		"text": "<p>In the Philippines, dances have been performed in various combinations of time and space and for various audiences and occasions&mdash;from the ethnic village to the Hispanic pueblo to the contemporary urban Westernized centers. Philippine geography and climate have allowed rituals and dances to be performed in the open air, on hills or by streams and seashores, as well as in houses. Ceremonies and dances mark social and religious functions, or the occasions for planting, fishing, or hunting. These may be performed for the well-being and strength of the group or community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ceremonies and social interaction often specify dance venues suited to the lifestyle of the group and/or the purpose of the ceremonies. The Sama Dilaut (Badjao) and the Sama/Samal dance at sea on outrigger boats for special occasions such as weddings. This practice was probably the origin of the pangalay ha pattong, a dance that requires balancing on bamboo poles. The lunsay of the Jama Mapun is danced on a special floor placed on top of the original house floor. In this truly communal event, dancers in a line coil or circle all day long, stopping only to eat, drink, or rest. The Maranao kalilang feast is launched in the open air with a procession of musicians, dancing women, and men on horseback before the datu and his lady. The kapanirong a ganding presentation follows, including the singkil dance and the playing of thekulintangandkagandang.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Time and place are more regulated for ritual dances where the community prays for its own welfare and everyone&rsquo;s health, especially the children&rsquo;s. The Subanon build abuklog, a temporary high ceremonial platform, on which the community dances together. In the center of this capacious pliant stage is a pestle that pounds into a mortar that resounds against jars dug into the ground. The communal event is also called buklog. It has sexual suggestions and mythical roots often mentioned in epics and tales. During the full moon, the Mamanwa stage a prayer ceremony with dancing, led by a shaman and his assistants. It is addressed to Magbabaya, the supreme being, and the spirits of the dead. A gong, drum, and guitar accompany the proceedings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mandaya also have the many-phased balilig ritual. For this ritual, the Mandaya usually prepare an outdoor altar calledantallmade of various kinds of wood tied together with rattan and decorated with plants, herbs, and lizard-like carvings calledpalla-os. Its center is painted with charcoal and red juice. To its north is a statue calledinutaw-utawrepresenting the spirits. A ceremonial bamboo pole has an open boiled egg at one end. Juice,siklat(chewing condiments), and boiled rice are offered together with a little symbolic carved boat. In one phase of the ritual, thebasalldrum is beaten inlisagstyle for the women to dance to and inkassalstyle for the men until the dancers are in a trance. In another phase called diwatahan, offerings of clothes, jewelry, lime containers, and a bolo are presented to theabyan(befriendedbusawor spirit) of thebalyan(shaman). In the sayaw part, the balyan, with her assistants, wearinglinagkaw(ceremonial skirt), withsallawtananordagmay(veil),kalasag(shield), andkuyab(fan), dances and goes into a trance under the sun. The beating of drums and the sacrificial pig please the spirits. The balyan and her abyan take up a dialogue called pagpanganito. At the end, the shaman stabs the pig to slow death, sucks its blood, bites into its flesh, and smears the sick with blood to protect them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ritual dancing may also happen under or inside the house. The Mandaya anito baylan, a ritual to heal the sick, is done beneath the house. A babaylan brandishes her shield and ax (to which noise-making shells have been attached) to the beating of agimbaldrum. But most ritual dances are done inside the house with the required altar and offerings. The Tagbanwa in Palawan perform the pagdiwata to thank Magindusa, the highest of deities, after a rice harvest and to ensure good fortune. With the ceremonial swing and offerings oftabad(rice wine), rice cakes, jewelry, cloth, and other things, the male or female babaylan officiates during the last three days of the full moon and after three or five preparatory lima ceremonies so that the spirits can see and participate. The percussive music of thegimbal,agong, smaller gongs, andbabandilaccompany the dancing, singing, smoking, chewing of betel nut, drinking, and other ritual acts of the babaylan and his/hertaga-iring(assistants). Dancing includes balancing on the head a bowl filled with rice, betel, pepper, and a lighted candle, or a kris or a long-stemmed plant. The family assists as a sodality while the rest of the chosen community attends. The ceremony can last for half a day or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kalinga gabbok is held in thanksgiving three or four months after a child&rsquo;s birth. A spirit medium leads the ceremony among relatives and friends with songs and sacrifices of chicken or pig. The say-am of the Isneg marks a headhunt, building a house, a harvest, or the end of mourning. It starts in the afternoon and may go on for five uninterrupted days. Friends and relatives participate. The house is decorated, food prepared, a shaman engaged. Themanganitoor shaman first communes with the spirits. The shaman beats a drum and gongs and soon enters a trance. A dog is sacrificed. The tungtung is the climax, where a mat is laid with a flat stone, a red rooster tied in a corner of a room, and wall decor hung from the ceiling. The men and women dance around the mat and pound with bamboo poles the boulder on which the shaman dances and chants. Other women shower grain on the dancers, while the rest sit in silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dances imitative of animals, plants, occupations, and courtship mark other aspects of the life cycle. The Agusanon Manobo go to the fields and imitate squirrels in the kinugsik-kugsik on large tree trunks. It is also a courtship dance with two males pursuing a female. The forest clearing is the setting for the planting cycle and courtship dances of the Blaan and the Matigsalug, and the propitiatory dance to thediwatafor a good harvest or fortune in the dugso among the Higaonon. The open field is the original locale for all dances that pertain to the rice cycle of planting, harvesting, winnowing, pounding, and the associated mimetic dances of the tinikling, itik-itik, and pabo. There are bird dances, such as the Manobo binanog, Mandaya kinabuwa, and Blaan aral kafi &mdash;all imitating hawks. Occupational dances of the Aeta, which are performed in the open, depict the gathering of potato and honey, or imitate martial activities such as duel and torture. The occupation dance ontuba(coco wine) gathering, mananguete, and the mock war dance, maglalatik, both associated with the coconut, entertain the folks outdoors. The Aeta talik paro imitates shrimps by the river stones. The Bicol gold-panning dance, pabirik, originated along rivers. The cleansing ritual of the Bagobo, pamalugu, that includes the transformation of young men intobagani(warriors aiming for the strength of eagles), is also done by streams. Related to the ethnic customs, the salibanda of Paete, Laguna, in which the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o is bathed, is also done along rivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue crabs imitated in sayaw sa lambay in Leyte, like the imitative fish dance tahing baila of Jolo, could only have originated by the seashore. The same can be said of the oasioas, which imitates fireflies and originally served to signal and guide the fisherfolk to come ashore. The sala ti alat of Camiling, Zambales, has the dancing fisherfolk coming in with baskets after a fishing expedition. The Samar dance an labasero has fisherfolk vending their catch and walking home along the shore. Mudfish is caught with a handheld fish trap and a gas lamp on the fisher&rsquo;s hat in the dance pandanggo sa bulig, commonly performed in Bulacan in relation to the fluvial festival, Pagoda sa Wawa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the dancing in the Cordillera is done by inhabitants of communal houses in the open on hills and mountains. The Igorot feast of the ca&ntilde;ao has relatives and neighbors dancing around a bonfire to drive away evil spirits that may prey on the sick. Before a headhunt, supposedly propitious when the firetrees are in bloom or when a wrong must be avenged, the Kalinga watch for the ominous bird,idaw. Amandadawak(priestess) invokes ancestral spirits. The successful hunters calledmingerfinally enact the headhunt, the purification after the mortal combat, and the victorious dance,takiling, where they are rewarded with crowns oflawi(a feathered headdress). The tengao in Benguet is a harvest festival with feasting, gong playing, and dancing on hills aflame with bonfires. The Bontok manerwap, which solicits rain, may last for days until the rain comes. The men go to the hills with baskets of chicks whose chirps supposedly address the spirits. The men dance around bonfires at night and in the daytime wash their gongs and sacrifice a pig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bagobo feast before planting rice used to involve sacrificing a slave in the woods. Returning to the house of the master of the feast, the people placed branches on an altar, ate, drank, and danced. The master and his followers asked the spirit, Drago,for a favor. A second &ldquo;feast of women&rdquo; gathered the people at the chief or master&rsquo;s house, where they drank sugarcane wine, made music, and danced until the next morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sulod or Panay Bukidnon perform the padapun once a year, starting in the afternoon and ending the next morning. A pig, chicken, rice cakes, bamboo twigs, areca nuts and fronds, banana-stalk plates, and an altar are all prepared earlier in the day inside the house by the main door. The babaylan dances to gongs and drums, addressing the ancestors, and goes into phases of a trance which the spectators observe with emotion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish colonialism and its state religion changed the lives of Filipinos forever. Roman Catholicism became the dominant religion with the church as the center of the people&rsquo;s social and spiritual life. The town plaza, surrounded by the church and town hall, witnessed the start and end of processions. The old ritual dances were adapted to honor Christian saints, the way the komedya and sarsuwela performances did. During the Spanish colonial period and to the present in rural Christian towns, dances have been performed as part of the celebration of events in the Catholic liturgical calendar or during the feasts of the town&rsquo;s patron saints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contemporary times, the community continues to participate in the processions, holding tapers or bearing theandas(platform) of the images being honored or dancing and singing as a form of prayer or vow. Processions on the feasts of patron saints are held in daytime or at night. The image of Maria Salome is fetched in the patio of Santa Isabel, Malolos, after the Easter Sundaysalubongand carried for a kilometer to hervisitaby dancing devotees. The celebration brought about the sayaw Santa Isabel. This custom of thedapitor fetching religious images from houses and carrying them to church highlights Tagalog religious feasts. In Pakil, Laguna, people honor the Virgin Mary whose image was supposedly found in the lake in 1640. Since then, it has been fetched from the church every year, and brought to the shore and back, while people sang and danced the turumba. In Makati, Rizal, the songs and dances of the panatang sayaw are performed on Jun 28 and 29 by 13 young girls in honor of San Pedro, San Pablo, and the Virgen de la Rosa in front of the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Virgin Mary is as central to the salubong on Easter Sunday as her risen son Jesus whom she meets underneath the four-posted structure calledgalileain or near the churchyard. Young women in pretty dresses and hats wave flags of all sizes and colors while dancing the bati under the galilea or a stage nearby. In the Visayas, the Santo Ni&ntilde;o is honored in the street dancing of the ati-atihan in Aklan, the sinulog in Cebu and Bohol, and the more recent dinagyang in Iloilo, all tied to church events. Ati-atihan dancers paint themselves black with soot and sport fantastic costumes. The sinulog, also called sin-ug, is danced in front of the church to assure good weather and ask for personal favors. In May, in Obando, Bulacan, women dance in a street procession that ends in the churchyard to celebrate the feast of San Pascual Baylon, Santa Clara, and the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salambao. The ritual is meant to obtain husbands for single women, offspring for childless couples, as well as a good harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays with dances, such as the komedya which features elaborately choreographed skirmishes between Christians and Moors called batalla, and the sarsuwela or musical plays on domestic themes which sometimes showed fashionable dances, were often held on outdoor stages erected at the church patio. At the turn of the century in Manila, both komedya and sarsuwela were also performed inteatrosor indoor theaters for paying audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Christmas, many towns enact the pastores de belen (shepherds of Bethlehem) in song and dance on the streets and before houses. Carolers are called cumbancheros in Leyte and daigon in Cebuano and Ilonggo-speaking regions. People dance and drink on tall, large water floats calledpagodaduring fluvial processions, as seen in the Pe&ntilde;afrancia in Naga, and that of the Santa Cruz in Wawa, Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In urbanized centers during the American colonial period, social dancing was seen primarily in formal balls in Malaca&ntilde;an or in grand hotels, mansions, clubs, and cabarets. Today, most social dancing is done in night clubs scattered all over Metro Manila and provincial cities. In urban centers, much of the dancing is indoors and done at night to the latest pop hits performed by live bands or played by disc jockeys. Dancing is also seen in variety shows on TV and in film musicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In major cities, dance theater performances are usually held in formal, closed venues, with proscenium-type stages, and are seen by paying audiences of matinee or evening shows during the regular annual seasons of dance companies. The same closed venues were used for bodabil or stage shows. In less urbanized places, the school gymnasia, the all-purpose halls (usually inhospitable to staged ballets), and recital halls of all shapes and sizes may be the site of dance performances. Dumaguete enjoys the well-appointed Luce Auditorium of Silliman University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metro Manila also has had several theaters. Popular venues for performances during the 19th century were the teatros, like the Teatro de Tondo, Teatro de Arroceros, and Teatro Zorrilla, which had proscenium stages with front curtains, a series of backdrops and flats, a paying audience seated on the orchestra, and several balconies. Similar to these teatros were the Manila Grand Opera House and the Manila Metropolitan Theater of the American colonial period. Immediately after World War II, Trudl Dubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s Manila Ballet Moderne (MBM) performed in the bombed out city of Manila at the surviving Rex Theater. On the other hand, her husband Herbert Zipper conducted the Manila Symphony Orchestra (MSO) in the ruins of Santa Cruz Church. He always conducted the MSO for all the music in MBM&rsquo;s presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The postwar years saw the rise of venues that showed mixed programs of films and bodabil, like Clover Theater and the new Manila Grand Opera House, as well as venues for academic programs and performances, like Far Eastern University (FEU) Auditorium, St. Paul College Fleur de Lis Auditorium, and University of the East Theater. From the 1960s, various auditoriums and theaters have been established for all kinds of performances or events, among them: the Philamlife Auditorium, Araneta Coliseum, New Frontier Theater, University of the Philippines (UP) Theater, UP Abelardo Hall, Rizal Theater, Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas aka Folk Arts Theater, Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo, Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino, and Tanghalang Huseng Batute of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), Meralco Theater, Conching Sunico Hall and Tanghalang Dalubdulaan of the reconstructed Manila Metropolitan Theater, and the Resorts World. In Manila, there have also been a variety of nonproscenium outdoor stages at Rizal Park, Fort Santiago, Puerta Real in Intramuros, and even in cemeteries like Paco Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancers have used regular proscenium or thrust stages innovatively. Alice Reyes broke the fourth wall by allowing dancers to come from the auditorium to go onstage, as in her modern pieces, Company, 1970, and Tommy, 1972. In 1971, Basilio also broke the barrier by using the rising and descending orchestra pit as the grave in The Resurrection of Lazarus. From 1990, Enrico Labayen enlarged the spatial dimension with the use of ropes for his multigravitational productions like Icarus in the early 1990salthough there were earlier occasions for dancers descending from the flies in El Gabriel&rsquo;s Olympiad, 1969; in Luminita Durnitrescu&rsquo;s The Sleeping Beauty, 1980; and Edna Vida&rsquo;s Peter Pan, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But dance performances were also staged in unconventional venues in the 1970s and 1980s. Ballet Philippines performed in the CCP&rsquo;s main gallery, an event directed by Johnny Manahan, while Dance Theatre Philippines (DTP) opened an art exhibition at the former Museum of Philippine Art with a dance presentation. Manila Metropolis Ballet used to take its portable stage to outdoor spaces such as Fort San Antonio Abad and Nayong Pilipino, as well as to the ballroom of Manila Peninsula Hotel. The Glorietta in Makati Commercial Center had an open and in-the-round stage that occasionally hosted dance concerts. Lawn performances at UP Diliman included two productions of Wisnusubroto Sunardi&rsquo;s Ramayana in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Studio space has often been used by dance majors and the UP Dance Company for the studio-choreo series at the UP College of Music (UPCMu).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Churches offer venues for dance chorography. In 1992, the UP Dance Company performed Basilio&rsquo;s Misa Filipina (Filipino Mass) at the altar of the Santuario de San Jose. The work was previously seen at the altars of the UP Protestant Chapel and the Manila Cathedral, performed by DTP in 1985. Other church performances include Shona Mactavish&rsquo;s The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and Julie Borromeo&rsquo;s dances for Benjamin Britten&rsquo;s Noah&rsquo;s Flood, both at the Episcopalian Cathedral in Quezon City. Mactavish also staged liturgical dances at the Presbyterian sanctuary in Silliman University. During the inauguration of the artists&rsquo; village of the Asian Institute of Liturgy and Music in 1992, the liturgical dance Dugso was staged outdoors. BP also contributed to Basilio&rsquo;s Doxology duet at the altar of Ellinwood Malate Church in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking off from both traditional and contemporary influences, dancing in the streets has proliferated nationwide from the 1990s to the present. New or old, these street events last the whole day. They coincide with religious or civilian fiestas, either to venerate respective patron saints, or to mark anniversaries and promote local produce. When favorable, they combine these motives as thematic strategies. These themes may also draw on and from folkloric or invented movements with which certain places may be identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naga, Camarines Sur, combined ecclesiastical and municipal aims in the Voyadores (Voyagers), a group street dance that is now a counterpart of the fluvial parade to celebrate the Virgin of Pe&ntilde;afrancia. Tacloban used to highlight their past with street-dancing in Pintados (Painted People). Camiguin Island&lsquo;s own festival centers on itslanzonesfruit produce. Contingents in these four events go around dancing on the streets and end in either a municipal plaza or a sports arena. Up north in Santiago, Isabela, the reason for festival dancing is communality in Pattaradday (Social Harmony). Baguio City holds the Panagbenga (Flower Festival) around the theme of flowers for which the city is famous. In Negros Occidental, the MassKara (Mass of Faces)was initiated to lift the people&rsquo;s spirit after the fall of the sugar industry. Davao&rsquo;s Kadayawan (Goodness) honors the city&rsquo;s varied cultural heritage in Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of these regional festivals now join the street dancing called Aliwan (Fun) in Pasay. Offering bountiful awards for the dancing, the floats, and the beauty queens, it is organized by the Manila Broadcasting Company and packaged as popular entertainment. Commercialism characterizes the event, with big sponsors, popular entertainers on floats, and politicians in the audience. The pompous event brought in the idea of competition. The audience is now divided into spectators and jurors. The former, composed of curious city audiences, may simply enjoy the parades while awaiting the rankings made by the latter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent or nonmainstream dancers hold events in their own dance studios, like the noted ones of Myra Beltran in Quezon City and of Agnes Locsin in Davao City. Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa&rsquo;s AlunAlun Dance Studio in Antipolo City and Handog Center in Marikina City likewise serve as a spaces for performances. Earlier prototypes were the old studios of Julie Borromeo in Mandaluyong, Sony Lopez Gonzalez and Joji Felix Velarde in Sampaloc, and Leonor Orosa-Goquingco in Quezon City. Those studios opened to lawns and gardens of their residences, as does the quadrangle lawn of the Shirley Halili-Cruz School of Ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, members of Contemporary Dance Network (CDN) entice audiences to their small or cramped studios, like those of Airdance and Chameleon Dance Theater in Quezon City, and of Lyceum of the Philippines University Dance Company and St. Benilde College Romancon Dance Company in Manila. CDN also holds site-specific performances in train stations, underpasses, streets, lobbies, facades and lawns. This mode recalls the street theater at the height of political protests in the 1970s and 1980s.Now and then, museums and galleries host dance events with visual artists called performance art. These spaces provide venues for cutting edge and on-the-spot ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UP Dance Company presents dance productions in the UPCMu dance studio or on its lawn quadrangles. One that moved from spot to spot was Al Bernard Garcia&rsquo;s full-length production, Sulog sa Kinabuhi (Flow of Life), which was inspired by the Subanon way of life. Also held on the UPCMu open grounds was Nasalapu-an (Birthing), by Angella Betina Carlos and Japhet Mari Cabling, based on the Panay Bukidnon&rsquo;s binanog (eagle/hawk dance) and rituals during birth. Accompanying the piece was the voice of a chanter from Panay and the original music of Toni Mu&ntilde;oz which combined bamboo flute and djembe drum.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

The men go to the hills with baskets of chicks whose chirps supposedly address the spirits. The men dance around bonfires at night and in the daytime wash their gongs and sacrifice a pig."

Returning to the house of the master of the feast, the people placed branches on an altar, ate, drank, and danced. The master and his followers asked the spirit, Drago,for a favor. A second &#x201C;feast of women&#x201D; gathered the people at the chief or master&#x2019;s house, where they drank sugarcane wine, made music, and danced until the next morning."

Roman Catholicism became the dominant religion with the church as the center of the people&#x2019;s social and spiritual life. The town plaza, surrounded by the church and town hall, witnessed the start and end of processions. The old ritual dances were adapted to honor Christian saints, the way the komedya and sarsuwela performances did. During the Spanish colonial period and to the present in rural Christian towns, dances have been performed as part of the celebration of events in the Catholic liturgical calendar or during the feasts of the town&#x2019;s patron saints."

Processions on the feasts of patron saints are held in daytime or at night. The image of Maria Salome is fetched in the patio of Santa Isabel, Malolos, after the Easter Sundaysalubongand carried for a kilometer to hervisitaby dancing devotees. The celebration brought about the sayaw Santa Isabel. This custom of thedapitor fetching religious images from houses and carrying them to church highlights Tagalog religious feasts. In Pakil, Laguna, people honor the Virgin Mary whose image was supposedly found in the lake in 1640. Since then, it has been fetched from the church every year, and brought to the shore and back, while people sang and danced the turumba. In Makati, Rizal, the songs and dances of the panatang sayaw are performed on Jun 28 and 29 by 13 young girls in honor of San Pedro, San Pablo, and the Virgen de la Rosa in front of the church."

Young women in pretty dresses and hats wave flags of all sizes and colors while dancing the bati under the galilea or a stage nearby. In the Visayas, the Santo Ni&#xF1;o is honored in the street dancing of the ati-atihan in Aklan, the sinulog in Cebu and Bohol, and the more recent dinagyang in Iloilo, all tied to church events. Ati-atihan dancers paint themselves black with soot and sport fantastic costumes. The sinulog, also called sin-ug, is danced in front of the church to assure good weather and ask for personal favors. In May, in Obando, Bulacan, women dance in a street procession that ends in the churchyard to celebrate the feast of San Pascual Baylon, Santa Clara, and the Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de Salambao. The ritual is meant to obtain husbands for single women, offspring for childless couples, as well as a good harvest."

Today, most social dancing is done in night clubs scattered all over Metro Manila and provincial cities. In urban centers, much of the dancing is indoors and done at night to the latest pop hits performed by live bands or played by disc jockeys. Dancing is also seen in variety shows on TV and in film musicals."

The same closed venues were used for bodabil or stage shows. In less urbanized places, the school gymnasia, the all-purpose halls (usually inhospitable to staged ballets), and recital halls of all shapes and sizes may be the site of dance performances. Dumaguete enjoys the well-appointed Luce Auditorium of Silliman University."

Popular venues for performances during the 19th century were the teatros, like the Teatro de Tondo, Teatro de Arroceros, and Teatro Zorrilla, which had proscenium stages with front curtains, a series of backdrops and flats, a paying audience seated on the orchestra, and several balconies. Similar to these teatros were the Manila Grand Opera House and the Manila Metropolitan Theater of the American colonial period. Immediately after World War II, Trudl Dubsky-Zipper&#x2019;s Manila Ballet Moderne (MBM) performed in the bombed out city of Manila at the surviving Rex Theater. On the other hand, her husband Herbert Zipper conducted the Manila Symphony Orchestra (MSO) in the ruins of Santa Cruz Church.

From the 1960s, various auditoriums and theaters have been established for all kinds of performances or events, among them: the Philamlife Auditorium, Araneta Coliseum, New Frontier Theater, University of the Philippines (UP) Theater, UP Abelardo Hall, Rizal Theater, Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas aka Folk Arts Theater, Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo, Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino, and Tanghalang Huseng Batute of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), Meralco Theater, Conching Sunico Hall and Tanghalang Dalubdulaan of the reconstructed Manila Metropolitan Theater, and the Resorts World.

				"value": "Dancers have used regular proscenium or thrust stages innovatively. Alice Reyes broke the fourth wall by allowing dancers to come from the auditorium to go onstage, as in her modern pieces, Company, 1970, and Tommy, 1972. In 1971, Basilio also broke the barrier by using the rising and descending orchestra pit as the grave in The Resurrection of Lazarus. From 1990, Enrico Labayen enlarged the spatial dimension with the use of ropes for his multigravitational productions like Icarus in the early 1990salthough there were earlier occasions for dancers descending from the flies in El Gabriel&#x2019;s Olympiad, 1969; in Luminita Durnitrescu&#x2019;s The Sleeping Beauty, 1980; and Edna Vida&#x2019;s Peter Pan, 1983."

Ballet Philippines performed in the CCP&#x2019;s main gallery, an event directed by Johnny Manahan, while Dance Theatre Philippines (DTP) opened an art exhibition at the former Museum of Philippine Art with a dance presentation. Manila Metropolis Ballet used to take its portable stage to outdoor spaces such as Fort San Antonio Abad and Nayong Pilipino, as well as to the ballroom of Manila Peninsula Hotel. The Glorietta in Makati Commercial Center had an open and in-the-round stage that occasionally hosted dance concerts. Lawn performances at UP Diliman included two productions of Wisnusubroto Sunardi&#x2019;s Ramayana in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The work was previously seen at the altars of the UP Protestant Chapel and the Manila Cathedral, performed by DTP in 1985. Other church performances include Shona Mactavish&#x2019;s The Lord&#x2019;s Prayer and Julie Borromeo&#x2019;s dances for Benjamin Britten&#x2019;s Noah&#x2019;s Flood, both at the Episcopalian Cathedral in Quezon City. Mactavish also staged liturgical dances at the Presbyterian sanctuary in Silliman University. During the inauguration of the artists&#x2019; village of the Asian Institute of Liturgy and Music in 1992, the liturgical dance Dugso was staged outdoors.

New or old, these street events last the whole day. They coincide with religious or civilian fiestas, either to venerate respective patron saints, or to mark anniversaries and promote local produce. When favorable, they combine these motives as thematic strategies. These themes may also draw on and from folkloric or invented movements with which certain places may be identified."

Tacloban used to highlight their past with street-dancing in Pintados (Painted People). Camiguin Island&#x2018;s own festival centers on itslanzonesfruit produce. Contingents in these four events go around dancing on the streets and end in either a municipal plaza or a sports arena. Up north in Santiago, Isabela, the reason for festival dancing is communality in Pattaradday (Social Harmony). Baguio City holds the Panagbenga (Flower Festival) around the theme of flowers for which the city is famous. In Negros Occidental, the MassKara (Mass of Faces)was initiated to lift the people&#x2019;s spirit after the fall of the sugar industry.

Offering bountiful awards for the dancing, the floats, and the beauty queens, it is organized by the Manila Broadcasting Company and packaged as popular entertainment. Commercialism characterizes the event, with big sponsors, popular entertainers on floats, and politicians in the audience. The pompous event brought in the idea of competition. The audience is now divided into spectators and jurors. The former, composed of curious city audiences, may simply enjoy the parades while awaiting the rankings made by the latter."

Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa&#x2019;s AlunAlun Dance Studio in Antipolo City and Handog Center in Marikina City likewise serve as a spaces for performances. Earlier prototypes were the old studios of Julie Borromeo in Mandaluyong, Sony Lopez Gonzalez and Joji Felix Velarde in Sampaloc, and Leonor Orosa-Goquingco in Quezon City. Those studios opened to lawns and gardens of their residences, as does the quadrangle lawn of the Shirley Halili-Cruz School of Ballet."

CDN also holds site-specific performances in train stations, underpasses, streets, lobbies, facades and lawns. This mode recalls the street theater at the height of political protests in the 1970s and 1980s.Now and then, museums and galleries host dance events with visual artists called performance art.

Also held on the UPCMu open grounds was Nasalapu-an (Birthing), by Angella Betina Carlos and Japhet Mari Cabling, based on the Panay Bukidnon&#x2019;s binanog (eagle/hawk dance) and rituals during birth.

In choreography, Locsin took the Prince Takamado Award in Tokyo in 1993, while Douglas Nierras won the grand prix at the Saitama International Creative Dance Competition in Yono City in 1999. For years, choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2581\"><strong>Hazel Sabas</strong></a> gained recognition at home and abroad with her fellowships, choreographic commissions, and directorial awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Videodanse-France conferred awards on two CCP dance documentaries, both with direction by Ramon Obusan and script by Basilio Esteban Villaruz.

This challenged dancers and choreographers nationwide; some went on to win international prizes. The competition was sponsored by the CCP, the NCCA, and the Department of Education. In 2013 the NCCA withdrew support, but the CCP continued it in 2014. Sometime after NAMCYA&rsquo;s ballet competition, the NCCA&rsquo;s national dance committee started its own in folk, ballroom, contemporary dance, and neo-classic ballet. In 2008, the Contemporary Dance Network began the WiFi Body Festival that gives awards to young choreographers. This is worked out with the CCP and Japan Foundation, the latter sending winners to Japan to join competitions or festivals. Events like these discover young dancer artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an independent jury, the Philippine Legitimate Stage Artists Association (Philstage) gives annual awards called Gawad Buhayto professional productions and artists in theater and dance with categories in playwriting, choreography, directing, lighting, and production design. The board of directors of Philstage also gives life-achievement awards called Natatanging Gawad Buhay <strong>.</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the popular front, there used to be competitions in <strong>break dancing</strong>; now the attention has shifted to <strong>hip-hopdancing</strong>. These are held in local and international sites, in categories like Junior, Varsity, Adult, and Megacrew. Hip Hop International&rsquo;s World Hip Hop Dance Championship is held in various places abroad. Among the Filipino groups which have won top places are the Philippine All Stars, The Crew, Romancon, UPeepz, and the A-Team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Awards are not the only honors given to individuals and groups which have excelled in dance. Grants are also given by government and nongovernmental cultural institutions to aid dancers and dance companies in the development and popularization of their craft. These may take the form of study grants, venue grants, and travel grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1950s, outstanding dancers have received scholarships for study abroad. Dance awardees were Felicitas Layag-Radaic, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2561\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2562\"><strong>Lulu Puertollano</strong></a></strong></a>, and Alice Reyes. Among the early scholars are Benjamin Villanueva Reyes, who studied in New York supported by the Manila Music Lovers&rsquo; Society and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> de Filipinas</strong></a>; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2467\"><strong>Joji Felix-Velarde</strong></a>, who was brought by Ricardo Cassell and Alicia Markova to train in England and New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a time, only the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a> (MPFP) supported musicians and dancers who wished to study abroad. Now, foreign governments and their funding agencies award study and observation grants to many dance artists. Among these agencies are the British Council, Goethe Institute, German International Theater Institute, the United States Information Service, Philippine-Soviet Friendship Society of the former USSR, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization&rsquo;s Regional Center for Archaeology and Fine Arts, and the Asian Cultural Council in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the MPFP, the CCP has assisted local groups which will represent the Philippines in foreign festivals through its special grants program. After 1986, the CCP also expanded its seasonal residencies for dance companies, accommodating <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a> and the ROFG. To &ldquo;develop artistic excellence&rdquo; and &ldquo;promote democratization,&rdquo; the CCP sponsored a dance grant program by opening CCP venues to local dance groups. Among the grantees from 1988 to 1991 were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2514\"><strong>Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</strong></a>, the Dureza Ballet School, Quezon City Ballet of the Halili-Cruz School of Dance, St. Anne&rsquo;s Dance and Music Studio, Dance Theatre Philippines, Philippine Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe, Ben-Lor Ballet Academy, La Salle Dance Troupe, Sandiwang Kayumanggi Folk Dance Troupe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2579\"><strong>Odon Sabarre</strong></a> and the People&rsquo;s Center School of Dance, Hwa Yi Ethnic Dance Center, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2440\"><strong>Dance Concert Company</strong></a>, Theatrical Ensemble and Artistic Movement, Chameleon Dance Company, Araullo University Dance Troupe, and Sandiwang Kayumanggi Folk Dance Troupe. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

It is also sometimes called &ldquo;movement notation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long before the term &ldquo;choreography&rdquo; began to be used in the late 18th century, native Filipinos had composed their dances through the ages. Tribes invented and taught dances communally. Shamans designed and directed rituals where they played special roles. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a> dances may appear improvised, seemingly without beginning, middle, or end; but they actually require a set of movements and even definite costumes, sets, and props. Spontaneity is ruled by both the purpose and objects of worship. The Philippines has numerous ritual dances, such as the Tinguian <strong>gabbok</strong> to assure a child&rsquo;s health, the Tagbanwa <strong>pagdiwata</strong> to plead for a good harvest, and the Mandaya <strong>anito baylan</strong> to please environmental gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the ethnic communities, mimetic and occupational dances tend to be sketches that follow the form and style of the subjects or the chronological order of the imitated tasks. The Tausug <strong>langka baluang</strong> imitates a monkey, while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a><strong>paypayto</strong> represents birds disturbed from their perch by hunters. The Blaan closely imitate the movements associated with each stage of rice planting, in the choosing and clearing of a field, the digging of the ground with poles, the sowing of the seeds, and finally, the harvesting of the rice to the rhythm of the<em>haglong</em>(lute) and gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European dances were brought over by soldiers, traders, and priests. Although the <strong>pandanggo</strong> may still follow the triple time and occasional figures and structure of the Spanish original, it has been adapted to indigenous culture and conditions. Thus, the props used may be lighted lamp or candle as in <strong>pandanggo sa ilaw</strong>,or a native hat as in the <strong>pandanggo sa sambalilo</strong>. The street <strong>pandanggo</strong> of Obando, Bulacan, has been performed for a religious feast that may originally have been animistic. Other Tagalog dances are the <strong>caracol</strong> of Cavite and the <strong>turumba</strong> of Laguna. In Cebu, the <strong>sinulog</strong> is performed as a dance-prayer to the Santo Ni&ntilde;o.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>European dances remained &ldquo;purer&rdquo; or &ldquo;closer to the European original&rdquo; among the Hispanized elite. These include the <strong>jota</strong>, <strong>balse, escotis</strong>, <strong>mazurka</strong>, <strong>polka</strong>, and <strong>rigodon</strong>, which all follow set patterns and procedures. The accompaniment is also predetermined so that even regional variations, such as the <strong>polkabal</strong> and <strong>mazurka</strong><strong>val</strong>, are regulated by their music and accepted figures. There are, however, some textural variations specific to Ilocano, Tagalog, or Visayan steps and hand gestures, such as the hand gestures of the <strong>kumintang</strong> among the Tagalog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American social dances changed Philippine fashions. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>Bodabil</strong></a></strong> adapted them for stage shows, giving them a semblance of choreographic order. From the <strong>charleston</strong> to the <strong>rock and roll</strong> to the <strong>chacha</strong> to the <strong>twist</strong> and the <strong>bossa nova</strong>, the dances were first popularized by movies and music records. American ethnic dances, such as the <strong>clog</strong>, <strong>tap</strong>, and <strong>hula</strong>, as well as the aesthetic &ldquo;Orientalism&rdquo; of Ruth St. Denis who visited the Philippines in 1926, left their mark on Philippine popular culture. Later, discotheques and contemporary bars encouraged highly improvisational dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a></strong>, on the other hand, features techniques set over the centuries in Europe and a choreography formulated by Marius Petipa in the 19th century in Russia. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\"><strong>Realism</strong></a>, formerly espoused by Jean Georges Noverre in the 18th century, was revived by Michael Fokine at the beginning of the 20th century, especially through the Serge Diaghilev Ballets Russes. In the 20th century, George Balanchine, whose abstract ballets have influenced world dance, personified neoclassicism. In the Philippines, Balanchine&rsquo;s mark is most clearly seen in Remedios de Oteyza&rsquo;s works, which are set to European concert and symphonic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abstract form was given Philippine touches by later choreographers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\"><strong>Julie Borromeo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/206\"><strong>Zagalas de Manila</strong></a></em></strong> (Young Maidens of Manila), Felicitas Layag-Radaic and Julie Borromeo&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/168\"><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></a></em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2455\"><strong>Eddie Elejar</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Katakata sin Rajah Indarapatra</em></strong> (The Story of Rajah Indarapatra), Basilio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/201\"><strong>Tropical Tapestry</strong></a></em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2537\"><strong>Brando Miranda</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lawang Paoay</em></strong> (Paoay Lake), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2506\"><strong>Enrico Labayen</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Songs</em></strong> are prominent examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The freer style of modern dance was, at the start, even more form-oriented. Philippine choreographers were influenced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\"><strong>Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</strong></a> from the 1930s to the 1960s: Doris Humphrey, Louis Horst&mdash;who worked closely with Martha Graham, and Hanya Holm&mdash;who taught <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\"><strong>Alice Reyes</strong></a>.

Alice Reyes&rsquo;s one-act <strong><em>Itim Asu</em></strong> (Onyx Wolf) on the assassination of Gov-Gen Bustamante and the revenge of his wife was based on an apocryphal narrative attributed to Fr Jose Burgos. Later, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a> followed this with the full-evening <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/151\"><strong>Itim Asu: 1719-2009</strong></a></em></strong> (Onyx Wolf: 1719-2009), based on Virginia Moreno&rsquo;s play <strong><em>The Onyx Wolf</em></strong> <em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dance choreographers, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a> and Ramon Obusan, stylized ethnic and folk dances for theatrical purposes. They modified the element of time by speeding up, retarding, or heightening dynamics. They reworked the idea of space by enlarging, elaborating, and using floor and space patterns. They explored new themes so the folk dances became larger than the original yet retained their flavor. However, staged folk dances restrict themselves to conventional program length to suit the demands of a marketed theater attendance, which limit choreographic practice to some extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choreographers violated the conventions of the proscenium stage by bringing the action out of the auditorium, thus changing the nature of movements and use of space. Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <strong><em>Company</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tommy</em></strong> brought performers into the audience area, and in the case of the first work, stripped the stage of its usual curtains and legs. Basilio&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Resurrection of Lazarus</em></strong> used the rising and falling orchestra pit for the climax, while his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/169\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a> Filipina</strong></a></em></strong> (Filipino Mass) used the church aisle for the procession. Borromeo&rsquo;s version of Benjamin Britten&rsquo;s <strong><em>Noah&rsquo;s Flood</em></strong> had &ldquo;animals&rdquo; parading down a cathedral aisle. For <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1003\"><strong>Siklo</strong></a></em></strong> (Cycle), Fabella, aided by Salvador Bernal, inflated and deflated a symbolic cosmic balloon and drenched the upstage with a waterfall. Labayen stretched the dimensions of performance with his multigravitational presentations. Obusan brought to his folkloric presentations a semblance of ritual time and space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary choreography increasingly addresses social issues as it also inquires into creative processes. Among Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s significant works is <strong><em>Suwana</em></strong> for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a>. She unravels the external and internal aspects of society with incisiveness. At the UP Diliman, dance majors take deconstruction strategies on dance traditions and situate these in Filipino lives. They composed adapted versions of ballet classics, like <strong><em>Mariang Sinderela,ang Bagong <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a></em></strong> (Maria Cinderella, the New Heroine) from <strong><em>Cinderella</em></strong>, <strong><em>Maria Clara&rsquo;s Colonial Dream</em></strong> from <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><strong>The Nutcracker</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>Higanti</em></strong> (Vengeance) from <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>Sa Pula, Sa Itim</em></strong> (In White, In Black) from <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/179\"><strong>Pedro Kusinero</strong></a></em></strong> (Peter the Cook) from <strong><em>Petrouchka</em></strong>, <strong><em>Sylvia <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></em></strong> (Sylvia Joy) from <strong><em>La Sylphide</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Alicia sa Bundok Dilim</em></strong> (Alice in the Mountain of Darkness) from <strong><em>Alice in Wonderland</em></strong> <em>.</em>For example, <strong><em>Sinderela</em></strong> and <strong><em>Maria Clara</em></strong> dwell on entertainment exported to Japan, <strong><em>Higanti </em></strong> onhacendero<em>-sacada</em>(sugarcane plantation worker) relations, <strong><em>Pedro Kusinero</em></strong> on the US military base in Subic, and <strong><em>Sylvia Ligaya</em></strong> on virtual Internet sex vis-&agrave;-vis reality. All of these deconstructions use the vocabulary of contemporary dance. In 2014, Michael Barry Que and Gebbvelle Ray Selga mounted <strong><em>Pavilion IV</em></strong>, a choreographic work placing the audience in the subject-position of both voyeur and patient as a way of critiquing society. The piece was based on the immersion trip of choreographers at the National Center for Mental Health. For some of these productions, composers created new music and dramaturgs provided new perspectives. These joint strategies sustain tradition and innovation in both music and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1960s, dance groups have performed in museums and outdoors, even on special stages set up in memorial parks and resorts. Dance Theatre Philippines adapted its performances to Rizal Park, such as Borromeo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Zagalas de Manila</em></strong> (Young Maidens of Manila), Layag-Radaic&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/194\"><strong>Tanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Elopement), Fabella&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/162\"><strong>Limang Dipa</strong></a></em></strong> (Five Armstretches), and Basilio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mosque Baroque</em></strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2623\"><strong>Wisnusubroto Sunardi</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong> was staged outdoors by the lagoon in UP Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choreographers have also adapted works for the restricted space of TV by orienting movements to the camera&rsquo;s eye, and on how figures disappear as they move toward and away from viewer or from one side of the camera to the other, or how they can form patterns for a camera riding on top of a crane. Among these choreographers are Julie Borromeo, Amelia Apolinario, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2421\"><strong>Lito Calzado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2545\"><strong>Douglas Nierras</strong></a>, and younger choreographers of popular and commercial dancing. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Spontaneity is ruled by both the purpose and objects of worship. The Philippines has numerous ritual dances, such as the Tinguian <strong>gabbok</strong> to assure a child&#x2019;s health, the Tagbanwa <strong>pagdiwata</strong> to plead for a good harvest, and the Mandaya <strong>anito baylan</strong> to please environmental gods."

She unravels the external and internal aspects of society with incisiveness. At the UP Diliman, dance majors take deconstruction strategies on dance traditions and situate these in Filipino lives.

All of these deconstructions use the vocabulary of contemporary dance. In 2014, Michael Barry Que and Gebbvelle Ray Selga mounted <strong><em>Pavilion IV</em></strong>, a choreographic work placing the audience in the subject-position of both voyeur and patient as a way of critiquing society. The piece was based on the immersion trip of choreographers at the National Center for Mental Health.

The dancers may train in a specific technique, school, or style with teachers, and may know more than one kind of dance; or they may continue training as they perform. Dancers rehearse and perform the company repertoire, which may consist of both new and classic dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A primary ballet company is directly linked to its director&rsquo;s school. Examples are Pamana <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a>, the Hariraya Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, Dance Theatre Philippines (DTP), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2440\"><strong>Dance Concert Company</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2528\"><strong>Manila Metropolis Ballet</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\"><strong>Julie Borromeo</strong></a> Dance Company, and Quezon City Ballet. Among these, DTP stood out, as its three founders ran separate schools and the dancers received regular allowances. Some companies, including DTP, Pamana, and Hariraya have had boards of trustees which raised funds. Manila Metropolis was supported by its subsidiary, Friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1987, a number of small companies and schools formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a> (PBT), the new resident company of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), complete with trustees, an artistic council, executive board, and office staff. PBT was formed by the Hariraya Dance Company, Dance Theatre Philippines (DTP), Dance Concert Company, Manila Metropolis Ballet, the Ben Lor Academy, and Academie of the Performing Arts. Up to the 2010s, PBT continues to be a seasonal company of the CCP and rehearses at the Meralco Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are institution-based companies. DTP, for example, performed regularly for the National Parks Development Committee, which subsidized it for 13 years to appear once or twice a month at the Rizal Park. The company ran subscribed seasons at the Meralco Theater for two years. It was resident company at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music, which supported its dancers and subsidized its university performers for seven years. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\"><strong>Alice Reyes</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>Modern Dance</strong></a> Company started as a private organization which later became a resident company of the CCP, first named CCP Dance Workshop and Company in 1970, then renamed CCP Dance Company in 1974, and finally <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> (BP) in 1980. BP&rsquo;s repertoire of both classical ballet and modern dance and its annual subscribed seasons make the company unique in Asia. As a resident company, it is similar to European companies under an intendant, although more independent with its own board of trustees and other support arms. It also serves other resident drama and music groups and the outreach programs of the CCP. The old Metropolitan Dance Theater (MDT) was based at the Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a>. A jazz and modern dance group, MDT enjoyed relative independence and maintained its own school. Other institution-based groups were the dance companies attached to the Central Post Office, Department of Tourism, and other government offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s, folk dance companies were usually based in schools. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine Dance Company was and is attached to both the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a> Folk Arts Center and the CCP. The Baranggay Philippine Dance Company was formerly based at the Philippine Normal College (PNC). The Darangan Cultural Troupe is based at Mindanao State University (MSU) in Marawi, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2604\"><strong>Tambuli Cultural Troupe</strong></a> at the MSU in Tawi-Tawi. Other major folk dance troupes are the UP Filipiniana Dance Troupe and University of the East (UE) Dance Troupe and the Far Eastern University (FEU) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Group. Recent school-based groups are the UP Dance Company, St. Benilde Romancon Dance Company, and the Lyceum of the Philippines University Dance Company.

The making of a dance includes conceptualization and manipulation of dance elements, including attendant designs. Dance is manifested in its performance, which includes audiences, time, and place. The meaning of a dance is its significance to various levels of perception or kinds of reception, and in the development of dance and culture in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Spanish period, European travellers or Spanish priests concentrated not on dance criticism, but on dance description. In 1521, Antonio Pigafetta described a dance worship of the sun, which he said was led by old women who chanted, drank, and circled around a sacrificial pig while carrying bamboo trumpets and spears (Blair and Robertson XXXIII 1973,169). In 1663, Fr Francisco Colin described the movements of what seems to be a war dance (Ibid., XL 1973, 37-48). In 1846, Mallat described the courtship dance called <strong>kumintang</strong> (Ibid., XLV, 276).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance description is also seen in the 1930s, this time focusing on the so-called modern dance which burst through the boundaries of accepted dance criteria and aesthetic principles. Philippine critics did not confine themselves to description, but continued on to make judgment. In the years before World War II, A. V. H. Hartendorp wrote about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\"><strong>Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</strong></a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a></strong></a> Moderne in his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></em></strong>. His descriptions and evaluations of all three annual seasons, which were cut short by the war, give us a fair idea of Dubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, more and more dance reviews started to appear in newspapers. The most significant dance critics were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5256\"><strong>Morli Dharam</strong></a> (later Anthony Morli) for the <strong><em>Manila Times</em></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5544\"><strong>Rosalinda L. Orosa</strong></a> for the <strong><em>Manila Chronicle</em></strong>. Like Hartendorp, they were general practitioners who covered musical, dramatic, and choreographic events. Along with Rodrigo Perez III, Edith Hernandez, Exequiel Molina, and Vilma R. Santiago-Felipe, they monitored the dance in those decades. Their pieces consisted mainly of brief descriptions as most critical writing then was given little space amid news and &ldquo;high society&rdquo; reportage. Descriptions were mainly adjectival, not always justifying why a dance was well performed or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, dance personalities such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta M. Kane and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\"><strong>Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</strong></a> started writing regular feature articles. Orosa-Goquingco combined teaching, choreographing, and writing about music, drama, and dance. Both she and Kane evaluated productions in the general style, focusing on performance and personality. Orosa-Goquingco continued to write criticism up to the 1980s. Her critical pieces are published in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/704\"><strong>Curtain Call: Selected Reviews 1957-2000</strong></a>,</em></strong> published in 2001. In the 1970s, other writers emerged, such as Isabel Taylor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Acosta, and Elizabeth Reyes who provided the readers with more analysis and context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBasilio Esteban S. Villaruz, who, like Orosa-Goquingco, has both a literary and choreographic background, also contributed much to dance criticism. In the 1960s, he wrote regular reviews for the <strong><em>Weekly Nation</em></strong>, covering musical, dramatic, choreographic, visual, and even anthropological events for two years. After a long hiatus, he resumed critical writing in the 1970s for <strong><em>BFB Newsletter</em></strong>, later renamed <strong><em>Sayaw Silangan</em></strong>, which he edited and produced for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2404\"><strong>Ballet Federation of the Philippines</strong></a>. Villaruz&rsquo;s writings closely observed both choreography and dancing, influenced by critics John Martin and Edwin Denby who were very insightful as they were themselves dancers. He likewise encouraged other dancers to write, among them Felicitas Layag-Radaic, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2542\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Morgan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a>, Lourdes Dalupan, and Teresa Bautista who followed suit and wrote with critical discernment and perspective. Later Villaruz went on to write for <strong><em>Manila Standard</em></strong> and for a new edition of <strong><em>Manila Times</em></strong>.He sat in a criticism class of Jack Anderson at the New School of Social Research in New York and joined conferences for critics at the American Dance Festival and in Hong Kong for the Goethe Institute. Later, Marcia Siegel, who visited Manila, was a distinct influence on him as writer and teacher. For a broader framework, he also drew from theater and cultural critics Rustom Barucha, Homi Bhabha, and the disciplines of sociology and anthropology. Villaruz published several anthologies of his dance criticism in <strong><em>Treading Through: 45 Years of Philippine Dance</em></strong>, 2006,and the three-volume <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/23\"><strong>Walking Through Philippine Theater</strong></a></em></strong>, 2012, which won the 32nd National Book Award&rsquo;s Alfonso T. OngpinPrizefor Best Book on Art in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Few critics dwell on the social implications of a piece, putting it in the context of preceding works, personal influences, and social forces. This limitation is caused by newspapers that do not allow lengthy discussion and critics who are incapable of ethnological and sociological analysis. But Villaruz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1302\"><strong>Thelma</strong></a> Sioson San Juan were fortunate to have been given much leeway and space by the now defunct <strong><em>Manila Chronicle</em></strong>. In the 1980s, new writers joined established critics like Rosalinda Orosa, Leonor Orosa-Goquingco, and Vilma Santiago Felipe. Among them was Pablo Tariman who edited the CCP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Arts Monthly</em></strong> and wrote for the <strong><em>Observer</em></strong> and later for the <strong><em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em></strong> <em>.</em>He was generally supportive if not adulatory. Marge Enriquez, who started in <strong><em>Business World</em></strong> but eventuallytransferred to the <strong><em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em></strong>, has been meticulous and could sometimes be either generous or dismissive. For a time, Edna Vida wrote for both the <strong><em>Manila Times</em></strong> and <strong><em>Philippine Star.</em></strong> In the 1990s, much dance criticism did not go beyond what it was in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2000s, Layag-Radaic only wrote intermittently and selectively. Young writers who write criticism backed by academic studies and dance experience include Rina Angela Corpus, whose essays are compiled in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/14\"><strong>Defiant Daughters Dancing: Three Independent Women Dance</strong></a></em></strong>, 2007, Ruth Jordana Pison, Elka Requinta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>al Primero, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2491\"><strong>Joelle Jacinto</strong></a>. After writing for <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></em></strong>, Jacinto published the quarterly <strong><em>Runthru</em></strong> which became an online magazine, and contributed to the World Dance Alliance&rsquo;s <strong><em>Asia Pacific Channels</em></strong>. Beyond just seeing performances and conscientious probing, these writers broadly contextualize their respective points of view. Their crop is well-versed in worldwide events and issues, and cover both mainstream and marginal groups. They write from current dance theories that are linked to cultural studies. Beyond just seeing choreography and performance, these writers consider the modes of production of the works, declaring sometimes the subject-position they occupy as critics. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Philippine critics did not confine themselves to description, but continued on to make judgment. In the years before World War II, A. V. H. Hartendorp wrote about <a href=\"/6/51/2453\"><strong>Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</strong></a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila </strong></a><strong><a href=\"/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a></strong> Moderne in his <strong><em><a href=\"/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></em></strong>.

Orosa</strong></a> for the <strong><em>Manila Chronicle</em></strong>. Like Hartendorp, they were general practitioners who covered musical, dramatic, and choreographic events. Along with Rodrigo Perez III, Edith Hernandez, Exequiel Molina, and Vilma R. Santiago-Felipe, they monitored the dance in those decades. Their pieces consisted mainly of brief descriptions as most critical writing then was given little space amid news and &#x201C;high society&#x201D; reportage. Descriptions were mainly adjectival, not always justifying why a dance was well performed or not."

Orosa-Goquingco combined teaching, choreographing, and writing about music, drama, and dance. Both she and Kane evaluated productions in the general style, focusing on performance and personality.

In the 1960s, he wrote regular reviews for the <strong><em>Weekly Nation</em></strong>, covering musical, dramatic, choreographic, visual, and even anthropological events for two years. After a long hiatus, he resumed critical writing in the 1970s for <strong><em>BFB Newsletter</em></strong>, later renamed <strong><em>Sayaw Silangan</em></strong>, which he edited and produced for the <a href=\"/6/51/2404\"><strong>Ballet Federation of the Philippines</strong></a>. Villaruz&#x2019;s writings closely observed both choreography and dancing, influenced by critics John Martin and Edwin Denby who were very insightful as they were themselves dancers. He likewise encouraged other dancers to write, among them Felicitas Layag-Radaic, <a href=\"/6/51/2542\"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=\"/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Morgan</strong>, <a href=\"/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a>, Lourdes Dalupan, and Teresa Bautista who followed suit and wrote with critical discernment and perspective. Later Villaruz went on to write for <strong><em>Manila Standard</em></strong> and for a new edition of <strong><em>Manila Times</em></strong>.He sat in a criticism class of Jack Anderson at the New School of Social Research in New York and joined conferences for critics at the American Dance Festival and in Hong Kong for the Goethe Institute. Later, Marcia Siegel, who visited Manila, was a distinct influence on him as writer and teacher. For a broader framework, he also drew from theater and cultural critics Rustom Barucha, Homi Bhabha, and the disciplines of sociology and anthropology. Villaruz published several anthologies of his dance criticism in <strong><em>Treading Through: 45 Years of Philippine Dance</em></strong>, 2006,and the three-volume <strong><em><a href=\"/6/50/23\"><strong>Walking Through Philippine Theater</strong></a></em></strong>, 2012, which won the 32nd National Book Award&#x2019;s Alfonso T.

This limitation is caused by newspapers that do not allow lengthy discussion and critics who are incapable of ethnological and sociological analysis. But Villaruz and <a href=\"/4/24/1302\"><strong>Thelma</strong></a> Sioson San Juan were fortunate to have been given much leeway and space by the now defunct <strong><em>Manila Chronicle</em></strong>. In the 1980s, new writers joined established critics like Rosalinda Orosa, Leonor Orosa-Goquingco, and Vilma Santiago Felipe. Among them was Pablo Tariman who edited the CCP&#x2019;s <strong><em>Arts Monthly</em></strong> and wrote for the <strong><em>Observer</em></strong> and later for the <strong><em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em></strong> <em>.</em>He was generally supportive if not adulatory. Marge Enriquez, who started in <strong><em>Business World</em></strong> but eventuallytransferred to the <strong><em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em></strong>, has been meticulous and could sometimes be either generous or dismissive. For a time, Edna Vida wrote for both the <strong><em>Manila Times</em></strong> and <strong><em>Philippine Star.</em></strong> In the 1990s, much dance criticism did not go beyond what it was in the 1960s and 1970s."

Beyond just seeing performances and conscientious probing, these writers broadly contextualize their respective points of view. Their crop is well-versed in worldwide events and issues, and cover both mainstream and marginal groups. They write from current dance theories that are linked to cultural studies. Beyond just seeing choreography and performance, these writers consider the modes of production of the works, declaring sometimes the subject-position they occupy as critics. <span class></span> "

The sets are painted or constructed. Properties or portable implements and costumes identify a character, occasion or action. Lighting may be natural or controlled with torches, candles, gas or electric lamps, spotlights, projections, and other equipment moved or modulated for effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> instruments like the Tagakaolo<em>udol</em>(plank drum) and the Kalinga<em>gangsa</em>lend purpose, properties, and accompaniment to the Tagakaolo and Kalinga dances, respectively. The elaborate<em>kulintang</em>stand with<em>okir</em>designs provides the setting for Maranao and Maguindanao dancing. The Bukidnon dance the <strong>dugso</strong> around an altar for their <strong>hinaklaran</strong> ritual as do the Manobo for their <strong>sangga</strong> ritual. Called<em>angkaw</em>(bamboo platform) or<em>sinengseng</em>(a bamboo pole split at one end to support a plate or candle) by the Manobo, these altars are decorated with<em>menhaw</em>(coconut fronds) and hold offerings of rice, buyo, betel nut, lime, raw eggs, and glasses of water. During the sangga, which addresses coastal spirits, the dancers also offer cigarettes, wine, cookies, and rice cakes. In the <strong>pagdiwata</strong> of the Tagbanwa in Palawan, elaborate bamboo altars in and outside the house also bear offerings. The<em>baylan</em>or shaman, covered by a mysterious<em>alindugan</em>(a large black hood), sits on a swing, and offers the spirits, among other things, a votive bird, rice wine, rice cakes, and jewelry laid out on a mat. The Subanon set wine and food on a high, resilient bamboo platform called<em>buklog</em>, constructed in the open field for the day. On this towering trampoline-like platform, people dance around a central pole that pounds on a log mortar below. The ritual lasts from sunrise to sundown.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The communal celebration of the Holy Child or Santo Ni&ntilde;o is just as elaborate. The residents of lbajay, Aklan, decorate their houses with seafood and carry bamboo poles displaying a wealth of sea harvest. They darken themselves like the Ati or Aeta and don extravagant costumes. In Kalibo, this costumed street-dancing and music making is a full-fledged carnival called <strong>ati-atihan</strong>. In Cebu, on the feast of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, civic, government, and religious organizations celebrate the <strong>sinulog</strong> to honor the Santo Ni&ntilde;o aka Pit Senyor with dancing and votive candles before the basilica. In honor of the Holy Cross or Mahal na Poong Santa Cruz in Batangas, <strong>subli</strong> dancers perform under a large shed and before a tall crucifix. Women wear<em>balintawak</em>and carry their hats like halos on their heads and in their hands; the men click bamboo castanets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some Spanish and Mexican social dances, especially the <strong>pandanggo</strong> and <strong>kuratsa</strong>, female participants wear the Tagalog balintawak or Visayan<em>patadyong</em>. Dancers of the <strong>jota</strong>, <strong>polka</strong>, and <strong>habanera</strong> wear the Maria Clara costume, with its<em>panuelo</em>or shawl, fan, long necklace with tambourine-styled locket, and open shoes or slippers called<em>zapatillas</em>. The men usually wear the barong tagalog or the Chinese-influenced collarless<em>camisa de chino</em>and colored pants in the less Europeanized or the occupational dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Spanish times to the present, the <strong>komedya</strong>, a play in verse with choreographed fighting, has been performed on improvised stages in town plazas. The audience stands around three sides of the stage. The<em>telon,</em>or painted backdrop and sets representing gardens, castle interiors and exteriors, and forests, established the setting for the scenes. Once adapted to formal theaters, the sets conformed to the requirements of the proscenium stage. Stages were lit by gas and later electric lamps. The komedya identified Christians and Muslims with different costumes and colors&mdash;for example, black or dark colors for the Christians and red for the Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>sarsuwela</strong>, a play in prose with songs and dances, was performed in formal theaters and proscenium stages, or in the outdoors on makeshift<em>entablado</em>or stage, open on three sides. A series of telon defined the setting for the scenes such as the facade of a rich person&rsquo;s house, the interior of a poor person&rsquo;s house, or the open field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>Bodabil</strong></a></strong> continued the &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; backdrop trend. Casual European and American clothes went onstage. The Flapper Age transformed women&rsquo;s clothing. With the advent of the Busby Berkeley musicals and Florenz Ziegfeld extravaganzas, platforms and ramps cramped local stages. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/482\"><strong>Velada</strong></a>s</strong> (variety programs) and beauty contests started to change stage design. Art deco became fashionable and was exemplified by the Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a>, which was built in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modern ballets of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\"><strong>Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</strong></a> were first seen at the Metropolitan. Dubsky-Zipper employed scenic designers and designed the costumes herself. By this time, expressionism had tempered realism. Hans A. Heimann&rsquo;s backdrops for Dubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/181\"><strong>Pictures at an Exhibition</strong></a></em></strong>, 1940, for example, were emotionally laden. Ernest A. Komeld&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Toy Box</em></strong>, 1940, featured a gigantic toy horse beside a realistic house. He also designed the stage for Dubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong>, 1951, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2503\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Kane</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Sleeping Beauty</em></strong>, 1953, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><strong>The Nutcracker</strong></a></em></strong>, 1955, produced by Alexandra Danilova.

Fernando Nicolas and Teodoro L. Hilado lit her shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Remedios de Oteyza&rsquo;s productions were mostly designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> O. Villa-Abrille. For de Oteyza&rsquo;s Hariraya Dance / <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, Arturo V. Cruz designed several sets and costumes, and Villa-Abrille and Nicolas, the lights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orosa-Goquingco&rsquo;s <strong><em>Firebird</em></strong>, 1956, and <strong><em>The Clowns</em></strong>, 1957, had sets designed by Leandro Locsin, and later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2431\"><strong>Arturo Cruz</strong></a>. Manuel Rodriguez created the set for her <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/173\"><strong>Noli Dance Suite</strong></a></em></strong>, 1956. Nicolas, Siebe Hartendorp, and Benjamin Goquingco also designed lighting for her works. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> (BP) had sets designed by Locsin and Arturo Cruz who likewise created costumes for the company&rsquo;s 24 works, including <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><strong>Amada</strong></a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/152\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a> Asu</strong></a></em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1916\"><strong>Onyx</strong></a> Wolf), 1970; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/154\"><strong>Juru-Pakal</strong></a></em></strong> (The Enchanted Kris), 1971; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/126\"><strong>Bungkos Suite</strong></a></em></strong> (Bundle Suite) and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/155\"><strong>Kapinangan</strong></a></em></strong>, 1972; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><strong>Ang Sultan</strong></a></em></strong> (The Sultan), 1973; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/168\"><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></a></em></strong>, 1969; and <strong><em>Tchaikovsky Piano <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> No. 1</em></strong>, 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other early set designers for BP were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a>, Ray Albano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>, Monino Duque, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, Jaime de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, Toto Sicangco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2510\"><strong>Luis Layag</strong></a>, and Norman Walker. But it is resident set and costume designer Salvador Bernal who has seen BP through most of its grand classical ballets, and expressionistic modern dances. Some of his works are <strong><em>Baile de Ayer</em></strong> (Dance of Yesteryears), 1974; <strong><em>Images</em></strong>, 1975; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/113\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a>-Bulan</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon Child), 1976; <strong><em>The Nutcracker</em></strong>, 1977; <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a> Act II</em></strong>, 1979; <strong><em>Rama, Hari</em></strong> (Rama, King), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/159\"><strong>La Lampara</strong></a></em></strong> (The Lamp), 1980; <strong><em>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong>, 1989; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress), 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many ways Bernal&rsquo;s prolific artistry helped BP gain its stature as a creator of dance theater. He understood stage space and provided not only decoration but also character and atmosphere which evoked a very particular time and place&mdash;whether reality or fantasy. In theater, Bernal&rsquo;s depiction of reality transcended visual representation and thus enabled the audience to penetrate the imaginary world of the narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BP&rsquo;s lighting designers include Teodoro Hilado, Monino Duque, Katsch S. J. Catoy, Roberto Roces, and Alex de Guzman. Catoy is one of BP&rsquo;s notable lighting designers who did <strong><em>Rama, Hari</em></strong> and <strong><em>La Lampara</em></strong>, 1980; <strong><em>Giselle</em></strong>, 1982; <strong><em>Carmina Burana</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/171\"><strong>Muybridge Frames</strong></a></em></strong>, 1983; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/185\"><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></a></em></strong> and <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong>, 1984; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/196\"><strong>Te Deum</strong></a></em></strong> and <strong><em>Firebird</em></strong>, 1985; <strong><em>Nijinsky</em></strong>, 1987; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/187\"><strong>Siete Dolores</strong></a></em></strong> (Seven Sorrows), 1988. As he closely attends to a narrative, he also intently listens to the music that a ballet uses. Recognizing the technical inadequacies in regional theaters, he wrote a booklet on how these can be lit in a simple and inexpensive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance Theatre Philippines (DTP) set designers include Pepe Roxas, German Lazo, Arturo Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2662\"><strong>Johnny Hubilla</strong></a>, Rupert Acu&ntilde;a, Raquel Rey, Ferdie Jingco, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3778\"><strong>Aro Soriano</strong></a>. Among its costume designers are Marcella Lopez, Arturo Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2432\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2860\"><strong>Eric Cruz</strong></a></strong></a>, Robin Haig, Felicitas Layag-Radaic, Luis Layag, Basilio, and Raquel Rey.

Regular set designers for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2528\"><strong>Manila Metropolis Ballet</strong></a> include Rollie de Leon, Mariflor Fajardo, Ferdie Jingco, Ben Payumo, Oscar Blanco, and Ray Albano. Its costume designers include Arturo Cruz, Fe Batungbakal, and Gang Gomez, while its lighting designers include Duque and Raymond Salvacion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four of the Martha Graham Dance Company&rsquo;s sets were created by Locsin. These were <strong><em>Lucifer</em></strong>, <strong><em>Adorations</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Point of Crossing</em></strong>, 1975; and <strong><em>Flute of Pan</em></strong>, 1978.

The Bukidnon dance the <strong>dugso</strong> around an altar for their <strong>hinaklaran</strong> ritual as do the Manobo for their <strong>sangga</strong> ritual. Called<em>angkaw</em>(bamboo platform) or<em>sinengseng</em>(a bamboo pole split at one end to support a plate or candle) by the Manobo, these altars are decorated with<em>menhaw</em>(coconut fronds) and hold offerings of rice, buyo, betel nut, lime, raw eggs, and glasses of water. During the sangga, which addresses coastal spirits, the dancers also offer cigarettes, wine, cookies, and rice cakes. In the <strong>pagdiwata</strong> of the Tagbanwa in Palawan, elaborate bamboo altars in and outside the house also bear offerings. The<em>baylan</em>or shaman, covered by a mysterious<em>alindugan</em>(a large black hood), sits on a swing, and offers the spirits, among other things, a votive bird, rice wine, rice cakes, and jewelry laid out on a mat. The Subanon set wine and food on a high, resilient bamboo platform called<em>buklog</em>, constructed in the open field for the day. On this towering trampoline-like platform, people dance around a central pole that pounds on a log mortar below. The ritual lasts from sunrise to sundown."

Tradition means the total practice of the art in the context of its history and culture. Technique is the skill with which the vocabulary of dance is expressed. Tradition and technique involve accompaniment, costuming, time, place, and purpose or occasion. Style is refined technique and applied tradition. Tradition, technique, and style may be taught formally at a dance academy, or informally through simple instruction and coaching. A dancer may adopt ideas and techniques encountered in diverse ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a> dances are learned as part of communal life in the Philippines. While shamans may lead and direct them, they are shared and easily learned by assistants or the community. In many areas, the priest/priestess (<em>mambunong, mumbaki,</em>and<em>mandadawak</em>in northern Philippines, or<em>babaylan</em>in the south) may have an assistant who learns the complete ritual processes. In the Subanon <strong>buklog</strong>, the whole community builds the traditional bamboo structure and executes dance movements in a circle as they offer prayers to the gods. In Christianized areas, the ritual dances may be taught by elders, as in Batangas, where the <strong>subli</strong> and the<em>panata</em>(pledge) that goes with it are taught formally. But in many areas, people simply join a gathering, executing the simple and repetitive movements of popular festivals like the <strong>pandangguhan</strong> in Obando, Bulacan; the <strong>turumba</strong> in Pakil, Laguna; the <strong>ati-atihan</strong> in Kalibo, Aklan; or the <strong>sinulog</strong> in Cebu or Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dances are learned by the community through constant exposure to these performances. Mimetic and occupation dances are transmutations of what people see and do, so that the motives behind and the forms of the dances derive from everyday life. Social dances&mdash;from game and song dances to courtship and wedding dances&mdash;are so familiar to the community that everyone is expected to execute them at social functions.When Philippine and foreign folk dances became an important part of the educational system after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a>&rsquo;s research became nationally known in the 1930s, they were taught in schools and performed in field demonstrations, staged programs, and town fiestas.

Today many of these groups constitute the Association of Ballet Academies Philippines (ABAP), which was founded by Vella Damian and close associates. Some of these ballet schools link themselves and conduct examinations according to the various syllabi systems mentioned above. ABAP and other networks also conduct ballet competitions. On a higher level and linked to the Department of Education, the National Music Competition of Young Artists (NAMCYA) ran a national ballet competition for eight years up to 2012.

Because modern dance emerged in the 20th century under individual initiatives, there are various techniques and styles, like those of Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon, and Merce Cunningham. Other styles, such as those of Isadora Duncan and Mary Wigman, did not become as popular. These new styles were influenced by anthropological, psychological, and aesthetic studies, and advances in modern science and art. For example, they emphasize varied physical dynamics, rootedness in going to the ground or floor, and improvisational and compositional approaches in structuring a dance class. At the same time, each style or technique serves the theme or method of its founder or choreographer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern dance first came to the Philippines in the 1930s by way of two Austrians, namely Kaethe Hauser and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\"><strong>Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</strong></a>. The first to come, Hauser, taught children of the elite, among them Maribel Aboitiz. With other and later teachers, Aboitiz became Manila&rsquo;s stellar ballerina. Identified with the European  <strong><em>Austruckstanz </em></strong> (Expressive Dance), Dubsky-Zipper first taught at the UP Conservatory of Music. Her educational influence is seen in Carmen Adevoso, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2572\"><strong>Adina Rigor-Ferrer</strong></a>, Remedios Villanueva-Pi&ntilde;on, Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, and Rosalia Merino-Santos. In the 1970s, Shona MacTavish taught in the Austruckstanz style of Gertrude Bondeweiser (Dubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s teacher) in Silliman University. A globally pivotal dancer-choreographer was Mary Wigman who studied with Rudolf von Laban and Jacques Dalcroze. Dalcroze&rsquo;s Eurythmics is taught to dancers and musicians in UP College of Music. Wigman has some influence in the Philippines through Merino-Santos who studied with her in Europe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\"><strong>Alice Reyes</strong></a> whose teacher was Hanya Holm from Wigman&rsquo;s school, and through Wigman-exponent Kazuo Kamizawa who briefly taught for the UP&rsquo;s dance degree program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, newer approaches came with Release Technique, Contact Improvisation, Labanalysis, the techniques of Pilates, Alexander, Feldenkrais, Grotowski, and Physical Theater that lend themselves to choreographic exploration or serve physical conditioning and rehabilitation. Visiting Fulbright fellow <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2494\"><strong>Kristin Jackson</strong></a> taught Irene Dowd&rsquo;s method and her own style at UP and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a>. Jackson&rsquo;s dancing bloomed in the phase of postmodernism, particularly while dancing with Laura Dean, and in her own choreographies. This movement undermined &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; modern dance (Graham, Humphrey, Holm, Limon, et al.) by its diverse conceptions of time and space, themes, and textures. Similarly, new orientation in anthropology as seen in Alfred Gell&rsquo;s study of Umeda dance in Papua New Guinea or the ethnographic analysis of the visual arts like that in Abraham Sakili&rsquo;s study of Philippine Muslim society may be linked to creative modes in choreography and movement notation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance was formally taught in school as part of academic curricula in the 1950s through the efforts of Francisca Reyes-Aquino. But over the years, the teaching of dance has changed. Where previously the primary grades and high schools taught music and the arts separately, the Department of Education (DepEd, 1987&ndash;2001), formerly known as the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports, combined both of these with fitness and sports. The program has been called Physical Education, Health, and Music (PEHM), or Music, Arts, and Physical Education (MAPE). Expertise in all these areas is not generally available, so DepEd holds supplementary summer seminars. Exemplary is the dance at the Philippine High School for the Arts (PHSA) in Los Ba&ntilde;os. It has both ballet and folk dance majors, with their respective performing groups. For projects, they collaborate with music, theater, and visual arts majors. In the past years, other public high schools also set up their own Special Program from the Arts now found in the regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance degree was eventually institutionalized in the collegiate level. The first degree course was instituted in 1972 at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University where it stayed for a while to graduate a few with a Bachelor in Music Major in Dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the University of the Philippines (UP), the College of Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (SPEAR) started a certificate program in 1981. After SPEAR was renamed the College of Human Kinetics, this program was replaced with a Bachelor of Sports Science in 2002 without a dance degree offering. In 2015, its master of science in human movement science had a major in physical education with electives and thesis in dance. Also in 1981, the UP College of Music (UPCMu) started to offer a four-year Diploma in Performing Arts Major in Dance. Later, the UPCMu provided an option for a five-year Bachelor of Music, Major in Dance. Courses are in dance technique (ballet, modern dance, Filipino and Asian dance), dance theory, dance composition, recital production, music, and theater. Solely in the Philippines, the program includes movement notation&mdash;to train students to read, write, and stage dances from scores.

Tradition means the total practice of the art in the context of its history and culture. Technique is the skill with which the vocabulary of dance is expressed. Tradition and technique involve accompaniment, costuming, time, place, and purpose or occasion. Style is refined technique and applied tradition. Tradition, technique, and style may be taught formally at a dance academy, or informally through simple instruction and coaching. A dancer may adopt ideas and techniques encountered in diverse ways."

While shamans may lead and direct them, they are shared and easily learned by assistants or the community. In many areas, the priest/priestess (<em>mambunong, mumbaki,</em>and<em>mandadawak</em>in northern Philippines, or<em>babaylan</em>in the south) may have an assistant who learns the complete ritual processes. In the Subanon <strong>buklog</strong>, the whole community builds the traditional bamboo structure and executes dance movements in a circle as they offer prayers to the gods. In Christianized areas, the ritual dances may be taught by elders, as in Batangas, where the <strong>subli</strong> and the<em>panata</em>(pledge) that goes with it are taught formally. But in many areas, people simply join a gathering, executing the simple and repetitive movements of popular festivals like the <strong>pandangguhan</strong> in Obando, Bulacan; the <strong>turumba</strong> in Pakil, Laguna; the <strong>ati-atihan</strong> in Kalibo, Aklan; or the <strong>sinulog</strong> in Cebu or Bohol."

The accompanying sound may be simple or complex, supplied by the dancer herself/himself or by nondancing singers and/or instrumentalists. Music supplied by the dance includes stamping, snapping of fingers, body slapping, or singing. This may be extended by the use of bells, castanets, shells, sticks, boots, tambourines, cymbals, or drums hung on the dancer&rsquo;s body. Dance music has a wide range. There may be only one accompanist or a whole orchestra; the music may be improvised or composed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous music and dance in the Philippines are as richly varied and diverse as the cultures from which they emanate. There are over 50 ethnolinguistic groups scattered throughout the Philippines. Dance and its music are part of rituals that commemorate various tribal life activities such as courtship, marriage, death, birth, healing, welcome, thanksgiving, victory in war, planting, or harvesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Kalinga, gong playing is an integral part of peace pact gatherings, weddings, prestige ceremonies or feasts in celebration of important events. Men performing in the <strong>gangsa palook</strong> style beat gongs with a stick as they stand beside each other in one line executing alternate steps, at first without moving from their place. Gradually, the man at the end of the line moves away in a stooping position followed by the others, forming a circle and continually moving in a long, curved line while alternately stooping and straightening up. The gongs are held in the left hand, away from the body, then near the body. Normally, sixgangsaor flat gongsare used. The music consists of two rhythms&mdash;<em>dadaw</em>and<em>sapi</em>&mdash;played in opposition to each other. The alternating beats of these two rhythms are interspersed with beats emanating from the four other gongs. Though women may join in the dance, only men perform on the gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>tadek</strong>, danced by a male and female, is accompanied by six gongs played in<em>topayya</em>style, in which the gongs are hit with the hands with tapping and sliding motions. The first four gongs play identical rhythms, one beat behind each other. The fifth gong sounds an ostinato rhythm of deadened tones, while the sixth gong sounds a fast tapping rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other flat gong ensembles with dance are found in the Cordilleras of northern Luzon. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> use a three-gong ensemble&mdash;<em>tobop</em>,<em>hibat</em>, and<em>ahot</em><strong>&mdash;</strong> to accompany men dancing in a ceremony to celebrate a harvest. Karao men use seven gongs struck with sticks, each with its own rhythm, while the women dance the <strong>itundak</strong> and <strong>tinebtebak</strong>. In Bontoc, men dance and play a set of 10 gongs. The<em>aliweng</em>and<em>soklungan</em>gongs play opposing rhythms in different tambours interspersed with rhythms played on the eight remaining<em>kalos</em>(gongs).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ifugao execute the <strong>himong</strong> ritual for deaths caused by foul play. Men play the<em>bangibang</em>(struck wooden sticks) while dancing in line. An alternation of strokes between odd- and even-numbered men in the line produces a regular rhythm of light and heavy sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tagakaolo women of Davao del Sur execute a dance imitating the<em>tamiala</em>bird. Wearing belts and anklets of<em>cascabels</em>, the dancers move to the music of the<em>udol</em>, a hollowed-out log drum. Two performers beat the top of the log drum. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> is seated, striking the log drum with two<em>patawagay</em>(short sticks), while the second moves freely around the instrument, striking the log drum with an<em>utumay</em>(long, thin stick), beating a rhythmic pattern in counterpoint to that of the patawagay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Matigsalug of Bukidnon have a charming courting dance performed by a male while playing the<em>kudlong</em>(two-stringed lute) and singing. The woman plucks her<em>takumbo</em>(bamboo zither), dancing around the man who eventually follows behind her in small mincing steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maguindanao musicians play the<em>kulintang</em>, a set of eight graduated bossed gongs, and the<em>dabakan</em>(drum) to accompany the dancing of the medium during the<em>pagibat</em>, a curing rite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Manobo<em>kulintangan</em>is made up of six to ten graduated bossed gongs suspended from a frame in pyramid fashion, with the highest-pitched gong on top and the lowest at the bottom. A melody player strikes the various gongs using one beater, while a drone player strikes a continuously repeated pattern on the lowest pitched gong. The ensemble is completed by a third musician beating on a cylindrical wooden drum. The gong melody player leaves the instrument occasionally to participate in the dance. The music and dance are performed during festive gatherings such as weddings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Tausug of Jolo, dancing occurs primarily as an adjunct to the kulintangan, a gong ensemble consisting of a set of 8 (in Pata island) to 11 (in Luuk) bossed gongs laid in a row, a<em>tunggalan</em>(single, large bossed gong),<em>duahan</em>(a set of two-paired bossed gongs), and two<em>gandang</em>(drums). Dancing is done only for entertainment, with no religious or social function. Gong music consists of a series of three types of compositions <strong>:</strong> <em>sinug</em>,<em>kuliri</em>, and<em>lubak-lubak</em>, the latter being played as accompaniment to the dancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gong ensemble of the Sama Dilaut (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>) of Sitangkai is similar to that of the Tausug, consisting of a seven to nine-piece kulintangan, three hanging gongs called<em>bua</em>,<em>pulakan</em>, and<em>tamuk</em>, and a<em>tambul</em>or drum. Gong music is associated with dance and is performed on important social occasions such as marriage or<em>magkawin</em>, circumcision or<em>magislam</em>, and communication with spirits or<em>magigal jin</em>. Often, dancers add the clicking sound of their<em>bula bula</em>(wooden castanets) to the instrumental ensemble. Different tunes are encountered: <strong>titik tagunggu</strong> (ceremonial voyage, marriage, circumcision); <strong>titik tabawan</strong> (wedding, dance of possession); <strong>tariray</strong> or <strong>limbayan</strong> (festive occasions danced by younger women characterized by suggestive shoulder jerks and gyrating torsos); and <strong>titik jin</strong> and <strong>lellang</strong> (dances of mediums).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stamp dancing to the fast beat of<em>agung</em>(gongs) by Hanunuo men and boys is an expression of jubilation during the<em>panludan</em>, a feast with merrymaking. Many other instruments like guitars, fiddles, flutes, mouth harps, zithers, and whistles join the<em>kalipay</em>(noise making).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bataan, the Aeta commemorate weddings with the <strong>ambahan</strong>, which lasts for several days. Participants dance&mdash;hopping, stepping, and kicking up their heels&mdash;to the accompaniment of<em>palai</em>(gong) beats, in an oval around a bonfire, while singing<em>amba</em>(verses) in leader-chorus style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dances among lowland Christian groups form the greatest bulk of &ldquo;popular&rdquo; folk dances. Though some dances like the <strong>kumintang</strong> retain indigenous forms and traditions, the great majority has been strongly influenced by turn-of-the-century European ballroom dances as well as Spanish and Mexican national dances. Thus, they have such names as <strong>habanera</strong>, <strong>tango</strong>, <strong>pandanggo</strong>, <strong>seguidilla</strong>, <strong>jota</strong>, <strong>kuratsa</strong>, <strong>polka</strong>, <strong>mazurka</strong>, <strong>danza</strong>, <strong>wultz</strong>, and <strong>rigodon</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Castilian and Andalusian courtship dance, <strong>fandango</strong>, came to be known locally as the <strong>pandanggo</strong>. Upon adaptation, its triple-time rhythm and moderately fast waltz-like tempo were retained. Travelogues by Guignes, 1808, Lafond, 1884, and Mallat, 1846, mention the fandango being performed for the entertainment of the elite at balls and soirees. Although Mallat mentions the fandango being accompanied quite dexterously by castanets, Walls y Merino, 1892, specifically cites the guitar and the<em>bajo de unas</em>(string bass) as the usual accompaniment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the pandanggo spread to various Philippine regions, each locality evolved its own characteristic movements and accessories. Thus, the llocano pandanggo of Camiling, Tarlac, and the Visayan pandanggo retain the pantomimic character of the Spanish prototype in which the men use a hat when inviting a chosen maiden to be a dance partner. Instead of the hat, lighted oil lamps may also be used. Both the Ilocano and Visayan pandanggo use music with only one part (A) repeated. However, the <strong>pandanggo sa ilaw</strong>, whose musical accompaniment was composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> using the original rhthym found in Mindoro, is tripartite (ABC), the sections occurring twice and ending with a repeated last section, thus: ABCABCCC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally from Aragon, Spain, the jota was indispensable at provincial fiestas, particularly those organized in honor of visiting civil and religious dignitaries. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\"><strong>Jota</strong></a></strong></a>s are found in almost every locality, some examples of which are the <strong>jota filipina</strong> of Lal-lo, Cagayan; the <strong>jota paloana</strong> of Palo, Leyte; the <strong>jota vintarina</strong> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/202\"><strong>Vinta</strong></a>r, Ilocos Norte; the <strong>jota yogad</strong> of Echague, Isabela; and the <strong>jota batangue&ntilde;a</strong> of Batangas. Music is variously repeated, and comprises three to six sections. It is in rapid triple time quite similar to that of the pandanggo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another dance in triple time is the kuratsa. Its music is quicker and livelier than the jota or the pandanggo. It is characterized by running 16th-note figures accompanied by a repeated rhythmic accompaniment consisting of two quarter notes followed by two eighth notes. At town fiestas, the kuratsa was played by an ensemble consisting of a clarinet and two trombones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cuban habanerain duple time is in a slow or moderate tempo. The later <strong>danza</strong> and <strong>tango</strong> were outgrowths of the habanera, retaining the latter&rsquo;s rhythmic characteristics. Dances utilizing the habanera rhythms may or may not be titled as habaneras. Examples are the <strong>mascota</strong> of Cauayan, Isabela; the <strong>imbestida</strong> of Bayombong, Nueva Viscaya; the <strong>annafunan</strong> of Cagayan; the <strong>sainita</strong> of Nueva Viscaya; and the habanera of Ilocos Sur. Many composers wrote music in the habanera style, e.g., <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Beautiful Star), Dolores Paterno&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/890\"><strong>La Flor de Manila</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Flower of Manila) also known as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>,&rdquo; and J. Massaguer&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Bella Filipina&rdquo; (The Beautiful Filipina).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other favorite ballroom dances which found their way to the Philippines were the polka, mazurka, and waltz or <strong>balse</strong>. The polka, which is of Bohemian origin, has a fast duple rhythm, as in the <strong>polka sala</strong> of Mindoro and the <strong>polkabal</strong> of Tayabas. The Polish mazurka is in triple meter and may be performed at several speeds from moderately slow to very fast. The waltz or balse continues to be popular until today. Its moderate triple time is used for a great number of dances other than the balse itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The music for most of these European-type dances is homophonic and harmonized in the major-minor tonal system. Most of the music is in 3/4 time with some 2/4 (habanera), 4/4, and fewer in 6/8 or 12/8 (quadrille) rhythms. Many of the melodies start with an upbeat. The melodies are cast in strictly phrased 8-measure periods (a 4-measure antecedent phrase followed by a 4-measure consequent phrase) or 16-measure double periods. The music is sectionalized, the number of sections varying from two to eight or more. The sections are repeated variously, e.g., ABB, ABAB, ABACAB, etc. Occasionally, there is a metric change in the sections, or a change from major to minor tonality or vice versa. Very often, the dance opens with a short two-measure introduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dances are accompanied by whatever instruments are available. Bands and orchestras used to accompany the dances at balls and soirees in the second half of the 19th century. Today, in many grade and high schools where these dances are taught, the music is played on the piano. In the absence of a piano, a guitar or guitars are used. The<em>rondalla</em>, an ensemble of plucked chordophones, is the favorite accompanying instrumental group. Originally, the rondalla was known as the<em>comparza</em>. It reached its height of popularity during the later period of the Spanish regime and the early years of the American era. In the 1990s interest in the rondalla was revived and many schools now have rondalla groups. A small ensemble consists of one or two<em>bandurria</em>, a guitar, a laud, an octavina and a bass guitar, also known as the bajo de unas or a string bass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively young is Philippine professional theatrical dancing or <strong>ballet</strong>. Filipino artists and audiences began showing an interest in this art form in the 1930s. Enthusiasm for ballet grew steadily in the ensuing decades. Since the 1970s, about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> works have been choreographed to music by Filipino composers. Approximately half of these works were original ballets, many commissioned jointly by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC) for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> (BP).

Twentieth-century works, both popular and avant-garde were also chosen. In the popular vein are <strong><em>Lonely Hearts Club Band</em></strong> by Alice Reyes, 1977, to Lennon and McCartney; and <strong><em>Vermillion Scarf</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2422\"><strong>Gener Caringal</strong></a>, 1982, to the Beatles.

They have widened their listening repertoire from the East and West, thus enriching the styles and textures of their works. However, the breadth of choice sometimes leads to lack of discrimination. One easy temptation is that choreographers no longer avail of advice, musical scores, or accompaniment from musicians. Their wide choice includes Filipino and foreign composers from collection&mdash;recordings that may result in a hodgepodge of musical and choreographic styles. Moreover, composers are not always consulted about the use of their music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UP College of Music, there are composers and instrumentalists who provide music for dance, like Ramon Santos, Josefino Toledo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>, Verne de la Pe&ntilde;a, Christine Muyco, and the college&rsquo;s several performing groups.

				"value": "The recent accessibility of recordings and Internet downloadings has modified how choreographers, dancers, and audiences attune themselves to music. They have widened their listening repertoire from the East and West, thus enriching the styles and textures of their works. However, the breadth of choice sometimes leads to lack of discrimination. One easy temptation is that choreographers no longer avail of advice, musical scores, or accompaniment from musicians. Their wide choice includes Filipino and foreign composers from collection&#x2014;recordings that may result in a hodgepodge of musical and choreographic styles. Moreover, composers are not always consulted about the use of their music."

In the 1930s, she combed the countryside for folk dances with fellow scholars photographer Ramon Tolentino and composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> as part of a team created by University of the Philippines (UP) President Jorge Bocobo. The team&rsquo;s documentation work resulted in the performance of the dances by the UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> and Dance Club, and the publication of <strong><em>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>s and Games</em></strong>, 1935, and <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong>, 1946. Reyes-Aquino&rsquo;s masterpiece, achieved with the help of the Bureau of Education and provincial researches, was the six-volume <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances</em></strong> published from 1953 to 1979. Reyes-Aquino set figures, establishing a standard vocabulary for Philippine folk dance and a system of verbal and sign directions that other researchers follow to this day. She also published glossaries and instructional books on folk dance. After Reyes-Aquino, dance research in UP received support in the 1990s, under the Office of Research Coordination and the President&rsquo;s Committee on Culture and the Arts of the UP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other field researchers followed Reyes-Aquino&rsquo;s example: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2463\"><strong>Libertad V. Fajardo</strong></a>, with her three-volume work <strong><em>Visayan Folk Dances</em></strong>, 1961; Juan C. Miel with <strong><em>Samar Folk Dances</em></strong>, 1973; Jovita Sison Friese, with <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances from Pangasinan</em></strong>, 1980; Teresita Pascua-Ines with <strong><em>Ilocano Folk Dances</em></strong>, 1973. More recently, Petronila Suarez did studies on Ilonggo folk dances, 2000; Leon Tuy did an analytical study of several Bicol folk dances; and Gloria Cabahug studied the fundamental characteristics of Cebuano folk dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) Filipiniana Folk Music and Dance Committee had started to do research in dance in the 1930s, it was only in the 1950s that the University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Folk Arts Center, under the leadership of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a>, Lucrecia Kasilag, and Isabel Santos, in coordination with PWU provincial branches, organized a comprehensive and systematic field research in folk dance. In 2002, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a> center and company completed a set of five video films classifying the suites in the company&rsquo;s repertoire of dances: namely, Cordillera, Maria Clara, Rural, Muslim, and Tribal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2547\"><strong>Ramon A. Obusan</strong></a>, former dancer and researcher of the Bayanihan, did extensive documentation of dance on his own after leaving Bayanihan. His invaluable personal video library forms the basis for the staging of folk dances by his dance company, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</strong></a>. For Mico Records (n. d.), Obusan published 14 folk dances from various regions in the Philippines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2398\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></a></strong></a>, another formidable researcher, studied the dances (including movements, occasions, and costumes) of the Tausug, Sama/Samal, Sama Dilaut (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>), and Jama Mapun of the Sulu archipelago and published these in her book <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/15\"><strong>Pangalay: Traditional Dances and Related Folk Artistic Expressions</strong></a></em></strong>, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dance research can be conducted by observing and joining Folk Arts Theater festivals and workshops, which started in 1978. Dances, such as those performed in the <strong><em>First Philippine Folk Festival </em></strong> in 1981by Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula, are introduced mainly to school teachers. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2441\"><strong>Dance Education Association of the Philippines</strong></a> holds annual folk dance workshops where regional researchers teach their newly discovered dances. The old Kaamulan festivals in Bukidnon and other festivals also allowed researchers to observe and document dances all in one place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most prolific association in dance research is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine Folk Dance Society</strong></a> (PFDS). Aside from its yearly workshops held in different parts of the country, PFDS anthologized previously published dances in three volumes of <strong><em>A Classic Collection of Philippine Folk Dances</em></strong>, 2006, 2007, and 2008 <strong><em>.</em></strong> These consolidate choices from the early books of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a>, Jovita Sison Friese, Juan Miel, Libertad V.Fajardo, Ramon Obusan, and Hadja Badria Jajurie. On the other hand, PFDS&rsquo;s several volumes of <strong><em>Sayaw</em></strong> (Dance) from 1999 to 2014 anthologize new researches in folk dance from all over the country. These dances are presented and taught at PFDS&rsquo;s annual workshops. Aside from those taken from Obusan, Sison Friese, and Paz Cielo Belmonte, contributions come from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2402\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2403\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2404\"><strong>Jose Balcena</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, Emerita Basilio, Franco Pastor, Petronila Suarez, and new researchers who help disseminate dances from all over the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a> published <strong><em>Cordillera Ethnic Dances: A Manual for Teachers</em></strong> that documents dances from Abra, Apayao, Benguet, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, Kalinga, Bontok, and other parts of Mountain Province. Notators of the dances are Salvadora Serrano, Eduardo Laconsay, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>. Whether through the physical education or formalized academic dance and arts program, there are hundreds of theses and dissertations that have enriched the scholarship in Philippine dance. There is a need to make a consolidated listing of these scholarly works found in universities nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video film is now an ubiquitous aid in dance research. Movement, color, and sound are recorded all at once, while notation completes the details of the dance. Film, however, is two-dimensional, requiring documentation from various angles, distances, and heights; several cameras or takes may be necessary to accurately portray performances. Despite these limitations in documenting dance in both notation and film (not to mention its cost and the need for periodic verification though time), the use of video has spread, especially with advances in portable digital video cameras. However, access to video documentation, as well as book manuals on dance, is still confined to dance organizations and researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Federation published its own journal of dance. But after a few years, the journal stopped publication and has not been replaced by another regular journal or annual in dance. However, in 2008, a new publication on dance called <strong><em>Runthrough</em></strong> appeared.Edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2491\"><strong>Joelle Jacinto</strong></a>, this publication is available online. Under the NCCA, the national dance committee held conferences to upgrade teachers&rsquo; academic awareness. The proceedings of the 1998 Philippine international dance conference were published. The NCCA stopped this program for a while, but in the 2000s, it revived workshops and conferences, with its annual international Dance Xchange Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance research has been popularized by the <strong><em>Tuklas Sining</em></strong> series of videos and monographs on the Philippine arts of the CCP. To date, the CCP has come out with the <strong><em>Sayaw</em></strong> series: <strong><em>An <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\"><strong>Essay</strong></a> on Philippine Dance</em></strong>, 1989, by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz and Ramon Obusan; the <strong><em>Philippine Ethnic Dance</em></strong>, 1994, by Villaruz and Obusan; <strong><em>The Spanish Influence on Philippine Dance</em></strong>, 1992, by Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2399\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2400\"><strong>Prosperidad M. Arandez</strong></a></strong></a>; and the <strong><em>The American Colonial and Contemporary Traditions in Philippine Dance</em></strong>, 1994, by Villaruz. Through the CCP, the ASEAN also issued <strong><em>The Traditional Dances: Philippines</em></strong>, 1977, describing and showing three well-known folk dances: <strong>itik-itik</strong>, <strong>habanera botole&ntilde;a</strong>, and <strong>kini-kini</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Library or archival research includes the examination of primary materials, including any form of dance notation, choreographic notes and scenarios, correspondence, and related manuscripts. Secondary materials include souvenir programs, posters, flyers, periodical notices, reviews, books, and folios. Libraries now include microfilms of these written or printed materials, and audio and visual recordings. Archives and museums preserve photographs and memorabilia, costumes, musical instruments, designs and librettos, rehearsal and performance schedules, and even account bills. A sizeable amount of dance and music materials is available at the CCP and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> Ethnomusicology Center, UP College of Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three important books that used library and other materials are: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2393\"><strong>Reynaldo Alejandro</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Philippine Dance: Mainstream and Concurrents</em></strong>, 1978, which presents a general survey of the development of ethnic dances, Christian lowland dances, social dances, ballet, and modern dance in the Philippines; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\"><strong>Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dances of the Emerald Isles</em></strong>, 1980, which describes the dances of 30 ethnolinguistic groups, among them the Bontok, Ifugao, Kalinga, Aeta, Mangyan, Tagbanwa, Batak, Palawan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Bukidnon, Manobo, Tboli, Tiruray, Tausug, Samal, Maranao, and Maguindanao; and Doreen Fernandez and Rudy Vidad&rsquo;s <strong><em>In Performance</em></strong>, 1981, which describes in text and pictures the classical modern ballets as well as the original modern dance pieces of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> from 1970 to 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few books which employ sociological, theoretical, and critical viewpoints. Among these are Elena Rivera Mirano&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>\"><strong>Subli</strong></a>: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Dance in Four Voices</em></strong> ( <strong><em>Subli: Isang Sayaw sa Apat na Tinig</em></strong> ), 1989, a nuanced reading of the music, literature, movements, and prayer constituting Batangas&rsquo;s traditional dance form, the<em>subli</em>; Basilio Esteban Villaruz&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/22\"><strong>Treading Through 45 Years of Philippine Dance</strong></a></em></strong>, 2006, an extensive scholarly chronicle of dance history and analysis in the Philippines and the dance world, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/23\"><strong>Walking Through Philippine Theater</strong></a></em></strong>, 2012, a three-volume compendium of essays, reviews, dance and theater history, and social biographies of artists written from the 1960s to the 1990s; Rina Angela Corpus&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/14\"><strong>Defiant Daughters Dancing: Three Independent Women Dance</strong></a></em></strong>, 2007, a study on the choreographic practices of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a>, and Kristine Jackson; and Theodore Gonzalves&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Day the Dancers Stayed</em></strong>, 2010, a critical analysis of the intersections of nation-formation, folk dance, the Philippine Cultural Night in the United States, and Filipinos dancing abroad. First to describe her choreographic process, Agnes Locsin published <strong><em>Philippine Neo-Ethnic Choreography</em></strong>, 2012, which maps the development of the idea of &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; and her process of creating works. A singular book on stage design is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G. Tiongson</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Salvador T. Bernal: Designing the Stage</em></strong>, 2007, on a prolific and innovative designer for theater and dance. Another welcome addition to dance research in the Philippines is Patrick Alcedo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ati-atihan Lives</em></strong> and <strong><em>Panaad: A Promise to the Santo Ni&ntilde;o</em></strong>, 2012, both documentary films which record the stories of festival participants and their devotion to the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. In featuring the narratives of these participants, these documentaries show multiple layers of a cultural practice which is both spiritual and secular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conferences of the World Dance Alliance (WDA) in the Philippines and elsewhere have published proceedings and most contain Filipino contributions. These conferences have been held in Hong Kong, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, China, India, Germany, Canada, Brazil, and USA. WDA&rsquo;s Asia Pacific Center reviews events through its <strong><em>Asia Pacific Channels</em></strong>,now available online. The International Council of Traditional Music (ICTM) closely links dance and music, thus dance is integral to its studies and conferences, held in Asia and worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews, which are essential to shed further light on the dances, are available in recorded and transcribed form in libraries and personal collections. Oral histories of a few key dance figures had been done by Reynaldo G. Alejandro for the New York Dance Library&rsquo;s Dance Collection. The dance degree program at the UP College of Music (UPCMu) also requires dance majors to compile oral histories and write their theses on dance. For a De La Salle University project, Marcelino Foronda Jr recorded Leonor Orosa-Goquingco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2590\"><strong>Tina Santos</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2455\"><strong>Eddie Elejar</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any movement notation has its advantages as well as limitations. Experts have continually reexamined Labanotation, the Benesh system, the Eskhol-Wachmann, and other systems (including the newly discovered ancient Chinese system) in light of the old (like those of Fuillet and Arbeau) and new (like those of Nijinsky and Massine) notation systems. The Benesh system is taught in four semesters at the UPCMu; it was offered first by Villaruz and is now taught by Desiree Peralejo Medina. Such meticulous efforts in analyzing systems have made possible the restaging of folk and theatrical dances as close to the original as possible. A few Filipinos such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2561\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2562\"><strong>Lulu Puertollano</strong></a></strong></a>, Priscilla Minas, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2474\"><strong>Larry Gabao</strong></a> use Labanotation. Villaruz used the Benesh or choreography system for sections of his ballet, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/201\"><strong>Tropical Tapestry</strong></a></em></strong>, 1980. Villaruz also did the dance notation for Rivera Mirano&rsquo;s <strong><em>Subli. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span></em><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</em></strong> </p>\r\n",

Despite these limitations in documenting dance in both notation and film (not to mention its cost and the need for periodic verification though time), the use of video has spread, especially with advances in portable digital video cameras.

The Benesh system is taught in four semesters at the UPCMu; it was offered first by Villaruz and is now taught by Desiree Peralejo Medina. Such meticulous efforts in analyzing systems have made possible the restaging of folk and theatrical dances as close to the original as possible.
