Mercado Management Inc</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first golden age of Philippine cinema, which began shortly after World War II and hastened into decline by the 1960s, was the heyday of the studio system. And one of the key figures of this period was Narcisa Buencamino de Leon or Do&ntilde;a Sisang, who co-founded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a> in 1938.

Her story is told in this book, which does triple duty as a definitive biography, a critical examination of de Leon&rsquo;s legacy, and a brief history of a specific period in the local movie industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book features anecdote-filled essays penned by seasoned journalists, such as Paulyn P. Sicam, Lorna K. Tirol, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4972\">Nestor U. Torre</a> as well as contributors Manuel G. Chaves and Babsy Paredes. Mercado&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sine: A Brief History&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Mosaic of Memories&rdquo; are the first and last chapters, opening and closing the book by putting into context the forces that allowed for the existence of LVN and the industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grand Old Lady.&rdquo; Torre&rsquo;s &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Sisang: Her Times, Her Studio&rdquo; is an in-depth look into how de Leon built and ruled her own studio, which gave rise to some of Philippine cinema&rsquo;s most enduring leading ladies and men. Chaves&rsquo;s &ldquo;LVN: Still in the Movies&rdquo; is a rich portfolio of annotated production stills from LVN&rsquo;s film vault, giving readers a glimpse of movies and stars from a bygone era, made all the more rare and precious because of the country&rsquo;s lack of a film archive. Sicam and Paredes&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Directors&rsquo; Director&rdquo; dissects de Leon&rsquo;s complex and sometimes contentious relationships with LVN&rsquo;s stable of directors. And finally, Tirol&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Starmaker,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Musicmaker,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Movie Stars&rsquo; Matriarch&rdquo; bring to light de Leon&rsquo;s different roles in LVN, as seen through the prism of memories from her collaborators, discoveries, and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What emerges is a portrait of de Leon as a shrewd entrepreneur, a canny impresario, a steely matriarch, and a confident stylemaker, perennially clad in her customary outfit of <i>baro&rsquo;t saya </i>and <i>corcho </i>(slippers). She was a power player in a baro&rsquo;t saya outfit whose unabashed nationalism, irrepressible commercialism, and escapist bent shaped a signature look and sound for LVN&rsquo;s movies, even though they were made by different directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;LVN style&rdquo; had de Leon&rsquo;s fingerprints all over it. No detail was too trivial or complex for her handle, as she &ldquo;read scripts, decided on projects, supervised casting, designed costumes, viewed rushes, all down the line,&rdquo; explains Torre. Her decided partiality for romance&mdash;the rural kind as well as the traditional <i>awit</i> and <i>korido </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>)&mdash;accounts for the attention she lavished on LVN&rsquo;s productions of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\">Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></a> </i></b>(Adarna Bird), 1941, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1163\"><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</a> </i></b>(Florante and Laura), 1949, and <b><i>Prinsipe Te&ntilde;oso </i></b>(Prince Te&ntilde;oso), 1954. That these stories were focused on noble and chaste love was no accident. De Leon had a strong religious streak, and her devotion to Catholicism was apparent in her demand that LVN movies carry moral lessons and feature no sex, just love scenes that were limited to a wholesome kiss on the cheek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her penny-pinching nature made her reluctant to spend on marketing and public relations, so she paired up LVN&rsquo;s male and female stars and created &ldquo;love teams&rdquo; instead. &ldquo;<i>Magpa-chismis kayo</i>&rdquo; (make other people gossip about you), she would tell them, and then allowed the rumor mill to do all the publicity work for her. It was a clever solution, though it did inadvertently contribute to the emergence and continued existence of the love team as an institutionalized fame-generating tactic in Philippine showbiz&mdash;a dubious legacy, if there ever was one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<i>Kung ano ang kikita</i>&rdquo; (whatever makes money) neatly sums up how de Leon chose what films to make. As such, LVN was best known for crowd-pleasing swordplay costume movies and comedies. But thanks to the persistence of Manuel, the de Leon matriarch&rsquo;s son, LVN was also the same studio that produced director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\"><strong>Lamberto Avellana</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> Dalita</a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Ruins</i></b>), 1956, a film that could only be deemed a blockbuster if the moviegoing public could not get enough of desolate, realistic dramas about how Filipinos rebuilt their life after World War II amid rubble-strewn poverty and loss-ridden misery. <b><i><strong>Anak Dalita</strong> </i></b> won a host of awards, including Best Film, at the 1956 Asia-Pacific Film Festival, but that didn&rsquo;t lead to a sudden surge in LVN movies imbued with socially conscious themes or gritty realism. No surprise there. In the chapter &ldquo;The Director&rsquo;s Director,&rdquo; Sicam and Paredes interview Avellana, who recalls that Do&ntilde;a Sisang asked him, &ldquo;<i>Bakit mo ipapakita sa tao na mahirap sila?</i>&rdquo; (Why show people that they are poor?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tirol starts &ldquo;The Movie Stars&rsquo; Matriarch&rdquo; with a revelation about legendary actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4651\">Rosa Rosal</a>. A serious thespian who frequently did daring or <i>kontrabida</i> (antagonist) roles in LVN pictures (she was also in <b><i>Anak Dalita</i></b>), Rosal had no qualms about wearing bathing suits or kissing her co-stars. But she did name two of her fears in life: God and Do&ntilde;a Sisang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That remark was telling, but it was not about de Leon&rsquo;s tyrannical ways. Instead, like this book, it was a tribute to her shrewd acumen, a sign of enduring respect for a pioneering woman whose drive and ambition helped give birth to the first Pax Filipiniana in Philippine cinema.<i> </i><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Ang</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In the chapter &#x201C;The Director&#x2019;s Director,&#x201D; Sicam and Paredes interview Avellana, who recalls that Do&#xF1;a Sisang asked him, &#x201C;<i>Bakit mo ipapakita sa tao na mahirap sila?</i>&#x201D; (Why show people that they are poor?)."

Eventually, each studio developed and banked on its own specialty genres. Similar to the &ldquo;dream factory&rdquo; of Hollywood, these studios churned out movies regularly, feeding a generation of Filipinos who flocked to the theaters to satisfy their hunger for films that reflected their own tastes and perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Golden Years</em></strong> <i> </i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">is an engaging experience for anyone with an inquisitive mind. Leafing through its 426 pages is like opening a treasure trove of pop trivia: character actor Berting Labra, known for his father-figure roles and stint as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a>&rsquo;s sidekick in <b>bakbakan</b> or action flicks, was once touted as &ldquo;Wonder Boy.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>&rsquo;s satiric <b><i>Si</i></b> <b><i>Juan Tamad </i></b>(Lazy Juan),<i> </i>1947, was promoted as &ldquo;A Laffterpiece,&rdquo; playing on the Filipino penchant for sly puns and coining portmanteau words. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a>, the dapper leading man of Philippine movies, starred in <b><i>Sword of the Avenger</i></b>, 1948, with Hollywood starlet Sigrid Gurie.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea for this book may seem quaint, but it is helpful to remember that there are probably no existing copies of the movies that these ads promoted. In a country where the imperative for film preservation is carried out by an ardent few who have limited resources, these materials could very well be all that we have left of the past. As with all relics, they are remarkable in their own right.

David proposes to mark the beginning of the period with Lino Brocka&rsquo;s resurgence, particularly with his film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, instead of basing it on the establishment of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a> (MPP) in 1976, and to end it with the EDSA Revolt in February 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the closing essay, &ldquo;Ethics First (Rather Than Aesthetics),&rdquo; David recommends formalist and structuralist approaches for local film practice. But in the epilogue, &ldquo;Moving Picture: World&rsquo;s Shortest Prequel,&rdquo; he also offers ways to re-examine the wealth of ideas he presented in the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether he is evaluating <i>masa</i> comedies and melodramas, such as <b><i>Kumander Gringa </i></b>(Commander Gringa), 1988, and <b><i>Nagbabagang <strong>Luha</strong> </i> </b>(Smoldering Tears), 1989, experimental forms like <b><i>Bilanggo sa</i></b><i> <b>Dilim</b></i> (Prisoner in the Dark), 1986, or a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1255\"><strong>Orapronobis</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Fight for Us</i></b>), 1989, David pulls out all the stops with his acerbic wit, masterful command of film theory and cinematic language, regard for history and culture, and passionate faith in cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <b><i>Fields of Vision</i></b>, David invests himself in a variety of critical enterprises and divides them into three parts: &ldquo;Panorama,&rdquo; &ldquo;Viewpoints,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Perspectives.&rdquo; &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; is a lengthy and dense essay that pinpoints the &ldquo;non- or anti-Hollywood influences in local cinema,&rdquo; particularly how and where modifications or differences occurred. One such influence is neorealism, which is exemplified by the works of Italian directors such as Roberto Rossellini (<b><i>Rome, Open City</i></b>, 1945) and Vittorio De Sica (<b><i>The Bicycle Thief</i></b>, 1948). Neorealist films were marked by the primacy of sociopolitical themes, and the practice of using nonprofessional actors, actual locations, reasonable budgets, and basic equipment. Neorealism was perceived as a challenge and a conspicuous departure from the Hollywood model of film production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David points out that when neorealism reached the country in the 1950s, its most prominent proponents were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> Dalita</i></b></a> (<b><i>The Ruins</i></b>), 1956, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\">Gregorio Fernandez</a>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1224\"><strong>Malvarosa</strong></a></i></b>, 1958, who both worked within the local studio system. They were able to exhibit their neorealist tendencies in the so-called prestige products of studios&mdash;films meant for the international festival circuit. In short, even if they took their cues from the European neorealists, they succeeded in creating films that were &ldquo;different&rdquo; in the sense that these works could not have possibly matched the moneymaking ability of surefire hits. Instead, these prestige movies were aimed at earning international awards, citations, or plaudits to boost the studios&rsquo; image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Viewpoints&rdquo; includes works David produced during his &ldquo;comparative reviews&rdquo; days. An example of this practice is &ldquo;Woman-Worthy,&rdquo; David&rsquo;s take on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4650\">Chito Ro&ntilde;o</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kasalanan Bang Sambahin Ka?</i></b> (Is It a Sin to Worship You?), 1990, and Brocka&rsquo;s <b><i>Hahamakin Lahat</i></b> (<b><i>All Be Damned</i></b>), 1990. David uses one critical heading for both films for good reason: they are melodramas with female leads who are unlike the long-suffering, passive Madonnas that Filipinos have gotten used to. Using this genre, Ro&ntilde;o and Brocka get down and dirty&mdash;that is, they explore the desires and pleasures of the so-called bad girls instead. With this critical device, David frees himself to some degree from discussing the specifics of either film, thus leaving him with more room to expound on the generalities of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David&rsquo;s &ldquo;canonizing projects&rdquo; are in &ldquo;Perspectives.&rdquo; An example is his &ldquo;Ten Best&rdquo; survey, which evolved from a group project of sorts during his stint as the secretary of the MPP. He eventually expanded his study and set definite criteria pertaining to data gathering and tabulation and the selection of respondents. His &ldquo;Ten Best&rdquo; lists focus on scholars, directors, critics, and screenwriters, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the third book, <b><i>Wages of Cinema</i></b>, David scrutinizes deconstruction, historiography, postcolonialism, and other trends in Western film discourse in a critical interrogation of Philippine cinema. The book is not so much about the films discussed or film-related trends and developments as much as it is about the conditions that make their existence possible. It is David&rsquo;s attempt to situate or perhaps haul Philippine cinema onto the world stage, if you will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book<i> </i>has three main sections: &ldquo;Subjectivities,&rdquo; &ldquo;Specificities,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sexualities.&rdquo; In a marked departure from the first two books, David also includes foreign films, such as Robert Altman&rsquo;s <b><i>Nashville</i></b>, 1975, Nagisa Oshima&rsquo;s <b><i>In the Realm of the Senses</i></b>, 1976, and R&eacute;gis Wargnier&rsquo;s <b><i>Indochine</i></b>, 1992, as texts for study. These were mostly used in reassessing questions regarding gender, genre and race, structure as well as autobiography, and authorship that the author posed in his earlier writings &ldquo;in the light of how these may best contribute to the interest of Philippine film criticism, production, and viewership.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Ang</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Tolentino</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>/ <em>Publisher:</em> Ateneo de Manila University Press</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book analyzes the media representations of the Philippine nation as well as the cultural politics involved in the formation of the Filipino subject through transnational media. The national, according to Tolentino, refers to the &ldquo;disjunctures, primarily those generated from within, in which the nation&hellip; comes into being and ceaselessly defines itself.&rdquo; While the transnational refers to &ldquo;the contending ways that capital, systems of power and knowledge, cosmopolitanism, urbanity, modernity, and postmodernity are penetrated within the nation&rsquo;s own being.&rdquo; For Tolentino, the critique of power &ldquo;can materialize only by interfacing the national and the transnational.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given this framework, Tolentino offers an evaluation of several texts in the three sections that constitute the book. The first section, &ldquo;National/Transnational Disjuncture,&rdquo; juxtaposes the contending issues in the formation of the nation and the various representations of the Filipina. The first chapter of the section reads into the advertisements of mail-order brides. The second delineates the concept of &ldquo;Inangbayan&rdquo; (Motherland) in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>&rsquo;s political films <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><strong> <strong>Bayan Ko</strong></strong>: Kapit sa Patalim</a> </i></b>(My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge), 1984, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1255\"><strong>Orapronobis</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Fight for Us</i></b>), 1989. And the third locates the place of the &ldquo;Filipino/a&rdquo; in Filipino/a American media arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second section, &ldquo;Colonial and Imperial Localities,&rdquo; evaluates how colonialism and imperialism have penetrated and defined what is national-local. Tolentino analyzes the tensions of nationalisms that exist in Antonio Roman&rsquo;s <b><i>Los Ultimos de Filipinas</i></b><i> </i>(The Last from the Philippines), 1945, which is Spain&rsquo;s attempt at &ldquo;defascistization,&rdquo; at the same time that it stakes a claim on the meaning of the 1896 Philippine Revolution. In the remaining two chapters in this section, he critiques the place of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a> in the rhetoric of First World critical theory, especially in the work of Fredric Jameson, and the negotiation of national subjectivities in the autobiographical films of Kidlat and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final section, &ldquo;Asia Pacific Imaginations,&rdquo; investigates how Filipino subjectivity is &ldquo;produced&rdquo; in Asia Pacific media texts. The first chapter of this section maps the &ldquo;archipelagic space&rdquo; of Philippine cinema vis-&agrave;-vis other Southeast Asian cinemas through a consideration of the omnibus film <b><i>Southern Winds</i></b>, 1992. The second delves into the geopolitical spaces of Chinese city films and how the Filipino is animated in or by these films. The final chapter problematizes the practice of subcontracting labor in the realm of cinema and beyond it, as well as inside and outside of the nation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Patrick Campos</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

It features the following sections: (1) in-depth studies of Philippine cinema, its history, and various aspects; (2) evaluations of popular genre films; (3) critiques of films with &ldquo;artistic vision and integrity,&rdquo; which constitute what the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino (MPP)</a> considers &ldquo;New Cinema&rdquo;; (4) features and portraits of film artists and personalities; (5) the criteria, list of winners, and citations of the annual Gawad Urian;<i> </i>and (6) an exhaustive filmography of the whole decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second volume, <em><strong>The U</strong></em><b><i>rian Anthology, 1980-1989</i></b>, continues where the previous anthology left off. It offers a frame of reference for appreciating Filipino films produced in the equally unstable years of the 1980s, when Benigno Aquino Jr was assassinated and the wave of anti-Marcos protests intensified, when the 1986 EDSA Revolt forced Marcos and his family into exile, and when pockets of the military (unsuccessfullly) staged several coups d&rsquo;&eacute;tat to unseat President Corazon C. Aquino. The volume also covers the establishment of the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third volume, <b><i>The Urian Anthology, 1990-1999</i></b>, gives an account of what may be considered &ldquo;the worst of times, the best of times&rdquo; of Philippine cinema when the film industry celebrated the 75th year of the Filipino film, the 100th year of the first Lumiere films, and the centennial celebrations of the revolution against Spain, the declaration of Philippine independence, and the proclamation of the first Philippine Republic, even as it sunk deeper into unmitigated commercialism and escapism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth volume, <b><i>The Urian Anthology 2000-2009</i></b>, chronicles the rise of &ldquo;the new wave indie films&rdquo; whose coming was hoped for and heralded just before the end of the 20th century and alluded to in the third volume. The volume covers the conditions that gave rise to the indie film, the different producers and artistic styles of the indie film, and the best examples of the indie film from 2005 to the end of the decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Urian anthologies<i> </i>are historically significant in a number of ways. The introductions written by Tiongson, the series editor, altogether provide a history of Philippine cinema, as well as analyses of this cinema&rsquo;s political economy, problems, and artistic highlights, from 1970 to 2009. These are supplemented by essays of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4693\">Agustin L.

The winners of the Gawad Urian eventually exert some form of presence in tentative film canons, and the artists memorialized in the volumes find a place in the ongoing historiography of Philippine film. The photographic illustrations, documents, and filmographies offer a wealth of resources for researchers, scholars, and film enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film essays and reviews demonstrate the various critical frameworks and methodologies employed by the MPP in their readings of film texts.
