He bought himself a fife, and to escape reprimands and whipping, ran away to Pandacan which was then famous for its artists and musicians and where his grandfather, Juan de Dios Abdon, lived. Abdon was sent to Mundong Bulag (Raymundo Fermin) who taught him solfeggio and later to the Ateneo Municipal to be a <b>tiple</b><i> </i>in its choir.

San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan 7 Feb 1893. d. Manila 21 Mar 1934. Composer, pianist, teacher. He was the eldest of the eight children of Valentin Abelardo, a photographer, and Placida Santa Ana, a church singer. He was a cousin of movie director and visual effects artist RichardAbelardo and cinematographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> Abelardo, and nephew to Richard and Bayani&rsquo;s father, scenic painter, JuanAbelardo. In 1917, he married Sixta Naguiat, a <i>taquillera </i>(movie-ticket seller). Their marriage bore six children, two of whom&mdash;Nicanor Jr and Cresencio&mdash;became musicians. His father taught him solfeggio and bandurria<i> </i>when he was five. At six, he could already play <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Tell Overture </i></b>on the guitar. In 1901, at age eight, Abelardo composed &ldquo;Ang Unang Buko&rdquo; (First Bud), a waltz dedicated to his grandmother. The following year, he was brought by his uncle, the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2715\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2715\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2715\"><strong>Juan Abelardo</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, to Manila, where he studied in several primary schools. While working for his uncle, he learned to play the piano, and later studied voice under Italian maestro Enrico Capozzi who refused to be paid for teaching such a talented boy. Upon the recommendation of FranciscoBuencamino, he was hired to play at saloons and cabarets at age 13. After finishing the sixth grade in 1908, Abelardo left Manila and, barely 15, took on a teaching job in barrio schools in San Ildefonso and San Miguel, Bulacan. Soon, Abelardo was invited back to the city by his uncle Juan. To support himself and his young family, he worked as a pianist in pubs and theaters in Manila.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was not until 1916, however, that he decided to study at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music, taking courses under Guy F. Harrison and Robert Schofield. While in UP, he composed &ldquo;UP Beloved,&rdquo; a school hymn which won first prize in an open musical composition contest in 1917. The faculty of the Conservatory instantly noticed his musical ability and, in 1918, he was appointed as assistant instructor in solfeggio and harmony. He became a full-fledged instructor in 1919. He took formal lessons in voice culture under VictorinoCarrion, and piano under JoseEstella. He received his teacher&rsquo;s certificate in science and composition in 1921. In 1922, he took up a postgraduate course at the Conservatory, which he completed in 1923. The following year, he became the head of the composition department of the Conservatory. Early in 1931, he was sent to the Chicago <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> College, where he took courses towards a master&rsquo;s degree. He won the Le Violette scholarship, but came back in 1932 without a degree. He later finished his degree at the National University.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon his return to the Philippines, Abelardo resumed teaching at the Conservatory and ran a boarding school where his students associated with him.

The Abucay Band has existed since 1810. It has been under several <i>recamaderos </i>(owners of bands), the first of whom was known as Apeng Malixi, a resident of Abucay, Bataan. After several years, it was turned over to Tandang Bastian then to another owner Santos Delfin, also a resident of Abucay. The last recamadero to finance and maintain the band around the end of the 19th century was Idrong Pague. Some known conductors and directors of the band since then were Taburio from Orion, Bataan, Lucino Buenaventura of Baliuag, Bulacan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong>Pedro Navarro</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> of Ilocos Sur.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning the 20th century, the band was no longer under any recamadero. Band members grouped themselves into an association (<i>samahan</i>) and elected amongst themselves the manager of the band called <i>encargado.</i> During this time, conductors were David Toribio of Hermosa, Bataan and Narciso Manlapaz of Abucay who was in active duty in the US Navy Band. Manlapaz then transferred the directorship to Mariano B. Danque Sr, a retired US Army musician. During the Japanese occupation, Mariano Danque evacuated to another province and the directorship passed on to Perfecto Adrid, a retired US Navy Band musician from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a> who married a woman from Abucay. After the occupation, a son of Mariano Danque Sr took music courses at the UP Conservatory of Music and consequently graduated with bachelor of music degrees in conducting and composition. Mariano Danque Jr took over the directorship and led the band to new heights, gaining several awards and trophies from concert and parade competitions. The band became known for its performances in civic activities that were sponsored by the Abucay Society. They had given free concerts to the sick and disabled veterans at the Veterans Memorial Hospital and V. Luna Hospital. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rodney D. S.

It is composed of six members: vocalists Juliet, Mercy, and Ken Sunot, keyboardist Stella Pabico, vocalist and lead guitarist Rey Abenoja, bass guitarist Rowena Adriano, and drummer Vilma Goloviogo. Named thus from the two initials of their former band, <b><i>AG Soundtrippers</i></b>, after the managers Abenoja-Galindo, the name was shortened by Alvin de Vera to <b><i>AG</i></b>&rsquo;s, which also tapped into the significance of <i>aegis</i> (protection) as the band has lasted more than a decade where other bands have disbanded due to intrigue and politicking.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The band has released 10 albums in its career, including <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\"><strong>Halik</strong></a></i> </b>(Kiss), 1999, <b><i>Mahal na Mahal Kita</i> </b>(I Love You Very Much), 2000, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> at Pag-Ibig</i></b> (Songs and Love), 2001, <b><i>Paskong-Pasko</i></b> (Christmas All the Way), 2000, and <b><i>Ating Balikan</i></b> (Let&rsquo;s Reminisce), 2002, all of which achieved gold and platinum status. They also produced a collection of remixed hits in <b><i>Ating Sayawin</i></b> (Let&rsquo;s Dance To It), 2004. Their hallmark singles, unmistakable due to the rock opera sound of its female lead vocalists, include &ldquo;Halik&rdquo;<b> </b>and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a>&rdquo; (Tears). The band has had a huge following due to the lovelorn content of their songs whose appeal cuts across gender and class differences and captures the Filipino penchant for melodramatic expressions of romantic love.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2014, the Philippine Educational Theater Association produced <b><i>Rak of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Aegis</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, a musical based on popular Aegis songs, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\"><strong>Liza Magtoto</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3048\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3048\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3048\"><strong>Maribel Legarda</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>.

Lamitan, Basilan 15 Feb 1945. Yakan musician. Near-blind since five years old, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3858\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3858\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3858\"><strong>Uwang Ahadas</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> grew up in a social environment where music is learned intimately and gradually by imitation, particularly in a context where it is best acquired, his family. In the village of Bohe Bessey where Ahadas was born to an <i>imam</i>, instrumental music played in ensemble is important because it fulfills many social functions, one of which can be understood to be fostering social cooperation among villagers that is needed in agricultural labor.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For Yakan people, a common instrument is the <b>kwintangan kayu</b>, an instrument made of five wooden logs hung horizontally, from the shortest to the longest, with the shortest being nearest the ground. It is associated with agricultural activity. It is hung from a beam tied to a tree and played after the planting of rice in the fields as a way of wooing the rice plant (de Leon). Elsewhere in Basilan, kwintangan kayu is played by in a group, with one playing an active rhythmic pattern (a &ldquo;melody&rdquo;) on all five logs, while one, two, or three sticks on the middle log constitutes the steady or drone ostinato. The performative of playing together unmistakably symbolizes social cooperation, a value indispensable in agriculture which cannot be done alone.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This ethos of bridging work and play was the setting for Uwang&rsquo;s early exposure to music. While he and his siblings helped their parents in their work, they learned to play other Yakan instruments in the process. He learned the <b>gabbang</b> (a bamboo xylophone), which also has many performers playing different musical parts. Eventually, he joined ensembles, playing the more popular shared instruments in the region, which are the <b>kwintangan</b> and the most universal of all indigenous Filipino instruments, the <b>agung</b>. In Yakan culture, kwintangan is a woman&rsquo;s instrument, the agung, a man&rsquo;s. When Uwang reached the age of 20, he had already mastered these fundamental Yakan musical instruments.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from performing, Uwang is an exemplary teacher of Yakan music. True to the traditional culture that he knew, his children have been the first recipients of his art. In addition, Uwang&rsquo;s accomplishment as possessing an exceptional technical and artistic mastery of Yakan music had spread beyond his town of Basilan. At present, he is constantly invited to grace civic events. Filled with a vision, he hopes his knowledge of traditional arts will outlive him.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Uwang&rsquo;s teaching style bears essentially the mark of traditional transmission via hands-on imitation. He demonstrates passages, teaching these by example to his students. A caring artist, he is keen in giving his students his full attention. However, worried about the future of his art, his younger brother, Rohas, had thought of documenting his brother&rsquo;s pedagogy by creating a notation system that will simplify the transmission of his music knowledge.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Uwang Ahadas was awarded the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in 2000. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Manila 26 Dec 1954. Singer. Born to Edgardo Alejandro and Aida Toledo, he was a management graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University in 1976. His eldest daughter, Rachel Alejandro, is one of the most talented female singers in the country today.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alejandro formed his own singing group in high school and started singing professionally in 1973 with the Circus Band. In 1976, he launched his solo career with the single &ldquo;Tag-araw, Tag-ulan&rdquo; (Summer Season, Rainy Season), an adaptation of the Bee Gees&rsquo; &ldquo;Charade,&rdquo; flipsided by &ldquo;Panakip-butas&rdquo; (Second Choice). Both songs hit the top of the music charts, and the single became a gold record. It was the beginning of a succession of hits such as &ldquo;Nakapagtataka&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Surprising), &ldquo;KayGandangAtingMusika&rdquo; (How Beautiful is Our Music), and &ldquo;Ang Lahat ng Ito&rsquo;y Para sa Iyo&rdquo; (All This For You). Within a decade, Alejandro came out with seven albums, two of which, <b><i>Hajji </i></b>and <b><i>Strictly OPM</i></b>, received gold record awards.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alejandro&rsquo;s musical talent and personal charm made him the favorite of young female audiences everywhere, especially the collegiate crowd. In 1977, he held a series of campus tours in the capital&rsquo;s major colleges and universities, capped by a successful solo concert at the Folk Arts Theater. He later developed into an all-around artist capable of holding the attention of mature and sophisticated audiences as proven by his well-attended shows in Manila&rsquo;s plush hotels and nightclubs. He also took on lead roles on stage, in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot </i></b>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/155\"><strong>Kapinangan</strong></a></i></b>, original ethnic musicals at the MetropolitanTheater, adaptations of Broadway musicals at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> such as <b><i>The Wiz </i></b>and<b><i> The Fantastiks</i></b>, and in the rock opera ballet <b><i>TalesoftheManuvu</i></b><i>, </i>in 1977.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, Alejandro left for the United States where he lived for five years.

The Band was organized in 1925 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4153\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4153\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4153\"><strong>Hilarion Rubio</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> (later, a professor of composition in the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music) and Felipe Dominguez after the disintegration of the old &ldquo;Bagong Silang&rdquo; Band in Bacoor. Dominguez recruited young boys and Rubio taught them note reading and playing of instruments. Since the beginning, the band never had a solo owner. It gained status and support from donations and contributions from the townspeople. The first persons who volunteered to supply instruments were Ignacio Alagar, Damaso Redondo, Evaristo Concepcion, and Marcelo Miranda. The bulk of the Band&rsquo;s library was donated by Silvino Evangelista, a US Navy musician. Expenses for uniforms and other equipments were shouldered by the parents of the members and avid listeners of the band.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under Rubio&rsquo;s leadership, the band participated in band competitions. Some of the music played as contest pieces in the competitions were <b><i>Il Guarany</i></b>, <b><i>Mignon</i></b>, <b><i>Second Hungarian Rhapsody</i></b>, <b><i>1812 Overture</i></b>, and <b><i>Willam Tell Overture</i></b>. They obtained more prizes in military and fancy drill exhibitions led by their military instructor, Capt Candido S. Burgos.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The band also helped graduating composers in performing their works in UP Conservatory of Music. Felipe Padilla de Leon Sr conducted the band in Villamor Hall (now Supreme Court) when he graduated in composition and conducting. Col Jose M. Campana did the same with the band, which was beneficial to the band members who got trained in the process.

Under the leadership of Elpidio San Pedro, however, it was formally organized upon the acquisition of standard instruments from the defunct Arevalo Band in 1918. Elpidio San Pedro was a fisherman, trader, and musician and father of National Artist for Music Lucio San Pedro. With the instruments, the elder San Pedro gathered 15 persons who comprised the core of a band that was named The Banda Angono Numero Uno. Beginning in 1933, the band was renamed as the Angono Municipal Band, then as the Angono Municipal Symphonic Band. It is now known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3866\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3866\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3866\"><strong>Angono National Symphonic Band</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> (ANSB).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under the tutelage and leadership of Lucio D. San Pedro, ANSB earned much praise for its accomplishments and achievements. It won championships in national band competitions such as the National Band Contest in 1960 and the San Miguel Corporation&rsquo;s Balik-Banda Competition in 1979. Since Lucio San Pedro was a composer, the band did not only perform works of non-Filipino composers, but valuable original band music by San Pedro for many decades. Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s nephew, Manuel S.P. Bautista, then the late Agripino V. Diestro, succeeded him. Presently the band is under the leadership of San Pedro&rsquo;s grandson, Gabrielle S.P. Rojas.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ANSB has continuously mounted regular concerts in the town, while fulfilling its religious functions in lenten ceremonies, fiestas, and the <i>simbang gabi</i> (nine dawn Masses before Christmas) concerts, and other civic activities. In addition, the band has been regularly featured in notable concert series outside Angono, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> in Luneta (now Rizal Park) and <b><i>Puerta Real Evenings</i></b> in Intramuros, Manila. It has been invited to perform in numerous events such as Araw ng Maynila on Jun 24, Independence Day on Jun 12, Rizal Day on Dec 30, and New Year&rsquo;s Eve in December.

They were then known as Salt of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>. Later Aban and Carbon joined the group. They were playing together in a folkhouse in Taft, Manila when they were discovered by Tony Ocampo, general manager of Vicor Records. They initially recorded two singles for the recording company: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/941\"><strong>Masdan Mo ang Kapaligiran</strong></a>&rdquo; (Look at the Environment) and &ldquo;Sayang Ka&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Such a Waste). It was followed by a long-playing album, <b><i>Asin</i></b> (Salt), which was released in 1978. The said album introduced to the listening public the repertoire of Asin songs that are based on the dramatic and ingenious integration of Filipino indigenous music and pop instruments. The group was first managed by Joseph Olaguer, who was succeeded by Dindo Pillora, and later by Ed Formoso. Nonoy Pillora broke his ties with the group in 1986 to concentrate on his painting. Only the trio of Aban, Ba&ntilde;ares and Carbon was left. The group officially disbanded in 1991 after the members decided to pursue separate singing careers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAban concentrated on his group called Grupong Pendong. Lolita Carbon went on to release a cassette featuring the music of her Nene Band. Ba&ntilde;ares continued singing in folkhouses in Marvela, Davao until he was murdered in Apr 1993. Asin had a tour in Canada in Sep 2005 titled <b><i>Konsyerto Para sa Kapayapaan</i></b> (Concert for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a>). The following month, they had farewell concert in Toronto. An open-air and free reunion concert in 2010 was held in Koronadal City as part of South Cotabato&rsquo;s 11th T&rsquo;nalak Festival.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The directions of the group&rsquo;s growth are reflected in such works as &ldquo;Ludima,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lagablab sa Katimugan&rdquo; (Blaze in the South), &ldquo;Mahal Kong Panaginip&rdquo; (Cherished Dream), and &ldquo;Para sa Inyo&rdquo; (For You).

It also aims to preserve and promote Filipino music cultural heritage in the realm of Afro-American jazz. Conceived by Amelita Ramos and John Lesaca in the early 1990s, the AMP has since aspired to confront the challenging issues being faced and experienced by active Filipino working musicians.

With most of the members&rsquo; keen attachment to jazz playing, this objective led to the establishment of the AMP Big Band, with all the members mentioned above as the instrumentalists and Mel Villena as music director. This has become a setting for the musicians to practice their ensemble playing and improvisational skills. As they are able to play music apart from what they perform as session musicians, they have institutionalized themselves as a performance unit, playing in both public and private gigs alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AMP Big Band began performing at Ten 02 (later renamed Skarlet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Kitchen), Myra Ruaro&rsquo;s jazz bar and restaurant in Timog Ave, Quezon City in 2009. When it closed down in 2012, the band continued rehearsing and performing at Tierry Garcia&rsquo;s Balete@Kamias located at Kamias Road in Quezon City. Until the present, this house-turned-into-restaurant has become a venue for jazz music enthusiasts and musicians, student or professional, and for event clients. The gigs have brought AMP their corporate and private event performances and concerts.

Malaybalay, Bukidnon 6 Dec 1953. Guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, arranger, composer, musical director, album producer, film scorer. He is the son of Concordia Villase&ntilde;or, a high school principal, and Leandro Asuncion, a school district supervisor. He is primarily known for his work with the bands Spy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4129\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4129\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4129\"><strong>Pinikpikan</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>yo. Asuncion&rsquo;s father was a musician who played the violin and piccolo. It was from him that Asuncion received his first formal instruction in music. Asuncion actively performed in grade school and high school, playing guitar and singing in various school activities and convocations. In college, he formed a blues band, which did covers of Jimi Hendrix and Santana.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After getting his degree in business management from Ateneo de Cagayan or Xavier University, he left Bukidnon in 1976 to explore the Manila music scene. He then formed the band Southern Blues, playing blues and rock-and-roll in the Manila bars that were popular during that time, such as Hobbit House, Bodega Mabini, Kola House in Kalaw, and My Father&rsquo;s Moustache along M.H. del Pilar St. In 1982, he teamed up with Lolita Carbon and Popong Landero, and they toured all over the Philippines as the trio Lolita and the Sulabama.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jan 1983, Asuncion left Manila and moved to Paris, France, where he had gigs, playing as a solo act in cafes and bars. This eventually led him to collaborate with international musicians, resulting in the group High Hats composed of musicians from Cape Cod and Massachusetts, and the band On The Spot, which he established with French mulatto musical artists.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around this time, Asuncion would often fly back to Manila for short breaks. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> such visit gave birth to Eurasia, dubbed as the &ldquo;first local reggae band&rdquo; in the Philippines. Asuncion did guitar and vocal duties alongside Rico Velez on bass, Pete Canzon on saxophone, and Rene Tengasantos on drums. When Asuncion returned to Europe, Eurasia reshuffled its lineup and eventually became Cocojam.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, Asuncion formed the seminal band Spy with Viennese drummer Fritz Barth and Parisian bassist Maurice Cassanove. Spy played in concerts in France and did a musical tour in Germany, before finally making Manila their permanent home base. They went on to produce five albums: <b><i>Spy by Spy</i></b>,<b> <i>Come on Home</i></b><i>,<b> Reggae Man</b>,<b> Global Unity</b>,<b> </b></i>and <b><i>Cosmic Blah Blah</i></b><i>.<b> </b></i>As of 2014, Spy&rsquo;s new roster of members are Reli de Vera on drums and Louie Talan on bass. Talan also does bass duties for Asuncion&rsquo;s other bands, such as Pinikpikan.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Originally starting as a drum circle in 1989, Pinikpikan eventually evolved into a world music performing group with a full-band setup when Asuncion stepped in. The band played regular gigs in various folkhouses and art spaces, such as 70s Bistro, Penguin, and Verve Room. It also played in major art and music festivals in Baguio, Cebu, and Davao, and represented the Philippines in Cambodia and Singapore.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under Asuncion&rsquo;s tutelage, Pinikpikan garnered five recognitions from the Katha Music Awards in 2000 for their album <b><i>Atas </i></b>(Duty), 1999, and bagged the prize in the categories Album of the Year, Best World Song, Best World Performance, Best World Album, and Best Instrumental Performance. In 2008, Pinikpikan adopted a new name, Kalayo, which means &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The year 2012 saw Asuncion returning to his blues roots, playing guitar for the group Kat Magic Express, which bagged the prize in the First Philippine Blues Competition (PBC) conducted by the Philippine Blues Society. In 2014, Asuncion&rsquo;s new band Glass Cherry Breakers emerged victorious in the 3rd Philippine Blues Competition and was selected to represent the Philippines in the 31st International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee, in Jan 2015. Its members include Maegan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r on vocals, Louie Talan on bass, Niki Cabardo on keyboards, and Boyet Aquino on drums.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As of 2015, Asuncion teaches music at the secondary and tertiary levels at the European International School in Para&ntilde;aque. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byFrancesca Casauay</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong> <b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asuncion 2014; Bello 2008; Caruncho 2013; Colvin 2015; Gargantiel 2012; Hilario 1997; Spy Facebook Page 2014.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

Guitarist, composer, arranger. He was the son of Jose Castro Aves and Anunciacion Torres Yulo. He was married to singer-composer  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4102\"><strong>Grace Nono</strong></a></strong> </strong>. He started tinkering with the piano before picking up the guitar at age twelve. In 1969, he listened to rock-guitarists Jimi Hendrix and John Mclaughlin and then to trumpeter Miles Davis, all of whom became early influences. He attended the University of the Philippines College of Music from 1974 to 1976, then moved to Boston, USA where he studied at the Berklee College of Music majoring in composition. He graduated with a bachelor degree from Berklee in 1979. He was considered a star student in arranging by Herb Pomeroy. He also studied privately with Hugo Norden of Boston Conservatory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in Manila in 1980, he started his career as a guitarist and bandleader of various groups in the pop-rock and smooth-jazz genres, as an arranger for numerous big names in the local music scene, and as a composer of jingles for the advertising industry. After accumulating modest revenues, Aves established a home recording studio and embarked on a long journey of producing local artists in a multitude of genres. His first solo album in 1989, <b><i>Welcome</i></b>, under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r Music, was his initial foray into World Music.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He co-produced a twin album with singer-ethnomusicologist Grace Nono, <b><i>Tao Music </i></b>(Human Music), 1991, which garnered positive reviews for the original arrangement of the traditional song &ldquo;Salidomay,&rdquo; and <b><i>Opo</i></b> (Respecful Yes), 1994, both under the international BMG Record label.

Inspired by indigenous Philippine music patterns like <b>sinulog</b>, <b>binalig</b>, and <b>tangunggo</b>, he learned to play the <b>kudlong</b> (indigenous lute) and <b>octavina</b> (16-fret guitar with short neck), and improvised on compositions influenced by Spanish folk and American jazz traditions. These improvisations culminated in a landmark album called, <b><i>Inner Country</i></b>, 2000, also under BMG records. Two follow-up albums, <b><i>Translating the Gongs</i></b>, 2006, and <b><i>Out of Tradition</i></b>, 2013, established Aves&rsquo; name in the world music genre.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His selected compositions for dance and theater productions include those for  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a></strong> </strong> &rsquo;s: <b><i>Sayao sa Pamlang</i></b>,<b><i> Pangalay</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/92\"><strong>Sagayan</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Kzuduratan</i></b>, <b><i>Kuntao</i></b>, and <b><i><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a></strong> </strong> Holders</i></b>; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/150\"><strong>Indios Bravos</strong></a></i></b> for  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2575\"><strong>Dwight Rodrigazo</strong></a></strong> </strong> &rsquo;s Airdance; and  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\"><strong>Alden Lugnasin</strong></a></strong> </strong> &rsquo;s <b><i>Ulaging</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>for  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong> </strong> </strong>.

Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna 4 Mar 1961. Composer, ethnomusicologist. His early musical exposure was through his father who conducted the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Ba&ntilde;os ROTC band. In his teens, from 1977 to 1983, he joined an underground rock band called Tulisanes (Bandits). He enrolled at UP College of Music, major in composition, in 1977, and finished a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1982. From 1992 to 1994, he did postgraduate studies <i>Aufbaustudium</i> at the Staatliche Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik in Freiburg, Germany. From the bachelor&rsquo;s degree program in UP, he absorbed the avant-garde works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> and Ramon Santos and learned traditional Southeast Asian music such as Kalinga, Maguindanaon, and Javanese gamelan music. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> processes of these traditions are reflected in his own compositions. In Germany, Jonas studied under Mathias Spahlinger. He later enrolled in the PhD Philippine Studies program of UP Diliman and finished the degree in 2004 with a dissertation on the politics of appropriating indigenous Philippine music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baes&rsquo;s music is committed to an alternative concept of art music or &ldquo;new music.&rdquo; He sees composition as a radical, interactive, collaborative process, with flexible instrumentation. This is evident in all his compositions, including a penchant for works in which audiences participate by manipulating non-conventional sound sources. <b><i>Pangtawag</i></b> (Music for Calling People) was performed in a procession around UP Diliman campus in 1981 and employed 50 to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> voices, sound sources such as scrapers and leaves. In 1982, he composed <b><i>Kalipay</i></b> (Happiness), a meditative work for 100 bamboo instruments, 100 voices, with an audience who plugged and unplugged their ears. He composed the work <b><i>Daluy</i></b> (Flow), 1994, a set of five pieces for five percussionists/animators playing bamboo instruments, together with the audience striking pebbles and chanting messages on vital social issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baes&rsquo;s view of the necessary relationship between music and politics has led him to compose music that advocates for the representation and rights of marginalized groups. His research from 1982 to 1987 among the Iraya Mangyan inspired him to compose <b><i>Yayeyunan</i></b> (Melody), 1985, which is for five women&rsquo;s voices and 20 bamboo instruments. In 1983, he composed <b><i>Basbasan</i></b> (Blessing) for 20 bean-pod rattles and 20 men&rsquo;s voices. This was his contribution to a memorial concert honoring the assassination of the returning political exile Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino. During this period, Baes composed and recorded protest songs against the dictatorship. His championing of the Filipino masses is reflected in his piece <b><i>Huntahang-Bayan</i></b> (People&rsquo;s Forum), 1992-93, in which animators and the public discuss social issues through chanting. His song &ldquo;Oyayi&rdquo; (Lullaby) 1993, for female voice and pebbles played by the audience has been performed for various feminist advocacy gatherings. He composed <b><i>Ibo/Ibon</i></b> (Woman/Bird) for dance, with four animators and iron nail chimes distributed among the audience. The concept of distribution, dialogue, exchange, and dialectic is an aspect of his vision for music interaction and this is seen in his work <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/864\"><strong>Banwa</strong></a></i></b> (Nation), 1997, which was inspired by Benedict Anderson&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;imagined community&rdquo; and written for four bamboo scrapers, and other bamboo instruments, 100 bird whistle flutes played by the audience. In the piece <b><i>Wala</i></b> (Nothing), 1997, seven or hundreds of voices play on the opposition and integration of forces. His work <b><i>Balawang-Paikutan</i></b> (Swidden Stamping Poles), 1999, for five dancers, animators, voices, and audience is an allegorical ritual about the death of ancestral lands. His recent works include <b><i>Patangis-Buwaya... And the Crocodile Wept</i></b>, 2003, a ritual improvisation for four bass recorders and four indigenous instruments; <b><i>Aguyoy</i></b> (Gentle Wind), 2005, for hollow woodblock, three <i>buray-dipay</i>, small and large rasps, or <i>tagutok</i>, sticks or tree branches or dried leaves; <b><i>Lisan</i></b> (Leaving), 2007, a soundfilm with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\"><strong>Jerrold Tarog</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, on the plight of the Iraya Mangyan<b><i>; N/REPA, the Mimesis of Spirits</i></b>, 2009, for indigenous flute with wind instruments and audience playing bird-whistles, iron nail chimes, and pair of pebbles; <b><i>InAYTA</i></b> (In Ayta Style), music for sound installation, 2010; <b><i>Dinanggaan </i></b>(Spirit Invocation), 2011, for flute, alto saxophone, tam-tam; <b><i>Gandhing-Ni-Napi</i></b> (Napi&rsquo;s Lament), 2011, for suspended Maguindanaon <b>gandingan</b>, five trombones, five tam-tams, and audience, again plugging and unplugging their ears and playing iron-nail chimes; <b><i>Babandir</i></b> (hanging gong with narrow rim), 2012, for diverse percussion instruments; and <b><i>Gita&rsquo;a</i></b> (Dissolution) for broken guitar and audience using crumpled plastic cups and empty water bottles, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a scholar, Baes has published in international journals such as <b><i>Ethnomusicology</i></b>, 1987, the <b><i>International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music</i></b>, 1989, <b><i>Perfect Beat</i></b>, 1998, and the <b><i>Journal of Intercultural Studies</i></b>, 2001.

Banda Cabiao was originally organized during the later part of the Spanish era. It is said that the band rules were so strict at that time that a member who failed to rehearse without sufficient excuse would be put in prison by the <i>guardia civil </i>(local police). At the start of the revolution in 1896, Gen Mariano Llanera invaded Factoria, now San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. Some of his men were band members, one of whom was Juan Lapuz, a bass drum player. It was at this time that Banda Cabiao members went in disarray and only 11 members remained, including Lapuz himself. He bravely continued to lead the band, which he initially named Juan de la Cruz Cabiao Band. Eventually, it became known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3889\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3889\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3889\"><strong>Banda Cabiao 11</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> to commemorate the 11 men who remained in the original Banda Cabiao. Up to the present time, the band has been continuously managed by the Lapuz family in Cabiao. Today, it is directed by Camilo Lapuz, a trombone teacher who once taught at the University of the Philippines College of Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other members who went on strike during the revolution formed their own band and named it Banda Cabiao 96. This name commemorated the gallantry and heroism of the pioneer members of the band. This band led the parade in Nueva Ecija during the revolution that caused the downfall of the Spanish government. The leadership and supervision of this band was inherited by Dominador Nogoy who guided the band in winning the Plaza Miranda Certamen Band Competition in 4 Jul 1952 and the National Band Contest at the Quirino Grandstand, Rizal Park in 1961. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRodney D.

This band was formerly associated with Banda Taytay, founded 1875, until the latter disbanded in the 1900s, forming two separate bands in Taytay, Rizal. The Banda Uno also known as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3893\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3893\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3893\"><strong>Banda Matanda</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; retains its name up to the present day, being the oldest band in the town. It consists mostly of non-Catholic and Protestant members, while the Banda Dos Bata or &ldquo;Banda Makapare&rdquo; was formerly under the supervision of the local parochial church. Composed of a group of relatives and friends, the management of Banda Dos was passed on to the younger generation of members. Among the members of the band who took the responsibility of training and instructing their youthful relatives were Pedro Cruz, Crispin Velasco, and German Tamayo. At its establishment in 1905, funding made the development of Banda Dos possible through the initiative of the former parish priest of Taytay, Fr Valentin Tanyag. He was responsible for providing and re-supplying the band with musical instruments which he bought from the disbanded Meralco Brass Band. In the 1950s, MSgt Felix de Leon, a former member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, became the maestro of Banda Dos Bata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1953, a huge band organization in the country known as the Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas (PASAMBAP) was established under the leadership of Felipe Padilla de Leon Sr. This organization aimed to unite local bands and to promote good band music, seeking to eliminate the &ldquo;show off&rdquo; competition called <i>tambakan</i>. The Banda Dos Bata was one of the 77 band members of the PASAMBAP that has been actively participating in the group&rsquo;s various activities such as National Concert Exhibition in 1954 and National Band contest in 1956 (de Leon 1966, 45). In 1957, Alfredo Villanueva Sr became the conductor of the Banda Dos Bata. The band garnered highest recognition by winning the National Championship under the baton of Felix De Leon in 1958 and in the National <b><i>Balik Banda</i></b> Championship under the baton of Alfredo Villanueva Sr in 1980. The latter event was organized by the San Miguel Corporation beginning in 1978, in cooperation with PASAMBAP as a program to revive and revitalize band music (Hila 1994, 137). In 1982, the late second-generation member of Banda Dos, Alfredo Villanueva Sr, was appointed vice-president for Promotions in the PASAMBAP administration. In this position, while leading the numerous community band members of PASAMBAP scattered in different regions throughout Philippines, Villanueva Sr helped Banda Dos members manage a wide variety of band activities. These included annual band festivals, seminars, workshops, and clinics that focused on band conducting and band management. Villanueva Sr&rsquo;s notable contributions to the improvement of band management in the country gave him prominence and made him a model and inspiration to the younger musicians of Banda Dos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recognizing band music as a legitimate form of artistic expression and wishing to bring band music to wide national attention, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) organized and sponsored the series of <b><i>Serenata ng mga Banda</i></b> which began in 1987.

BKP is a bamboo music ensemble based in the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Santa Mesa, Manila until 2013 after which it was registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The group had its first performance on 19 Dec 1973 in the Christmas party of the Philippine College of Commerce (PCC), which later became PUP. This was organized by the then principal of the school, Gloria R. Talastas, and by then professor of the same institution, Siegfredo B. Calabig, who has been its composer, arranger, trainer, and instrument maker. Instruments of the BKP are made of indigenous materials, mainly bamboo and narra. The ensemble consists of marimba, <b>lira gabbang</b>, <b>bumbong</b>, panpipes, and angklung. Other instruments, also made by Calabig, are the <b>kalagong</b>,<i> </i><b>kalatok</b>, and <b>kalavien</b>, so named to carry the first two syllables of the instrument maker&rsquo;s surname, &ldquo;kala.&rdquo; The group is now under the artistic direction of Rossini Calabig, the eldest son of Siegfred. Rossini has also assisted his father in the construction of instruments.

In 1888, Don Catalino Arnaldo, a prosperous resident of San Francisco de Malabon Grande now known as General Trias Cavite, formed the Banda San Francisco de Malabon Grande. He bought the instruments and, with the help of his friends &ldquo;Onofre&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jorge,&rdquo; took care of teaching music to the town&rsquo;s residents who had the musical inclination for it. Some of the original members were Ambrocio Clanor, Meliton Aroy, Salyo Batulan, Eustaquio Closas, Policarpio Culabutan, Clado Guinchoma, Anastacio Mota, Joaquin Pabalan, Antonio Poblete, Lucio Poblete, Raymundo Presa, and Candido de los Santos. During the Spanish-American war in 1898, a Filipino revolutionary named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\"><strong>Julian Felipe</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> migrated to San Francisco de Malabon Grande and stayed at the house of Gen Mariano Trias, a member of the secret revolutionary organization called Katipunan. Julian Felipe was a pianist and composer and he was introduced to Gen Emilio Aguinaldo in a meeting of the Katipunan. He was instructed to compose a march that would be the counterpart of the Spanish Royal March. Felipe did and after it was approved, he immediately arranged and taught it to the Banda San Francisco de Malabon Grande. The music was variously called <b><i>Himno Nacional Filipino</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a> Filipina Magdalo</i></b>, <b><i>Marcha Magdalo</i></b>, and <b><i>Aguinaldo March</i></b>. On 12 Jun 1898, Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence from Spain and unfurled the revolutionary flag before the public in Kawit, Cavite. It was then that the Banda San Francisco de Malabon Grande played for the first time the march that became the Philippine National Anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Don Catalino Arnaldo died, the leadership was passed on to his son Emilio Arnaldo, then subsequently to Crispulo Arnaldo with the help of Engracio Clamor and Hilario Clanor. In 1921, a brewing conflict between Clamor and Clanor resulted in a split, despite the mediation of Crispulo Arnaldo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Engracio Clamor founded a band called Banda Beteranos, now known as the Banda Kabataan. Hilario Clanor continued to lead the Banda San Francisco de Malabon Grande, now known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3893\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3893\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3893\"><strong>Banda Matanda</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>. The latter band became popular and played in the provinces of Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Laguna, Batangas, and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1931, Delfin Asercion, a retired US Navy, took over the supervision of the band from Hilario Clanor. Delfin later passed it on to fellow US Navy, Manuel Asercion. Some members of the band, namely, Diosdado Nocon Rios, Danilo Sotto, Diosdado Palompo and David Poblete proceeded to study at the Conservatory of Music of the University of the Philippines (UP) to help in further development of the band. Other members followed, including Eliseo Clamor who later not only taught at the UP College of Music but also became Director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4206\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4206\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4206\"><strong>UP ROTC Band</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>. Another notable member of the band was Agapito Afortunado who was a clarinet lecturer in UP and at the same time a member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>. Because of the band&rsquo;s tradition of excellence in music, many of the members joined the US Navy and US Army Bands, Armed Forces of the Philippines Bands, Dance Bands and Symphony Orchestra. Other members like Isidro and Merofe Leano founded their own dance orchestra named Roy Leano Fil-American Orchestra in San Francisco, California. Many of them also became members of the US Navy concert and ceremonial band in Washington DC, including Rodrigo Mugol, Oscar Mugol, Rogelio Palompo, Wally Mugol, Diosdado Buan, and Norberto Clanor. Notable members from Gen Trias include Albert Asercion, a clarinet player, who became the first Filipino instructor at the US Navy School of Music in Norfolk, Virginia; Diosdado Palompo who became the Band Master of Subic Bay US Navy Band; and David Poblete who became Assistant Band Master of the 7th Fleet US Navy Band. In 1964, the Banda Matanda Foundation was formed under the leadership of Crispulo Arnaldo and Delfin Asercion with Merofe Leano as its first President.From 1888 up to the present time, Banda Matanda has displayed a strong sense of culture and excellence in band music. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by</em></strong> <em><strong>Rodney D.

The ownership changed hands in 1935 when Maximiano Feliciano Sr bought it.

His wife Julia Feliciano took over its management with the help of her eldest sons Junior and Roberto, who were at that time young members of the band. It was in 1956 when Amando San Jose of Banda Ocho of Cardona, Rizal took pains in training the band. In his first stint as conductor, San Jose greatly improved the quality of the band&rsquo;s performance for the ensuing three decades. Starting in 1983, San Jose gradually relinquished the directorship to Arnel Feliciano, who was then studying at the University of the Philippines College of Music. Arnel is a third generation member of the Feliciano family whose patriarch is Maximiano, the founder of the band.

The band was founded in 1870 by a town musician named Pedro Mercado, becoming its first <i>recamadero </i>(owner) and <i>encargado </i>(manager). They started out as a handful of players but gradually increased its membership to serve the town of Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija. Due to financial difficulties, the band declined but the arrival of Fr Teodoro Parada, the town&rsquo;s parish priest fondly known as Pari<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>basa who was a music lover, reactivated the band. He hired a certain musician known as Maestrong<i> </i>Pepe<i> </i>to teach and conduct the band. Under his tutorship, together with Fr Parada&rsquo;s financial support, the band made tremendous progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1888, Apolinar Bernabe, a native of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> who was a prolific composer and expert cornet player who married a Penaranda woman, became the band&rsquo;s maestro or bandleader. Under his leadership, the band was very much in demand. Then came a time when the band split into two: &ldquo;Banda Kabataan&rdquo; (<i>hulo</i>)<i> </i>composed of young players and &ldquo;Banda Pagkakaisa&rdquo; (<i>liwasan</i>)<i> </i>composed of senior members. The intense rivalry between them resulted in improved playing thus gaining their popularity in many places in Luzon, especially during fiestas and other occasions. However, the constant feuding also had a divisive effect in the town of Pe&ntilde;aranda itself. Realizing this problem, Felipe Padilla de Leon, then a student at the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music, united the two groups. On Rizal Day 30 Dec 1935, the Pe&ntilde;aranda Band played as a unified group and gave a concert at the town plaza under the baton of the young de Leon. From then on, de Leon became the band&rsquo;s conductor until the outbreak of World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war, Felipe Padila de Leon became occupied with his teaching duties and other activities in Manila. He entrusted the band to Felicisimo Padilla, one of the more senior and experienced members of the band. Through his untiring efforts, Padilla became instrumental in sustaining the band&rsquo;s mission of making music in public ceremonies.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by</em></strong> <em><strong>Rodney D.

The trio was originally formed in 1975 so that the siblings could participate in the Battle of the Bands contest. The group pioneered in socially relevant songs, with lyrics written in the vernacular and which tackled pressing social issues during the Martial Law era. The term &ldquo;banyuhay&rdquo;<i> </i>is short for &ldquo;bagong anyo ng buhay,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;new form of life&rdquo; or &ldquo;metamorphosis.&rdquo; The group was widely recognized as one of the bands that shifted the attention from foreign to local artists in the Philippine music industry. Heber is credited as songwriter, rhythm guitarist, and vocalist, with Levi on lead guitar, and Jesse on bass and backup vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1976, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> released their first single &ldquo;Buhay Pinoy&rdquo; (Filipino Life) under Dyna Records.

The group took a break in 1982 so Heber could focus on his painting and teaching career, and they returned to the scene three years later with the independently released <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>mansi sa Sugat</i></b><i> </i>(Calamansi on the Wound), 1985, which was later distributed by Alpha Records.

The most successful of these incarnations would be the &ldquo;Top Three&rdquo; featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4757\"><strong>Apeng Daldal</strong></a> aka Seraphin Gabriel, Bebeng Dahilan aka Bebeng Samson, and Mar Reklamo aka Mar Lopez. It was entertainment impresario, Lou Salvador, who provided the group with their funny aliases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1962, Boy Sullivan, one-time professional boxer and singer-comic co-performer with Mar Lopez, was convicted of murder and meted a punishment of 8-20 years imprisonment in the Muntinlupa Penitentiary. Mar Lopez decided to pay frequent visits to his friend, Sullivan, and they ended up performing for the prisoners. Word of their entertainment abilities spread throughout the prison facility, prompting the authorities to recognize the goodwill potential of the duo and to arrange for them to sing for other prisoners. Incarcerated only four years, Boy Sullivan was released from prison for good behavior. Mar Lopez then officially formed D&rsquo; Big Three Sullivans naming it after Boy (guitar/vocals) and adding Ding Arraza (guitar/vocals) to the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">1966 was the year they produced their first hit, &ldquo;Aswang&rdquo; (Vampire) under Los Compadres Records. Entertainment promoters took notice of their popularity and performance bookings grew, leading to performance contracts abroad. They toured Japan for about a year, performing in the provinces of Okinawa, Kagoshima, and Hokkaido.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later, D&rsquo; Big Three Sullivans joined the Philippine Constabulary&rsquo;s Special Services in Camp Crame in the 1970s. This office opened doors for them to perform for audiences all over the Philippines, giving goodwill performances for servicemen and civilians alike. It was at this time that their song &ldquo;May Pulis sa Ilalim ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\"><strong>Tulay</strong></a>&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s a Policeman Under the Bridge), inspired by the melody of a Japanese folk song, became a big hit. Two other versions of this song are &ldquo;May Puno sa Ilalim ng Dagat&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s a Tree Under the Sea) and &ldquo;May Tao sa Ilalim ng Kubo&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s Someone Under the Hut).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The trio was also a mainstay of the <b><i>Hatid Saya</i></b> program, a government program which exported local entertainers to perform for Filipino communities abroad, such as Filipino contract workers in the Middle East and immigrant Filipinos in the United States and Canada. All told, the trio has visited and performed in 36 countries including China and Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">D&rsquo; Big Three Sullivans produced several novelty hits, a sampling of which includes &ldquo;Inday Palayasin Kita&rdquo; (Inday, I&rsquo;ll Send You Away), &ldquo;Kaning Baboy&rdquo; (Pig Slop), &ldquo;Nagbomba si Candida&rdquo; (Candida Goes Nude), &ldquo;War Kami ng Misis Ko&rdquo; (Me and My Wife Have a Fight), &ldquo;Karanasan&rdquo; (Experience), &ldquo;Ang Gusto Ko&rsquo;y Hot Pandesal&rdquo; (I Like Hot Buns), &ldquo;Manugang At Biyenan&rdquo; (Son-in-Law and Mother-in-Law), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng Palaka&rdquo; (Frog&rsquo;s Song), and &ldquo;Para Kang si Tarzan&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Like Tarzan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another spin-off from the D&rsquo; Big Three Sullivans is Tatlong Pinoy, a comedy singing trio established in 1979 featuring Ilokano, Visayan, and Tagalog songs. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Jose Valenciano</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The Casa San Miguel was turned into a community-based arts center that promotes classical arts and music to the rural people of Zambales, i.e., to children of farmers, fishermen, tricycle drivers, and other people interested in arts, and educates them to become highly skilled artists. The children meet every weekend to do lessons in the violin, viola, cello; to draw and paint; to make puppets for shadow play vignettes; and to act, direct or dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To promote the artists and bring culture to the countryside, Bolipata organized the yearly musical event called the Pundaquit Festival in Brgy Pundaquit since Mar 1994.

Pandacan, Manila 27 Jun 1854. d. Pandacan, Manila 28 Mar 1908. Conductor, contrabass player, teacher, composer. LadislaoBonus was born to poor parents, Pedro Bonus and Maria Mariano. He married Rosalia Guazon with whom he had eight children. Due to poverty, he had no formal regular music education except for a few lessons from Gregorio de Luna. Bonus studied by himself and learned to play the contrabass, flute, cello, guitar, violin, and other instruments. He became an expert contrabass player and found a job as such in orchestras hired by foreign opera companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical atmosphere of Pandacan, then known as the &ldquo;Venice of the Philippines,&rdquo; stimulated his talents. Bonus learned opera production through observation of visiting opera company performances. In 1887, he established an all-Filipino opera company. It debuted in the same year with Donizetti&rsquo;s <b><i>Lucrezia Borgia</i></b>, and presented other operas such as <b><i>Linda di Chamounix</i></b>,<b><i> La Traviata</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor</i></b>, and <b><i>Fra Diavolo</i></b>. Next to the opera company, another musical group in Pandacan which he directed won general admiration&mdash;the Orquesta Feminina de Pandacan founded in 1890 by Raymundo Fermin. He also conducted the Marikina Orchestra owned by the landowner Jose Tuason, the celebrated Pasig Band of Rizal, and the Arevalo Band of Quiapo, Manila. In 1903, the Arevalo Band, then at the height of its fame, was sent to the Regional Exposition in Hanoi, Vietnam, and won first prize in the international band competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bonus was also a composer. Three of his popular compositions were the &ldquo;Triumphal March,&rdquo; dedicated to the First Philippine Assembly; &ldquo;Pasodoble Hanoi,&rdquo; dedicated to the Hanoi International Exposition; and &ldquo;Los Diputados&rdquo; (The Representatives), dedicated to the members of the Philippine Assembly. He also composed the music of two <b>sarsuwela</b>, <b><i>Unang Pag-ibig </i></b>(First Love) and <b><i>Buhay ng Lasing </i></b>(A Drunkard&rsquo;s Life). &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s a la Patria&rdquo; (Memories of My Land) was composed as a result of JoseRizal&rsquo;s request for him to compose the music for &ldquo;Canto de Maria Clara&rdquo; (Song of Maria Clara), a poem that appeared in one of the chapters of Rizal&rsquo;s novel <b><i>NoliMeTangere </i></b>(Touch Me Not). Bonus&rsquo; major work was the first Filipino opera <b><i>SangdugongPanaguinip</i></b>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), 1902, based on the libretto written in Spanish by PedroPaterno and translated into Tagalog by RomanReyes. For this he has been called the &ldquo;Father of Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>.&rdquo; His birthplace along San Luis Street in Pandacan was marked on 21 Nov 2014.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

Cebu City 10 Oct 1879. d. Manila 1945. Pianist, composer, and <b>bodabil</b> impresario. Borromeo was one of the 16 children of Juan Borromeo and Paulina Veloso. He studied piano with his father, and attended the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos in Cebu City and University of Santo Tomas in Manila, where he studied pharmacy. He married Clemencia Atillo in 1905. After her early death, Borromeo left for the United States in Sep 1914.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In San Francisco, Borromeo&rsquo;s piano skills caught the attention of impresario Eugene D&rsquo;Avigneau, who featured Borromeo alongside two American-born Chinese entertainers in the trio &ldquo;D&rsquo;Avigneau&rsquo;s Celestials.&rdquo; In 1916, this group began touring the United States and Canada on the Keith vaudeville circuit. Between 1920 and 1921, Borromeo also published four songs with American publishers, the first of which, &ldquo;My Beautiful Philippines,&rdquo; was made into a piano roll (Walsh 2013, 250). Borromeo returned to the Philippines in Apr 1921 upon hearing news of a parent&rsquo;s illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Borromeo intended to return to the United States with a large Filipino vaudeville troupe but decided instead to remain in Manila. In Sep 1921, he performed the first of his &ldquo;vod-a-vil&rdquo; shows and began a four-year residency of popular weekly performances at Manila&rsquo;s Olympic Stadium. Throughout the 1920s he also appeared occasionally in other Manila venues and took his troupe on yearly tours of the Visayas, Mindanao, and Sulu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Borromeo was widely celebrated for discovering, developing, and promoting local Filipino talent. His shows featured dozens of famous performers, such as Catalina &ldquo;Katy&rdquo; de la Cruz, Dionisia &ldquo;Toy Toy&rdquo; Castro/Moncado, Canuto &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\"><strong>Canuplin</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; Francia, and Honorata &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a>&rdquo; de la Rama. While both vaudeville and jazz were well-established in the Philippines before 1921, Borromeo&rsquo;s &ldquo;vod-a-vil&rdquo; was important in featuring a mix of local genres and American popular songs. His blend of Spanish, English, and Tagalog songs, dances, topical comedic routines, and everything from juggling to boxing tricks influenced the rise of other Filipino vaudeville troupes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While rheumatism began hampering his ability to perform in the 1930s, Borromeo continued composing, creating over 40 musical pieces in a wide range of styles, including sacred pieces, tangos, fox-trots, and patriotic anthems. He worked with lyricists such as Manuel Bernabe, Flavio Zaragoza Cano, Jose Hernandez Gavira, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\"><strong>Amado V.

They had five children and remained in Manila through World War II. Borromeo died in Manila of an undetermined illness in 1945 and is buried in the Borromeo-Veloso family tomb at the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Cebu.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Frederick J.

According to reliable sources, the band took active part in the revolution of 1896. Led by Lucino Buenaventura, it formed part of the army contingent that was sent to the battle of Malabon. It is believed that it was during this time that Buenaventura composed his stirring military march titled &ldquo;Katagalugan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the turn of the century when Lucino Buenaventura of Lucban, Quezon (then Tayabas) married Leocadia Ramirez of Baliuag, Bulacan, the band developed into one of the best musical organizations of the province.

San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan 5 Nov 1883. d. 16 Oct 1952. Composer. He was the sixth of 10 children of Fortunato Buencamino, a church organist and bandmaster, and Luisa Beltran, a singer. He was married to Pilar Luce&ntilde;o. They had two children, both of whom also took up music. His son, Francisco Jr, was a successful film scorer. Pianist CecileLicad is his grand niece while composers WillyCruz, LorrieIlustre, and  <strong><strong> <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4307\"><strong>Nonong Buencamino</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong>, and actor NonieBuencamino are his grand nephews. He first learned music from his father, and at age 12, he could play the organ. At 14, he was sent to study at the Liceo de Manila, where he took up courses in composition and harmony under MarceloAdonay and pianoforte under a Spanish music teacher. However, he did not finish his education, for he had taken an interest in the <b>sarsuwela</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1900s, Buencamino taught music at the Ateneo de Manila and at the Centro Escolar de Se&ntilde;oritas. While at the Centro, he founded the Conservatory of Music, heading it until 1938. At the same time he was handling music lessons at the Liceo de Manila. In 1930, he founded the Buencamino Music Academy, which was authorized by the Department of Public Instruction to grant music degrees. Some of his pupils were NicanorS.Abelardo, ErnestinaCrisologo, Estela Velasco, Beatrice Alba, and Amelia Hilado. In the 1940s, he started working as musical director, also composing music for films produced by  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a></strong> </strong> Pictures, LVN, and Excelsior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Buencamino was also a musical director for sarsuwela productions together with BonifacioAbdon, and for a time acted frequently onstage. Apart from this, he collaborated on the plays written and produced by AurelioTolentino. Buencamino established Philippine Music Publishers, which undertook the printing of his more important compositions, but this venture was not successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the sarsuwela he wrote were: <b><i>Marcela</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1904; <b><i>Si Tio Selo </i></b>(Uncle Selo), 1904; <b><i>Yayang</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1905; and <b><i>Pangakong Hindi Natupad </i></b>(Broken Promise), 1905. In 1908, when the popularity of the sarsuwela started to wane because of American repression and the entry of the silent movies, Buencamino turned to composing <b>kundiman</b>.<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> early composition was &ldquo;En el bello Oriente&rdquo; (In the Beautiful Orient), 1909, which uses JoseRizal&rsquo;s lyrics. His famous kundiman, &ldquo;Ang Una Kong Pag-ibig&rdquo; (My First Love), was inspired by his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1938, he composed <b><i>Daughters of Bathala</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>an epic poem which won a prize from the Far Eastern University (FEU) during one of the annual carnivals. In 1943, he began work on <b><i>Mayon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> </i></b>which is considered his magnum opus. It was finished in Nov 1948 and had a full rendition in Feb 1950 at the graduation recital of Rosario Buencamino at Holy Ghost College.

Her parents are Mayo Mamendeg and Madaya Abu. As is usual in oral cultures, Aga Mayo learned music by imitation at an early age. After graduating from Cotabato Public High School in 1962, she enrolled in the bachelor of science in education program of Arellano University, which she finished in 1968. Upon graduation, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> took her to teach at the Department of Asian Music (now called Department of Musicology) of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music. This was an important milestone in the teaching of music at the tertiary level in the country. Through Maceda and Butocan, <b>kulintangan</b> music has since then been studied as a translocal tradition by non-Maguindanao in a formal educational setting. Butocan&rsquo;s teaching stint in UP was later emulated by the University of Washington Seattle, which graduated other Muslim musicians like Usopay Cadar and Danongan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>nduyan who spread the tradition in a transnational context.

This has engendered controversies in the academe because traditional learning of the instrument is done through imitation and copying as exemplified by her own experience. The notation system, developed during the time of Jose Maceda as chair of the Department of Music Research (now Department of Musicology), proved to be helpful and beneficial to those who have been trained in Western music. Felicidad Prudente and Kristina Benitez later helped Butocan publish her kulintang method booklet titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1043\"><strong>Palabunibunyan</strong></a></i></b><i>:<b> A Repertoire of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Pieces for the Maguindanaon Kulintangan</b></i>,<b> </b>Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, 1987.

Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna 6 Aug 1860. d. 18 Jul 1938. Music essayist and guitarist. He was the son of smith and watchmaker, Fernando Guevara Canon Faustino and landowner Blasa Alumna Salvador. He was a close friend of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, having been his townmate and later classmate at Ateneo Municipal where Canon graduated with a <i>bacchiler en artes</i> (bachelor of arts) in 1876.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like the children of wealthy families during his time, Fernando studied in Madrid beginning 1877 and later became part of the group of Filipino <i>ilustrado</i> (educated) propagandists in Spain. He contributed a few articles in the newspaper <b><i>La Solidaridad </i></b>which was published by a printing press believed to have been supported by the Barcelona banker Ramon Battle y Serra whose daughter Teresa Battle became Fernando&rsquo;s wife in 1887. It was in 1888, during Fernando&rsquo;s return to Manila with his wife Teresa, supposedly on a &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; to avoid suspicion of the authorities, that 20 copies of the first edition of Rizal&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></i></b> were smuggled into the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After seven months in the Philippines in 1888, Canon and his wife returned to Barcelona where Canon got his degree in electrical engineering. Canon furthered his studies in Munich, in Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and in Paris, where he met Rizal sometime in 1892, together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\"><strong>Antonio Luna</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> (Jose 1972, 97). This was the last time Canon met Rizal, for Canon was in Barcelona when Rizal was executed in Dec 1896.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1898, Canon, together with his friend Antonio Luna, joined Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Philippine revolutionary army and served as an engineer in Malolos before the capital was captured by the Americans. Canon then was assigned to Nueva Vizcaya as comandante politico-militar but was captured by the Americans. Thereafter he was released from prison, returned to Spain, and worked as instructor in polytechnics in Barcelona. In 1906, his wife Teresa immortalized the friendship of her husband Canon with Rizal in piano variations based on the theme of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a> Nacional Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Canon returned to the Philippines beginning 1908 and accepted a position in the Bureau of Public Works and at the same time taught at the Liceo de Manila and Escuela de Ingeniera y Arquitectura de Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1910 and in 1914, Canon contributed essays on Philippine music, the first on &ldquo;Kuriapi&rdquo; (two-stringed Southeast Asian lute) and the second on &ldquo;Cundiman,&rdquo; both of which appeared in <b><i>Cultura Filipina</i></b>. These articles are literary, but they are significant for having been written in a time when culture was used as a weapon in asserting a sovereign Filipino nation in the midst of American colonial occupation. Canon wrote poetry, a skill he shared with Rizal and which he acquired since his early education in Ateneo. He penned a sonnet titled &ldquo;A las Dalagas Malolenses&rdquo; (To the Young Women of Malolos), published under his pen name &ldquo;Kuitib&rdquo; in the 15 Mar 1889 issue of <b><i>La Solidaridad</i></b><i>,</i> which was dedicated to the 20 ladies who petitioned Gov Valeriano Weyler for a school.

When Guevara was transferred to the Quiapo Church, Carrion went with him. He became the cantor of the Quiapo Church choir, under the baton of NatalioMata, and achieved renown for the high pitch and quality of his voice. He also sang in novenas,<i> rosario</i> (rosary), or <i>misa cantadas </i>(high masses), celebrated in Manila churches and neighboring provinces, and with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> choir under the direction of Blas Echegoyen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carrion used to perform minor parts in operas produced by visiting foreign companies, until he joined the Chananay dramatic troupe and played the role of Manrico in <b><i>Il Trovatore</i></b>.

Quiapo, Manila 6 Mar 1872. d. Quiapo 9 May 1935. Singer, teacher. He is the fifth of 11 children of BalbinoCarrion, tenor and cantor of Quiapo church, and of Basilia Jose, a gilder. He was born on Callejon Templanza, near the church where he sang from boyhood until his death. He married Agatona Trinidad in 1896. They had six children. Carrion studied for free at the Ateneo Municipal. He sang as <i>tiple </i>(soprano voice) at the Ateneo masses. He learned to play the guitar from beggars, and later the mandolin and the bandurria. After singing as tiple in the Quiapo choir, he was taught solfeggio by its director NatalioMata, and later the piano by ManuelMata, the church organist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carrion made his theatrical debut singing the last scene in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor </i></b>with NemesioRatiaJr at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Cervantes. Soon, he appeared with Ratia in the Spanish zarzuela, <b><i>Una vieja </i></b>(An Old Woman), and in others with YeyengFernandez and JoseCarvajal. He played Tenyong in <b><i>WalangSugat </i></b>(No Wounds) at the TeatroZorrilla in 1902. He joined the GranCompa&ntilde;iadelaZarzuelaTagala of SeverinoReyes, with which he toured for three years, just as his father had done with the Chananay troupe. It was during this time that he achieved prominence as a <b>sarsuwela</b> performer, sharing stellar billing with MariaCarpena or Estanislawa San Miguel, both of whom he had partnered in sarsuwela like <b><i>Minda Mora</i></b>, <b><i>AngKalupi </i></b>(The Wallet), <b><i>Filipinas para los Filipinos </i></b>(Philippines for the Filipinos), <b><i>Filotea</i></b>,<b><i> Lukso ng Dugo </i></b>(Leap of Blood), and <b><i>La venta de Filipinas al Japon </i></b>(The Sale of the Philippines to Japan). He last sang in 1919 in PatricioMariano&rsquo;s <b><i>Deni</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After performing on the sarsuwela stage, his interest shifted to the opera. In 1909, upon Sylvia Lanzi&rsquo;s invitation, he sang with her in the opera <b><i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i></b>. Up to 1912, he was active in the opera scene, essaying such coveted roles as Manrico in <b><i>Il Trovatore</i></b>, Turridu in <b><i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i></b>, and a part in Gounod&rsquo;s <b><i>Faust</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1905, he opened the Escuela de Canto, a singing school, where the ordinary student paid six pesos a month; the middle class, 12; the well-to-do, 24; and the talented poor, nothing. Although he continued performing in well-known operas, he provided his students opportunities to perform. In 1923, his students debuted in Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>Requiem </i></b>at the ManilaGrand<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>House, among whom were JoseMossesgeldSantiago-Font, MercedesMatias, NeliaManalo, Jose Barredo, and others.

He is a National Artist for music and literature. He was born in Tondo, Manila on 30 Apr 1910. He died in Quezon City on 2 Apr 2002. He was the son of Cornelio Cruz, a native of Baliuag, Bulacan and Juliana Celerio of San Pablo, Laguna. He grew up in the slums of Tondo and went to the public elementary school there. At age 11, he started taking violin lessons from a Philippine Constabulary (PC) musician and became a member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4121\">PC Band</a> while attending classes at Torres High School. He finished two semesters of violin at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>, then director of the Conservatory, recommended him for a scholarship at the Academy of Music of Manila and also made it possible for him to become the youngest member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a>. However, a fall from a tree, which resulted in a broken wrist, ended Celerio&rsquo;s dream of becoming a violinist. He worked for some time as a <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a> </i>illustrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1930s, Celerio was asked to write the theme song of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b>(Country Maiden) which starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a>. He soon became the most sought after lyricist in the country. He was not only a master of the Tagalog language; he could finish a song&rsquo;s lyrics in an average of 20 minutes. He wrote the lyrics of almost all of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\">Santiago Suarez</a>&rsquo;s <b>balitaw</b><i> </i>and <b>harana</b>, like &ldquo;Caprichosa&rdquo; (Capricious Woman), &ldquo;Ang Tapis ni Inday&rdquo; (Inday&rsquo;s Overskirt), &ldquo;Dungawin Mo, Hirang&rdquo; (Look Out of the Window, My Love), and &ldquo;Umaga na Neneng&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Morning, Neneng).

He started the trend of putting lyrics to folk melodies like &ldquo;Pandangguhan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cari&ntilde;osa,&rdquo; &quot;Subli,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maglalatik.&rdquo; The most memorable song he wrote the lyrics for is &ldquo;Maligayang Pasko at Manigong Bagong Taon&rdquo; (Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year), also known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/975\">&quot;Ang Pasko ay Sumapit&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Christmas is Here).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Celerio landed in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the only man who could play music on a leaf. He also published two books: <b><i>Filipino Palindromes </i></b>and <b><i>Take it From Levi</i></b>, a collection of love poems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Celerio was conferred a doctorate in humanities, honoris causa, by the UP in 1991.

Graus, Aragon, Spain 26 Jul 1762. d. Quiapo, Manila 24 Jun 1832. Spanish Augustinian Recollect missionary, organist, and organ builder. Born to Joaquin Cera and Francisca Badia. Ordained priest in the Augustinian Recollect Order on 30 January 1787 in Barcelona. He is remembered as the builder of the bamboo organ at the Parish of St Joseph in Las Pi&ntilde;as, Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1790, three years after his ordination in Barcelona, he left Spain for Mexico with other Augustinian Recollect missionaries. He arrived in Manila on 5 June 1792. In his first year in Manila, Fr Cera constructed a piano that was regarded by then Gov-Gen Don Rafael Maria de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r y Ponce de Leon and the Recollect provincial, Fr Jose de Santa Orosia, as a worthy gift to Queen Maria Luisa of Parma, the wife of King Charles IV of Spain. It was believed that no piano constructed in Spain or England at that time could match it. In 1798, Fr Cera completed a pipe organ for the San Nicolas Church of the Recollects in Intramuros, Manila. This organ had 33 stops, one of which was made of bamboo. The San Nicolas pipe organ was probably Fr Cera&rsquo;s first experimentation on the durability and performance of this type of material. It was damaged in 1898 during the siege of Manila. Although restoration work was done in the early 20th century, this pipe organ and the San Nicolas Church were totally destroyed in World War II that ended in 1945. Aside from the San Nicolas pipe organ, Fr Cera also constructed the organ at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> which is believed to have begun in 1802. The Manila Cathedral pipe organ suffered extensive damages during the earthquakes of 9 Nov 1828 and 16 Sep 1852. It was totally destroyed in the earthquake of 3 Jun 1863.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fr Cera&rsquo;s first assignment was in Mabalacat Parish, Pampanga in Jun 1794. On 26 Dec 1795, he left Mabalacat to assume the position of parish priest of the newly organized Recollect parish of Las Pi&ntilde;as, amidst the opposition of the local secular clergy. The secular priests were favored by Gov-Gen Jose Basco y Vargas to serve as parish priests of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a> Viejo and Para&ntilde;aque, to which Las Pi&ntilde;as belonged. Nevertheless, Fr Cera began his work as the spiritual director of Las Pi&ntilde;as in late 1795 until his death in 1832. His first chapel was built of bamboo and nipa in 1796, located near the seashore. It is worthy to mention that this small chapel already featured a small chorus and a small orchestra of string instruments for the accompaniment of religious services. In 1797, the site of the present church was purchased by Fr Cera at the price of 150 pesos. On this site the stone church of St Joseph was eventually constructed. In 1816, three years before the completion of the stone church, Fr Cera began assembling the now famous bamboo organ. This has a striking resemblance to the old organ built by Fr Martin Peruga in 1653 in the Cathedral of San Vicente, approximately 25 kilometers north of Graus. By 1824, the bamboo organ was completely constructed, the pipes of which were 85% made of bamboo and the rest, of metal. Fr Cera is recorded in world history as the maker of the first pipe organ made of bamboo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other than his duties as parish priest in Las Pi&ntilde;as, he was also appointed prior of Taytay in Palawan, 1805; in Baclayon, Bohol, 1815; and in Tandag, 1825. These assignments did not require residency. His last appointment was president prior of San Sebastian Convent in Manila in 1832. On 15 May 15 1832, thirteen days after his appointment, Fr Cera fell ill and resigned from his positions. He passed away at the San Sebastian Convent in Manila on 24 Jun 1832. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

He was commissioned by the Philippine government to write an orchestral work in celebration of the centennial of Philippine independence from Spain in 1998, together with four other major Filipino composers who each wrote a large work for orchestra. Ching&rsquo;s contribution was his <b><i>Symphony No 3 </i>(<i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong></a>s</i></b>)<i>, </i>highlighting his widening ethnographic interests in which he fused Balinese, Chinese and Spanish elements in a work for three orchestras and a male chanter. After this compositional turning point, Ching continued to broaden his works through a more in-depth study of Eastern cultures and incorporated them as integral components of his succeeding compositions, blurring the established boundaries of East and West. In 2006, he wrote his <b><i>Symphony No</i></b><i> <b>4 </b></i>(<b><i>Souvenir des Ming</i></b>) and <b><i>Symphony No</i></b><i> <b>5 </b></i>(<b><i>Kunstkammer</i></b>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His musical works have been highlighted in radio portraits on Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (rbb) and Deutschlandfunk (DLF), and in Neue Zeitschriftf&uuml;r Musik. In Nov 2013, a unique technological achievement allowed for the concert goers and radio listeners of Dessau and Magdeburg to hear the two halves of his &lsquo;incantation&rsquo; <b><i>Diese So-Geliebte</i></b> as a complete score. They were played separately in Dessau and Magdeburg, and were simultaneously broadcast live by Deutschlandradio Kultur and MDR Figaro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ching was recognized as one of the five Outstanding Young Citizens of the Year by the President of the Philippines in 1998.

The band was established in 1989 under the Citizens&rsquo; Brigade of Dasmari&ntilde;as, a nonpolitical, nonprofit organization that also supports the Dasmari&ntilde;as Public Library, the Citizens Band and Music Workshop, a Livelihood Program, the Midgets Basketball Tournament, the Dasmari&ntilde;as Public Market, and a Credit Cooperative. The CBBD is an example of a modern Filipino brass band. It has adopted the new tradition of Band in Parade of wearing flashy uniforms and displaying great skill and discipline as a marching band. Band membership is open to everyone, but especially to the residents of the city and its neighboring towns who have the passion and love for music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Young musicians are trained for free in the CBBD&rsquo;s annual summer music workshop. At the workshop, CBBD members teach the participants how to read music notations and symbols, and how to play an instrument. Then they are subjected to rigorous marching drills to perfect their movements. To build their stamina during long competitions, they practice at the hottest time of the day. Trained by the band&rsquo;s late drum major Victor Sapida, each step and turn must be snappy and precise as in a military drill. For the competitions, each member must wear the complete uniform with hair well groomed and beard and mustache shaved. The band is well known for its elaborate and colorful costumes, which include Scottish kilts, Russian soldier uniform, and anime-inspired attire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CBBD provides an alternative venue for expression and recreation among the youth, sparing them from the influence of drugs and criminality. Aside from earning money from band commitments, the youth also assist other bands in organizing out of town band exhibitions. Among the towns they visited were Vigan, Laoag, La Union, Baguio, Bataan, Pampanga, Laguna, Batangas, and Romblon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Year after year, the CBBD has been the grandslam winner in different town fiesta competitions, in Amadeo and Silang in Cavite, Pasay City, Las Pi&ntilde;as City, and others which were previously dominated by bands from Bacoor, Cavite. The band&rsquo;s biggest award came from the First Manila Band Competition on 24 Jun 2000, a project of then Manila Mayor Lito Atienza held in celebration of Araw ng Maynila at the Quirino Grandstand. They won trophies for Best Marching Band, Best Drum Major, and Best Uniform, and were given a sum of 250,000 pesos in prizes. The CBBD has become one of the most important institutions in the city, promoting music education, discipline, good health, camaraderie, and unity among the youth. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRodney D.

She studied with Olga Samaroff Stokowski, Katherine Bacon, Arthur Newstead, and Leonid Hambro. She also went to France for master classes under Robert Casadesus. She studied marimba with Maurice Goldenberg, Philip Kraus, Yoichi Hiraoka, and Vida Scenoweth.

He was born in Malolos, Bulacan on 10 May 1936. He died in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila on 11 Jun 1988. The son of Felix Cuenco and Maria Joson, he was married to Magdalena Marcial, also a musician, with whom he had two children. His son, Ernani Jr aka Jong, is also a musician and a film and television actor. Cuenco started taking piano and violin lessons at six. While in high school at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), he took up piano with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3867\">Julio Esteban Anguita</a>, and violin with Ramon Mendoza at the UST Conservatory of Music. He completed a music degree in piano and cello from the UST and a master&rsquo;s degree in music education from Santa Isabel College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A seasoned performer, Cuenco played with the Filipino Youth Symphony Orchestra and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a> from 1960 to 1968, and the Manila Chamber Soloists from 1966 to 1970 organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4234\">Oscar C. Yatco</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4063\">Basilio C. Manalo</a>. In 1983 and 1987, he toured the United States with other Filipino performers and artists including the Kayumangging Kaligatan, a choral group he founded in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cuenco was at one time or another on the faculty of the music departments of several major schools and colleges in Manila including the UST Conservatory of Music, where he taught for decades. He also helped initiate the annual <b><i>Sampung Daliri</i></b> (Ten Fingers) concert of the UST Conservatory of Music, featuring their piano faculty, alumni, and students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He wrote award-winning musical scores for Filipino films. His first commission came in the early 1960s, for movie producer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a>. For the next two decades, he continued scoring for numerous films and writing some of the most memorable songs, often in collaboration with lyricist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\">Levi Celerio</a>. His works include <b><i>Diligin Mo ng Hamog ang Uhaw na Lupa </i></b>(Sprinkle Dew on the Parched Land), 1975, and <b><i>Bakya Mo, Neneng </i></b>(Your Wooden Clogs, Neneng), 1977, both awardees of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> for Best Musical Score; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/868\">&quot;Bato sa Buhangin&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Stone in the Sand), 1976, FAMAS Awardee for Best Theme Song, 1976; <b><i>Ang Babaing Pinagtaksilan ng Panahon </i></b>(A Woman Betrayed by Time), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Gawad Urian</a> for Best Music, 1980; and <b><i>Pedrong Taruc</i></b>,1982, and <b><i>Isang Bala Ka Lang </i></b>(You&rsquo;re Only Worth a Bullet), 1983, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP)</a> awardees for Best Musical Score. His greatest hit, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/892\">&ldquo;Gaano Ko Ikaw&nbsp;Kamahal&rdquo;</a> (How Much Do I Love You), 1979, shows how Cuenco enriched the Filipino love ballad by infusing it with elements of the classic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a>. His song &ldquo;Kahit na Magtiis&rdquo; (As I Endure) with words by Joseph Ejercito Estrada became a hit when the latter assumed the Philippine presidency in 1998. Its revival by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\">Philippine Madrigal Singers</a> with an arrangement by Christopher Borela lent prestige to the composition, and was included in the choir&rsquo;s live concert recording of their international tour of 2000, titled <b><i>Around the World</i></b> in 2001. Another recent recording of his music is Renato Lucas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\">Raul Sunico</a>&rsquo;s rendition of his love song, &ldquo;Nahan&rdquo; (Where?) in the album <b><i>Romanza</i></b>, released by Tawid Publications in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cuenco was posthumously conferred the CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts, and the National Artist award in 1999.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Julie Ann Hallazgo, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>Cultural Center of the Philippines</b>&nbsp;(<strong>CCP</strong>) is the leading institution in the country that plans and implements programs for the development and promotion of the arts&mdash;music, dance, theater, visual, literary, cinematic, and broadcast arts. Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"> Ballet Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\">Philippine Madrigal Singers</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\">Luis Valencia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\">Oscar Yatco</a>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\">Cecile Licad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\">Raul Sunico</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"> Lea Salonga</a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\">Andrea O. Veneracion</a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\">Antonio Maigue</a>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"> Gilopez Kabayao</a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</a> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"> Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\">novel</a>, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a> and libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>. De Leon and Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> </a>(Touch Me Not), first staged at the FEU Auditorium in 1957, was also restaged at the CCP in 1974, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3956\"> Don David </a> as Ibarra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4158\">Ruby Salazar</a> as Maria Clara, Jimmy Melendres as Padre Damaso, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\">Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</a> as Sisa. In 1984, the CCP and Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\">Francisco Feliciano</a> to create the three-act opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a></i></b> (The Black She-wolf), with libretto by Cuyugan-Asensio. In 1987, the CCP partnered with Music Theater Foundation in another restaging of <b><i>Noli&hellip;</i></b> this time with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3920\">Nolyn Cabahug</a> as Ibarra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3982\">Andion Fernandez</a> as Maria Clara, and Cuyugan-Asensio as Sisa (alternating with Luz Morete). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>&rsquo;s Philippine adaptation of <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> were also produced by and staged at the CCP in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Two major opera productions of the CCP in the 21st century were <b><i><strong> <strong>Spoliarium</strong> </strong> </i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, 2012. <b><i>Spoliarium</i></b> was inspired by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> &rsquo;s life and masterpiece, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> and libretto by Fides Cuyugan-Asensio, and co-produced by the CCP with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4106\">Opera Guild of the Philippines</a><b>&nbsp;</b>and Music Theater Foundation of the Philippines. <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b> was a co-production of the CCP and MusicArtes, Inc, with director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3017\">Anton Juan</a> giving local flavor to Puccini&rsquo;s famous opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is also the organizer and main proponent of major music festivals including the biennial Andrea Veneracion International Choral Festival and the CCP International Jazz Festival which was merged with the Orchestra and Symphonic Band Festival, and the annual Flute/Woodwind Festival. It has also been actively supporting the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) since its inception in 1973. The CCP Arts Education Department also organizes masterclasses of renowned musical artists as well as yearly workshops in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\"><b>rondalla</b> </a>music, choral music, and band music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Dance. </b>The CCP has four resident dance companies: Ballet Philippines (BP), which is based at the CCP Main Building, and Philippine Ballet Theatre (PBT), Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, and the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFC) which are all based outside the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since its founding in 1969, BP has performed over 400 works at the CCP, ranging from full-length classical ballets to modern dance and neo-ethnic pieces, under its founding artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>, later National Artist for Dance, and after her, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2593\"> Cecile Sicangco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2499\"> Noordin Jumalon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\">Alden Lugnasin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2437\">Augustus Damian III</a>, Alan Hineline, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2521\">Max Luna III</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2541\"> Paul Morales</a>.

Gawad Alternatibo annually cites the best efforts of Pinoy filmmakers in four categories: Animation, Experimental, Documentary, and Short Feature. Each winner receives a cash prize and a certificate. Special citations are also awarded to the best work from the regions, as well as works on/for/by children.

Established in 2004, the festival has given birth to some of Philippine cinema&rsquo;s contemporary masterpieces and is regarded as one of the most prestigious independent film competitions in the country, and a much awaited cultural event as well. Some of today&rsquo;s acclaimed filmmakers have launched their careers via the annual festival and competition, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Kanakan Balintagos</a> aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Aureaus Solito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4428\">Lawrence Fajardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4498\">Jun Robles Lana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5792\">Alvin B.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos. In 1990 it produced <b><i>Pinoy Eh</i></b>, a magazine show<b><i> </i></b>aired on ABC Channel 5.

In 1990-1998, the Gawad CCP Para sa Radyo (CCP Awards for Radio) was given at the same time as the television awards, to outstanding radio programs, producers, directors, scriptwriters, performers, and music and sound designers.

The first essays on the seven arts were compiled and published in a coffee table book with the same title in 1991.

He was born in Guiguinto, Bulacan on 11 Nov 1903. He died in Manila on 16 Aug 1982. He was the son of Higino de Guzman, a writer in Spanish, and Margarita Canseco. He married Leonor Buensuceso with whom he had six children. He was the grandson of fictionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, nephew of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> fictionist and poet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a>, and brother of film director and screenwriter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4376\">Susana de Guzman</a>. During his boyhood, he studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/38/835\">composition</a> under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, but his father sent him to law school. Later he switched to commerce and finished business administration in 1931. After passing the Certified Public Accountancy board examinations, he started working in the movies, together with his sister Susana. He wrote numerous pieces of music for films beginning 1931, becoming one of the earliest, if the not the first, Filipino musical director for the movies. He composed music for the films of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, Royal, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4507\">Lea</a>, National, X&#39;Otic, Excelsior, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4698\">Tagalog Ilang-Ilang</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of de Guzman&rsquo;s compositions, &ldquo;Panaginip&rdquo; (Dream), became a big hit by accident. His father heard Constancio play the song and had it published, thinking it was the composition of a friend. It sold by the thousands, and the father was surprised to learn it was his own son&rsquo;s work. Since then de Guzman has recorded hundreds of songs, principally under Vicor Records and Columbia Records. De Guzman was at one time director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\">Villar Records</a>. He was also musical director in many music companies in the Philippines and served as a director of Filipino Society of Composers, Arrangers, and Publishers (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3987\">FILSCAP</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of de Guzman&rsquo;s notable compositions are: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&quot;Bayan Ko&quot;</a>&nbsp;(My Country), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/857\">&quot;Babalik Ka Rin&quot;</a>&nbsp;(You Will Come Back), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\">&quot;Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig&quot;</a>&nbsp;(My Only Love), &ldquo;Birheng Walang Dambana&rdquo; (Virgin Without a Shrine), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/968\">&quot;Pamaypay ng Maynila&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Manila Fan), &ldquo;Lambingan&rdquo; (Tender Caressing), &ldquo;Ang Pag-ibig Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw&rdquo; (You are My Love), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\">&quot;Maalaala Mo Kaya?&quot;</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Will You Remember?). He also composed music for the following movies: <b><i>Arimunding-munding</i></b>, <b><i>Se&ntilde;orita </i></b>(Miss), <b><i><strong>Sarung Banggi</strong> </i></b>(One Night), <b><i>Probinsyana </i></b>(Provincial Lass), <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, <b><i>Roberta</i></b>, and <b><i>Ikaw ang Aking Buhay </i></b>(You Are My Life) where he won the Best Musical Scorer award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> in 1959. He was also named the Best Composer and Lyricist in the 1969 Awit Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the EDSA Revolution of 1986, de Guzman&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; became the symbolic anthem of the Filipino people that represented their sentiments and eagerness to be freed from the Marcos&#39;s&nbsp;dictatorship. This resonated with the earlier purpose for which the song was written, as a hopeful expression of independence from the Americans. The song was incorporated into the restaging of Severino Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></i></b> (No Wounds) in 1970. The Tagalog lyrics were written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>. &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; won for de Guzman the gold medal at the Paris International Fair of 1948, together with his other song, &ldquo;Kung Kita&rsquo;y Kapiling&rdquo; (When I&rsquo;m With You). &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; has also been used in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><strong>Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim</strong></a></i></b> (<em><strong>My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge</strong></em>), 1985; in the TV documentary <b><i>EDSA 25: Sulyap ng Kasaysayan </i></b>(EDSA 25: A Glimpse of History), 2011; and in the movies <b><i>Don&rsquo;t Give Up on Us</i></b>, 2006, <b><i>Pisay</i></b><i>,</i> 2007, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1251\"><strong>Noy</strong></a></i></b>, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His other famous song, &ldquo;Maalala Mo Kaya?&rdquo;, was used by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> for their TV series of the same title, which started in 1991 and is hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\">Charo Santos</a>. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\">Maalaala Mo Kaya</a> </i></b>is considered the longest running drama anthology in the Philippines to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Guzman also acted for the movies, appearing in <b><i>Huling Dalangin </i></b>(Last Prayer), 1948, and <b><i>Hiyas ng Pamilihan</i></b> (Gem of the Marketplace), 1949. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Flerida G.

Manila 9 Sep 1959. Composer, ethnomusicologist. He is the son of Benjamin M. de la Pe&ntilde;a and Purita Carmen, both from Indang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>. As a son of a presbyterian pastor, de la Pe&ntilde;a grew up in a family where music was always present because it was an important part of his father&rsquo;s ministry as a leader of the United Church of Christ of the Philippines (UCCP). His father and uncle were both amateur violin players and sang baritone. As the family moved every three years to different places following his father&rsquo;s pastoral assignments, de la Pe&ntilde;a was exposed to the local cultures of different communities, which always had choral singing. This exposure to music in his early childhood musical experience was immersive. At Union High School of Manila (that is part of Philippine Christian University) where he got his secondary education, he listened to folk pop music, formed a band, and composed some songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He entered the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman as a veterinary medicine major in the mid-1970s. Two years after, he shifted to music, major in composition. His first composition teacher was Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4072\"><strong>Manuel Maramba</strong></a>, OSB. He later studied with Ramon Santos and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>, both of whom instilled in him the appreciation for things Asian, particularly Asian philosophy. This inclination to write compositions that ran counter to Western compositional method was thus deeply entrenched in him, and de la Pe&ntilde;a, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>, followed the path of this tradition in art music composition. This was further deepened with his apprenticeship as a music copyist for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>. De la Pe&ntilde;a graduated in 1983 with a bachelor of music degree in composition. For this degree, he wrote the piece <b><i>Nyuma</i></b> for 36 singers and Asian instruments, which portrays the idea of forces yin and yang. Nyuma is a three-layered textural music in which representations of yin and yang weave around a static drone. It was during this time when de la Pe&ntilde;a was invited to become a member of the erstwhile <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a>. For around eight years or more, de la Pe&ntilde;a was active as a music director for Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s Asian children&rsquo;s theater <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Mulat, for which his <b><i>Si Suan</i></b><i>,<b> Si Suan</b></i> (Suan, Suan) was composed. This work for four artists&mdash;singer, puppeteer, actress, and drummer&mdash;is minimalist and utilizes subtle forms of expression using Asian materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After earning his bachelor&rsquo;s degree, de la Pe&ntilde;a immediately taught as lecturer in music theory at the UP College of Music. Later he continued his composition studies with Ramon Santos and earned his master&rsquo;s degree in composition in 1992 with a piece called <b><i>Seven Songs of the Book of Revelation</i></b>. This was rendered by the UP Madrigal Singers and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4204\"><strong>UP Concert Chorus</strong></a>. In 1993, deciding to work on research techniques in addition to composition, de la Pe&ntilde;a entered the PhD program in ethnomusicology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He finished this in 2000 with a dissertation on the music performed during funerary rites among the Kankanaey in Benguet. However, de la Pe&ntilde;a did not forget composition and continued composing for choirs such as hymns and anthems, especially those for UCC which appeared in Pilgrim Press, USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After his doctoral studies, de la Pe&ntilde;a resumed teaching in the UP College of Music and held the position of chair of the Department of Musicology starting 2004. He has also served as officer-in-charge and member of the Advisory Board of the UP Center for Ethnomusicology. In addition to his research on Cordilleran music in Luzon Island, de la Pe&ntilde;a has also done research work on the Tagalog song genres <b>awit</b>, <b>pasyon</b>, and <b>urban hip hop</b>. In 2001, he became the secretary general of the National Music Competitions for Young Artists. Beginning 2010, he has been hosting the weekly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4826\"><strong>DZUP</strong></a> radio program, <b><i>Tunog at Tinig</i></b> (Sound and Voice), which got a citation by the Catholic Mass Media Awards in 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

De Leon&rsquo;s father died when he was only three years old. His mother supported the family by selling betel nut leaves. He entered elementary school only when he was eight years old.

In 1927 he took up fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP), but had to stop schooling in order to make a living. He played the trombone in dance orchestras which performed in cabarets, circuses, and bodabil. Then, he worked as assistant conductor of the Nueva Ecija High School Orchestra, where he started doing musical arrangements, and later on, writing music for the <b>sarsuwela</b>.

Dumaguete City 8 Sep 1953. Classical guitarist, guitar pedagogue. His parents are Ricaredo Demetillo, a poet and English professor, and Angelita Delariarte, a church organist. His sister Becky Demetillo is a singer, while his brother-in-law, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3850\"><strong>Edru Abraham</strong></a>, heads the Kontra-GaPi. Growing up at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman campus where his father taught, Demetillo spent his childhood filled with poetry readings at home and Sundays picnics by the UP lagoon listening to the university orchestra. He learned to play the guitar from a family friend as a teenager and was soon obsessed with the instrument, playing the popular songs of his generation. He became proficient enough in the instrument to play professionally in folk houses. His very first break came when his sister Becky, then a regular singer at the famous Butterfly House outside UP campus, needed a substitute guitarist. With his skilful guitar playing and fine singing, Demetillo soon became one of the top folk singers in Manila, becoming the main feature in places such as the Kola House in Ermita and the Appaloosa Bar in Quezon City. He would later form a band with his high school friends called the Silver Grass, which played in campus events such as the Folkways concerts sponsored by the Beta Sigma Fraternity. The band would become his &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for learning musical arranging and song writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shifting from a previous college course in UP Manila, Demetillo decided to audition at the UP College of Music and got accepted as a composition major. However, in one session with his composition professor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>, where he was presenting a piece he wrote for guitar, the old man profusely complimented his guitar playing and urged him to shift his major to guitar. At that time, the only guitar professor in UP was Jose Ma. Pellicer whom Demetillo remembers as a kindhearted and jolly teacher. Later, after securing a special permission from the college, he transferred to another teacher, well-known violinist and conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"><strong>Sergio Esmilla</strong></a>. Although Esmilla was not a guitarist, his mentorship allowed Demetillo to sharpen his musicality and sight reading skills. In 1980, Demetillo joined the faculty of the UP College of Music Department of Strings and developed its guitar program, which is still implemented today and which has produced some of the country&rsquo;s top classical guitarists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside UP, Demetillo has given master classes in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia and serves as an examiner for the Associated Board of Royal Schools in Indonesia. He has performed at the American Colleges in Chicago, Sejong Hall in Korea, Melbourne Concert Hall, and the Chuo Center Hall in Osaka. He also founded the UP Guitar Orchestra, the first of its kind in the country, for which he continues to produce arrangements and transcriptions. He remains active in the local concert scene, performing up to 50 shows annually. Recently, Lester also began concertizing on the mandolin and the banjo. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byVerne de la Pe&ntilde;a</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Composed of students from its different colleges, the choir has served the university. In its early years, with Noel Bugarin as conductor, the group gave formal concerts and participated in local choral concerts where it garnered top prizes. The choir received invitations to perform in Tokyo, Japan in 1989 and in the International Choral Festival in Ancona, Italy in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1992, conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3970\"><strong>Rodolfo Delarmente</strong></a> took over and the choir participated in its first international choral competition in the 46th Llangollen International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Eisteddfod in Wales, England. The group garnered awards for the folkloric and chamber choir categories in that competition. In 1995, the group bagged the top prizes in international choral competitions all over Europe. The tour brought home a total of six first prizes and two grand prix awards from Arnhem, The Netherlands and Tampere, Finland. In Finland, the group bested 53 other choirs from all over the world with three first prizes&mdash;the highest recognition given in that festival. In the every-four-year Arnhem International Choir Festival, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3973\"><strong>DLSU Chorale</strong></a> had taken home the grand prix, public&rsquo;s choice award, folkloric, light music a capella, and mixed choir awards. In Cantonigros, Spain, the group won first prize in the folkloric category and second prize in the mixed choir category. In Sweden, the group won first prize in the mixed and folkloric choir categories. The choir repeated the same feat in 1999 when the choir won first prize in the mixed choir category in St Petersburg, Russia and first prize in folkloric category in Polheim, Germany. In 2004, the group won first prize in folkloric category in Debrecen, Hungary. In 2010, the group embarked on a North American-European tour. They competed again in the 2010 Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod where they placed second in the chamber choir category. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2013, the chorale has garnered a long list of top prizes in some competitions in Europe. The group won the grand prix in the 3rd International Choral Competition-Kaunas Cantat in Kauna, Lithuania, where they also bagged the gold prizes for the adult chamber choir category, polyphonic category, and the folkloric category. In the 41st Festival of Songs in Oloumuc, Czech Republic, the choir took the gold in the adult chamber choir category, gold for spiritual, gospel, pop categories, and gold in the folkloric category. At the 11th International Choir Competition-Antonio Vivaldi in Karpenissi, Greece, the choir garnered the first prize in the adult chamber choir category. It also bagged the first prize at the 31st International Choral Competition of Sacred Music in Perveza, Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from competing, the DLSU Chorale reaches out to Filipino and foreign audiences with concerts all over the world. In 2002, the group embarked on its first North American Tour, visiting several cities in the United States and Canada. The tour was so successful that the chorale was invited again in 2004 with more performance engagements. The choir&rsquo;s growing reputation has paved the way for more organizers inviting the choir to perform for their communities. This has led to three invitations in 2001, 2005, and 2007 to South Korea. The group continues to have a growing audience and enjoy cordial relationship with local Koreans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite its busy schedule abroad, the DLSU Chorale also shares its music locally. Apart from its regular concert season and outreach concert to various local communities and churches, the DLSU Chorale performs for charitable causes that promote choral, classical, and Filipino music. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

This rock band was founded in late 1989 by combining two college bands&mdash;Curfew and Sunday School&mdash;at the University of the Philippines (UP) in Diliman. The trio of Raimund Marasigan (drums), Buddy Zabala (bass), and Marcus Adoro (guitar) of Curfew was a group based at the UP Narra Residence Hall. They joined Ely Buendia (guitar, vocals) from Sunday School, which was a group from the UP Molave Residence Hall. The new quartet called themselves The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, lifting the name from a movie <b><i>Eraserhead</i></b> by the director David Lynch. Robin Rivera, a humanities teacher from the university, worked with the group as recording engineer, and they recorded the privately circulated cassette album <b><i>Pop-U!</i></b> in 1991, which eventually led to a three-year recording contract with BMG Records Pilipinas two years later in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Eraserheads&rsquo; first album <b><i>Ultraelectromagneticpop!</i></b> was shipped by BMG in Oct 1993 with 5,000 initial units. These escalated to an excess of 200,000 copies, thus leading to its certification by the Philippine Association of the Recording Industry as a &ldquo;7X Platinum Record.&rdquo; The album&rsquo;s quirky production style, with novelty singles like &ldquo;Pare Ko&rdquo; (My Dude), &ldquo;Tindahan ni Aling Nena&rdquo; (Mrs. Nena&rsquo;s Variety Store), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a>&rdquo; (Happiness), and &ldquo;Toyang&rdquo; caused a commercial avalanche in the Original Pilipino Music (OPM) industry and the country&rsquo;s independent music scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the heels of their astounding debut in 1993, the Eraserheads lost no time in creating chart-topping albums in yearly succession, bringing their mentor Robin Rivera to the fold as their album producer of choice. <b><i>Circus</i></b>, 1994, which sold 214,000 copies, a &ldquo;7X Platinum Record,&rdquo; and <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, 1995, which sold 400,000 copies, a &ldquo;14X Platimum or Diamond Record,&rdquo; surpassed expectations. In 1996, the elaborate Christmas album and EP titled <b><i>Fruitcake</i></b>, sold 122,000 copies, a &ldquo;3X Platinum Record,&rdquo; complemented by a matching <b><i>Fruitcake</i></b> book from Anvil Publishing. This album marked a turning point in the Eraserheads output, moving their direction into more serious compositional works. In mid-1997, they once again released an EP titled <b><i>Bananatype</i></b>, featuring the song &ldquo;Tikman&rdquo; (Taste) that became a Burger Machine commercial. The same year, they went to California for the first of many similar engagements in the United States and the rest of the world, to perform at The Palace in Hollywood and the Calvin Simmons Auditorium in Oakland. Soon after, BMG Pilipinas released the fifth Eraserheads album, <b><i>Sticker Happy</i></b>, 1997, which sold 55,000 copies, becoming a platinum record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By then, Ely Buendia&rsquo;s iconic composition from the <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b><i> </i>album of 1995, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/905\"><strong>Ang Huling El Bimbo</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Last El Bimbo) had won much critical praise for its imagery, while its music video won the International Viewer&rsquo;s Choice Awards for Asia at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards. Their later albums elicited mixed reactions: <b><i>Aloha Milkyway</i></b>, 1998, a compilation album for the ASEAN market; <b><i>Natin 99</i></b> (Ours 99), 1999; and their unforeseen swansong <b><i>Carbon Stereoxide</i></b>, 2000. In Mar 2002, management problems brought Ely Buendia to effectively leave the group. Kris Gorra, the singer-guitarist from the all-female band, Fatal Posporos, was recruited to join the Marasigan, Zabala, and Adoro trio, now renamed the Eheads, to fulfill the band&rsquo;s remaining contractual obligations, with a self-produced independent EP, titled &ldquo;Please Transpose&rdquo; issued in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Oct 2003, Marcus Adoro had similarly quit and the Eheads changed their name once again, becoming the reformulated band, Cambio, with Marasigan, Zabala, and Gorra, joined by Ebe Dancel from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4184\"><strong>Sugarfree</strong></a> and Diego Mapa from Monsterbot. They released two albums for the MCA Music label, namely <b><i>Derby Light</i></b>, 2004, and <b><i>Matic</i></b>, 2007. In 2004, BMG released the two-volume compilation <b><i>Eraserheads Anthology</i></b>, with resurgent sales of 209,000 units, creating a demand for lucrative, enormously budgeted reunion engagements and recordings such as the concert and album <b><i>Eraserheads: The Reunion Concert</i></b>, 2008, and the bonus CD single, which was distributed in the Sep 2014 issue of <b><i>Esquire <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Magazine Philippine</strong></a>s</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Eraserheads is the recipient of the following awards from NU Rock Awards: Album of the Year for <b><i>Ultraelectromagneticpop!</i></b>, Listener&rsquo;s Choice Award, and Band of the Year, 1995; Album of the Year for <b><i>Circus</i></b>, 1995, and <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, 1996; Best Music Video and Song of the Year for &ldquo;Ang Huling El Bimbo,&rdquo;<b> </b>1996; Artist of the Year, Listener&rsquo;s Choice Award, and Best Video for &ldquo;Fruitcake,&rdquo; 1997; and Hall of Fame, 2003. They were recognized as the Most Favorite Band in 1995 and Most Popular Group in 1997 by the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Awards. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards, they won Best Performance by a Group for &ldquo;Ligaya,&rdquo; 1994; Album of the Year for <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, 1996, and <b><i>Eraserheads: The Reunion Concert</i></b>, 2009; and Best Alternative Recording for &ldquo;Fruitcake,&rdquo; 1997, and &ldquo;Julie Tearjerky,&rdquo; 1999. They received the Awit Awards&rsquo; Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino in 2012. From Katha Music Awards, they won the following: Album of the Year and Best Rock Album for <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, Best Rock Song for &ldquo;Ang Huling El Bimbo,&rdquo; and Best Rock Group, all in 1996; and Best Rock Vocal Performance for &ldquo;Fruitcake,&rdquo; 1997.

In 1953-54, he pursued a music degree at University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music, then in 1956 went to the United States for masteral courses in violin and chamber music at the Julliard School of Music. He also took postgraduate studies in chamber music and conducting at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore.

Founded by his grandfather, Marcos Espejo, the Espejo Comparsa was composed of 12 members, namely Celso, his father, uncle, and tenants of his grandfather. The group played boleros, waltzes, tangos, and <b>kundiman</b> during weddings, baptisms, and anniversaries.

Aside from the school rondallas, he also mentored a senior citizens&rsquo; rondalla in Malibay, Pasay. With almost 40 years of teaching rondalla to children and adults alike, Espejo garnered first prizes in at least six national rondalla contests including the <b><i>Hamon sa Kampeon</i></b> (Champ&rsquo;s Challenge) in the 1960s as well as first prizes in the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) rondalla competitions for both elementary and high school levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, Espejo and three other rondalla masters formed the Pambansang Samahan ng Rondalla (PASARON) to promote the rondalla through workshops, competitions, and festivals.

Escolta, Manila 1870. d. 6 Apr 1943. Composer, conductor, pianist. He is the father of film director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>. He studied at the Conservatory of Music in Madrid, Spain and was the director of the all-Filipino Orquesta Rizal in 1898. He was also the piano teacher of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4152\"><strong>Francisco Roxas</strong></a> (1896 martyred revolutionary supporter) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>. He married Matilde Tronqued, then aged 16, a daughter of an actor in Compania de Yeyeng Fernandez, in 1903 (Tronqued de Estella Diary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Estella was active as a composer of musical theater from the 1890s to around 1912. He composed the music of the Spanish zarzuela <b><i>El Diablo Mundo </i></b>(Devil&rsquo;s World), which inaugurated the opening of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3303\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Zorrilla</strong></a> in 1893. Estella&rsquo;s works for the stage include: the one-act opera <b><i>Veni</i></b>, <b><i>Vidi</i></b>, <b><i>Vici </i></b>(I Came, I Saw, I Conquered), 1904; and the <b>sarsuwela</b> <b><i>Ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> Italiana </i></b>(The Italian Opera), <b><i>La Venta de Filipinas al Japon </i></b>(The Sale of the Philippines to Japan), and <b><i>Sangla ni Rita </i></b>(Rita&rsquo;s Pawn). He also composed a three-act opera in Tagalog called <b><i>Lakambini </i></b>(Muse) with libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\"><strong>Patricio Mariano</strong></a>, for the opening of Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a> in 1931.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of his piano compositions were <b>valse</b>, which earned him the title the &ldquo;Waltz King&rdquo; of the Philippines. He had a dance orchestra which performed the valses. He is said to have written more than <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> waltzes, most popular of which was &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/943\"><strong>Ang Maya</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Sparrow), composed earlier for the sarsuwela<i> <b>Filipinas para los Filipinos </b></i>(Philippines for the Filipinos), 1905, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>. This piece was later recorded by soprano <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\"><strong>Maria Carpena</strong></a>, and is one of the earliest examples of a Filipino popular music hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the realm of art music, he completed <b><i>Filipinas </i></b>(Philippines) in 1928, which is the first extant symphony in the Philippines. This work is based on traditional Filipino tunes and rhythms of the <b>balitaw</b><i>, </i><b>kundiman</b>, and other folk songs. He also wrote a large work <b><i>Ultimo Adios</i></b> (Last Farewell), a symphonic tone poem for orchestra based on Rizal&rsquo;s poem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As light classical music composer, Estella was famous for his &ldquo;costumbrista&rdquo; suites that depicted local characters and scenes. He generically titled these <b><i>Cancionero Filipino</i></b> (Filipino Songbook). They were written between 1887 to 1929. His first cancionero, titled &ldquo;Naci en Binondo&rdquo; (I Was Born in Binondo), 1887, appeared alone in a manuscript that is now archived in the University of the Philippines College of Music Library. Subsequent canciones appeared as song collections and were written for various performance media. The first <b><i>Cancionero Filipino</i></b> was for an orchestra, only the first movement (De Jarana) of which is extant. The second <b><i>Cancionero Filipino</i></b>, also for orchestra and dated 1928-29, is in the style of impressionism. It consists of &ldquo;El Amanecer en el Campo&rdquo; (Dawn in the Fields), &ldquo;El Medio Dia&rdquo; (Midday), and &ldquo;La Noche&rdquo; (Night). The third <b><i>Cancionero Filipino</i></b>, also for orchestra, seems to be a reworking of his first and contained scenes of romantic love and courtship: &ldquo;De Jarana&rdquo; (Like a Serenade), &ldquo;La Emprentada&rdquo; (The Printer), &ldquo;Declaracion de Amor&rdquo; (Declaration of Love), and &ldquo;La Retirada&rdquo; (The Recluse).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other cancioneros are extant. <b><i>Cancionero Filipino a 2 Voces y Quinteto Cuerdas</i></b> (Songs for Two Voices and String Quintet) was dedicated to Natividad Ocampo de Arellano, then president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> de Filipinas</strong></a>, and was premiered on 6 Dec 1922 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand Opera House</strong></a>. Another cancionero consists of &ldquo;Tristezas&rdquo; (Dolours), &ldquo;En El <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>s&rdquo; (By the Stream), and &ldquo;Sa Iyo&rdquo; (To You). Another cancion Filipino, with heteroglossic linguistic titles, has &ldquo;Buhay Ko&rdquo; (My Life), a kundiman; &ldquo;En Hamaca&rdquo; (In a Hammock), a danza; and &ldquo;Alaut&rdquo; (Disgrace), a balitaw. He also composed a cancionero based on Cebuano music and which contains Cebuano Songs: &ldquo;La Bibinquera&rdquo; (Female Rice Cake Vendor), &ldquo;Kamingaw&rdquo; (Loneliness) based on an old Visayan Song, and &ldquo;Sa Imong Saad&rdquo; (According to Your Promise) for baritone and piano. Estella self-published the pieces in his last two cancioneros as separate sheet music for voice and piano. In these works, Estella contributed to the elevation of folkloric Philippine music and to the creation of a patriotic awareness for the uniqueness of Philippine music.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

These were simple in composition, easy to learn, and lively and attractive to the young and old.When she joined the Davao City-based John XXIII Catechetical Center, she went around the Archdiocese of Davao and adjacent Dioceses to run liturgical music seminars as well as teach the songs she composed. She was a staff member of this Center from 1972 to 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her first collection of songs was published by the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption in 1976 under the title <b><i>Huni sa Kinabuhi I</i></b> (Tunes of Life), which contained a total of 67 original compositions.

Later, after she joined the Communication Foundation of Asia (CFA), her last collection of songs, <b><i>Ang Bag-ong Huni sa Kinabuhi</i></b> (The New Tunes of Life), was published bythe CFA in 1996 with 12 original compositions.Her songs have also been recorded on cassette tape by Fr Edgar Labagala of the Bishop Thibault Communication Center of the Archdiocese of Davao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of her songs have become classics and are still popular in Visayas and Mindanao. Her collections include Mass Ordinary, i.e., &ldquo;Ginoo Kaloy-i Kami&rdquo; (Lord Have Mercy) and the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, &ldquo;Amahan Namo&rdquo; (Our Father).

Folk-rock singer, songwriter, acoustic guitarist. He is the son of Isaias de Leon from Pasig, Rizal and Adella Miguel. Isaias died when Florante was 17 years of age. Florante was the youngest in the brood of 15. He is married to Ruth Pesta&ntilde;o and has four children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At seven, Florante played the ukelele. In 1967, on his second year in high school, he formed a band called The Ludwigs, which was named after the instruments the members used. After less than two weeks of rehearsals, the band was able to play the Beatles, Dave Clark 5, and Zombies in a basketball court. Being the lead guitarist of the band, he was sought after by other bands, some of which he eventually joined. After playing with as many as 14 combos, he performed in Okinawa, Japan for a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early in the 1970s, he performed cover songs by James Taylor and Cat Stevens in folk houses. He later ventured into rock music with a group, playing the songs of Grand Funk and Santana. He started to compose the song titled &ldquo;Jack of All Trades&rdquo; but was unable to finish it. This led him to quit singing in English and start composing in Tagalog. The folk ballad &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Pinoy&rdquo; (I Am a Filipino) was his first major hit. His first public television appearance was on Channel 13 in <b><i>Alice Zerrudo in Concert</i></b> (<b><i>Evening Post</i></b>), 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1971, he decided to go on solo performance because he was tired of organizing bands that had to be continually disbanded. He composed, arranged, sang, and collaborated with other Filipino music artists as seen in his prolific output of 51 recorded singles and albums. His songs were included in the collection of printed Original Pilipino Music (OPM) titled <b><i>All Pinoy Music Special</i></b>, which contains 320 local songs with chords, Vol. 1, 1996. He collected 12 of his compositions in his first LP album titled <b><i>Mga Tula at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>in ni Florante</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1932\"><strong>Poems</strong></a> and Songs of Florante). These songs were so popular that they were taught in elementary schools. Because he wrote songs associated with everyday street culture, Florante was addressed as &ldquo;Tatang, Kaka, or Pinoy&rdquo; by his colleagues. By the time his songs got printed, Florante was already considered a leading exponent of Pinoy rock music. In his second album, he included &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a>&rdquo; (Offering), which was a song of gratitude to all people who helped him, as well as a farewell song. This song became the theme song of the Film Academy of the Philippines. Another song of his, &ldquo;Abakada,&rdquo; was composed for the International Year of the Child in 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the time when the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Child) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a> was playing in all radio stations, Florante&rsquo;s music posed a challenge to it. Florante&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Pinay&rdquo; (Filipina), which he first sang at Don Bosco College, was used by Asia Brewery in a beer commercial, and &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Pinoy&rdquo; (I Am a Filipino) by San Miguel Beer and Selecta companies in their own commercials (Velarde 1978).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Florante was an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> awardee as Best Folk Singer of the year in 1976. In a survey conducted by <b><i>Jingle</i></b> <b><i>Magazine</i></b>, Florante was declared the Best Performer in 1975 and Poet of the Year in 1976-77. In the 1980s, his career ended. Florante and his family migrated to the United States after the 1986 EDSA Revolt. <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251787264\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"></v:shape> <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>  <strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Baradas</em></strong> </p>\r\n"

Francisco, SJ</b>)<b> </b>b. 26 Feb 1965. Liturgical composer. He is the fourth child of Victor and Concepcion Francisco. His siblings are Eduardo, Victor Jr, Leonardo, and Vicente. When he was six years old, he took summer lessons on electone piano, music theory, composition, and solfege in Yamaha and Greenhills Music Studio. At age 13, while preparing for his first piano concerto under Asuncion Laureola of University of the Philippines College of Music, he was enlightened with a calling for priesthood. He then became active in catechism, community immersion, and theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a young musician with a vocation for priesthood, he commenced composing as an outlet for personal expression. In a school-wide music composition competition, Manoling&rsquo;s melody was chosen for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\"><strong>Onofre Pagsanghan</strong></a>&rsquo;s lyrics of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/903\"><strong>Hindi Kita Malilimutan</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Won&rsquo;t Forget You), winning first place in the said contest. He then continued to compose music together with classmates Jandi Arboleda and Norman Agatep. Among their early compositions were &ldquo;Mariang Ina Ko&rdquo; (My Mother Mary) and &ldquo;Gumising&rdquo; (Wake Up). Fr Manoling&rsquo;s first solo composition was created during his college sophomore year in Ateneo de Manila University and was titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> More Gift.&rdquo; During the same year level, he collaborated with the aforementioned classmates in composing a setting of a Mass in the idiom of gospel, &ldquo;I Will Sing Forever.&rdquo; He later composed more songs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ma Christi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pasko Na&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Christmas). In 1984, during his junior year, his song &ldquo;Gabing Kulimlim&rdquo; (Dusk), followed by &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1297\"><strong>Tanging Yaman</strong></a>&rdquo; (Only Wealth) in 1985 were very popular in churches. In his senior class, he attempted to compose in classical style, which led to &ldquo;Luwalhati sa Diyos&rdquo; (Glory to God). This, however, did not prosper. He ventured back into composing with simple melodies and chord progressions and thus easy to sing and remember, without sacrificing depth of messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He described his church works as in-between secular and liturgical styles, infusing the complex meanings of his spiritual songs with a touch of romantic ballad and traces of <b>kundiman</b>, but with a contemporary feel. With these qualities, local artists like Dulce and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a> were moved and had included Francisco&rsquo;s songs in their albums. The impact of his compositions to the laity has given him a realization that he fulfills the needs of the church. His most recent work is an album for the Holy Week, released in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Francisco graduated class valedictorian at the Ateneo de Manila Grade School and High School for the years 1979 and 1983, respectively. In 1990, he was conferred with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in pre-divinity by the Ateneo de Manila University, cum laude, and was graduating class valedictorian. In 1997, he was summa cum laude and also class valedictorian upon conferment of his master of arts in theology by the Loyola School of Theology. He got his licentiate in 2002 and doctorate in systematic theology in 2005 from Weston Jesuit School of Theology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fr Francisco entered the Society of Jesus in May 30, 1985 and was ordained priest in 1997. He had served as parish priest and school director of St Joseph&rsquo;s Catholic Mission in Kiangan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>.

She began piano lessons under the town organist, then went to the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Manila. During school vacations she organized <b>sarsuwela</b> and operettas with friends and neighbors. After college, Fuentes took formal voice lessons from Salvina Fornari, an Italian singer residing in Manila. She was an instructor of voice culture at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music, 1919-24. In 1924, she left for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a>, Italy to further hone her skills in opera singing and acting under voice teachers Arturo Cadore, Luigi Lucenti, and Maestro Villani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fuentes first earned international recognition in Apr 1925 when she appeared as Cio Cio San in Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Municipale di Piacenza in Italy.

After World War II, she moved to Manila and enrolled in the Assumption Convent and later transferred to Holy Ghost College (now College of Holy Spirit) where she completed her secondary education. It was also in Holy Ghost College that she pursued her music degree under Amanda Cabrera and eventually obtained her bachelor of music in piano, 1952, and bachelor of arts, 1953. She then took further studies in music at the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, Maryland and obtained a master in music degree in performance under the tutelage of eminent pedagogue for piano Erno Balogh, who was a pupil of Hungarian composer Bela Bartok. She also studied theory under Louis Cheslock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon her return to the Philippines in 1955, she took further piano studies with Stella Goldenberg-Brimo and became featured soloist under conductors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, and Sr Rosalinda Abejo, RVM. She taught at Holy Ghost and St Joseph College before eventually becoming a faculty member of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1960. At the UST Conservatory of Music, she taught piano and theory subjects. Her interest in history and the affairs of the country made her enroll at the UST Graduate School to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree in political science. Hence, she also taught Philippine history, Philippine Constitution, and Rizal course among the students of the conservatory. It is here at the UST Conservatory of Music that she would spend the next 50 years of her academic and professional life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the time of conservatory director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"><strong>Sergio Esmilla</strong></a> Jr, she helped establish the degree program in Music Education, and under dean Stella Goldenberg-Brimo, she assisted in putting up the UST Brass Quintet and the UST Woodwind Quintet. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of her important legacies was reestablishing the UST Symphony Orchestra and organizing as well the UST Symphonic Band along with Fr Manuel P. Maramba, OSB. Fule was also a frontliner in the conservatory projects, such as the UST Summer Music Camp which she herself conceptualized and the <b><i>Sampung mga Daliri Atbp</i></b> (Ten Fingers and Others) concerts that was a brainchild of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3949\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Ernani Cuenco</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fule succeeded Alejandra Atabug as dean of the conservatory in 1990 and held the position until 2001.

Santa Cruz, Manila 13 Jun 1865. d. 4 Apr 1919. Pianist, cellist. His father, Calixto Garcia, was an organist and cantor in the SanAgustin, Intramuros and Santa Cruz churches, and his mother, Eusebia del Rosario, was an entrepreneur. He married Paulina Vasquez with whom he had six children. He first learned music from his father, who besides singing and playing the organ, was adept with the flute, violin, and guitar. Starting at nine years old, Garcia studied under different teachers at the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples of the ManilaCathedral for the next four years: singing and vocalization under Luis Calpe, piano under Luis Vicente Arche, and violin and cello under Ramon Valdes. Later, he continued schooling at the Ateneo Municipal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcia made his public debut in 1878 when he was only 13. The following year, playing the cello, he was awarded second <i>accesit </i>(honorable mention)<i> </i>in a musical contest conducted by the Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario. At 16, he became the organist of the Parroquia del Sagrario of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>. He appeared in nearly every program given at the University of Santo Tomas, Malaca&ntilde;anPalace, and Casino Espa&ntilde;ol, and in various concerts initiated by musical patrons or given by the Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario and Sociedad <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Filipina de Santa Cecilia. The visiting Hungarian concertmaster Remenyi was so impressed by his versatility on the piano, violin, and cello that he strongly urged Garcia to take further studies abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this time, Garcia taught solfeggio and, later, piano at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran together with Blas Echegoyen and Jose Muezo, and at the Ateneo Municipal with the same artists and Jose Felix. He became director of the instrumental section of the Sociedad Filipina de Santa Cecilia in 1891. He continued to play in churches and theaters, public venues, and private homes, and directed Gruet&rsquo;s orchestra in Manuel Garrido&rsquo;s farewell concert at the Filipino Theater. He served as director of Euterpe Orchestra when it was organized by nonprofessional musicians in 1899.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American regime, he also taught at the Centro Escolar University, Santa Catalina College, and Colegio de Consolacion. In 1916, Ignacio Villamor, the first Filipino president of the University of the Philippines (UP), asked Garcia to serve as director of the newly opened UP Conservatory of Music, an offer which he modestly declined. Among Garcia&rsquo;s pupils were Conchita Cruz Herrera, Rosario Valdez, Barbara Cuaycong, JovitaFuentes, Mariano <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, and Jose Paez. He was the friend and favorite pianist of jurist Cayetano Arellano. <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251792384\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"></v:shape><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written byEspiridion Arsenio Manuel and Rosalinda Galang</em></strong> </p>\r\n"

The band is both a marching band and a concert band. It also maintains a <i>combo</i> or dance band, which plays during social gatherings and program entertainment numbers for the military.

Binangonan, Rizal 18 Oct 1977. Rap artist, songwriter. He is the son of Orlando Pollisco and Blesilda Condenuevo. He is married to Thea Gomez with whom he has three children. Pollisco graduated from STI Regalado Fairview with a nursing degree in 2006, but his body of work about nation and community was heavily influenced by a life and education cradled by Binangonan and Morong, Rizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in high school from 1991 to 1994 in Morong Rizal, when Pollisco, an avid fan of Original Pilipino Music (OPM) decided that he wanted to be a rapper like Francis Magalona aka Francis M. His first rap name was Venom, until in 1997 he became a member of the rap group Death Threat, during which he claimed the name <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Gloc-9</strong></a>. When he was unceremoniously dropped from the group in 1999, Pollisco became a contractual crew member and dishwasher at restaurants and fast food chains. On the upside, it was during his stint with Death Threat that he met Francis M during a TV guesting in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a> </i></b>(Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!). This was a friendship that would become a constant in Pollisco&rsquo;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While working to contribute to the household expenses of his family, he continued recording demos and dropping these off at different recording companies. In the year 2000, Enrico Santos of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s Star Records picked up one of his demo tapes, and sent someone to look for him in Binangonan. Pollisco was then hired as a music researcher with Star Records, with the opportunity to pitch projects and write songs. In 2002, his song &ldquo;Bakit&rdquo; (Why) was chosen for the Himig <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> Love Songs contest, the first time that Pollisco was introduced as solo artist Gloc-9 in the mainstream. This would lead to his first two albums <b><i>Gloc-9</i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Ako Si&hellip;</i></b> (I Am&hellip;), 2005, both with Star Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wanting to have the freedom to write the songs he aspired to do, Pollisco resigned from his job as music researcher and sought to find his way in the music industry. Unsurprisingly, he was met with the same roadblocks any musician with no connections and backers faces. Given the uncertainty of his future as recording artist, and with a growing family to fend for, Pollisco decided to enroll in a nursing degree, thinking he would just work overseas if his dream of a recording contract did not pan out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Going back to school would provide Pollisco with more material to write about. In 2006, he released a low-budget independent CD entitled <b><i>Limang Kanta Lang</i></b> (Five Songs Only). In 2007, Sony Records would sign him up for a mainstream album <b><i>Diploma</i></b>, which had as carrier single &ldquo;Lando,&rdquo; with a hook sung by Francis M. This officially started his solo mainstream career as Gloc-9, writing the songs that he wants, evolving in his rap skills and musicianship, from one album to the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From <b><i>Matrikula</i></b> (Matriculation), 2009, and <b><i>Talumpati</i></b> (Declamation), 2011, both with Sony Records, and <b><i>Mga Kwento ng Makata</i></b> (Poet&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a>), 2012, and <b><i>Liham at Lihim</i></b> (Letter and Secret), 2013, with Universal Records, Pollisco would build a reputation not just as rapper, but as songwriter who keeps an eye out for stories that are untold, taking on voices of the underrepresented, encouraging his audience to reassess collective truths and critique institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Upuan&rdquo; (Seat), 2009, is a conversation the powerless might have with those in positions of power, demanding that they be held accountable for the disparity between the lives of those in government and the governed. In &ldquo;Walang Natira&rdquo; (No <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>&rsquo;s Left), 2011, Pollisco assesses the state of a nation that is dependent on having its own people leave as Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). &ldquo;Sirena&rdquo; (Mermaid) portrays the narrative of growing up homosexual in this country, and how sexuality does not capture the value of an individual. In &ldquo;Magda,&rdquo; 2013, what Pollisco discusses is the archetypal narrative of the woman brought to prostitution, this time from the voice of the long-lost love who fails to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Across these major hits, what Pollisco does is speak of lives that would otherwise go unnoticed, encouraging collective reflection about those we silence and choose to be blind to. In the process, he is able to speak to an audience that is used to escapist music, shedding light on issues bound to the state of the nation, unlike any other rapper and songwriter of his generation. What Pollisco has proven is that songs in the mainstream can be both popular and relevant, which in turn is what makes his work important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pollisco is a four-time Rap Artist of the Year Awardee of the Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/778\"><strong>Hip-Hop</strong></a> Awards from 2005 to 2009. His song &ldquo;Upuan&rdquo; was the first rap song to win Song of the Year from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards in 2010, and his singles &ldquo;Sirena&rdquo; and &ldquo;Magda&rdquo; won numerous awards at the Awit Awards, PMPC Star Awards for Music, and MYX Music Awards. Pollisco is also a two-time winner of Best Theme Song from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</strong></a>, first for &ldquo;Hari ng Tondo&rdquo; (King of Tondo) which was the theme song for <b><i>Manila Kingpin, The Asiong Salonga Story</i></b>, 2012, and the second for &ldquo;Hindi Pa Tapos&rdquo; which was the theme song for <b><i>Bonifacio, Ang Unang Pangulo</i></b> (Bonifacio, The First President), 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2015, he was featured by MTV Asia&rsquo;s Music Evolution, which hailed him as the Philippines&rsquo; Rap Icon. His song &ldquo;Dapat Tama&rdquo; (Do What is Right) commissioned by GMA News and Public Affairs for its 2013 voter awareness campaign, won the Bronze Medal in the New York TV Festival Awards of 2014.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by Katrina Stuart Santiago</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

They were famous for performing in the vein of American disco group The Village People, complete with costumes and synchronized choreography. &ldquo;Hagibis&rdquo; in Filipino means &ldquo;rush.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The group&rsquo;s music is considered a prime example of the <b>Manila Sound</b> genre, which is known for being &ldquo;catchy and melodic, smooth, lightly orchestrated, [and an] accessible folk/soft rock.&rdquo; Hagibis was a large influence in Pinoy rock music&rsquo;s evolution and the boom of Original Pilipino Music (OPM) during the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The group was packaged to exude a macho image, as illustrated by the lyrics and subject matter of their songs that deal mainly with female beauty and the female form. Their self-titled debut album <b><i>Hagibis</i></b>,<i> </i>1979, was one such record and it produced the hit songs &ldquo;Legs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nanggigigil&rdquo; (Antsy), and &ldquo;Katawan&rdquo; (Body). The latter track was used as the opening and closing theme of the popular TV sitcom <b><i>Palibhasa Lalake</i></b> (Because They&rsquo;re Men), which was aired in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> from 1987 to 1998. Their subsequent albums include <b><i>HumaHagibis </i></b>(In a Rush), 1980, under Blackgold Records and <b><i>Walang Katapat </i></b>(Incomparable), 1997, which was distributed by Star Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, Hagibis starred in a film directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4435\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Tony Ferrer</strong></a></strong></a>, titled <b><i>Legs</i></b><i>,<b> Katawan</b>,<b> Babae </b></i>(Legs, Body, Woman). The group has also served as commercial endorsers for Honda motorcycles and Ginebra San Miguel. When Hagibis disbanded in the 1980s, former member Sonny Parsons went on to become an action star and, later, councilor of Marikina City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hagibis is currently back with a new lineup, which includes original members Parsons and Respall, alongside new members, Carlos Nabiula, and Pete Gatela.

He was the former lead bass guitarist of the iconic Filipino band Juan de la Cruz in the 1970s, sharing the limelight with rock pioneers Pepe Smith and Wally Gonzalez. His grandmother, Nanay Inday, was his earliest influence, lulling him to sleep with her guitar playing. At the age of 14, Hanopol started earning a living from playing the instrument. His exploits include being the leader of the band in the seminary and, in 1967, he joined yet another band that flew to Vietnam one month shy of his college commencement rites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His musical career spanned three and a half decades of several hits and 20 albums, which earned him multiple recognition from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Awards and gold prizes, notably for his song &ldquo;Laki sa Layaw&rdquo; (Spoiled Brat). His third album, <b><i>Lagablab </i></b>(Burning),<i> </i>displays verses from the Psalms and the Ten Commandments. He also mentored the hugely popular band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4005\"><strong>Hagibis</strong></a>, writing several of their early songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In April 2001, Hanopol collaborated with popular Filipino music icons Fredie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\"><strong>Rey Valera</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4167\"><strong>Vehnee Saturno</strong></a> in their album, <b><i>Saga</i></b>, which aimed to &ldquo;inspire Filipinos&hellip; in the music industry&hellip; as well as to support Pilipino music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hanopol relocated to the United States in 1982, living in Florida and New York, and continues to perform with bands in concerts across that country, before returning to the Philippines in 1993.

Sampaloc, Manila 12 Jun 1882 d. Manila 10 Feb 1945. Composer, conductor, teacher. He is the only child of Isidoro Hernandez and Josefa Concepcion. He showed a natural talent for music when he learned to play the piano without the benefit of instruction in his early years. He took formal lessons in solfege under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4021\"><strong>Cayetano Jacobe</strong></a> when he was 12 years old and advanced lessons in solfege under a certain Capt Jose Fernandez and later with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4173\"><strong>Rosalio Silos</strong></a>, one of the first musicians in the Spanish Regiment No 72 in 1894. He took his first lessons in piano under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> in 1895 and continued with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3993\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong></a> from 1896 to 1897. From 1898 to 1901, he took up lessons not only in piano but also in composition and principles of instrumentation with an Italian musician, Santino Coppa. In 1896, he entered the Colegio de San Juan de Letran where he earned his <i>bachiller en artes</i> (bachelor of arts) in 1898. He continued his higher studies at the School of Law at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) where he earned his law certificate in 1902.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon the invitation of a French diplomat, a patron who frequented the Bohemian Club where Hernandez worked, he went to Saigon from 1902 to 1904, and held the position &ldquo;Chef d&rsquo; Orchestre au Cafe de la Musique.&rdquo; Upon returning to the Philippines in 1905, he served as a clerk in the law division of the Executive Bureau. In 1906 he became a second clerk in the Quartermaster of the Constabulary Bureau in Fort McKinley. It is believed that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a>, then director of the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music who got impressed with Hernandez&rsquo;s chamber piece <b><i>Poemas del Hogar</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1932\"><strong>Poems</strong></a> about Home), appointed him as instructor in science and composition in 1926 at UP, where he taught harmony, harmonic analysis, keyboard analysis, dictation, sight-reading, and transposition. Beginning in the 1930s, Hernandez also worked as music director for Parlatone Pictures and taught at St Theresa&rsquo;s College in San Marcelino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hernandez got his bachelor of music in composition degree from UP in 1933. For his recital, he played his <b><i>Piano <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> in D minor</i></b> (Fantasie, First Movement), which he wrote under the mentorship of Jeno von Tackacs. This first movement concerto was dedicated to his daughter Carmela, who played it complete with the other two movements&mdash;romance (second movement) and rondo (third movement)&mdash;in her piano graduation recital on 23 Jan 1939. The concert drew the attention of the press because <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4008\"><strong>Juan Hernandez</strong></a>, the father, conducted the orchestra for her daughter who was also his student at UP. Carmela was Hernandez&rsquo;s daughter with second wife Ascension Manio Garcia. The piano concerto was later performed by Carmela&rsquo;s daughter Titas Gonzales Gayoso in her piano graduation recital at UST in 17 Mar 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hernandez&rsquo;s works previous to his concerto were waltzes like &ldquo;Rosarito,&rdquo; 1900, dedicated to Rosario Lozada who was his first wife; &ldquo;Primavera&rdquo; (Spring), 1908; and &ldquo;Crepuscul&rdquo; (Twilight), &ldquo;Gratitud&rdquo; (Gratitude), and &ldquo;Flirteo&rdquo; (Flirt), all in 1912; as well as the two-step &ldquo;Internal Revenue&rdquo; and the gavotte &ldquo;Pintakasy,&rdquo; both 1905; the patriotic song &ldquo;Maria Clara,&rdquo; 1907, based on the poem of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>; the choral work &ldquo;Alcazano Flotante,&rdquo; 1912; and the Spanish serenade &ldquo;Nuits de Lune,&rdquo; 1914.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hernandez is also most remembered for his music for theater, notably the music for the <b>sarsuwela</b> <b><i>Minda Mora</i></b>, 1904, which contained the famous song &ldquo;Mora, Bella Flor&rdquo; that his daughter Carmela popularized in <b><i>Sunshine Hour</i></b> at radio station KZRM and the Tagalog melodrama <b><i>Lukso ng Dugo </i></b>(Leap of Blood) in 1906. Hernandez&rsquo;s other works are: <b><i>Ang Puso ng Isang Pilipina </i></b>(The Heart of a Filipina) and <b><i>Ang Krus na Pula</i></b> (The Red Cross), 1919, <b><i>Ang Guardia Nacional </i></b>(The National Guard), 1921, <b><i>Ang Mutya ng Silangan</i></b> (The Muse of the East), 1922, and <b><i>La Gloria (</i></b>The Glory), 1931.

Roxas City 20 Dec 1923 d. Quezon City 15 Jan 2008. Composer, priest. Born to Supreme Court Justice Jose M. Hontiveros and Vicenta Pardo, he comes from an artistically and musically inclined family, his elder sister being stage actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2991\"><strong>Daisy Hontiveros-Avellana</strong></a>, wife of film director and National Artist for film Lamberto Avellana. Film director and actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2757\"><strong>Jose Mari Avellana</strong></a> and visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3424\"><strong>Ivi Avellana-Cosio</strong></a> are his nephew and niece respectively. He entered San Jose Seminary in 1945, and later joined the Jesuit order. He obtained his master&rsquo;s degree in philosophy at the Berchmans College, Cebu in 1949, and his doctorate in sacred theology from the Gregorian University in Rome in 1958. From 1958 to 1989, he taught theology at San Jose Seminary and the Loyola School of Theology, also serving as the latter&rsquo;s president from 1983 to 1989. In 1989, he became dean of the St John Vianney Seminary in Cagayan de Oro City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon after Hontiveros began his priestly duties, he was assigned as choirmaster of San Jose Seminary. Though he lacked formal training in composition, he arranged music for the choir and composed original music with English, Latin, and later Tagalog texts. In 1971, Hontiveros arranged the songs for a liturgical concert sung by a choir of the urban poor. This was the beginning of an annual tradition that spanned the years 1971 to 1978. His first liturgical composition in Tagalog was &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>ng Bayan sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>&rdquo; (The People&rsquo;s Mass in Song). Some of his songs are: &ldquo;Awit ng Mangingisda&rdquo; (Song of the Fisherfolk), &ldquo;Pagtitipan&rdquo; (Tryst), &ldquo;Pananagutan&rdquo; (Responsibility), &ldquo;Dakilang Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Great Love), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/447\"><strong>Dapit</strong></a>-hapon&rdquo; (Dusk). Lyrics were sometimes written by Hontiveros himself or by his friends and colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, Hontiveros helped organize the Jesuit Music Ministry, which is responsible for publishing and taping many of his compositions, along with those he has inspired. In 1972, he cut his first long-playing record <b><i>Luwalhati sa Diyos </i></b>(Glory to God). In 1975, he collaborated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\"><strong>Rolando S.

Among their many hit songs were &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re the Miss Universe of My Life), &ldquo;Pers Lab&rdquo; (First Love), &ldquo;Annie Batungbakal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beh Buti Nga&rdquo; (Suits You), and &ldquo;Bongga Ka &rsquo;Day&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Fabulous, Pal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The release of &ldquo;Miss Universe&rdquo; rode on the lavish promotions for the Miss Universe pageant held in Manila in 1974 while &ldquo;Pers Lab&rdquo; established Hotdog as a major recording band. Their music touched on the theme of love, rendering it casually, but without the typical mushiness common to many Filipino songs. The band initiated what has been called the <b>Manila Sound</b>, a very light kind of pop music that uses colloquial or Taglish (Tagalog and English) language, and is expressive of juvenile sentiments. Some of their hit songs were adapted into movies with the band&rsquo;s participation such as <b><i>Bongga Ka &rsquo;Day</i></b>, 1974; <b><i>Hotdog: Unang Kagat</i></b> (Hotdog: First Bite), 1975; and <b><i>Annie Batungbakal</i></b> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, 1979. The band was instrumental in launching the solo careers of musicians like songwriter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4015\"><strong>Lorrie Ilustre</strong></a>, and singers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a> and Ella del Rosario. The group officially disbanded in 1984, closing a successful band career with another hit tune titled &ldquo;Manila.&rdquo; In 1988, they had a reunion concert at Rizal Theater, Makati City. Other reunion concerts followed in 2011 and 2012 titled <b><i>Hotdog</i>&hellip;</b><i> <b>Isa Pa Nga! </b></i>(Hotdog&hellip; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> More Time!) held at Dusit Thani Hotel, Makati City. The band has produced an eight-album collection of 250 songs, 25 of which became gold records. In 2009, the band received the Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written byGalileo Zafraupdated by Connie Ladrido</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Ibaan, Batangas 8 Aug 1866 d. Batangas, Batangas 3 Jun 1922. Bandmaster, conductor, composer, educator, and businessman. The youngest of five children of Nicolas Ilustre and Narcisa Saez from Batangas, Lorenzo sang with the choir of Ibaan Church and played with the town&rsquo;s local brass band. Lorenzo married his violin student, Apolonia Guerra y Pastor (also from Ibaan, Batangas) with whom he had six children (Aurea, Julia, Concorida, Fracita, Epitacio and Cipriano). His first musical training was under Padre Braulio Enriquez of Ibaan Church. He was later taught by his uncle, Lino Ilustre, who was a composer, organist of Batangas City church, and conductor of Banda Batangas. The young Lorenzo played the clarinet in this brass band and, at times, was asked to conduct it. On one occasion, he was spotted by bandmasters of the Spanish regimentary band who were scouting for new Filipino music leaders. Upon invitation and passing the competitive examination of the Spanish military, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4014\"><strong>Lorenzo Ilustre</strong></a> became the bandmaster of the 71st Regiment of the Spanish Army, one of the seven regiments stationed in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era. In his brief assignment from 1888 to 1897, he traveled with his troop to Cebu and Iligan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ilustre later gave up his post as band leader to join his brother, Maj Mateo Ilustre, who was in the revolutionary army against the Spaniards in the towns of Rosario, Taysan, and Ibaan, under the command of Gen Miguel Malvar. Upon the change of colonial masters from the Spaniards to the Americans, their guerilla company continued to fight against the American troops. However, the impending defeat of the guerilla movement forced their surrender to Capt D.N. Boughton, 3rd Cavalry, in charge of the civil affairs of the old provincial capitol of Batangas. As a reward for surrendering, Lorenzo was appointed leader of the US Military Band in Batangas, in recognition of his brilliance as a former conductor of the Spanish Military Regimental Band. Under Ilustre&rsquo;s direction, the US Military Regimental Band of Batangas provided public concerts in Manila and other provinces. This obliged him to travel extensively, which became too strenuous that hisqaA stomach ulcer developed. Thus, he resigned from the American military service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon retirement, Ilustre founded and conducted the Rizal Orchestra, which gave weekly Sunday afternoon concerts in Batangas City plaza. He also established the Banda Ibaan and an all-female <b>rondalla</b> group. In his weekly visits to Ibaan, he trained 40-50 musicians and composed music for their band performances. Aside from these, he also trained students to play musical instruments, particulary the clarinet and the violin. Ilustre also ventured into business by opening Batangas City&rsquo;s biggest single-floor supermarket called &ldquo;Ang Kaibigan,&rdquo; located at the busiest part of the city, Rizal Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon the founding of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (aka Aglipay Church), he joined this new nationalist church, composing music for it. His music for Easter is still being sung at the Batangas City Aglipay Church by <b>cantoras</b> who learned the music by oral tradition. Despite his conversion to the Iglesia Filipina Independiente, his remains are interred at the baptistery of the now Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, the main Catholic Church in the city of Batangas, resting beside the select few but very prominent citizens of Batangas City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his compositions are: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\"><strong>Mi Ultimo Adios</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Last Farewell), &ldquo;Himno al Recibimiento de los Restos de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a>&rdquo; (Hymn Welcoming the Remains of Apolinario Mabini), &ldquo;Ang Pangingibang Bayan sa Sariling Lupa&rdquo; (Migration in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>&rsquo;s Own Land), &ldquo;Diwa ng Bagumbayan&rdquo; (Spirit of Bagumbayan), &ldquo;Himno Mabini&rdquo; (Mabini&rsquo;s Hymn), &ldquo;Encarnacion <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/789\"><strong>Polka</strong></a></strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gregorio Himno&rdquo; (Gregorio&rsquo;s Hymn), &ldquo;Ang Samyo ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Scent of Jasmine), &ldquo;La Triste Noche Feliz&rdquo; (A Sad Christmas Eve), &ldquo;A las Ocho de la Noche&rdquo; (Eight in the Evening), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a> a Un Amor&rdquo; (Memento for a Beloved), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\"><strong>Jota</strong></a></strong></a> Rizal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tagala Batangue&ntilde;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a> Cantada&rdquo; (Sung Mass), &ldquo;Misa Pastorela&rdquo; (Mass for the Traditional Christmas Play), and &ldquo;Sa Dakong Sikatan&rdquo; (Where the Sun Rises). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Recorded over Po&rsquo;s four-track recording machine and launched in Dec 1981, it sold 500 copies off the rack and orders poured in for months to come. Inang Laya started performing before large crowds in assemblies, concerts, strikes, demolition areas, and protest actions. In early 1982, UP Tropang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>Bodabil</strong></a> (later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3166\"><strong>Peryante</strong></a>), headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\"><strong>Chris Millado</strong></a>, invited Inang Laya to be the musical director and composer for its production of Marina Feleo&rsquo;s play on the peasant movement and the Hukbalahap, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/534\"><strong>Dahong Palay</strong></a></i></b> (Rice Stalks/Rice-field Snake).

They captured in song the dramatic events of the period, some of which they directly experienced. Demetillo&rsquo;s husband, Edru Abraham, and brother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3971\"><strong>Lester Demetillo</strong></a>, contributed in evolving the type of music suitable for their lyrics. In early 1985, the duo held a concert in Australia for women&rsquo;s groups, from which came a recording titled <b><i>Song of Freedom</i></b><i>.</i> In 1986, they joined commercial artists from the music industry in making an album carrying the People Power song, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> ng Pilipino sa Mundo&rdquo; (Filipinos&rsquo; Gift to the World).

Alfafara was born in Carcar, Cebu, in 1881. Not much is known about his early life except that an uncle, who was a balitaw practitioner, taught him the dance movements of the balitaw and that Indong quickly excelled in the form because of his natural gift for verse and rhyme and his resonant, melodious voice. Caniban was born in Mambaling, Cebu City in 1900, though other sources cite her birth year as 1906. She learned the art of the balitaw from her parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alfafara was the more experienced artist, performing with other women-partners whom he helped train, before he met Caniban. The two must have teamed up first around 1920. By the 1920s, they had become extremely popular, touring the towns of Cebu as well as places in Bohol, Leyte, Negros Oriental, and Mindanao. They were invited to perform during fiestas, carnivals, and other festivities, private as well as public. The two were in such demand that they had to turn down invitations. They commanded a high price for performing and audiences would shower them with coins as they performed. There are references to other balitaw performers before <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2489\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4017\"><strong>Indong-Colasing</strong></a></strong></a>, such as Hermenegildo(Amoros)Solon and his daughter Meding, ca 1916, but Indong-Colasing was the most popular pair of the prewar period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In an interview published in <b><i>The Freeman </i></b>of 19 Nov 1926, Caniban said that she spontaneously composed the verses as she performed but that she and her partner would decide on a subject or theme beforehand, e.g., the unfortunate maiden, the deceitful promise, wealth breeds misery, or the patient wife. In the course of the performance, one of the partners might stray from the theme, thus testing the other&rsquo;s skill in improvising without missing a beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Caniban possessed an amulet which she believed gave her the power to attract attention. She carried this <i>mutya </i>in a bottle of oil tied around her waist and anointed herself with the oil before a performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the balitaw began to decline, the team split up.

Brooke&rsquo;s Point, Palawan, ca 1943. d. 30 Nov 2013. Palawanon storyteller and musician. He was born near the head of the river in Makagwa valley at the foothill of Mantalingayan mountain at Brookes Point, Southern Palawan. He was not only a well-known epic chanter, poet, and story teller, but an outstanding percussionist and <b>kusyapi</b> (two-stringed lute) musician. In addition, he also played the <b>aroding</b> (mouth harp) and <b>babarak </b>(ring flute).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Intaray is best remembered for his narrative songs, notably the <i>tultul</i> (long narrratives) of M&auml;mininbin, which French linguistic-anthropologist Nicole Revel recorded in 1971 when Intaray was just 28 years old. His rendition was consequently transcribed, translated to French and English, and published in Paris in 2000. Like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5753\"><strong>Usuy</strong></a>, who was another eminent traditional Palawanon tultul master, Intaray&rsquo;s songs illustrate the process of oral transmission in which a traditional artist projects&mdash;not an individual art per se&mdash;but communally-held cultural knowledge, truths, and values. Using improvisatory, formulaic techniques of remembering words, Intaray was exemplary for his creativity, which enabled him to chant a complex yet coherent structures of voice and meaning all night long, even for successive nights. The narratives of this chant are about mythical heroes and heroines who embody desired Palawan virtues. They teach ideal ways of maintaining good, balanced, and harmonious social relationships, even as these entertain listeners as well. Intaray knew not only the verbal art tultul, but also <i>sudsungit</i> or short narratives, and <i>tuturan</i> or myths of origin and teachings of ancestors. On the kusyapi, he was remembered for his <b>kulilal</b>, which is a lyrical song genre on seven-syllabled verses (<i>karang</i>) about love, a type of music based on a scale with semitones and which is accompanied by the bigger-sized kusyapi, a two-stringed lute played by a man. Kulilal can also be played with the <b>pagang</b>, a bamboo polychordal zither, played by a woman. In addition, Intaray also played the <b>bagit</b>, a strictly instrumental music genre based on a scale with no semitones and played on the smalle-sized kusyapi. In contrast to kulilal, bagit music depicts the movements and sounds of nature and of animals like birds, dogs, and monkeys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the realm of ceremonial instrumental music, Intaray was an expert in <b>basal </b>or rhythm ensemble music. Along with rice wine drinking, dancing, and singing that are heard in joyous collective celebrations like <i>tambilaw</i> or thanksgiving after harvests, this music conveys the fundamental value of sharing among the Palawan. Basal music reflects this value for no instrument predominates in the group. Instead, techniques of hocketing (alternation of parts) create a counterpoint of rhythms and colors that symbolizes musical joint effort. A pair of <b>sanang</b> (hanging gongs with narrow rims) produces bright sounds that interlock with the dry beats of the <b>gimbal </b>(drum). These, in turn, are counterposed by one, two or three wide-rimmed <b>agung</b>, which produce low booming sounds. The very essence of musical interlock points to creative cooperation and togetherness that is an attribute of most traditional Southeast Asian musics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For his artistic gifts and achievements, Intaray was conferred the title Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan in 1993.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Makati City 3 Jan 1946. Musician and entrepreneur. Ramon Pereyra Jacinto distinguished himself as an enterprising and creative musician, establishing his own private company, RJ Enterprises. When he was only 15 years old, he produced, sold records, and promote his high school band, his own RJ and The Riots. He would later become the senior vice president in their family steel business as well as founding the legendary rock radio station, DZRJ. He also set up RJ Bistro, which was renowned for resuscitating the live performances of local bands during the years following the 1986 EDSA uprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manned by his volunteer group of classmates, DZRJ was the laboratory for on-air experiments of radio concepts unknown and unheard of before in Philippine entertainment history. Easily, DZRJ developed a cult-like following, doing away with rampant <i>payola</i> (recording company fee to radio stations) and introducing alternative music to Filipino teenagers. It was the first station to give exposure to such rock legends as the Ventures, the Shadows, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Lil Richard, and Elvis. Likewise, RJ directed his station and put an emphasis on playing the music of local talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jacinto would also be responsible for making the local band scene flourish with his insistence on showcasing local talents in his club, the RJ Bistro, as well as enshrining the importance of the guitar as instrument when he established a guitar manufacturing business based on his own penchant for producing specific sounds that he wanted to hear while performing with his band. His RJ Guitar Centers continue to provide various, world-class RJ Guitar models and handles the exclusive distributorship of coveted Taylor, Traben, and Michael Kelly guitars and Belcat products in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jacinto&rsquo;s legacy to the music scene owes largely to his ties with Ninoy Aquino and his collaboration with local bands in the 80s, i.e., after his return to the country following his and his family&rsquo;s exile abroad for more than a decade. He continues to manage his businesses, while also performing weekly at the RJ Bar for <b><i>Thank God It&rsquo;s RJ!</i></b> every Friday. In addition, he hosts the <b><i>RJ Sunday Jam</i></b>, which is simulcast through 2nd Avenue RJ and RJ<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>.3 FM on Sundays from 9 am&ndash;12 noon and performs once a month at the Captain&rsquo;s Bar of the Mandarin Hotel in Makati as part of <b><i>The Greatest and The Latest Concert Series</i></b><i> </i>of RJ100.3FM<i>.</i><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written byLara T.

Lumbang, Laguna 8 Aug 1876. d. 17 Jun 1940. Violinist. He was the son of Juan Jacobe and Cecilia Dimaranan. He married Ana Protacio with whom he had five children, but no one of them survived. He was a choirboy in the Catholic church of his town. On his own he learned how to play the small violin his father gave him as a gift. At age eight, he studied violin in Manila under his uncle, Ubaldo Jacobe, bandmaster of a Spanish military band. Then he studied under Maestro Velasquez, who introduced him to opera and concert music. In his middle teens, Jacobe joined Pedro Gruet&rsquo;s orchestra, the best known in the city during the late 1800s, and played in theaters and for foreign opera companies. At this time, he also learned composition and directing from an Italian music professor, Ciro Cavalieri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jacobe first performed in public as a violinist in 1900, playing &ldquo;Fantasia&rdquo; from <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor</i></b>.<b> </b>Arrested for alleged involvement during the Philippine-American war in the midst of his budding career, he persuaded the authorities to free him by giving a dazzling demonstration of his musical prowess. Resuming his performances, he captivated the metropolitan audience and received glowing reviews from the local press. In 1909, he was part of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a> which gave concerts in many American cities. He became known to American audiences and reaped praise from American critics, who said he deserved to be called the &ldquo;second Pablo de Sarasate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At various periods, Jacobe was a member of the Manila Monday <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>e Symphony Orchestra, ManilaSymphonyOrchestra, and the Philharmonic Orchestra of the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music. The public often gave him standing ovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was also &ldquo;a graceful, elegant, and aristocratic band and orchestra conductor,&rdquo; according to AntonioJ.Molina. Among the bands and orchestras he directed were the Orquesta Rizal, Tiwi Orchestra, Banda Pagsanjan, Banda Cuaderno, Banda Kawit, and Banda Tipas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Besides his public performances, Jacobe taught in various schools. In 1904 he was professor of violin in the Centro Artistico, Manila, and in 1916, became a member of the faculty of the newly opened UP Conservatory of Music. He also taught at the Centro de Bellas Artes, Centro de Artistas de Manila, San Juan de Letran, San Beda, and La Salle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his compositions, none of which can be located at present, were &ldquo;Zorilla,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tres Dalagas&rdquo; (Three Maidens), &ldquo;Trining,&rdquo; &ldquo;Concha,&rdquo; &ldquo;Juanita,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amparo.&rdquo; He also composed the musical scores of the following <b>sarsuwela</b>:<b> <i>Mabuhay ang Filipinas! </i></b>(Long Live the Philippines!), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/676\"><strong>Tatlong Maria</strong></a> </i></b>(Three Marys), and <b><i>Amor Patria </i></b>(Love for the Motherland).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written byEspiridion Arsenio Manuel and Rosalinda Galang</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

San Juan, Rizal 13 May 1927. d. 30 Nov 2009. Pianist, conductor, pedagogue. He was the third of eight sons of Lino Jose of Baliuag, Bulacan and Emilia San Luis of Marilao, Bulacan. Lino worked in a Manila printery but was a prizewinning poet on the side; he declamed <i>tulang pamutong</i> to local beauties as they were crowned on festive days. Emilia was a seamstress. Regalado married his piano student, Remedios Aranas Trota of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> City in 1954. Remedios herself studied voice under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>. The couple have six children, two of whom, Regalado Jr, and Ricardo, are writers. Regalado studied at the Burgos Elementary School and finished his high school at the University of Manila. He began his music lessons with a neighbor, the mother of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2398\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></a></strong></a>, in whose house there was a piano. While still young, Jose fractured his right middle finger while fixing his bike&mdash;improper treatment left that finger permanently bent like an L-hook, but this was never noticed by his future audiences. Lino often took his son to compete in <i>pagalingan sa piano</i> (piano-playing competitions) in fiestas and bring home some extra prize money. In his teens, Jose played the piano accompanying silent movies at the Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a>. Here he accompanied Jose Mossessgeld in his production of the opera <b><i>Rigoletto</i></b>. During the Japanese occcupation he took piano lessons at Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. In 1946, he obtained his teacher&rsquo;s diploma from the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music, then located at the Philippine General Hospital compound. This was ahead of his high school diploma in 1947. In 1951, he began studies at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. In 1952, he obtained his master&rsquo;s degree and, in 1953, his artist&rsquo;s diploma. He was also a scholar at the Mary Washington College, University of Virginia, and a Walter Huffman Personal Scholar in Composition in 1952. UP granted him an additional year of study, and in 1953 he graduated at the top of his class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose&rsquo;s first major performance as a concert pianist was at the Independence Day Concert at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum in 1946. His concert on 18 Oct 1947 at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Gymnasium launched his career. The program included the Philippine premier of the then ultra-modern <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> for Piano and Orchestra </i></b>by Shostakovich. Despite a blackout, his unwavering delivery of Chopin&rsquo;s <b><i>Polonaise in A Flat Major</i></b> landed him in Society pages. He has played with almost all Filipino conductors as well as with George Hurst, Helen Quach, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\"><strong>Herbert Zipper</strong></a>, and other foreign conductors. Jose premiered the piano concertos of Filipino composers Eliseo Pajaro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4156\"><strong>Lucino Sacramento</strong></a>, and Rodolfo Cornejo. He concertized extensively here and abroad. In the 1960s, he and Remedios, billed as &ldquo;Two hearts that beat as one,&rdquo; gave duo piano concerts all over the country. Jose also accompanied most of the top Filipino artists of his time&mdash;especially memorable were his renditions of Philippine <b>kundiman</b> and German <b>lieder</b> with baritone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3978\"><strong>Aurelio Estanislao</strong></a>. He was commissioned to assist many visiting performers, such as soprano Montserrat Caball&eacute; and cellist Pierre Fournier. He played <b><i>Liszt&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\"><strong>Sonata</strong></a> in B Minor</i></b> as Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev did a pas de deux at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. His last major performance was the <b><i>Concerto for Piano and Orchestra</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a> in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He served as resident conductor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> from 1972-78. As the first music director and conductor of the Metro Manila Symphony Orchestra in 1978-83, he brought music to many audiences through the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> series at the Rizal Park. Ever protective of the ordinary musician&rsquo;s lot, he once held up the second act of <b><i>Rigoletto</i> </b>until the sponsors agreed to come up with the salaries of the orchestra. He conducted for foreign artists like Paul Badura-Skoda, Natalia Makarova, and many others. He also conducted the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose began teaching at the newly created UST Conservatory of Music in 1947. Among his co-teachers were Julian Esteban Anguita, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3952\"><strong>Bernardino Custodio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4078\"><strong>Mercedes Matias-Santiago</strong></a>, Antonio J. Molina, and Salvacion Oppus-I&ntilde;iguez. His fellow students then included vocalists Grace Turla Melendres and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3913\"><strong>Remedios Bosch-Jimenez</strong></a>, pianists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4201\"><strong>Benjamin Tupas</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4141\"><strong>Reynaldo Reyes</strong></a>, and Leandro Locsin. He returned to UP to teach in 1948, after concertizing with the Municipal Symphony Orchestra of Manila in a tour to Hongkong, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a>, Yokohama, Hawaii and Guam. At UP, he became chair of the piano department in 1966 until his retirement in 1992. He continued teaching until shortly before his death, investing more than 60 years rearing generations of musicians. He also taught at Santa Isabel College, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, and College of the Holy Spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jose received numerous honors and citations. He was Accompanist of the Year, 1949. He won first prize over 130 contestants in a TV piano competition in Baltimore, Maryland in 1952. The following year, he also received the American Student Leaders Award, and upon his return to the Philippines, was named Filipino Musician of the Year by the UP Conservatory of Music. Among his other awards are: Award of Music in the Field of Music and Pedagogy and Musicianship, UP College of Music, 1960; Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan, City of Manila, 1973; Outstanding Pianist, Music and Arts Center, Malolos, Bulacan, 1977; and Gintong Ama Award, 1991. He was appointed professor emeritus by the UP College of Music in 1992.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written byMa.

The band&rsquo;s first major appearance was at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a> Rock Festival in Dec 1970. This was followed by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> production of the rock opera <b><i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i></b> by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber where Tagarro played the role of Judas Iscariot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Juan de la Cruz Band</strong></a> easily distinguished itself from the outset by performing only their own original compositions. This was a major break from the prevailing trend in the Filipino music scene where local versions of foreign hits were popular and deemed viable by the recording companies. Despite its effort, it would still take some years before the band would be on firm footing with its own works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ensuing years found the group in shaky existence with its constantly changing membership. Fortuno, Labrador, and Cruz left to form their own band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> Bayan. Tagarro soon followed suit. Replacements came in the persons of Clifford Ho, Bobot Guerrero, Romy Santos, and Rene Sogueco, who also left for other bands despite the critical acclaim garnered by the Juan de la Cruz Band&rsquo;s debut album <b><i>Up In Arms</i></b> for the Sunshine label of Vicor Music Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in 1974 when Gonzales unveiled the new Juan de la Cruz Band which would rock the local music industry. Forming a powerhouse trio with Wally were Joey Smith, who would later come to be known as Pepe Smith, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>. The trio were former members of Zero History which performed in Tokyo. Smith, a singer, composer, and drummer, and Hanopol, a singer, composer and bassist, joined the rock trio Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki with Japanese artist Shinki Chen, which recorded for Atlantic Records in Japan. Smith was earlier also a member of The Downbeats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Juan de la Cruz Band made its bow with the album <b><i>Himig Natin</i></b> (Our Music) in 1974. The title song became the theme of Filipino rockers who had at long last found something to call their own. It also introduced Pinoy rock as a music genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Juan de la Cruz Band went on to record three more albums <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1468\"><strong>Maskara</strong></a> </i></b>(Mask),<i> <b>Super Session,</b></i> and <b><i>Kahit Anong Mangyari </i></b>(No Matter What)<i>.</i> They are the ultimate iconic figures of Pinoy rock and their hits, which include &ldquo;Himig Natin<i>,</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Balong Malalim&rdquo; (Deep Well)<i>, &ldquo;</i>Laki Sa Layaw&rdquo; (Spoiled Brat), &ldquo;No Touch,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1517\"><strong>Titser</strong></a>&rsquo;s Enemi Number <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>&rdquo; (Teacher&rsquo;s Enemy No. 1) laid out the groundwork for the standards by which Pinoy rock is now measured.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written byCarmencita A.

Founded in 1989 by art studies professor Pedro &ldquo;Edru&rdquo; Abraham Jr, the group&rsquo;s goal is to promote and experiment with Filipino musical practices through the use of indigenous instruments from different ethnolinguistic groups across the Philippine archipelago (Abraham, 2015). Kontra-GaPi&rsquo;s repertoire is a fusion of newly created music drawn from various traditions like the Maguindanao and Maranao <b>kulintangan</b> from Mindanao, and the <b>gangsa</b> (flat gong) and bamboo music of the northern Mountain Province and Kalinga. The group also incorporates local dances into stylized choreographies like the traditional <i>pangalay</i> and <i>igal</i> of the Samal-Sama Dilaut (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>) peoples in the south, and the <i>ati-atihan</i> in the Visayas. Every year Kontra-GaPi trains 15 to 20 new recruits. Since its inception, the ensemble has had around 600 student members perform with the group locally and in tours abroad. They had visited the United States in 2000, Australia in 2003, Thailand in 2009, and China for the World Exposition in 2010. Kontra-GaPi also represented the country in six folkloric festivals in 2013, where they earned distinctions. In 2014, music percussion student Jaimar Palispis officially became the group&rsquo;s associate director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kontra-GaPi also maintains an active sociopolitical voice, conscious in its advocacy for the welfare of indigenous communities, human rights, and the environment. These advocacies remain in line with the group&rsquo;s stand against anything that &ldquo;stifles freedom, individuality, and inventiveness,&rdquo; hence the additional layer of meaning in the group&rsquo;s name as kontra (against) -<i>gapi </i>(shackle). With its rhythmically driven soundscape, Kontra-GaPi highlights the more participatory and communal aspect of music making, maintaining the philosophy that creativity can also be derived from within the community and that artistic excellence is not the sole property of &ldquo;experts&rdquo; nor of &ldquo;leaders in the power centers of music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kontra-GaPi received the UP Diliman Chancellor&rsquo;s Recognition for Outstanding Achievement in the Performing Arts in 1996.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written byIsidora Miranda</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abraham 2015; Caruncho 1996; Kontragapi Wordpress 2015.</p>\r\n"

The choir was initially intended to enhance the midnight Mass of Christmas of 1969 through music and songs. The first groups were composed of 24 boys, aged 9 to 14 years old who were all students of St Joseph&rsquo;s Academy, the parochial school adjacent to the church. After passing auditions, the boys undergo systematic training in music before being chosen to be members of the choir. The choir is supported by the Las Pi&ntilde;as parish and performs regularly for the Las Pi&ntilde;as Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The choir became known after winning third prize in the first National Children&rsquo;s Choir Competition organized by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) in 1972 and first prize in the third edition of the same competition, now under the National Music Competitions for Young Artists, in 1974.

In 1989, three of its members joined the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Little Singers&rdquo; held during the bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution in Paris. Moreover, the group has performed at Malaca&ntilde;an Presidential Palace, and in all major cities and towns all over the country.

All their festival performances have been documented on the yearly <b><i>Highlights</i></b> (cassette and CD) since 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early exposure to music has made several alumni decide in favor of a career in music. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of them is organ builder Cealwyn Tagle, who, together with his company&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a> Organ Builders&mdash;is responsible for the restoration of some of the historical organs in the country. A second alumnus is Armando Salarza, who now teaches organ at the University of the Philippines College of Music and St Scholastica College&rsquo;s School of Music. His formation in Graz and Vienna as organist and church musician for 10 years also benefited the choir, which he headed as conductor and musical director since 2003. Under his direction the choir was nominated for best choral group in the 2005 and 2006 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Awards, and was declared champion of the children&rsquo;s choirs category during the fifth World Choir Games held in Graz, Austria in 2008. The choirmasters who helped build a 45-year-old tradition of choral singing in Las Pi&ntilde;as are Fr Leo Renier, 1969-74; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4195\"><strong>Engracio Tempongko</strong></a> with Zenas Lozada as accompanist, 1974-79; Fr Leo Renier and Donna Ofrasio as accompanist and trainer of the preparatory choir, 1979-95; Renato Cortes, 1995-2000; Ricardo Mazo, 2000-01; Gerardo Fajardo, 2001-03; and Armando Salarza, 2003-present. Music has been their medium to train characters and personalities. They have proven that it is still possible to find young boys who feel rewarded not by money or stardom but by the mere satisfaction of a good performance, and who never stop striving for perfection.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> Carunungan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4839\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4840\"><strong>Elmer L.

It had 11 charter members, with conductor-composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a> as founding chairman. From 1956 until 1998, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a> served as its chairperson. From the original 11 charter members, the League has accepted only 27 members until 1990, many of whom have later been conferred the National Artist award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Until 1968, the LFC organized annual festivals of Philippine music featuring the new major works of its members, through subsidies from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) continued the holding of the annual Philippine Music Festival from 1969 to 1990. Starting 1976, the LFC, together with the CCP, conducted annual nationwide competitions for young composers, which have generated more than 40 new works in varied forms, ranging from art songs to chamber music, piano compositions, and symphonic music. It also held workshops and seminars to promote contemporary works among Filipino composers. It received substantial assistance from the Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines and the CCP in the form of commissions and financial subsidies. The League also commissioned new works for orchestra and other instrumental ensemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Members of the League continued to write major compositions using western idioms with conventional traditions using folk themes and legends. Western genres such as the concerto, symphony, symphonic poem, overture, suite, opera, choral, chamber, art song, ballet and incidental music were written, combined with 20th century musical practices such as atonality, minimalism, polyrhythm, polytonality, percussive dissonance, electronic music, and Eastern modal systems. These produced works of distinct cultural personality that helped elevate the Filipino composers who were evaluated by global standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1973, the LFC became a member of the Asian Composers League (ACL), and hosted the Third Conference Festival of the ACL in 1975, the first large-scale event in the history of the organization. On this occasion, Lucrecia R. Kasilag was elected chair of ACL, a position she held until 1990. The ACL began with four-member countries and later expanded to 12. International conferences organized by the ACL provided a space for exchanges and dealt with topics which included, among many, the attainment of international levels of acceptance and recognition of Asian composers. In 2005, a local chapter of the ACL, the Asian Composers League, Philippines Inc., was founded and it has taken the role of supporting and fostering the development of contemporary musical compositions of Filipino composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The commissioned symphonic works by the LFC have been recorded in the four-disc <b><i>Pagdiriwang </i></b>(Celebration) which was released in 1979. This was followed in 1983 by the recording of two violin concertos by Lucrecia R. Kasilag and Alfredo S. Buenaventura featuring violinist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4050\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4052\"><strong>Carmencita Lozada</strong></a></strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The living members of the LFC include: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, Jerry A.

Santa Ana, Manila 5 Dec 1858. d. 9 Dec 1915. Band musician and director, composer. His parents are Catalina Ibarra and Francisco Libornio, a piano teacher who died at a young age. He married Gregoria del Rosario with whom he had two children. At the <i>hospicio </i>that took charge of him after his father&rsquo;s death, Libornio learned how to play the flute. Later, he became a member of the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples of the ManilaCathedral. He had already reached the fourth year of the <i>segunda ense&ntilde;anza </i>(secondary school)<i> </i>at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran when he was taken back by his mother who had remarried. With his stepfather&rsquo;s encouragement, he studied piano and, later, the violin, under native teachers. Though underaged, he joined the Spanish Infantry Band No 7 on its assignments in Jolo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, and Cotabato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Libornio directed bands in various parts of the country, which took him as far as Vigan, Ilocos Sur. He then joined the Charini Circus in 1882 as a musician, going with it on its engagements in Hong Kong and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a>. However, the troupe disbanded in Shanghai after a disagreement, leaving the Filipino members on their own. Libornio made his way to Honolulu, where he taught music and bands for several years, then proceeded to San Francisco, USA, where he became a tramp musician, traveling from state to state. In 1895, he reached Lima, Peru, enlisted in the Peruvian Army, and the following year, was appointed Director General de las Bandas de Musicos del Ejercito of the entire nation. In 1905, he founded a school of music in Lima called the Conservatorio Libornio. He never returned to the Philippines and married a Peruvian, Maria Estrada, with whom he had several children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in Peru where Libornio produced all of his creative works. A list of his musical compositions at the Ministry of War of Peru includes 21 waltzes, 37 marches, six funeral marches, two quadrilles, 13 polkas, a piece for a grand ball, two mazurkas, three danzas, and one gavotte. His works totalled 106 pieces, not including arrangements and compositions for more than 500 pieces of classic and contemporary composers. A significant work was &ldquo;National Army March,&rdquo; which used to be played by army bands of Peru.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Libornio was awarded a gold medal for his creative works by the Municipality of Callao during its 81st annual independence celebration and a silver medal by Provincial Council of Lima for directing bands of the Peruvian army. He reached such stature in Peru that when he died, 32 years after he left Manila, his body was borne on the &ldquo;shoulders of gendarmes with a full regiment attending.&rdquo;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written byEspiridion Arsenio Manuel and Rosalinda Galang</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Pasil, San Nicolas, Cebu City 12 Aug 1912. d. 20 Jan 1981. Actor, composer, singer. His parents were Juan Lopez and Basilia Abagon. Domingo Lopez married Maria Caridad Falcon, from Sogod, Leyte in 1933. Raised in the crowded barangay of Pasil, Lopez demonstrated an early love for music. At eight years old, he sang and acted in the <i>pastores</i> (Shepherds Play) of Nita Alburo. He later joined a group of artists known as the Zarzuela Cebuana. He dropped out of high school to further develop his talents in acting, singing, and playing musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most memorable year was 1930. That year Lopez was discovered by Badong Yburan, a veteran actor who often played the role of a comedian. He was 18 when Yburan invited him to join the stage actors&rsquo; group called Tirana&rsquo;s Troupe, headed by Emy Gabuya. That same year he played a major role in a play and was hailed as a consummate actor. Finally in 1930, he wrote his first song, &ldquo;Pagkatam-is&rdquo; (How Sweet), which was sung by Diosdado Alferez, another Cebuano musician, for a singing contest at San Nicolas. This song won first prize. Later, Lopez composed &ldquo;Karon Pa Lamang&rdquo; (Only Now), his second song, which was also very popular, and another memorable <b>balitaw</b> titled &ldquo;Kagahapon ug Karon&rdquo; (Yesterday and Today).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because the actor&rsquo;s blood ran strong in his veins, acting soon became his profession. From the group of Emy Gabuya, Lopez moved on to Piux Kabahar&rsquo;s group. It was there that Domingo Lopez penned the lines of the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/649\"><strong>Rosas</strong></a></strong></a> Pandan,&rdquo; which was made into a film, with script by Piux Kabahar and directed by Toting Villarino. In this same movie, Lopez&rsquo;s balitaw titled &ldquo;Bukidnon&rdquo; was performed. After learning what he could from Kabahar&rsquo;s group, Lopez joined the actors&rsquo; group of Toting Villarino who were mainstays at the famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Oriente. From there, he later joined the Antingan Troupe led by Leox and Tancred Juezan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">Though Lopez had no formal training in reading music, he learned the skill from Pidong Villaflor. The young Lopez always stayed by the side of Pidong at barrio Kalubihan, especially when the latter was composing a song. Another famous Cebuano composer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4994\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4237\"><strong>Ben Zubiri</strong></a></strong></a>, hung out with Lopez. Many of Lopez&rsquo;s songs were recorded by D&rsquo; Sound Recording under the management of Jhul Antopina, a writer who also made records. Among these were &ldquo;Sala sa Panahon&rdquo; (Time&rsquo;s Fault) and &ldquo;Hagki Ako&rdquo; sang by Yelly Albino.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lopez also wrote carols, such as &ldquo;Pasko sa Buta&rdquo; (A Blindman&rsquo;s Christmas) and &ldquo;Maayong Pasko, Tagbalay&rdquo; (Merry Christmas, Householder). The latter was sung by Sergs de la Pe&ntilde;a and became very popular throughout the Visayas and Mindanao. Another song Lopez composed was &ldquo;Ayaw Gayod Palipat&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t Be Fooled) which was sung by the Zabala sisters and brought a lot of sales for D&rsquo; Sound Recording. His song &ldquo;Salimuang&rdquo; (Delirious) was considered a masterpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lopez also acted in radio and television. He was a member of Cedric Tumulak&rsquo;s group with ABS in Cebu. He was the main actor in the play <b><i>Maria Flor de Luna</i></b> which was famous on air in the Visayas and Mindanao.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by Hope Sabanpan-Yu</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

He was married to Edith McCary, with whom he had a son, Walter Jr, who rose through the ranks of the US Military, served in Korea as an infantry officer, and retired as a colonel in 1969. Walter Sr was a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and took up a postgraduate course at the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany. In 1899, he arrived in the Philippines with the US Army, and in 1902 organized the Philippine Constabulary (PC) Band. The band started with 30 members and grew to 80. At the St Louis Exposition in 1904, it garnered the grand prize and a gold medal, and in 1909 played during the inauguration of Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Taft at the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He retired from the PC in 1916 to join the US Military in its war effort in the World War I but was not enlisted to take part in combat. He served as a civilian in the Military Intelligence Division. He returned to the Philippines in 1920 to lead the PC Band once more, only to retire again three years later. When Manuel Quezon became president in 1935, Loving was invited to reorganize the PC Band into the Philippine Army Orchestra. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel by Quezon. In 1937, he was asked to prepare the PC Band for the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939 where it was well received. Their final concert was on 15 Dec 1940, at the Central Student Church in Manila. Loving was killed during the Battle of Manila in 1945, believed to have been beheaded by the Japanese officer, Gen Yamashita, at the entrance of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Loving composed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a> de los Colectivistas&rdquo; (Collectivista March) in 1922 to honor the newly founded Partido Collectivista Liberal of Manuel L.

Organized on 12 Dec 1954 by friends and students of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3989\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> Francisco</strong></a> of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music, it aimed to encourage gifted but poor music students to pursue their studies in piano. It also envisioned training piano students to reach their full potential, either as concert artists or pedagogues who will, in turn, mentor future piano scholars. LFMC offered piano scholarships to qualified students between the ages of five and 12 on an annual basis. The students were trained by members of the Circle, comprised mostly of UP graduates with a degree in piano performance. They had been presented in piano recitals at the UP College of Music Abelardo Hall Auditorium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A four-year scholarship at the university level was established, with a maximum of eight scholarships open every year. Among the Circle&rsquo;s university scholars were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3941\"><strong>Jose Contreras</strong></a>, Corazon Pineda-Kabayao, Adolovni Acosta, and Lino Rivera. Some of the younger pianists are now noted professors at the UP College of Music such as Luci Magalit and Geraldine Marie Gonzales who not only graduated with honors but were also proclaimed in <b><i>The Ultimate Pianist </i></b>competition, 2006, grand prize winner and first laureate, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first president and co-founder of the LFMC was Eva Ponce-Panajon, who was succeeded by Jose Balingit, and Consorcia Valmonte. The incumbent president is a former child scholar, Guillermo Lauzon, who was installed in office in the early 1990s. Since 2000, the Circle has not been active. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written byFelizidad Z. Reyesupdated by James C. Diaz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Villar, president and chief executive officer of the Mabuhay Records Corporation (MARECO) more popularly known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a>, the group was a combination of two leading trios at that time&mdash;the Tres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/649\"><strong>Rosas</strong></a></strong></a> and the Lovers Trio. The two groups got together by chance at the MARECO studios in Escolta one afternoon and Villar instantaneously thought of making them sing together. He immediately asked <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a>, renowned composer and in-house musical director of the outfit, to conduct the group in singing Manuel P. Velez&rsquo;s <b>balitaw</b>, &ldquo;Lawiswis Kawayan&rdquo; (Hissing Sound of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Tops). Villar loved the way the group sounded and instantly he gave it the name <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a>, thereby making it the official singing group of his record company. With its name, which literally means &ldquo;long live,&rdquo; Villar intended the group to keep alive the Philippine music legacy in the forms of balitaw, <b>danza</b>, <b>kundiman</b>, <b>polka</b>, and others that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and reflect the culture, tradition, and most importantly, the ideals of a nation struggling to be free from foreign oppression and trying to cultivate self-respect and moral virtues among its people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The members of the Tres Rosas namely, Carmen Camacho, Nora Hermosa, and Raye Lucero, and of the Lovers Trio, namely, Ador Torres, Floro San Juan, and Bert Legaspi were the original members of the group whose voices were immortalized in the first long-playing album of the group produced and released by Villar Records, <b><i>Halina</i></b><i>&rsquo;<b>t Umawit</b></i> (Come and Sing). The album consisted of popular Philippine folk songs like &ldquo;Leron Leron Sinta&rdquo; (Leron Leron Beloved), &ldquo;Cari&ntilde;osa&rdquo; (Charming Lady), &ldquo;Aking Bituin&rdquo; (My Star), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\"><strong>Paruparong Bukid</strong></a>&rdquo; (Butterfly Song), &ldquo;Chitchiritchit&rdquo; as well as folksy songs with known composers such as &ldquo;Lawiswis Kawayan&rdquo; by Manuel P. Velez, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/914\"><strong>Kataka-taka</strong></a>&rdquo; (How Strange) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\"><strong>Santiago Suarez</strong></a>, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1000\"><strong>Sarung Banggi</strong></a>&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Night) by Potenciano Gregorio, and &ldquo;Tugtuging Bukid&rdquo; (Rural Music) by Constancio de Guzman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the success of this first album, the group came up with the albums <b><i>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a>s, Maligayang Araw</i></b> (Happy Day), <b><i>Mabuhay Singers Sing Pandangguhan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/884\"><strong>Dahil sa Iyo</strong></a> and Other Philippine Hits </i></b>(Because of You and Other Hits),<b> <i>Manila, I Love Manila</i></b>, and <b><i>Bakasyon </i></b>(Vacation). In <b><i>Philippine Folk Songs</i></b> the group sang folk tunes from the different regions of the Philippines like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>&rdquo; (From the Chavacanos in Mindanao), &ldquo;My Nipa Hut-Butterfly Song&rdquo; (from the Tagalog &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paruparong Bukid&rdquo;), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/886\"><strong>Dandansoy</strong></a>&rdquo; (from Western Visayas) and &ldquo;Where is My Ring&rdquo; (from the Kapampangan&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/853\"><strong>Atin Cu Pung Singsing</strong></a>&rdquo;) with English lyrics that became popular during the American colonial occupation. In <b><i>Manila, I Love Manila</i></b>, on the other hand, the group sang standard Filipino love songs like Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\"><strong>Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Only Love) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a>&rdquo; (Will You Remember), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Jr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ikaw ang Buhay&rdquo; (You Are My Life), and Miguel Velarde Jr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ikaw&rdquo; (You) with English lyrics penned by Luis Ma. Trinidad. Obviously, these albums were Villar&rsquo;s attempt at promoting Philippine songs internationally. It is also worth noting that in the first several albums of the Mabuhay Singers, producer Villar and musical arranger Silos deliberately wanted the group to sing in unison or without complicated vocal arrangements so as not to intimidate but rather invite the listeners to enjoy singing along with the group. However, the later albums produced and released in the late 1960s and early 1970s such as <b><i>Sariling <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Our Own Song),<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a></b>, <b>Awit ng Pagmamahal </b></i>(Songs of Love), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\"><strong>Pamulinawen</strong></a></i></b><i>, <b>Perlas ng Silangan </b></i>(Pearl of the Orient), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>han </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a>), featured more sophisticated vocal and orchestral arrangements by Silos to highlight the ingenuity and artistry of Filipino music. The traditional and classic Christmas songs that are famous today such as &ldquo;Sa Paskong Darating&rdquo; (This Coming Christmas), &ldquo;Pasko Kasi&rdquo; (Because It is Christmas), &ldquo;Sino si Santa Klaws&rdquo; (Who&rsquo;s Santa Claus), &ldquo;Himig Pasko&rdquo; (Christmas Melody), &ldquo;Damdaming Pasko&rdquo; (Christmas Feeling), &ldquo;Dalangin sa Pasko&rdquo; (Christmas Prayer), and others were originally recorded by the Mabuhay Singers for their Christmas albums, <b><i>Pasko sa Pilipinas</i></b> (Christmas in the Philippines), 1961, and <b><i>Kami Po&rsquo;y Paskuhan </i></b>(Give Us Gifts), 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1960s, Bert Legaspi had to quit the group for some reason and he was immediately replaced by Chi Licerio. That was also the time when Villar started inviting popular soloists of the day to sing as members of the group like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3902\"><strong>Cely Bautista</strong></a>, Rita Rivera, Noel Samonte, Flor Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> Jr, Robert Malaga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3956\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3905\"><strong>Don David</strong></a></strong></a>, Everlita Rivera, Betty Rivera, and Robert Natividad. Other members who came much later in the 1980s, 1990s, and at the beginning of the 21st century were Rene Evangelista, Naning Alba, Leila Atienza, Nolito Gregorio, Peping de Leon, Eddie Suarez, Marlon Marifosque, Jimmy Salonga, Emma Lucero, and Juliet Barangan. With Leopoldo Silos as musical director for more than two decades, the group was able to make around 50 long-playing albums that featured folk, classic, and standard Filipino songs in Tagalog and in the major languages of the Philippines, namely, Cebuano, Waray, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a>, Kapampangan, Ilocano, Pangasinan, and Bicolano. In some albums, the group also sang songs in Chavacano and Tausug. They also did several albums that featured foreign hit songs in English and Spanish. For their topselling records, the Philippine Records Association honored the group with a citation in 1973. That same year, the Department of Tourism brought the group on tour to parts of the United States and Canada under its grand Balikbayan Project to serenade and convince Filipinos abroad to come home and witness the developments that were taking place in the Philippines under the New Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The popularity of their records played on radio programs and all sorts of cultural activities such as fiestas and school-based Filipiniana celebrations all over the country has inevitably made the Mabuhay Singers one of the most in demand performers in the Philippine music industry during the 1960s and the 1970s. In the late 1980s, when Villar Records had become inactive in the recording business, the Mabuhay Singers became the leading musical performers in the Regency of Manila and at the Intramuros Bar of the Hotel Nikko Manila Garden. In the late 1990s up to 2005, the group sang regularly in Tiya <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Serenatang Kumbidahan</i></b> (Invitation to Serenade) aired on Saturday evenings over DZRH 666 kHz of the Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. In Feb 2006, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5187\"><strong>Michael M. Coroza</strong></a> as producer-host through the support of Sonia Roco, Noel Lacsamana, Jeanette Job-Coroza, and Dennis Regis, the group launched its own program called <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1442\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/898\"><strong>Harana</strong></a></strong></a> ng Puso</strong></a> Kasama ang Mabuhay Singers</i></b> (Serenade of the Heart with the Mabuhay Singers) over DWBR 104.3 FM of the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS), which is aired every Sunday from 8:00 to 10:00 in the evening. The group celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 with a two-night grand concert at the Philamlife Auditorium in Manila. This concert was produced and hosted by Sonia Roco with a script written by Michael M. Coroza, production design by National Artist Salvador Bernal, and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3206\"><strong>Jerry Respeto</strong></a>. In 2010, Poly-East Records produced and released the latest CD album of the Mabuhay Singers, <b><i>Mabuhay Singers</i></b><i>: <b>Patuloy sa Pag-awit</b></i> (Mabuhay Singers: The Singing Continues) where the group sang contemporary hits like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Karaniwang Tao&rdquo; (Common Person), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\"><strong>Aiza Seguerra</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/967\"><strong>Pagdating ng Panahon</strong></a>&rdquo; (When Time Comes), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a>&rdquo; (Offering). The present members of the group are Raye Lucero, Cely Bautista, Emma Lucero, Juliet Barangan, Peping de Leon, Eddie Suarez, and Jimmy Salonga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2004, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Foundation of the Philippines bestowed upon the group a Lifetime Achievement Award in the field of music. Likewise, in 2006, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5426\"><strong>Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino</strong></a> honored the group with a National Award of Recognition for promoting Philippine languages through songs. In 2008, the School of Humanities of the Ateneo de Manila through its Department of Filipino paid tribute to the Mabuhay Singers with an award of merit for tirelessly promoting Filipino culture through the decades. An exhibit of their memorabilia was installed at the lobby of the M.V. Pangilinan Building to be viewed by Ateneans and guests of the university. Other academic institutions such as De La Salle University and University of Santo Tomas have also paid tribute to the contributions that the group has made in preserving Filipino cultural heritage in music.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>\r\n<em><strong>Written byMichael M.

Manila 31 Jan 1917 d. Quezon City 5 May 2004. National Artist for music. Ethnomusicologist, composer, pianist, educator. He was the son of Casto Noro&ntilde;a Maceda and Concepcion Montserrat. He was married to French pianist Madelyn Clifford with whom he had four daughters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maceda graduated with a music diploma at the Academy of Music of Manila in 1935 before he was sent to Paris in 1937, where he studied piano with Alfred Cortot. In 1941, he returned to the Philippines, bringing with him a French style of piano playing in many concerts and recitals. In 1946, he took further studies in San Francisco with E. Robert Schmitz, another French pianist known for his pedagogy and interpretation of French works. He also studied musicology at Queens College and Columbia University in New York, 1950-52, and anthropology and ethnomusicology at the University of Chicago, Northwestern and Indiana Universities, 1957-58. Eventually, he ended up at the University of California in Los Angeles where he got his doctor of philosophy degree in 1964. He also took up <b>musique concrete </b>in Paris at the Radio Television Francaise in 1958, where he worked with Pierre Schaeffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Manila, he turned his concentration from piano playing to composing New Music. He conducted concerts in 1964 to 1968 of avant-garde and Asian Music, including works of Varese, Boulez, Xenakis, and Ravel which were programmed together with Chinese music, <b>kulintang</b>, and <b>kudyapi</b>,<i> </i>and his first avant-garde works. These concerts introduced to Philippine audiences the latest languages of music composition. Among his avant-garde works were: <b><i>Ugma-Ugma</i></b>, for native instruments and chorus using blocks of sound alternating with tense-high voices, 1963; <b><i>Agungan</i></b>, for gongs featuring decays, densities, colors, sounds struck with sticks, hands, sliding palms, 1965; <b><i>Kubing</i></b>, for bamboo instruments and men&rsquo;s voices, 1966; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/965\"><strong>Pagsamba</strong></a></i></b> (Worship), a ritual music for a circular auditorium, for 116 instrumentalists, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> voices, and a chorus of 25 men, 1968. Since then, his works have expanded to other realms, involving elements like drone, distribution of labor, a separation of musical functions, relative values of pitch and levels of timbres. These techniques were used in the following: <b><i>Cassettes 100</i></b>, for 100 participants with cassette recorders playing together, 1971; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a></i></b> (Coordination), music for 20 radio stations, 1974; <b><i>Udlot-Udlot </i></b>(Fluctuation), a ritual for open air played by hundreds of performers, 1975; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a></i></b>, for 200 performers based on drones and melodic cells, 1978; <b><i>Aroding</i></b>, for 40 mouth harps, men&rsquo;s voices, flutes, 1983; <b><i>Siasid</i></b>, for percussion, bamboo tubes and five violins, 1983; <b><i>Suling-Suling</i></b>, for 10 flutes, 10 flat gongs, and 10 <b>kudlong</b>, 1985; and <b><i>Strata</i></b>, for 10 percussion bars, 5 <b>tumtum</b>, 5 celli, 5 flutes, and 5 guitars, 1988. His compositions in the 1990s include <b><i>Dissemination</i></b>, 1990; <b><i>Distemperament</i></b>, 1992; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/955\"><strong>Music for Five Pianos</strong></a></i></b>, 1993; <b><i>Two Pianos and Four Winds</i></b>, 1996; <b><i>Music for a Chamber Orchestra</i></b>, 1997; <b><i>Music for Gongs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a></i></b>, 1997; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1022\"><strong>Udlot-udlot</strong></a> for Six Performers</i></b>, 1997; and <b><i>Sujeichon</i></b>, 2002; many of which have been premiered outside of the Philippines, particularly in Japan. His latter works show Maceda&rsquo;s return to the use of western instruments subjected to his continued musical innovation that featured sounds with constantly transforming rhythm, different densities, texture, sonority, mass, and short melodic fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His monumental composition <b><i>Pagsamba</i></b> has been recorded, together with <b><i>Suling-Suling</i></b> and <b><i>Colors Without Rhythms</i></b>, in a CD titled <b><i>Gongs and Bamboos</i></b>, released by Tzadik Records in 2001. A sequel to this album featuring <b><i>Strata</i></b>, considered as his most ambitious large scale work, has been recorded together with <b><i>Sujeichon</i></b> and <b><i>Music for Two Pianos and Four Percussions</i></b>, in an album titled <b><i>Drone and Melody</i></b>, also released by Tzadik Records in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In music research, Maceda has, since 1972, had continuous field experience in many places in the Philippines, Sarawak, Thailand, Kalimantan, and other parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Brazil. He has deposited all his research collection in the University of the Philippines (UP) Ethnomusicology Archives. This consists of about 2,500 hours of music in tapes of 51 Philippine ethnolinguistic groups and other groups in Asia, besides field notes, music instruments, song texts, transcriptions and translations, photos, personal files, books in English, European and Asian languages, and his music compositions. A summation of his many decades-long, extensive research on indigenous instruments of the many ethnolinguistic groups in the country is documented in <b><i>Gongs and Bamboos: A Panorama of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Instruments</i></b>, published by the UP Press, in cooperation with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was always invited to attend international conferences and deliver lectures in universities and institutions in England, France, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Poland, United States, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, China, Indonesia, India, Iran, Nepal, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, and Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His scholarly works won for him prestigious national and international awards, which include: three grants from Rockefeller Foundation in Southeast Asia, 1956, the United States, 1961-63, and Brazil, 1968; the Ordre des Palmes Academiques from France, 1978; UP Composer&rsquo;s Award, 1985; UP Outstanding Researcher Award, 1985; the JDR III Award by the Asian Cultural Council in New York, 1986; Philippine National Science Award for Outstanding Researcher in the Humanities, 1987; Gawad Tanglaw ng Lahi from the Ateneo de Manila University, 1987; UP University Professor Award, 1988; the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining, 1989; and the National Artist Award in music, 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maceda dedicated his life towards the promotion of a national cultural identity, initiating and inspiring scholarly study of the musics and culture of the Filipino minority tribes. As a composer, he has incorporated in his works a blending of avant-garde techniques steeped in an Asian philosophical approach to time and music. His experiments blazed the trail of a new trend in composition among younger Filipino composers.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

It is not the instruments that produce the sound per se but the mouths and voices of the players. However, some instruments in the band, such as the bamboo flute and <b>bumbong</b> (which looks like a sousaphone in the beginning), are actual sound-producing bamboo instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4061\"><strong>Malabon Musikong Bumbong</strong></a> was founded by Gregorio Kilala and Felix Ramos at barrio Tonsuya in Malabon (now a city), Rizal (formerly Morong) during the 1890s at the time of the Philippine revolution against the Spain in 1896-98. Felix Ramos was the founder, as well as inventor and maker of bamboo instruments used by the original group. He and the original members were all <i>katipuneros </i>or revolutionaries against Spain. Aside from Kilala and Ramos, the comrades included Juan De Silva, Anaceto Topacio, Tomas Gonzales, and Delfin Borromeo. These men had no formal training in music and played by ear or &ldquo;oido.&rdquo; They used their musical talents to entertain their fellow katipunero and to enliven their revolutionary activities by playing patriotic songs. Sometimes, they played music as a front for their revolutionary secret meetings. In 1896, the group was known as Samahang Banda Harikos. To strengthen their will to fight, each musician believed that he was the best and claimed superiority over the other as in &ldquo;Hari ako&rdquo; (I am king), hence the term &ldquo;Banda Harikos.&rdquo; With around 28 all-male members then, the bamboo band also played for fiestas, funerals, processions, and parades. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto Topacio was the first conductor. Later, Felix Ramos&rsquo;s son, Magno Ramos, took charge of the second and third generations of the bamboo band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early part of the American occupation, the group was temporarily disbanded and they reorganized in 1921 with the help of Marcelo De Silva. The group&rsquo;s name was then changed to Banda Filipina because they began to accept female members, under Matias de Silva as conductor. The members were composed of sons, relatives, and brothers of the original members. But due to the prevalence of courtship among members, the group was short-lived. In the late 1960s, Visayan men joined and constructed additional bamboo replicas of band instruments like saxophones, clarinet, trumpet, French horn called <b>trompas</b> that sounded like bumbong. In 1984, the group&rsquo;s name became St Anthony Original Bamboo Band, with an all-male membership. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> de Silva was the conductor until 1992 and Gilbert M. Ramos, a fourth generation descendant of Felix Ramos, was the musical director. In 1990, the name reverted to Banda Filipina as requested by old members, with the inclusion once again of female members. With the death of Bayani de Silva in 1993, Gilbert M. Ramos became the conductor and musical director. Gilbert is a bachelor of music graduate, major in conducting, from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2004, the group&rsquo;s name was changed to Musikawayan and was officially registered as manufacturer and seller of bamboo musical instruments with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with both Ronnell P. Ramos and John Dave Ramos, fifth generation descendants of Felix Ramos, as in-charge. The group was a marching band until 2005. After this, their instruments were replaced with those suited and made for stationary stage performances, like marimba, gabbang, angklung, tipangklung, guitar, and drum set. The bamboo flute, bamboo clarinet, bamboo saxophone, and bumbong are still in use. In 2006, musicians were trimmed down to five from 10 members for convenience and economic reasons. However, when need arises, the group can still provide a full bamboo marching band. The members of Musikawayan are mostly relatives and a few are members of the community. They receive basic lessons in note reading and harmony under Gilbert Ramos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Malabon Musikong Bumbong has received several distinctions such as the certificate of honor during the term of Pres Manuel L. Quezon, the Malabon Gintong Parangal, the Most Distinguished Men of Malabon in 1998, and the Certificate of Appreciation for their invaluable contribution in preserving the cultural heritage of Malabon in 2010. They have been featured at the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>, Manila Hilton, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, SM malls, and in the different Casino Filipino branches as part of the stable of PAGCOR artists. They have performed before local and foreign dignitaries and in other countries as well. The &ldquo;Veteranos de la Revolucion&rdquo; (Veterans of the Revolution) is the group&rsquo;s theme song. Their repertoire has evolved from mostly patriotic to varied types of music that cater to a wider audience of music aficionados. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byPacita M.

The ManilaChamberOrchestra was founded in 1985 when conductor and violinist SergioEsmillaJr brought up the idea of forming a chamber group to banker Antonio Ozaeta. Its aim was to provide a professional venue for the country&rsquo;s young talents in music. The group consisted of two foreign senior wind players and 24 Filipino musicians who had earlier trained with the PhilippineYouthOrchestra. On 8 May 1985 the MCO gave its inaugural concert at the PCIBank&rsquo;s FranciscoSantiago Hall in Makati. The program included &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winter&rdquo; from Vivaldi&rsquo;s <b><i>Four</i> <i>Seasons</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Grieg&rsquo;s <b><i>Holberg Suite</i></b>,<b><i> Op</i></b><i>.<b> 40</b></i>,<b><i> </i></b>Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>Divertimento in D</i></b>,<b><i> KV136</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and Haydn&rsquo;s <b><i>Quintet </i></b>for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon. It has since been giving annual concert seasons and special performances that have featured renowned Filipino musical artists like pianists LeonorKilayko, NenadelRosario-Villanueva, and RaulSunico, composers RyanCayabyab and JoseMariChan, soprano AndionFernandez, cellist RamonBolipata, violinist JosephEsmilla, as well as foreign international artists like British guitarist Michael Conn, German violinist Christopher Poppen, and British cellist Richard Markson. It has also come out with live recordings of selected repertoire from its previous concerts, featuring prominent Filipino as well as foreign visiting artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The MCO was initially subsidized by PCIBank through the MCO Foundation Inc. When the foundation decided to go public in 1992, it had the Philippine Long Distance Telephone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (PLDT), Metro Manila Electric Company (MERALCO), Philips, and IBM among its contributing members. The MCO was also patronized by foreign cultural agencies like the Goethe House, the Australian Embassy, and the British Council. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEdna Marcil M.

It began as an informal symphony concert orchestra in 1926 that played Lippay&rsquo;s symphonic concerts under the patronage of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> de Filipinas</strong></a>, a music society made up of the colonial elites of Manila. Its musicians were initially contracted from the UP Conservatory of Music and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a>. In 1931, the orchestra was formally organized and managed by the Manila Symphony Society, an offshoot of the Asociacion Musical de Filipinas. When Alexander Lippay died, the baton was formally handed over to Austrian conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\"><strong>Herbert Zipper</strong></a> in Aug 1939, during a memorial concert for Lippay. Zipper conducted the orchestra from 1939 to 1969. Under Zipper&rsquo;s guidance, the MSO premiered such works as Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>Requiem</i></b>, Beethoven&rsquo;s <b><i>Ninth Symphony</i></b>, Bach&rsquo;s <b><i>Magnificat</i></b>, and major works of Mahler and Brahms. The orchestra also played for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a></strong></a> Moderne, led by Trudl Dubsky, who became Zipper&rsquo;s wife. At the end of World War II, in May 1945, the orchestra held the first postwar concert among the ruins of Santa Cruz Church in Binondo, Manila. It became one of the most attended concerts in MSO history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The orchestra also played for the US Armed Forces every night for approximately 150 days in Manila&rsquo;s Rex Theater. In the 1950s and 1960s, the MSO was the most important orchestra playing European classical works at various venues like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong></a>, Far Eastern University Auditorium, the Philamlife Auditorium, as well as in schools and in parks. It featured soloists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a>, Nena del Rosario-Villanueva, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong></a></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4201\"><strong>Benjamin Tupas</strong></a>. The MSO went through troubled times starting in the 1960s. It lost some of it members to Redentor Romero&rsquo;s newly formed National Philharmonic Orchestra. The emergence of other symphony orchestras in later years, such as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra in 1973, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\"><strong>Manila Chamber Orchestra</strong></a> in 1985, further stripped its ranks. In 1978, the MSO became the resident orchestra of the newly renovated Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a>. However, the theater&rsquo;s unstable financial conditions after 1986 affected the orchestra. In 1989, Herbert Zipper returned to the country to help revitalize the MSO which had been inactive for more than a year. The MSO re-established itself with concerts featuring Japan&rsquo;s Yoshinao Osawa in its 1989-90 season, and Helen Quach in 1991. The orchestra did not last long and was disbanded. Today&rsquo;s MSO traces its name and origin from Lippay&rsquo;s original MSO through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\"><strong>Basilio Manalo</strong></a> who was once the concertmaster of the MSO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other local and international guest conductors that stood on MSO&rsquo;s podium include Oscar Yatco, Gilopez Kabayao, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3952\"><strong>Bernardino Custodio</strong></a>, Lucio San Pedro, Walter Hendl, Eaktay Ahn, Christoph Poppen, Lorenzo Martinez Palomo, Yaakov Bergman, Jeffrey Rink, and Sebastian Bereau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the years, numerous musicians had joined and participated in some of MSO&rsquo;s performances. Currently, the MSO&rsquo;s music director and principal conductor is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4085\"><strong>Arturo Molina</strong></a>, while the executive director and associate conductor post is held by Jeffrey Solares.

It was founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a> out of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> de Filipinas</strong></a>, which was its parent organization. From 1927 to 1931, the Asociacion Musical de Filipinas supported the symphonic concerts led by Lippay. Out of those symphonic concerts, a formal orchestra was established and permanent membership became necessary. For many years, the MSO was the only symphony orchestra in the country whose performers were paid regular salaries. This was made possible by the Manila Symphony Society, which together with the MSO were professional music organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the onset of the organization, the 1932-33 Board of Directors of the society was led by Filomena Roces Legarda as president; Rosalind W. Duckworth, vice-president; Rosario Abreu Roensch, treasurer; Arthur Hoyer, secretary; and members Mrs. H.B. McCoy, A.V.H. Hartendorp, and Alexander Lippay. Major patrons were: Maria Elison Earnshaw, wife of Tomas Earnshaw, mayor of Manila (1927-33); Concepcion Fernandez-Crame, wife of Gen Rafael Crame, the first director of the defunct Philippine Constabulary; Nina Isabelle Gilmore, wife of Eugene Allen Gilmore, vice governor-general of the Philippines (1922-29); and Aurora Aragon-Quezon, wife of Pres Manuel L. Quezon and First Lady of the Philippines (1935-44). Other names included John Brimo, Carmelo Cristi, Ernest Korneld, and Hans Inhelder, together with Andres Soriano, Benito Legarda III and Benito Legarda IV, Basilio Valdes, and Rita Legarda-Valdes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the 25th anniversary of the Manila Symphony Society in 1956, the Board of Directors was composed of Trinidad F. Legarda, president; Rosario de Valdes, first vice-president; Pilar Vergel de Dios, second vice-president; Ernest Korneld, third vice-president; Carmita L. de Carrion, executive secretary; Maria Orense Casas, social secretary; John G. Brimo, Treasurer. The directors were Purita L. Ponce Enrile, Edgar Krohn, Hans Inhelder, Rachel Kaufman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4513\"><strong>Mona Lisa</strong></a> Steiner, Naty Aguinaldo, Candida Bautista, Kathy Sternberg, Angelo O. Fiteni, and Rafael Gomez. It also included composers Lucrecia Kasilag and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> and pianist Julio Esteban-Anguita as technical advisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since its establishment, the MSS has sought to help foster a hospitable climate for music appreciation in the country. Over the years, it has conducted, launched, and funded projects to develop cultural interests and activities, particularly in Manila. It has provided free instruction on orchestral instruments to music students, music teachers, and professional musicians through a special educational grant by the JDR III Fund, and has also invited American and West German professors to further hone the MSO members&rsquo; artistry. The MSS was instrumental in recruiting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\"><strong>Herbert Zipper</strong></a> to take over the directorship of the orchestra when Alexander Lippay passed away. The MSS and the MSO regularly offered free concerts of excerpts from operas and ballets, as well as other musical fare in public parks and in schools. The repertoire ranged from classical music to contemporary works by Filipino artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the later years, the MSS did not only encourage Filipino composers to create new works but also featured Filipino soloists and conductors, among them Oscar C. Yatco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong></a></strong></a>, Nena del Rosario-Villanueva, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4141\"><strong>Reynaldo Reyes</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4201\"><strong>Benjamin Tupas</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a>.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byEdgardo Marananupdated by Ma.

Manila 23 May 1941. d. Buena Park, California, USA 22 Sep 2017. Singer. He was active in the glee club during his high school days at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He took up commerce at the Far Eastern University, but did not graduate. In 1960, he joined <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage), a national amateur singing contest on television, and became champion for several weeks with his rendition of standard English ballads. Teddy Valdemor, the program&rsquo;s director who was a songwriter as well, handpicked Manrique to sing one of his compositions, &ldquo;Till I Die.&rdquo; This turned out to be Manrique&rsquo;s first big hit. In 1963, he had a big break when he sang &ldquo;Sapagkat Kami&rsquo;y Tao Lamang&rdquo; (For We are Only Human), the theme from the movie of the same title which won for its composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4059\"><strong>Tony Maiquez</strong></a> the FAMAS Awards for Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Score and Best Theme Song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the next two decades, he became one of the most sought after interpreters of movie themes penned by leading musical directors for films, such as Tony Maiquez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong></a>, Pablo Vergara, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\"><strong>George Canseco</strong></a>. His first long-playing album, <b><i>Sa Lamlam ng Buwan</i></b> (Under the Pale Moonlight), released under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a> in 1967, featured &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/883\"><strong>Dahil sa Isang Bulaklak</strong></a>&rdquo; (Because of a Flower) by Leopoldo Silos and S.Y. Ramos, the theme of the film of the same title from Nepomuceno Productions topbilled by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4688\"><strong>Charito Solis</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4641\"><strong>Ric Rodrigo</strong></a>. His &ldquo;Magbalik Ka, Hirang&rdquo; (Please Come Back, My Love), a cut in his 1971 album of the same title also under Villar Records, was used as the theme of <b><i>Uhaw</i></b> (Yearning), the first ever <i>bomba</i> (bold) film in the Philippines that featured Merle Fernandez in 1970. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a> at Halakhak&rdquo; (Tears and Laughter), by George Canseco, was a cut from his 1976 album under Vicor-RCA Records <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/913\"><strong>Kapantay ay Langit</strong></a></i></b> (High As the Sky) and was the theme for the movie <b><i>Eva Fonda 16</i></b> with Alma Moreno on the lead role. His bestselling LP, <b><i>Diyos Lamang Nakakaalam</i></b> (Only God Knows), came out in 1973, the title song of which was a masterpiece by Leopoldo Silos with lyrics penned by Manuel P. Villar Sr, president and CEO of the Mabuhay Records Corporation (MARECO aka Villar Records). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the cuts in the said album was &ldquo;Sabihin Lang&rdquo; (Just Say It), which is an adaptation in Tagalog of the song &ldquo;Speak Softly Love&rdquo; from the movie <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Godfather</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Singing themes for Tagalog films proved to be so advantageous for Manrique that upon the early retirement of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a> from the music industry in the early 1970s, he became one of the contenders for the title &ldquo;Hari ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (King of Kundiman). A long-playing album that he did for Oregon Records in 1971, which featured movie themes composed by Pablo Vergara, was aptly titled <b><i>Hari ng Kundiman</i></b>. In 1979, as to somewhat declare his ascent as the new kundiman king, he did the album titled <b><i>Kundiman</i></b> (Love Song) under A&amp;W Records International where he rendered classic compositions like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Madaling Araw&rdquo; (Dawn), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\"><strong>Pakiusap</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Plea), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> Dalita&rdquo; (Child of Woe), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Beautiful Star), &ldquo;Nasaan Ka, Irog&rdquo; (Where are You, My Love?), &ldquo;Kung Hindi Man&rdquo; (If Not So), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\"><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong></a>&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig), not in the usual bel canto style of singing but in a manner that is characteriscally his&mdash;sweet, relaxed, and natural. His other hits, mostly themes from films, include &ldquo;Ikaw ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> Ko&rdquo; (You are My Happiness), &ldquo;Hindi Nahahati ang Langit&rdquo; (Heaven Can&rsquo;t Be Divided), &ldquo;Iginuhit sa Buhangin&rdquo; (Drawn on Sand), &ldquo;Nasaan ang Pangako&rdquo; (Where is Your Promise), &ldquo;Kapag Puso&rsquo;y Sinugatan&rdquo; (When the Heart is Wounded), &ldquo;Paano Kita Lilimutin&rdquo; (How Can I Forget You), &ldquo;Ang Daigdig Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw&rdquo; (You are My World), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/995\"><strong>Saan Ka Man Naroroon</strong></a>&rdquo; (Wherever You Are). </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He appeared in musical films such as <b><i>Christmas Holiday</i></b>, 1965; <b><i>Mula Nang Kita</i></b><i>&rsquo;<b>y Ibigin</b></i> (Since I&rsquo;ve Loved You), 1966; and <b><i>Top Ten</i></b>, 1967. He sang as a member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a> in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He hosted his own radio show, <b><i>Panambitan</i></b> (Serenade), which aired every Sunday evening over DZBB 594 of GMA 7 for almost two decades since the late 70s. From the late 90s up to 2002, he regularly sang in <b><i>Serenatang Kumbidahan</i></b> (Invitation to Serenade), a Saturday night Filipiniana musical program produced and hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>. In 2003, he migrated to California where he sang occasionally in concerts, cultural programs, and benefit shows for the Filipino community. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5187\"><strong>Michael M.

JoseMossesgeldSantiago-Font had drafted him into the ranks of the choruses for operatic productions of the late 1940s. Melendrez was often heard over DZPI&rsquo;s <b><i>Sing for Fun</i></b>, a pop-oriented program. Taking lessons from pianist-singer Grace Turla, a piano graduate of University of Santo Tomas and a University of the Philippines graduating voice student, Melendrez became a concert and opera soloist. He gave his first full-length recital at the Philamlife Auditorium in 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He then embarked on a singing career that peaked via television from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s.

Licuanan. Bolipata was then a faculty member of the Music Center of Miriam College, which was headed by Teresita Serrano. Licuanan, then president of Miriam College, approved its organization. It was registered under the umbrella of the Institute for Orchestra Development in the Philippines (IODP). The organizers held auditions for its membership in Jan 2000 and presented an inaugural concert at the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) on 23 Jun 2000, with conductor and music director Josefino &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Toledo. In its many years of existence, the group has been guided by a vision to sustain the formation, growth, and development of talented musical artists, thus uplifting the culture of Philippine communities, especially the marginalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2010, on its 10th year, the orchestra was renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4082\"><strong>Metro Manila Concert Orchestra</strong></a>, after having performed 40 concertos. Since then, it has featured outstanding Filipino pianists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a>, Albert Tiu, Cristine Coyiuto, Aima Labra Makk; violinist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3907\"><strong>Alfonso Bolipata</strong></a>; soprano Camille Lopez; the Novo Concertante Choir; and young soloists Michael Yu, Luci Magalit, and Caitlin Coyiuto. Thus year 2010 saw the orchestra moving beyond being a local community training orchestra, which has a limited association, onto a &ldquo;people&rsquo;s orchestra&rdquo; that has performed, not only in concert halls such CCP and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> Hall, but in school auditoriums, churches, makeshift stages in the provinces as well. This flexibility has allowed the orchestra to transcend the divide between high art and popular culture, making symphonic music broadly available to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A distinguishing character of this orchestra is that it has played a wide variety of musical genres. New compositions from young Filipino composers who wrote in contemporary idiom have been launched in special programming titled &ldquo;Music Under Konstruction Orchestral Reading Project.&rdquo; In addition, the orchestra has annual concerts designed for children, in cooperation with the CCP. This series has enhanced the musical learning experience of the children particularly in marginalized communities. Another program at present is the School Outreach Series, which is aligned to the K-12 curriculum, which highlights the values &ldquo;maka-Diyos (pro-God), makatao (pro-people), makabayan (pro-country), and makakalikasan (pro-environment).&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 3 Jul 2012, the Metro Manila Concert Orchestra Foundation Incorporated (MMCOFI) was organized and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to manage the MMCO and replaced the IODP. Since 2013, it has moved its office and rehearsal hall from the Miriam College Campus to Erehwon Center for the Arts in Villa Beatriz Subdivision, Old Balara, Quezon City. The MMCOFI Board of Trustees is composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> B. Arnaldo, chair and president; Corazon Alma G. de Leon, vice president; Mary Ann M. Streeter, treasurer; and Rafael R. Benitez, Bro Ricardo P. Laguda, FSC, Clarita T. Ordo&ntilde;ez, Renato T. Boysie Villavicencio, Michael T. Toledo, and Mercedes Palanca Pleno, members. At present, the MMCO has become one of the leading symphony orchestras in the country. It has answered the demand for a debonair symphonic sound that is the product of the synergy between its conductor and the musicians. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

Quiapo, Manila 26 Dec 1894. d. 29 Jan 1980. National Artist for music. Composer, cellist, educator. He was the son of Juan Molina, a customs inspector during the final years of the Spanish regime, and Simeona Naguit. He was married to Pilar Siauingco, who died in 1957, with whom he had six children including Rosita, a pianist; Exequiel (Lito), jazz artist and journalist; and Antonio Maria Jr, conductor and composer based in the United States. His second wife was Carmen Serrano. In 1896, his father founded the 22-piece Orquesta Molina whose members lived and rehearsed in the family residence. At 12, he could play the violin, and later, the bandurria, mandolin, guitar, <b>laud</b>, <b>bajo de u&ntilde;as</b>, <b>octavina</b>, and the cello. His favorite instrument was the violoncello. He played it so well that he became an orchestra soloist at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He went to the Escuela Catolica de Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno in 1902 in Quiapo and then to Colegio de San Juan de Letran where he received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1909. He also studied architectural design, landscape sketching, and decorative and freehand drawing. To please his father, he enrolled for a law degree at the University of Santo Tomas and then at the Manila Law School but shifted to music upon his father&rsquo;s death. He stopped his law studies in 1913 and did odd jobs to help his family. During this time, he formed a string band, Rondalla Ideal and learned to compose by ear and later, by writing the notes. From 1916 to 1924, he was orchestra director of the Cine Empire on Carlos Palanca St, Manila during the era of the silent movies. He took formal lessons with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a> in 1918. In 1919, he enrolled at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music for a teacher&rsquo;s diploma in violoncello which he obtained in 1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In school, he composed the following: <b><i>Era La Penumbra</i></b>, <b><i>Kung sa Iyong Gunita </i></b>(Upon Your Remembrance), <b><i>Cantilena Romantica</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\"><strong>Ave Maria</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Scherzo in D major</i></b>, <b><i>Epifania de las <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/649\"><strong>Rosas</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>No Adayuca</i></b>. His teachers included Nicanor Abelardo and Conservatory director Robert Schofield. From 1922 to 1924, he concertized extensively in Hanoi and other parts of Indochina. Molina also taught at the UP Conservatory of Music and then at Centro Escolar University (CEU). Molina wrote his first composition, &ldquo;Matinal,&rdquo; 1912. This was followed in 1913 by a set of waltzes, <b><i>Lamentos de Mi Patria</i></b> (Laments of My Fatherland), and in 1915 by his most popular violin piece, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/899\"><strong>Hatinggabi</strong></a>&rdquo; (Midnight). While in school, he composed works which included a <b>sarsuwela</b>, <b><i>Ana Maria</i></b>, and his most important orchestral works, like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a> Antoniana Grand Festival Mass</i></b>, 1964, and <b><i>Ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>ngaw</i></b> (The Bell), 1972, and chamber music compositions, like <b><i>Prelude</i></b> and <b><i>Romanz</i></b> for cello and piano, 1928, and <b><i>Bontok Rhapsody</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his works Molina used whole tone and pentatonic scales, many ninth and eleventh chords, and linear counterpoint. He included the use of ethnic instruments like the <b>kulintang</b> and the <b>gabbang</b> in symphonic music. He wrote hundreds of scores for chamber music, chorus, orchestra, instrumental and vocal solo music, and sarsuwela. About 200 of his works utilize folk tunes. He was one of the early 20th century Filipino composers who, with Nicanor Abelardo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, continued the nationalistic movement in Philippine music. Molina was also actively involved in the development of choral and rondalla music in the Philippines. He functioned as both organizer and conductor of such groups. He conducted the premiere of Bach&rsquo;s <b><i>Christmas Oratorio</i></b> on 14 Dec 1947, the first performance of Mozart&rsquo;s opera <b><i>Don Giovanni</i></b>, and the first television choral concert to be presented in the Philippines. In 1949 he received the Choral Conductor of the Year award from the Music Lovers&rsquo; Society. He was the only Filipino musician cited in the 1952 edition of <b><i>Who&rsquo;s Who in American Education</i></b>. He was listed in the <b><i>Philippine Commonwealth Directory</i></b> and <b><i>Encyclopedia of the Philippines</i></b>. The CEU conferred on him an honorary doctorate in law in 1953, and named him dean emeritus upon his retirement from the university in 1970. He received the Civic Assembly of Women of the Philippines Citation of Merit in 1962, Patnubay ng Kalinangan Award for music, City of Manila, 1969; the UP Conservatory Alumni Award and the Phi Kappa Beta Award in 1972, and the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1972.

Malate, Manila 24 Jan 1958. Violinist, violist, strings pedagogue, and orchestral conductor. He is the son of Salvacion Tria and Benjamin Molina. His father was the nephew of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a> and was the composer&rsquo;s secretary and occasional copyist. Arturo&rsquo;s paternal grandfather Mariano Molina was a pianist who traveled internationally, while his great grandfather Juan Molina was the founder of the Molina Orchestra active in the early 20th century. Arturo&rsquo;s siblings are also notable musicians. His older brother Augusto is a violinist and his sister Regina is a cellist who played for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a> (PPO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Molina&rsquo;s formal violin lessons began at age six with Adriano Garcia, a violist of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> (MSO). He received his early orchestral training at the University of the East Students Orchestra under Col <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> and not long after received a scholarship to study under the MSO&rsquo;s director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a>. When Yatco went to Germany, Molina went on to train with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\"><strong>Basilio Manalo</strong></a>, then concertmaster of the MSO. In the early 1980s, Molina joined his mentors Manalo and Yatco at the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO) as its principal violist, at the time when the orchestra underwent some major reorganization. By 1984, he was recognized as a promising young musician and was given a scholarship to study in Russia through the Orchestra Development Program of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the Kiev Conservatory, Molina came under the tutelage of Alexander Yegorov and went on to win the conservatory&rsquo;s annual competition after three years of study. Upon his return to the Philippines, an invitation came from conductor and violinist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"><strong>Sergio Esmilla</strong></a> to lead the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\"><strong>Manila Chamber Orchestra</strong></a>, the resident performing group at the PCI Bank&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> Hall in Makati. Molina would later also serve as concertmaster of the PPO as part of his service for the scholarship he received. In 1999, he formed the Battig Trio with cellist Wilfredo Pasamba and pianist J. Greg Zuniega, performing concerts locally and on tours in Italy, France, and Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alongside a prolific career as a professional violinist, Molina began to teach younger musicians through the auspices of the Philippine Research for Developing Instrumental Soloists (PREDIS), which his former mentor Manalo and Sr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4130\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4131\"><strong>Mary Placid</strong></a></strong></a> Abejo founded in 1985. &ldquo;Sir Toti,&rdquo; as he is known to his students, have made significant contributions to strings pedagogy in the country, mentoring violinists that have gone through the strings program of the PREDIS, and the collegiate programs at the St Scholastica&rsquo;s College in Manila and at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music. Many of his own students have won the National Music Competitions for Young Artists and have represented the Philippines in international music festivals and competitions. They have also gone to pursue careers as leading soloists, orchestral musicians, and music educators in the Philippines and abroad. From 1994 to 2003, Molina was chair of the Strings Department of the UP College of Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Molina&rsquo;s transition to an orchestral conductor came about with the formation of the Manila Youth Symphony Orchestra (MYSO) as a further training ground for the PREDIS and musicians from other universities in Manila. In 2000, he became a fellow at the Conductor&rsquo;s Institute at the University of South Carolina. Not long after, the MYSO organization transitioned into a more professional orchestra, paving the way for the revival of the MSO. Molina was at the helm of the relaunch concert in 2001, leading a new generation of musicians through varied programming set to revitalize local interest in orchestral music. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Isidora Miranda</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Quiapo, Manila 20 May 1929. d. 5 Mar 2003. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> musician, music critic. Molina was the fourth child of composer and National Artist Antonio J. Molina and Pilar Siauingco. He was a grandson of conductor and orchestra manager Juan Molina. He was married to Josefa Tuason with whom he had three children. He studied at the San Miguel Elementary School in Manila, the Mapa High School, and the University of Santo Tomas where he received his degree in journalism in 1952. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was exposed to music in the Molina household and studied piano under Iluminada de Leon. After discovering his interest in jazz music, he played with the Martiniano Esguerra Orchestra in 1943. In 1945 he played professionally with various bands, and in 1951 was invited to join the Pete Aristorenas Orchestra, then considered the finishing school of jazz in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1955, Molina and Tony Velarde formed Jazz Friends. The original band members included Piding Alava (piano) and Angel Pe&ntilde;a (bass). The iconic Jazz Friends blazed the Philippine jazz scene and immediately established the artistic standard for other jazz bands and artists. During the late 1950s, the UPSILON fraternity of the University of the Philippines started a series of concerts that brought jazz music to the university campus. This event has since then become an institution. He was also a member of the Executive Jazz Band from 1967 to 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Molina was also a music critic. He got his first job as a journalist in 1954, but it was only in 1960, after a brief stint as a salesperson for a Manila appliance firm that he landed a job as deskman for the <b><i>Evening News</i></b>. He eventually became its editorial writer, then features editor, and incidental music reviewer. He moved on to other newspapers until he was invited to set up <b><i>Business Day</i></b><i> </i>(now <b><i>Business World</i></b>) in 1967. He was its managing editor and music reviewer until his retirement in 1987. He was also a member of the Samahan ng mga Manunulat at Manunuri sa Musika sa Pilipinas or SAMMPI since 1985 up to his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was considered by many as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Jazz,&rdquo; promoting this musical idiom to as many audiences as he could reach. Throughout his musical career he had inspired several Filipino jazz artists to continue the Philippine jazz tradition. Molina remained active in the concert scene in spite of a stroke he suffered in 1982. He led the Philippine Jazz Ensemble at the Monterey Jazz Festival in California in 1981, and participated in the Asian Arts Festival in Hong Kong in 1982. His passion for jazz music is best reflected in his statement:<i> </i>&ldquo;A crusade for sane music in this country is often a labor of love.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEdna Marcil M.

Created by Congress on 18 Jun 1955, it was formally organized in May 1956 with the following board of trustees: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>, chair; Isabel Roces, vice-chair; LucreciaR.Kasilag, secretary; Evelina <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w, treasurer; RamonTapales, liaison officer; and Liwanag P. Cruz, LeonorOrosa-Goquingco, and FelipePadilladeLeon, members. The Foundation has launched a number of major projects, starting with the first Philippine Music Festival in Feb 1957. This featured Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>NoliMeTangere </i></b>(Touch Me Not) which was a major full-length opera in Tagalog of its time, a ballet and dance concert, and a symphony band concert. It has sponsored grand band concerts, national band competitions, ballets, concerts, <b>sarsuwela</b>, operas, and recitals by its scholars. From 1952 to 1972, it commissioned 20 works, including operas, sarsuwela, symphonies, concertos, symphonicpoems, works for chorus and orchestra, overtures, and chambermusic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Foundation is credited with having opened the door of opportunity to many gifted Filipino musical artists through scholarships, travel grants, and various national competitions. Many personalities in Philippine music&mdash;conductors, pianists, singers, composers, choreographers, bandleaders, musicologists&mdash;owe much of their development and training to the Foundation. Its list of scholars include CecileLicad, AndreaVeneracion, BenjaminTupas, GamalielViray, and AliceReyes. The Foundation operated until 1989, when it was turned over to the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5495\"><strong>Edgardo B.

Quiapo, Manila 22 May 1867 d. Quiapo, Manila 2 Nov 1960. Composer, pianist. He was the fourth of 12 children of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> Nakpil, a musician and jeweler, and Juana Putco Garcia.

Juan Nakpil, the eldest and only son became a National Artist for architecture. Julio and Gregoria with their children lived in the house built by Dr Ariston Bautista and wife Petrona Nakpil as the couple was childless.

The strict education at this school did not appeal to the precocious and highly creative child. He was well read and even learned to read and write well in Spanish. He was also largely self-taught in music. After taking a few lessons in violin from Ramon Valdes and piano with his cousin Manuel Mata, he honed his musical talent on his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He became a well-known pianist in Manila&rsquo;s affluent society performing in social gatherings and at the Malaca&ntilde;an Palace during the time of Gov Eulogio Despojol. He started composing short pieces for the piano and his first known work was &ldquo;Cefiro&rdquo; (Zephyr) in 1888. Other early compositions were &ldquo;Ylang-Ylang,&rdquo; a <b>mazurka de salon</b>; &ldquo;La Brisa Nocturna&rdquo; (The Night Breeze), a habanera; &ldquo;Noche Tempestuosa&rdquo; (Stormy Night), a<b> polka de salon</b>, and the danzas &ldquo;Eco de Iloco&rdquo; (Echoes from Iloco) and Ecos de Visayas (Echoes From Visayas), all in 1890. In 1891, he composed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Capiz&rdquo; (Memories of Capiz), a habanera, which became his most famous work. It reached six printings with the first edition published by Louis Schumpff, an editor in Paris. This piece together with the &ldquo;Luz Poetica Amor&rdquo; (Dawn of Enlightenment), 1892, and the &ldquo;Exposicion Regional de Filipina,&rdquo; 1895, were awarded a Diploma of Honor in the Exposicion Regional held in the Philippines in 1895. He also received acclaim in succeeding expositions receiving diplomas and medals in Hanoi in 1902 and St Louis in 1904. His other compositions for piano before the onset of the revolution were &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Luisa,&rdquo; 1891, &ldquo;Clotilde,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dance Campestre,&rdquo; a <b>habanera para concierto</b>, also for violin and piano, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/930\"><strong>Lulay</strong></a>,&rdquo; 1892.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nakpil was deeply stirred by the events leading to the revolution.

The NAMCYA seeks to encourage young artists to excel in performance, and to preserve, develop, and promote Philippine music as art and as a handmaid of cultural development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 1973, the main sponsoring institution of the annual event has been the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) whose president sits as chairperson of the national committee which conducts the competitions. The CCP has also hosted the competitions and festivals in its venues. In 2001, Presidential Proclamation No 80 was signed affirming NAMCYA&rsquo;s continuing mission for the development of the nation&rsquo;s young artists. This proclamation also further designated the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a> as the principal supporting agency of NAMCYA.

An important contribution of the NAMCYA to Philippine musical literature is the commissioning of new contest pieces annually which provides a continuous source of works with high artistic quality from prominent Filipino composers such as Ramon Santos, Lucio San Pedro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>, Felipe Padilla de Leon, Lucrecia Kasilag, Ruben Federizon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, Josefino Toledo, and Eudenice Palaruan.

Navarro</b>) aka Pedro N. Bravo.<b> </b>b. Tagudin, Ilocus Sur 17 Sep 1879 d. Malabon, Rizal 9 Mar 1951. Conductor, composer. He came from humble beginnings as the only child of Pedro Bravo, a fisherman, and his wife, Bartola Navarro. In 1904, he married Timotea Garcia. His daughters Irene, Severena, and Leonor were also musicians. He is the grandfather of Mary Talusan, a Filipino-American ethnomusicologist who teaches at Loyola Marymount University in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During his lifetime, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong>Pedro Navarro</strong></a> was a respected band director and composer. After losing his father to the sea before Pedro reached the age of nine, Pedro was brought to the local convent where he studied violin and flute. Fr Mariano Ortiz, a Spanish priest, recognized his musical talent and sent him to the San Agustin Convent in Manila. From age 11 until he was a young man, he sang in the choir, played piccolo and violin, and studied solfeggio and harmony with the famous composer and teacher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a>, then <b>maestro di capella</b> (choirmaster)<i> </i>of San Agustin Church in Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the end of the Spanish-American war in 1898, Pedro left the convent and joined several American military bands in Manila, including the 6th US Artillery Band. Loving heard Navarro and convinced him to join the newly founded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a> in 1902. Around this time, he changed his last name from Bravo to Navarro, his mother&rsquo;s maiden name. In 1904, Navarro traveled with the PC Band to the United States to participate in the Philippine Exhibit of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis, Missouri, known as the St Louis World&rsquo;s Fair. It was during this world&rsquo;s fair that the PC Band became known to international music lovers, was recognized by John Philip Sousa, and acknowledged as among the best bands in the world. A legend still told today is that during the PC Band&rsquo;s performance of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Tell Overture</i></b><i> </i>the lights suddenly went out<i>,</i> but the amazing musicians kept playing in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1909, Navarro served as Chief Musician when the PC Band returned to the United States at the invitation of President-elect Taft to march in his inaugural parade. They were celebrated by American music lovers in Washington DC, New York, Boston, Atlantic City, New Jersey, Chicago, Cincinnati, Madison, Wisconsin, and Denver. They participated in the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific International Exposition and was praised by Pres William Howard Taft wherever they went. In 1915, Navarro proved himself an effective leader when Loving became ill and actually took charge of the PC Band at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco for 10 months, during which they were presented with a bronze medal. Shortly after returning to Manila, Loving retired as major, and during his farewell concert in Feb 1916 handed the baton to Navarro in the middle of the piece &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo; Navarro was active as the conductor for a period of 18 months from 1916 to 1918, performing each week at the Luneta and other venues. In addition to the standard Euro-American concert band repertoire, Navarro often included his own compositions during PC Band concerts. He left his position as conductor suddenly for active duty in Baguio where he served from 1918 to 1924. He retired from Philippine Constabulary after his tour was finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">After retiring from the PC, Navarro continued his musical activities. In 1925, he established the all-girls Banda <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> in Malabon that included his daughters Irene, Severina, and Leonor. In 1926, Navarro became director of National University (NU) Band and often combined both boys and girls band together for performances. He was criticized for including girls in his bands because bands up until then had been exclusively male. In 1928, the all-girls Banda Ligaya won at the Manila Carnival. In 1932, it won the &ldquo;All-star&rdquo; Band Championship, while the National University all-boys won the Band Music Contest. Navarro continued to conduct the NU Band until 1940, while directing other bands in Malabon.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarro died at age 72, surrounded by band musicians who were rehearsing then, still holding their instruments. A Requiem Mass was held for him at the San Bartolome Parochial Church in Malabon on Tuesday, 13 Mar. He was buried at the Philippine Army plot in the Cementerio del Norte in Manila. Few of Navarro&rsquo;s compositions survived after he died, but recent research uncovered dozens of band pieces including numerous marches and pieces featuring instrumental solos. The titles of the compositions&mdash;such as &ldquo;Los Brutos y Borregos&rdquo; (Brutes and Sheeps), <b>paso doble</b>; &ldquo;Bonnet,&rdquo; march; &ldquo;Acedera,&rdquo; solo for trombone; &ldquo;Miss Rubio,&rdquo; for solo saxophone; and &ldquo;Id Est,&rdquo; for solo cornet&mdash;reveal the historical eras that Navarro belonged to in his lifetime, including the Japanese regime. On 18 Jul 2014, the UP Symphonic Band featured several of Navarro&rsquo;s works, which have not been heard for half a century. He was honored by his hometown of Tagudin, Ilocos Sur in Dec 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byMary Talusan</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Instruments of the ensembles are bamboo replicas of European band instruments such as oboe, clarinet, horn (<i>trompa</i>), trumpet, trombone, saxophone, and sousaphone. Due to the material of the instruments, the sound of each instrument is very different from its original model. In fact, the instruments rely on the voice of the performers to produce the sounds. An instrument is open at both ends and has a hole on the side covered with a membrane that produces a buzzing sound when the player &ldquo;hums,&rdquo; rather than blows, into the mouthpiece of the instrument. The air pressure of the &ldquo;hum&rdquo; makes the membrane vibrate, varying the pitch and loudness. The shape of the instrument amplifies and projects the sound. The group also employs other instruments like the harmonica, cymbals, and snare and bass drums.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The origin of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4104\"><strong>Obando Musikong Bumbong</strong></a> can be traced back to the time of the Philippine Revolution against Spain (1896-98). Obando is in Bulacan, which was one of the first eight provinces in Luzon to revolt against Spanish rule. It was founded by Bonifacio Anastacio. In the 1950s, Obando Musikong Bumbong also came to be called the Santa Clara Musikong Bumbong after the name of one of the patron saints of the town, Santa Clara. The two other patron saints are San Pascual Baylon and the Virgin of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>bao. Santa Clara is believed to miraculously grant prayers, especially the wish of a childless couple for a long and much awaited offspring, following the fulfillment of the annual &ldquo;fertility dance&rdquo; held in the Obando town fiesta from 17-19 May. This is done in the churchyard where devotees and pilgrims from all walks of life converge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Santa Clara Musikong Bumbong performs the song &ldquo;Santa Klarang Pinung-Pino&rdquo; (Exquisite Saint Claire) during the procession that commences from and ends in the Obando Church. Devotees dance, swaying their hips and moving their hands and waist in unison. For variety, the ensemble also plays other types of music, as do the other regular marching bands, which also participate in the celebration.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from their local religious devotional ritual function, the group has been invited to perform in town fiestas in other provinces like Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and Rizal. The group was selected to participate in the 5th Philippine Folk Festival held at the Folk Arts Theater on from 4 to 11 July 1982 and in the Marian Congress and the Holy Trinity Special Project held at the Quirino Grandstand on 29 Jan 2000. In 1998, the Santa Clara Musikong Bumbong was chosen to represent the Philippines in the 32nd Smithsonian Folklife Festival, an international exposition of living cultural heritage that features community-based cultural groups held in Washington, DC.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Membership in Santa Clara Musikong Bumbong consists of around 25 males, mostly family members, relatives, and their neighbors. Most of the members are young, with the following age distribution: a few between 7 to 12 years old, seven to nine members who are adults, and three to four senior citizens. Organizationally, the ensemble has a president who takes charge and gives counsel to the group and a trainer who takes charge of the rehearsals and conducts and gives cues during performances. Maximo C. Santiago or &ldquo;Ka Emong,&rdquo; 82 years old in 2014, became the sixth president of the ensemble during the 1950s. He still plays the harmonica and saxophone. Rodrigo C. Anastacio is the bass drum player, trainer, instrument maker, and a third genaration descendant of the founder, Bonifacio Anastacio. Antonio A. Anastacio, son of Bonifacio, was the former trainer and conductor of the group. The following are the other former leaders of the group: Genaro Ramos, Bianong Cabigao, Jose S. Roxas Sr, Mariano Remigio, and Roman Sta Ana. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byPacita Narzo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Among the founding members were DalisayAldaba who conceived the idea, Chito Madrigal Vasquez, Eloisa F. Revilla, Letty Montelibano, Lee Dilworth Dibble, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Nicholoff. The guild was set up as a private nonstock corporation to promote and stimulate interest and broaden the base of support for opera training of the highest professional standards; to make scholarships available to young Filipino artists in need of financial assistance; to undertake a continuing program of opera presentations; and to strive for professionalism in all aspects of opera, so that Filipino opera artists may meet international standards necessary to project a Philippine cultural image abroad. At present, the Guild is chaired by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cojuangco.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrevious chairpersons include Chito Madrigal Vasquez, Eugenia Puyat, and Glecy Tantoco. In 1969 the Guild initially began to stage its performances in the open-air theater of the Dulaang Raha Sulayman in FortSantiago in a program billed as <b><i>Opera Under the Stars </i></b>with excerpts from Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>The Impressario</i></b>, Purcell&rsquo;s <b><i>Dido and Aeneas</i></b>, Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>La Boheme</i></b>, Strauss&rsquo;s <b><i>Faust</i></b>, among others. The Guild later transferred to the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines where it staged the full-scale performances of Leoncavallo&rsquo;s <b><i>I Pagliacci </i></b>and Pergolesi&rsquo;s <b><i>La Serva Pedrona </i></b>in 1970, and later, Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>The Impressario</i></b>, Mascagni&rsquo;s <b><i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i></b>, Smetana&rsquo;s <b><i>The Bartered Bride</i></b>, Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>Madame Butterfly </i></b>and <b><i>Tosca</i></b>, and Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>The Marriage of Figaro</i></b>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe guild&rsquo;s last three operas were successfully produced in cooperation with the CCP. <b><i>Madame Butterfly </i></b>featured Wilma Vernocchi of La Scala de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a> and Italian tenor Franco Corici. <b><i>Tosca </i></b>had a Filipino choir singing with the complete cast of the San Francisco Opera <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> led by world-class tenor Placido Domingo and Eva Marton. It became the biggest production and largest opera season of the Guild. Mozart&rsquo;s comic opera featured an all-Filipino cast. In 1992 the Guild produced yet another successful staging of <b><i>Rigoletto </i></b>which also featured an international cast. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLucresia R.

The group was founded on 6 Sep 1966 at the Aurora A. Quezon Elementary School in Quezon City by Victor Toledo. It is a youth orchestra playing music on bamboo instruments. The original group, the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4112\"><strong>Pangkat Kawayan</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> composed of 50 elementary school children, lasted for 13 years. In 1973, the second Pangkat Kawayan Company was organized, followed by the third in 1978, and the fourth in 1983. Each formation was retired as soon as 50 percent of the members reached the age of 24. At present, the group is composed of students in elementary, secondary, and college levels from Quezon City and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first musical pieces of Pangkat Kawayan consisted of Filipino folk melodies. It has developed a repertoire of traditional music, light classics, modern pieces, and popular music both Filipino and foreign. The group&rsquo;s more than <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> instruments consist of various types of bamboo: the <b>bumbong</b>, a musical bamboo tube; <b>talungating</b> or bamboo marimba; <b>tipangklung</b>, a set of angklung (bamboo shakers) arranged as a horizontal keyboard, also known as &ldquo;bamboo piano&rdquo;; bamboo flute <b>tulali</b>; a bamboo clapper <b>bungkaka</b>; a bamboo knocker <b>kalatok</b>; xylophones <b>gabbang</b>; rattles <b>alugtug</b>; pipe <b>diwdiwas</b>; and Philippine <b>angklung</b>. Completing the orchestra are supplementary instruments such as drums, cymbals, gongs, triangles, and tambourines. Toledo designed the instruments, and he continues to manufacture new ones from bamboo and other materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pangkat Kawayan has performed in many musical programs and entertained at national and international conferences. Its first performance abroad was at the World Expo &lsquo;70 in Osaka, Japan. This was followed by performances in other world expositions and in international festivals. It played for &ldquo;Balikbayan&rdquo; performance tours in Hawaii and the West Coast in 1973, and in the United States mainland and Canada in 1974. In 1975, it was sent on official missions to Australia and Spain, and in 1978 to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. It also performed in the United States in 1982 and 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ensemble is led by Laura Gorospe, executive director; Elena Carlos, managing director; and Victor Toledo, musical director and conductor.

Beginning as a garage band named Comic Relief, it was composed of the following founding members: vocalists Chito Miranda, Vinci Montaner, and Jeric Estaco, with guitarists Gab Chee Kee and Mikko Yap, then high school students of the Ateneo de Manila University. At an earlier period, they opened for a concert by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a> at the Ateneo school fair. Later, they recruited Buwi Meneses (bass) and Dindi Moreno (drums), and renamed themselves <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a>. Yap, who is credited for coining the band&rsquo;s name, left after high school and was replaced by Darius Sema&ntilde;a (lead guitar).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In one of their appearances at the underground rock venue Club Dredd, they impressed Universal Records&rsquo; managing director, Bella Dy Tan, who signed them immediately to the label. Their first album <b><i>Khangkhungkherrnitz</i></b>, 1996, sold 120,000 copies and was conferred triple platinum record status by the Philippine Association of the Recording Industry. Their succeeding albums were <b><i>Buruguduystunstugudunstuy</i></b>, 1997, which also achieved triple platinum record sales; <b><i>Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow</i></b>, 1998, which attained gold record status; and <b><i>Gulong Itlog Gulong</i></b> (Roll, Egg, Roll), 1999, once again achieving triple platinum record status, featured a deviation from their expected novelty mold with the rock ballad, &ldquo;Halaga&rdquo; (Value).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PNE&rsquo;s tongue-twisting album titles have created legendary consternation among fans and record store sales personnel. The band&rsquo;s prodigious output in the succeeding years, <b><i>Edgar Edgar Musikahan </i></b>(Edgar, Edgar Music Making), 2002; <b><i>Bigotilyo </i></b>(Mr. Moustache), 2003; <b><i>Inuman Sessions </i></b>(Drinking Sessions<i>)<b> Vol</b>.<b>1</b></i>, 2004; <b><i>Halina sa Parokya</i></b> (Come to the Parokya)<i>,</i> 2005; <b><i>Solid</i></b>, 2007, and <b><i>Middle Aged Juvenile <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\"><strong>Novel</strong></a>ty Pop Rockers</i></b>, 2010, and <b><i>Inuman Sessions Vol</i></b><i>.<b> 2</b>,</i> 2012 brought Parokya ni Edgar an envied commercial longevity. In Oct 2012, founding member Vinci Montaner left the band after a lucrative 20-year stint to devote his time to a school for special children. The band itself had taken time out for advocacy, such as the &ldquo;Free Mali&rdquo; (the solitary elephant in the Manila Zoo) animal rights campaign initiated by People for the Ethical Treatment of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>mals (PETA) in 2013. Montaner briefly reunited with the band in 2013 for a one-off appearance by Parokya to launch their greatest hits and 20th anniversary album <b><i>Bente </i></b>(Twenty). PNE was awarded with the MYX Magna Award in 2014. The band&rsquo;s most recent concert tour was in 2015 when they performed in key cities in the United States. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byJuan Bautista H.

Its weekly sessions at Nayong Pilipino&rsquo;s Batangas House follow a three-level curriculum that includes rudiments, solfeggio, violin ensemble, and string orchestra performance. The group was originally composed of 25 children of Government Social Insurance System (GSIS) employees whom Sales taught for free on weekends. Its membership at one time grew to about 300-450 children but is now limited to 150. Its past members make up 35 percent of professional string players in Philippine symphonic orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group performed at the CCP twice a year, as well as in two television programs namely, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1482\"><strong>Paco Park Presents</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b>. Initially funded by parents of its students through minimal monthly contributions, Pasaknungan since 1981 has been jointly supported by the Philippine National Oil Corporation and the CCP. Due to the vast number of young aspiring musicians, the association had to seek the assistance of its very own musicians who were more advanced to guide the younger ones in their music learning. Some of these were Rebecca Alejaga and Jorge Joy Sababan who eventually became members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a>. Also, violinist Dionesia &ldquo;Donnie&rdquo; Fernandez was discovered in the group, sent as a scholar to Juilliard School of Music in New York until she finished her postgraduate education. Fernandez eventually occupied the assistant concertmaster position of the White House Orchestra in Washington, DC. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEdna Marcil M.

It was born of the protest movement against the Marcos dictatorship, aiming to compose and popularize protest music. Its membership has ranged from 12 to 20, drawn from different fields of endeavor. Through its music workshops in various regions of the country, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4116\"><strong>Patatag</strong></a> has helped in the formation of protest chorales like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><strong>Balitaw</strong></a></strong></a> in Cebu, Salidumay in the Cordilleras, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>ntog in Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Patatag gave its debut performance on 6 Mar 1984 to welcome the Lakbayan protest marchers who converged at the University of the Philippines (UP) Sunken Garden on the eve of a massive rally at Liwasang Bonifacio. It rendered songs like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng Tagumpay&rdquo; (Song of Victory) and &ldquo;Dapat Bawiin&rdquo; (We Must Recover), Filipino adaptations from the works of Chilean composer-poet Victor Jara. Patatag held its first concert, <b><i>Alay sa Magbubukid</i></b> (Homage to the Farmer), in Oct 1984 at the National Press Club in support of various farmers&rsquo; issues. This was followed by two concerts in 1985: <b><i>Nagbabagang Lupa </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a> on Fire), which dramatized the national outrage over the massacre of farmers in Escalante, Negros Occidental, and <b><i>Buhay Proletaryo </i></b>(Proletarian Life), a tribute to the workers&rsquo; movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1985, the group went on a tour of the Visayas, performing and holding workshops for amateur musicians in Bohol, Samar, Leyte, Bacolod, and Cebu. It recorded its songs in cassette, titled <b><i>Nagbabagang Lupa</i></b>. In 1987, Patatag raised the issue of human rights in its concert <b><i>OPLAN Patatag </i></b>at the Folk Arts Theater. In 1988, it recorded <b><i>Batang Clark </i></b>(A Kid From Clark), in support of the campaign against the US military bases, and in 1990, a collection of religious protest songs called <b><i>Masdan</i></b><i>, <b>O Yahweh </b></i>(Look, O Yahweh). Over the years, Patatag has played indigenous-based music like &ldquo;Bebsat san Kaigorotan&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> Community), folk ballads like &ldquo;Tano&rdquo; (depicting the condition of poor peasants), pop songs like &ldquo;Batang Clark,&rdquo; traditional music like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/861\"><strong>Baleleng</strong></a>,&rdquo; <b>kundiman</b><i> </i>like &ldquo;Manggagawa&rdquo; (Worker), church music, rock, and art songs. Some of its members include theater artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\"><strong>Rody Vera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2952\"><strong>Upeng Galang-Fernandez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3156\"><strong>Louie Pascasio</strong></a>, Lia Moran, Bessie Lee, Dodgie Fernandez, Ella Ola, Noel Kintanar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\"><strong>Chris Millado</strong></a>, Susan Fernandez, Fidel Nemenzo, Clotilde Lucero, Lorenzo Gealogo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\"><strong>Al Santos</strong></a>, Telly Nacpil, Norman Mendoza, and Mark Encarnacion. Many of them have gone on to establish successful careers in different fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Patatag received nominations for Best Music Group, 1987, and Best Live Concert, 1988, in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Awards. The songs of Patatag are considered as the ones that lent a strong voice to the struggling people of the 1980s and the 1990s, elevating protest music into recognized high revolutionary art and culture. They make up the prolific musical tradition of the leftist mass movement that continues to be relevant amongst the oppressed classes in Philippine societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tribute to the music of Patatag was held at the UP College of Music in Aug 2015 which featured the religious protest songs of <b><i>Masdan, O Yahweh</i></b>, interpreted by the UP College of Music faculty and students, with a pre-concert forum by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a> and Rody Vera, under a Metro Manila Commission Professorial Chair Lecture. The concert served as a reunion for the Patatag members. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> Carununganupdated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Although organized in its present form during the early part of 1949, this miniature air force band was already in existence much earlier as a section of the 534th Air Base Squadron in Pasay City. In 1952, the PAF Band was activated pursuant to Section 1, General Order Number 212 of General Headquarters, Armed Forces of the Philippines. Its organizer, Lt Lauro L. Abano, was subsequently designated as its first commanding officer. Succeeding him at the helm later were Maj Mariano S. Bareng, Maj Valentin Y. Mechilina, and Col Emiliano T. Pineda. In 1961, 1st Lt Augusto C. Bataclan took over the Command as the fifth Commanding Officer and held it for 16 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PAF Band is composed of one officer and more than 60 bandsmen, with a unit component of an eight-piece combo and an 18-man dance orchestra. The band&rsquo;s primary mission is to furnish music for military and social functions of the Command. It is also tasked to provide miscellaneous support for other services such as radio broadcasts, stage shows, concerts, and other musical activities as the Commander may direct. Since its activation, the band has not only rendered concerts at the Rizal Park and Nayong Pilipino but also in principal cities, provincial capitals, and different towns all over the country. In 1953, upon the invitation of General Wang Shu-Min, known as &ldquo;Tiger Wang&rdquo; of the Nationalist Chinese Air Force, the band performed for two weeks at different military bases in Taipei, Taiwan. It has also played at international conventions, ASEAN conferences, National Day celebrations, programs of government and civilian agencies, gatherings of different foreign embassies, and athletic competitions. This unit also provides musical requirements for arrival and departure of different heads of state, celebrities, tourists, balikbayan, and other foreign dignitaries at the Manila International Airport, now known as the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4118\"><strong>Philippine Air Force Band</strong></a> is known not only as a unit of fine musicians but also as a group of outstanding and dependable military men. The band, regarded as the best marching unit of the PAF, has won several awards and trophies at different competitions like the 520th Air Base Wing Monthly Flight Drill Competition, the PAF Inter-Wing Mass Calesthenics Competition, and the Nichols Air Base Platoon Drill Competition. The band has also been a consistent recipient of plaques, resolutions, certificates, letters of appreciations and awards of merit from various government and civilian institutions. With the passing of years, the PAF Band has become an indispensable outfit of the Command in pursuance of the Armed Forces of the Philippines&rsquo; commitment to the entire Filipino people, particularly towards the enrichment of the country&rsquo;s arts and culture. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRodney D.

The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4119\"><strong>Philippine Army Band</strong></a> began as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a> or PC Band. Organized on 15 Oct 1902 by Col Walter H. Loving, the then Philippine Constabulary (PC) Band catapulted the cause of band music, brought fame to the country, and established itself as a highly accomplished musical organization. In addition to its performances at home, the band crossed oceans on several tours in early decades of the 20th century to represent this island nation in Southeast Asia. The PC Band played at the St Louis Exposition in 1904, the inauguration of President Howard Taft in Washington, DC in 1909, and the Pan Pacific Exposition and Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco, California in 1938. In 1904, this powerhouse band of some 87 players attracted visitors from all over the world to the St Louis Exposition&rsquo;s Philippine Pavilion, where the smartly uniformed band performed everyday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sharing the limelight with Col Loving were two Filipinos who alternated in conducting the said band: Capt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong>Pedro Navarro</strong></a> and Capt Alfonso Fresnido. During the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines, some members of the band were mobilized into the Metropolitan Constabulary Band. After the death of Col Loving and Capt Fresnido during World War II, then Defense Secretary Maj Gen Basilio J. Valdez designated 2nd Lt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> to re-organize the band in 1945. Under the young officer&rsquo;s direction, the organization was renamed the Philippine Army Band. Col Buenaventura was able to regroup practically all members and, shortly after, the band once more bounced back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period after World War II saw the welcome return of overseas performances as musical ambassadors. When Dr Goldman came to Manila in 1946, he personally selected the band in his conducting under the USO. His report considered the band as the principal military band in the entire Pacific area. In Aug 1955, Pres Ramon Magsaysay sent the band to Jakarta, Indonesia to officially represent the Philippines in the First Floating Exposition in Southeast Asia. A high point for the band came toward the end of its first 90 years when in 1992 under then Commanding General, Philippine Army Lt Gen Arturo Enrile, the band participated in the Singapore National Day Parade as part of the ASEAN Festival in Singapore. The Singapore Armed Forces senior director of music Col Toni Wei Shi Ren was full of admiration and praise for the performance of the Philippine Army Band. Col Buenaventura led the prestigious band for 16 years when it was in the musical limelight. When he retired in 1961, he handed down the baton to Lt Col Jesus del Carmen. In 1964, Lt Leonardo Sabale took over and recruited many young talents. When Capt Sabale was assigned to General Headquarters, Lt Elias Roan took over. He was later succeeded by Lt Sg Eliseo Javier who continued running the outfit in its proud tradition of excellence in music. In 1973, Lt Col Javier passed the baton and command to a younger conductor, Maj Jose FG Dunca Jr, from the 1st (Tabak) Division, Fort Magsaysay, Palayan City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Army Band contributed immensely to the appreciation and propagation of band music through the holding of annual concerts on legitimate stages. Likewise, it lent its artistry to grace military as well as socio-civic affairs. For over a century, the Philippine Army Band has established a remarkable tradition that has succeeded and prevailed over the upheavals of two world wars and the changes of political administrations. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRodney D.

It paved the way for the organization and development of other local choral groups in the country. At one time or another, the PCS had practically all the well-known vocal artists of the local concert stage as either as members or soloists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a decade of dormancy in 1960 and 1971, the PCS was revived on 21 Mar 1971 when Cruz became its musical director once more. With new members and a new repertoire, it presented a revival concert at the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines(CCP), featuring Orff&rsquo;s <b><i>Carmina Burana</i></b>, Beethoven&rsquo;s <b><i>Choral Fantasie</i></b>, FelipePadilladeLeon&rsquo;s <b><i>NoliMeTangere </i></b>(Touch Me Not), LucioD.SanPedro&rsquo;s <b><i>Valedictory <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1932\"><strong>Poems</strong></a> </i></b>(of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>), and BenjaminTupas&rsquo;s &ldquo;AveMaria.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1973, the PCS held auditions for singers wishing to join the organization.

Allen, chief of the Philippine Constabulary, who felt the need for a band to assist in military ceremonies as well as in civic and official functions. Its formation got encouragement from then Civil Gov Howard H. Taft and Vice Gov Luke Wright. Then 2nd Lt Walter H. Loving, who was designated the commanding officer, organized the band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Loving was an African-American who was born in Lovingstone, Virginia on 17 Dec 1872 and had his musical education from the New England Conservatory. He imposed strict discipline among the musicians and set a high standard for band playing. He took only the best among Filipino musicians after passing a rigorous audition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The band was sent to the 1904 St Louis Exposition where it became a sensation after playing completely in the dark in a competition when the light snapped out while it was playing Giacomo Rossini&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Tell Overture</i></b>. Loving tied a white handkerchief at the tip of his baton to cue accurately the musicians who memorized their parts. The band continued playing during the entire power outage that lasted for an hour, without missing any notes under accurate cueing. At once, Loving and the musicians became &ldquo;world celebrities.&rdquo; The band bagged the second prize, with the first prize going to the veteran Le Garde Republicaine band of France. It played alongside with seasoned bands from America and Europe such as the US Marine Corps Band, the John Philip Sousa Band, the Mexican National Band, the band of the British Grenadier Guards, and the Royal Italian Band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Loving trained the band to double as an orchestra when they arrived home having been inspired by the Victor Herbert Orchestra and the German Symphony Orchestra at the exposition. It is this sole distinction to play as an orchestra that added prestige to the band&rsquo;s fame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The band made its second visit to the United States on the occasion of Pres William Howard Taft&rsquo;s inauguration as president of the United States in 1909 where it earned many &ldquo;firsts.&rdquo; It was the first non-American band that accompanied Pres Taft in the inaugural parade from the White House to the Capitol where he would take his oath of office, an honor traditionally given to the famed US Marine Band. It was also the first non-American band that played during Pres Taft&rsquo;s reception and the first non-American band to perform at a new riverside bandstand in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From Washington, the band proceeded to fulfill engagements in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Atlantic City in New Jersey, and Seattle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1913, the band went back to the United States to play at the Panama-Pacific Exposition at San Francisco, California, giving side performances in Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a>, Yokohama, Kobe, and Honolulu. Sousa conducted the band at the Exposition and ranked it the &ldquo;best and organized&rdquo; among the bands that played.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1916, Sgt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong>Pedro Navarro</strong></a> took over as the band&rsquo;s conductor when Loving got sick of tuberculosis. When Navarro retired the following year, Lt Jose Silos succeeded him. Alfonso Fresnido took over as the band&rsquo;s conductor when Silos retired after a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1938, Pres Manuel Quezon recalled Loving to prepare the band to play in the Golden Gate Exposition in California that was scheduled the following year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In between these overseas engagements, the band gave concerts first at the Binondo Square in front of the Binondo Church known as Plaza Calderon de la Barca before it went to the 1904 St Louis Exposition. Later on, Luneta (now Rizal Park) became its venue for its regular serenata or band concert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The band was disorganized when the Pacific war broke out. Loving and his wife Edith were incarcerated at the University of Santo Tomas for three years and three months. Prominent citizens of Manila pleaded to release the couple. They were allowed to go back to their apartment in Ermita. During the liberation, a Japanese who had gone berserk in Feb 1945 beheaded Loving at Luneta, ironically the site of his greatness, where he and the band gave the best performances that made them famous among the Filipino audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1945, Maj Gen Basilio Valdez, then secretary of National Defense ordered the reorganization of the band assigning Lt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> the task. He was able to gather some 98 original members. However, because the PC had not been reactivated yet, the band was placed under the Philippine Army. It bounced back to life with Buenaventura handling it for 16 years. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

Formerly the UP Madrigal Singers. Choral Ensemble. Organized in 1963 by Andrea O. Veneracion of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music, it was modeled after the University of Indiana Madrigal Choir where Veneracion earned a master&rsquo;s degree in voice. The group&rsquo;s first public performance of a choral program was at the UP Abelardo Hall on 1 Oct 1963. In Feb 1964, it held its first public performance outside of the university at the Philamlife Auditorium, attended by Pres Diosdado Macapagal and the First Lady. The choir participated at the 2nd International Choral Festival in 1969 that marked its first international exposure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1980, the choir changed its name to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a> when it became a resident company of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> that entitled them to an annual subsidy. The current choirmaster since 2001 is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3929\"><strong>Mark Anthony Carpio</strong></a>. Originally composed of 12 singers, they now have 18 to 24 members who are teachers, students, and alumni of UP. Their unique style of concertizing&mdash;sitting in a semicircle&mdash;is drawn from the style of singing the <b>madrigal</b>, a Renaissance piece sung a capella by entertainers or guests gathered around banquet tables. The group&rsquo;s repertoire includes Renaissance music, European classics, Filipino and international folk songs, contemporary music, sacred music, Negro spirituals, avant-garde, opera, and even popular music. It aims to set standards of excellence in choral competitions, develop appreciation for choral music, establish the Philippines as an active and respected member of the international choral community, and widen the Philippine perspective on choral works and techniques. They have also performed in the premieres of choral works by major Filipino composers like Lucrecia Kasilag, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>, Ruben Federizon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3938\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3939\"><strong>Jeffrey Ching</strong></a></strong></a>, as well as in operas and <b>sarsuwela</b>. The choir is one of the Asia&rsquo;s most awarded, having won the top prizes in the world&rsquo;s most prestigious choral competitions: Arezzo and Gorizia, Italy; Marktoberdorf, Germany; Spittal, Austria; Neuchatel, Switzerland; Tour, France; Varna, Bulgaria; Debrecen, Hungary; and Cantonigros and Torrevieja, Spain. They hold the distinction of being the first choir in the world to win the European Grand Prix for choral singing twice, in 1997 and 2007. Some of the group&rsquo;s members have moved on to become choirmasters, musical directors, solo performers, and teachers, notably <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4060\"><strong>Elmo Makil</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4065\"><strong>Evelyn Mandac</strong></a>, Enrico Saboren, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3875\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3878\"><strong>Francisco Aseniero</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4219\"><strong>Noel Velasco</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1992, the Philippine Madrigal Singers went on its sixth international concert tour covering Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Brunei Darussalam. They also participated in the l0th Anniversary celebration of the International Federation for Choral Music.

The Philippine Navy Band was born on 1 Mar 1949 when Lt Anastacio Sosa was designated officer-in-charge and conductor of a small unit of military musicians, then known as the Philippine Naval Patrol Band. It was later renamed Headquarters Philippine Navy Band on 15 Feb 1952, in conjunction with the reorganization of Philippine Naval Patrol into the Philippine Navy which recruited more personnel. In 1966, Lt Commander Geronimo P. Torres assumed the position as the commanding officer and conductor of the band, which was based at the Philippine Naval Station at Roxas Boulevard, Manila. Now in its present station in Fort Bonifacio and led by Capt Rodolfo Morres, a graduate of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music and former member and assistant conductor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4206\"><strong>UP ROTC Band</strong></a>, the Philippine Navy Band is not only engaged in furnishing music within the command but also in various public concerts, radio broadcasts, and civic affairs. Under Morris&rsquo;s leadership, the Philippine Navy Band was proclaimed champion several times in Philippine Military Bands Concert Competitions in the 1990s. Due to the expansion of the Philippine Navy and the greater support given by the band to civilian sector in the field of music, the Philippine Navy Band expanded from 50 to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> bandsmen. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRodney D.

The Philippine Normal University (PNU) Himig Kawayan was organized in the 1990s by music education professor Pacita Narzo. The group was originally a <b>rondalla</b> class that is a requirement for majors in the bachelor of secondary education in music program at PNU. In 2001, the PNU Rondalla was formally recognized as an independent performing group in the said university. Shortly thereafter, it ventured into angklung ensemble playing. For a time, the same performers play for both the rondalla and angklung ensembles in PNU. Thus, the group was called the PNU Rondalla, Angklung and Ethnic Ensemble. A grant from the Japanese Cultural Center through Grant Assistance for Cultural Grassroots Project in 2007 made possible the separate organization of the PNU Angklung Ensemble. Consequently, the PNU Angklung Ensemble was renamed PNU Himig Kawayan in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An earlier grant from the UNESCO National Cultural Committee in 2003 and from Local Government Units bank rolled the group in organizing, training and monitoring of bamboo instrument ensembles in different localities in the Archipelago. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4126\"><strong>Philippine Society for Music Education</strong></a> (PSME) was also involved in the promotion of music by PNU Himig Kawayan to both local and foreign audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many opportunities paved the way for the transformations of the group. The grant from the Japan Foundation, the close ties with the PSME, and funding from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts defined the directions the group had taken. Funding gave the Himig Kawayan the capacity to build its collection of instruments. Institutional connections with the PSME and the NCCA gave it fora to perform in public and private spaces, and to give lectures on Philippine music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Notable performances of the rondalla group included participation in the First (2004), Second (2007), and Third (2011) International Rondalla Festivals held in the Bicol region, and in the cities of Dumaguete and Tagum, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the many engagements to perform in various education-related activities, government functions and corporate events, the group regularly prepares for annual concerts. Previous concerts were titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1444\"><strong>Himig ng Lahi</strong></a></i> </b>(Song of the Race), 2002; <b><i>Kayamanan ng Lahi</i></b> (Gems of the Race), 2003; <b><i>Kabataan, Musika at Kinabukasan</i></b> (Youth, Music, and the Future), 2006; <b><i>Musika ng Lahing Pilipino</i> </b>(Music of the Filipino Race), 2009; <b><i>Cuerdas sa Pagkakaisa</i></b> (Strings of Unity), 2011; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/915\"><strong>Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika</strong></a> </i></b>(How Beautiful is Our Music), 2012; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/961\"><strong>Ngayon at Kailanman</strong></a></i> </b>(Now and Forever), 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4099\"><strong>Raul Navarro</strong></a></strong> </em><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251913216\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"></v:shape></p>\r\n"

In 1979, the orchestra toured Singapore, Taipei, and Hong Kong. In the Metro Manila area, the orchestra has performed at the UP, the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines, and the PCIBank <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> Hall, among others.

The guild became a foundation in 18 Nov 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At its first general meeting at the Little Theater (now Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) on 11 Mar 1973, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4201\"><strong>Benjamin Tupas</strong></a> gave a lecture-demonstration on &ldquo;Impressionism&mdash;Its History and Relevance to Music and the Humanities.&rdquo; Pianist-pedagogue <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4141\"><strong>Reynaldo Reyes</strong></a> spoke on piano technique and piano repertoire at the guild&rsquo;s first general assembly in 1974.

In the first decade of its existence, the group found itself with a constantly revolving roster of performers that included Pepito Bosch, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\"><strong>Roberto Villanueva</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a> (who was known to have come up with the name after the popular Cordillera dish &ldquo;pinikpikan&rdquo;), Boyu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\"><strong>Diokno Pasilan</strong></a>, Billy Bonnevie, Shant Verdun, Nonoy Alcalde, Samuel Asuncion, Louie Talan, Boy Garovillo, Budeths Casinto, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2785\"><strong>Carol Bello</strong></a>. Through guitarist Asuncion&rsquo;s influence and musical direction, Pinikpikan slowly evolved into a musical force that broke into the local and international &ldquo;world music&rdquo; scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pinikpikan&rsquo;s vision is to &ldquo;present hybrid Filipino music&rdquo; to both local and international audiences, bringing in a &ldquo;texture of ethnicity&rdquo; in their mix of a wide-array of indigenous instruments with the more familiar and amplified sounds of a standard rock band (Asuncion 2015). Pinikpikan&rsquo;s albums include <b><i>Metronomad</i></b>, 1996, <b><i>Atas</i></b> (Mission), 1999, <b><i>Obra <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a> </i></b>(Enchanted Work), 2000, and <b><i>Kaamulan</i></b>, 2003. <b><i>Atas</i></b> garnered five awards including Best Album from KATHA Music Awards in 2000, and is distributed in Europe by Tropical Music, Record and Publishing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. The sounds of gongs (<b>gangsa</b> from the Cordilleras and <b>kulintang</b> from Mindanao), bamboo instruments, and percussions of other music traditions create a distinctive texture to the album&rsquo;s original music. The fifth track &ldquo;Una Kaya&rdquo; (Naturally the First), for example, features the bamboo xylophone <b>gabbang</b> alongside Carol Bello&rsquo;s powerful vocal chanting. The percussive-driven music of Pinikpikan adds to the group&rsquo;s popularity in performances and music festivals that enjoin listeners to participate in the music making and impromptu dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2001, Pinikpikan collaborated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> in staging <b><i>Tambol at Padyak</i></b> (Drum and March) with award-winning choreography by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2462\"><strong>Tony Fabella</strong></a> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. Pinikpikan was also active in the touring circuit, performing around the Philippines in provincial festivals and cultural shows, community concerts, and school events. Abroad, one of the group&rsquo;s major appearances was in the ASEAN Cultural Summit in Sep 2002, performing at the historic site of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Around 2008, Asuncion, along with Bello, Talan, Garovillo, and Casinto, made the transition to form the Kalayo band. Other seasoned musicians joined the group: drummer Reli de Vera (also of Sino Sikat?), multipercussionists Deej Rodriguez, and Gerry Baguio. After its transition to Kalayo, the band has released the album <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a> </i></b>(Free), 2013, and has performed in numerous concerts and music festivals like the 2008 Rainforest World Music Festival in Sarawak and the Penang World Music Festival, and in a special concert in Paris organized by the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise Foundation in 2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byIsidora Miranda</strong> </em><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251918336\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"></v:shape></p>\r\n"

She is the eldest daughter of Josepha Casino and Crisogono Abejo. Baptized Lorna, she credits her childhood music exposure to her educator-parents who played the piano. Her mother, a home economics major at Centro Escolar University, studied piano with the Filipino composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a> Sr, while her father&rsquo;s sister is the nun-composer Sr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3848\"><strong>Rosalina Abejo</strong></a>, RVM. She finished her elementary and secondary education at Tagoloan Central School, 1947, and St Mary&rsquo;s High School, Misamis Oriental, 1951, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abejo availed of piano lessons at Lourdes College of Cagayan de Oro, with P Capistrano, a music graduate of St Scholastica&rsquo;s College (SSC) Manila. She then enrolled in SSC where she graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Music degree, major in piano and composition. On 24 Apr 1963, Abejo professed her vows in the Order of St Benedict (OSB). Advanced studies led her to the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, where, as a recipient of a Levi Barbour Scholarship for Oriental Women in 1971-75, she finished her master&rsquo;s, 1972, and a doctorate, 1975, in music education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon her return to the Philippines, she created some important works. First among these was the twice-published <b><i>Liturgy of Hours</i></b>, 1979, a compilation of her original modal-based melodic settings of the approved English translations of antiphons and psalms. This is still used by Benedictine nuns locally and abroad. Her other accomplishments clearly reflect the main focus of her masteral thesis and doctoral dissertation, namely, the upgrading of music education at all levels in private and public schools by way of seminars/workshops/programs addressing the training needs of classroom music teachers. Going beyond the classroom and believing in the broad development of the innate musicality of young Filipinos, she co-founded the Philippine Research for the Development of Instrumental Soloists (PREDIS) in 1985, and served as three-term president of the Piano Teachers&rsquo; Guild of the Philippines (PTGP) from 1984. Through the years, she actively participated in local and national projects of several private and government-related cultural agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In her mission of instilling the pursuit of excellence among the youth, Sr Mary Placid, dean of SSC School of Music since 1976, has reaped rewards through the prizes won by SSC students in the National Music Competitions for Young Artists; the rebirth of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> (MSO) through PREDIS; student participation in international camps and festivals; and the successful careers of her school&rsquo;s music graduates as performers or teachers here or abroad. She continues to share her expertise in the field of music education and liturgy through her linkages in the country and abroad. The renovation of St Cecilia&rsquo;s Hall in 2000 and the new five-floor building of the SSC School of Music is the result of her commitment to provide the best environment for nurturing musical talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among her numerous awards are the PAX 1998, the highest award given to SSC Alumnae; the Outstanding Music Centennial Award 2007, the highest centennial award of SSC; and the TOFIL (Ten Outstanding Filipinos) in 2008. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byMauricia D.

It was incorporated on 21 Jul 1977, with officials of the broadcast and print media, the recording companies, and stage and theatrical associations as members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Foundation aims to achieve its general objective by promoting and developing Filipino composers, arrangers, writers, performers, and artists; developing foreign markets for Filipino pop music; and encouraging studies and research on popular music through grants, scholarships, and financial or other forms of assistance to students, researchers, and scholars. Its major project was the holding of the Metro Manila PopularMusic Festival or Metropop, which sought to give recognition and provide incentives to local composers and develop among the public an awareness of and appreciation for popular Filipino music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Metropop was launched on 15 Aug 1977. Fourteen compositions were chosen from hundreds of entries. The Foundation would have the legal right to manage the songs, with generous terms offered to the composers. At the second festival held in 1978, changes were made in the rules such as limiting each composer to one entry and reducing the number of finalists from 14 to 12; the participation of music students in the screening committee; and the inclusion of foreign judges. In 1982, two distinct divisions&mdash;amateur and professional&mdash;were created and the musical categories were expanded to five: jazz, rock, folk, upbeat pop, and ballad. Indigenous music was also encouraged. Starting with this festival, the Foundation decided to honor musical artists who have excelled in their fields and made significant contributions to Filipino music. The first honoree was ConstanciodeGuzman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Metropop gave birth to songs like RyanCayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;KayGandangAtingMusika&rdquo; (How Beautiful is Our Music), HeberBartolome&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;yMgaPinoy&rdquo; (We are Filipinos), Freddie<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Child), GeorgeCanseco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ako ang Nagwagi, Ako ang Nasawi&rdquo; (I Won, I Lost), Charo Unite&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lupa&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>), LouieOcampo and RowenaArrieta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ewan&rdquo; (I Don&rsquo;t Know), Gines Tan&rsquo;s &ldquo;MagsimulaKa&rdquo; (Make a Start), VehneeSaturno&rsquo;s &ldquo;Isang Dakot&rdquo; (A Handful), Rene <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\"><strong>Novel</strong></a>les&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Smile in Your Heart,&rdquo; and GaryGranada&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>at Musika&rdquo; (Thank You Music).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 1982, the Foundation was chaired by Imee Marcos. It was supposed to hold its ninth pop music festival in Mar 1986, but the EDSA uprising in Feb of that year overthrew the Marcos regime which led to the sudden dissolution of the Metropop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vacuum arising from such dissolution led to two later developments in the field of Philippine popular music. From 1996-2003, GMA Network organized the Metropop Song Festivals, which were aired in its station, and the creation of Philpop Music Fest Foundation, chaired by Manny V. Pangilinan, which has revived the songwriting contest, now named Philippine Popular Music Festival, beginning 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRosalinda Galang</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Only few would know of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4133\"><strong>Presidential Security Command Band</strong></a> because the band only graces the exclusive social halls of Malaca&ntilde;an Palace on important occasions. Founded during the incumbency of Pres Manuel Roxas, the PSC Band was organized to provide music during guard mounting, reviews, and parades in connection with decoration ceremonies, escorts of honor for foreign dignitaries, important social occasions, and other state functions. The task of organizing the Presidential Security Command Band fell on the hands of Col Jose Tando who then asked the help of Col <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, the commanding officer of the First Armed Forces Band (PC Band). The nucleus of the band came from musicians of Samar and Leyte but because of numerous requests from the military as well as the civilian sectors, musicians from neighboring towns of Rizal, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>, and Laguna were enlisted. In 1954, 2nd Lt Ambrosio S. Ordona took over as the second officer-in-charge of the band which then had a total strength of 28 musicians. It was during the incumbency of Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong></a> that the first <i>combo </i>unit was organized. Named &ldquo;Linda,&rdquo; after the only daughter of the President, the combo proved the versatility of the band as it could easily convert itself into an orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Maj Ordona retired in 1963, then 1st Lt Luis Palad took over. He worked for the increase of membership from 32 to at least 50. A musician of discriminating taste, Lt Col Luis Palad believed that the first requirement of the band was a good volume. With the support of the then commanding general, Maj Gen Fabian Ver, the band acquired new musical instruments and sets of gala uniforms. Being a musical enthusiast himself, Gen Ver enlarged this band and elevated it to the level of Major Command bands like the GHQ, PA, PAF, and PN, which has <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> members each. Today, despite the scarcity of players, it is still able to maintain itself as it diligently searches for qualified young players to replace retirees. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRodney D.

He was noticed by Vicor executives in 1975 when the Temptations, impressed by his singing at the Pallazi, joined him in an impromptu number. A few months after, his first single under the Sunshine Label, &ldquo;Love Won&rsquo;t Let Me Wait,&rdquo; was released. In this recording, he introduced something new in Philippine music&mdash;substituting Tagalog lyrics for parts of the foreign hits. It caught on and became his trademark. His topselling first three albums, <b><i>The Way We Were</i></b>, <b><i>RicoJ.Puno</i></b>, and <b><i>Spirit of Christmas</i></b>, a series of singles which included &ldquo;Kapalaran&rdquo; (Fate), and his first solo performance at the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines, <b><i>Rico in Concert</i></b>, with the ManilaSymphonyOrchestra, established him as the leading pop singer in the Philippines. His performances in the Philippines in such venues as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a> and his first American tour in 1978 drew the largest audiences ever assembled by a Filipino artist during that period.

San Jose, Batangas 8 Dec 1926. d. Quezon City 6 Dec 1985. Singer. She was born to Eusebio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Rosal, and married lawyer-impresario Luis Pimentel. She started singing at the age of six as a church soloist in the San Jose Church in Batangas. She also loved to sing while her mother sold fish at the market, delighting listeners with her Filipino songs, notably &ldquo;AngMaya&rdquo; (The Sparrow). Later she studied voice at the University of Santo Tomas Conservatory of Music where she became a favorite student of noted professor Lourdes Corrales de Razon and a classmate of SylviaLaTorre. Rosal further honed her craft on her own by studying and imitating other singers. In the late 1960s, she took advanced studies in the United States under Dean Verchines, coach to leading artists of the Metropolitan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> and the New York City Opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rosal&rsquo;s first performance on stage was in <b><i>DalagangBukid </i></b>(Country Maiden), 1950, at the Far Eastern University (FEU) Auditorium. She began her rise to prominence when she won the <b><i>Elizalde Family Hour </i></b>talent search in 1952. She learned acting skills while playing Sally in Herbert and TrudlDubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s production of <b><i>Die Fledermaus</i></b>. She was singing in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4070\"><strong>Manila Symphony Society</strong></a> Chorus when the Zippers cast her as Carmen in the Tagalog version of Bizet&rsquo;s opera. First presented in 1956 at the FEU Auditorium, the Tagalog <b><i>Carmen</i></b>, set in 19th-century Binondo, was a huge success and brought Rosal her first taste of fame in the opera world. Later on, her memorable performances in the Philippine production of <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, 1967, and <b><i>Aida</i></b>, 1971, established her as one of the country&rsquo;s top opera singers. She also starred in <b><i>La Gioconda </i></b>and sang the lead role in the <i>sarsuwela, <b>AngKiri </b></i>(The Flirt).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rosal&rsquo;s spinto voice enabled her to sing both dramatic and lyric roles and to execute an operatic repertoire ranging from very light <b>sarsuwela</b> to <b><i>Carmen</i></b> for mezzo-soprano. She was also famous for her beautiful rendition of <b>kundiman</b><i> </i>of which she made several recordings. Together with SylviaLaTorre, she popularized the light classics in mini-concerts at the PhilamlifeAuditorium. She was well known over the radio and later on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During a musical career spanning more than three decades, Rosal was hailed as one of the Philippines&rsquo; great sopranos. Her last operatic performance was in <b><i>Aida </i></b>in 1981. She made her last public appearance in the country in a concert with Sylvia La Torre entitled <b><i>May Rosal at Torre </i></b>in 1982. Then she went on a concert tour of the United States in 1983 to raise funds for the Dipolog Church. At this time she was already battling cancer, which led to her death in 1985. Just before she died, she was engaged in a project to record various renditions of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\"><strong>Ave Maria</strong></a>&rdquo; of which she was able to record only five.

Francisco belonged to one of the richest creole families since the late 18th century Spanish Philippines, the Roxases, who owned a vast network of businesses like the Ayalas and the Zobels. His parents were Juan Roxas and Vicenta Arias. He was the grandson of Antonio, the brother of Domingo Roxas (1782-1843) who played a crucial role in exploiting early 19th century Philippine economy. Francisco was married to Maria Elio with whom he had six children. He was engaged in business as a shipping agent and ship supplies dealer. As member of the Camara de Comercio de Manila, honorary councilor for civil administration, and member of the governing board of Banco Espa&ntilde;ol Filipino, he was an influential figure in the city. In 1896, he was arrested for alleged involvement in the revolution&mdash;a move fabricated by Andres Bonifaco after failing to get Francisco&rsquo;s financial support. All his properties were confiscated by the government, and he was shot together with other martyrs on Bagumbayan field the following year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from his business, Roxas was involved in the performing arts.

He was a well-known violinist during his time and studied music with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a>, based on the account of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\"><strong>Felix Roxas</strong></a>, a cousin, who witnessed that Francisco was having music lessons with Estella in Francisco&rsquo;s house on the night of his arrest in Aug 1896. Some of Francisco&rsquo;s compositions are remembered.

Lubuagan, Kalinga 4 Aug 1942. Kalinga musician, dancer, and performance artist. Saclag is also a cultural worker who advocates for the continuity of Kalinga culture in modern contexts. As expected of someone who grew up in a village in which culture was learned face-to-face among kindreds, Alonzo Saclag was exposed to Lubuagan music traditions that are deeply shared collectively and that have indissoluble link to calendrical and life cycle rituals. He learned his particular Kalinga culture by imitation, mastering instrumental music and dance, the latter of which is an essential ingredient in village ceremonies being a profound expression of sociability in a closely-knit community.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a passionate advocate of his own cultural heritage, Saclag had extolled members of his community to preserve their traditional material culture, archaeological sites, and even re-invented a new form of <i>bodong</i> (peace pact) in which customary retribution or justice is not applied at the tribal group level but is individually addressed. Clearly a modern subject with an individual consciousness, Saclag&rsquo;s aspiration to move his culture beyond static tradition is manifest is his advocacies. He convinced the provincial government of Kalinga to convert and finance the transformation of an abandoned Capitol Building into a museum of heritage, which is now a branch of the National Museum. Moreover, in 2009, he founded a School of Living Tradition that was partly supported by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He also tirelessly campaigned in schools to press the issue on maintaining a strong ethnic identity despite the modern origin of the institution of formal schooling, so much so that he introduced the practice of children wearing the Kalinga costume during important events like graduation ceremonies and even during the Catholic rite of first communion. Another innovation that was consistently a part of his effort to bolster indigenous expressions has been mission of intensifying the singing of folk songs in Kalinga classrooms and, remarkably, putting up skits and other artistic performances that mix old and new elements in a number of schools. In addition, he aspired for the broadcast of traditional Kalinga music alongside contemporary music in the local radio station.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To concretize his effort in moving his culture in a sustainable manner in modern contexts, he founded the Kalinga Budong Dance Troupe where he teaches the youth their local music and dance. Since this dance company now tours in cities beyond the village, i.e., it now circulates beyond its traditional place of origin, it is envitable that artistic hybridity has resulted in Saclag&rsquo;s projects.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For his artistry, cultural advocacy, and influence, Saclag was conferred the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan in 2000.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Java, Indonesia 17 Jul 1950. Singer. Her father is Pete Alfonso, owner of the popular restaurant called Caf&eacute; Indonesia located on Roxas Boulevard during the 1950s. Her mother is Ana Ledesma-Quitco from Negros Occidental. She studied in St Theresa&rsquo;s College in San Marcelino, Manila. She dropped out during her first year in high school and later went to various vocational schools. She was one of the models for the Bagong Anyo group of First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos that promoted Philippine couture in other countries in the early years of martial law.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although she played the guitar and could carry a tune, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> had no aspirations of becoming a singer. It was her then husband music promoter Nilo Santos who convinced her to try her luck as a rock artist. This was in the mid-1970s when Pinoy rock was growing in popularity. While there was no shortage of male rock artists, there were no females in the genre and Vicor Music Corporation was in search of one. She was packaged to fill the void. She was given the name Sampaguita after the fragrant national flower, dressed in fabulous, psychedelic costumes, and asked to record the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/873\"><strong>Bonggahan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Razzle-Dazzle), composed by Gary Perez.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Released in 1977, the carefree &ldquo;Bonggahan&rdquo; invited fun times in the then popular gay lingo that mixed English and Filipino. Though initially reluctant to be a singer, Sampaguita proved to be a natural with the song and scored a big hit with her first single. She came to be known as the Queen of Pinoy Rock and went on to headline concerts, <b><i>New Moon</i></b>, musicals, and the Pinoy rock opera <b><i>Mahal </i></b>(Beloved) and to record more songs that have since become classics like &ldquo;Tao&rdquo; (Man), &ldquo;Nosi Ba Lasi?&rdquo; (reverse of Filipino &ldquo;Sino Ba Sila?&rdquo; or Who are They?), &ldquo;Laguna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sa Diyos Lamang&rdquo; (Only in God), and &ldquo;Sayawan&rdquo; (Dancing).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sampaguita is now acknowledged as a true Filipino music icon. She is now retired but would once in a while take to the stage to perform her famous songs. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byCarmencita Gil</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Angono, Rizal 11 Feb 1913 d. Quezon City 31 Mar 2002. National Artist for music. Composer, conductor, film scorer, educator. He was the son of Elpidio San Pedro and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Diestro. San Pedro was married to Gertrudez Diaz with whom he had five children. He became seriously involved in music when his father put up a family band, which later on served as his laboratory for conducting and composition. He had already written songs and learned to play well the bandurria and banjo before he enrolled at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music in 1932. He earned his teacher&rsquo;s diploma in composition and conducting in 1937, and took further studies at the Juilliard School of Music in 1947. Upon his return, he taught at the St Scholastica&rsquo;s College, La Concordia College, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, Santa Isabel College, St Paul College, St Joseph&rsquo;s College, Ateneo de Manila University, Centro Escolar University, and the UP College of Music, where he was a full professor until his retirement in 1978, and served at one time as chair of the Theory and Composition Department.

Highly evocative of the folk, his works strove to reflect the Filipino soul, in line with his musical philosophy of &ldquo;creative nationalism.&rdquo; He has written hymns, masses, choral works, songs for solo voices, chamber music, incidental music, even background music for movies. Among his famous orchestral works are: <b><i>Violin <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> in D minor</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>1948; the symphonic poems, <b><i>Ang Buwan sa Kabundukan</i></b> (Moon Over the Hills), 1952, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a></i></b> (Brown Race), 1961, which earned for him the 1962 Republic Cultural Heritage Award; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1009\"><strong>Suite Pastorale</strong></a>,</i></b> 1956; and <b><i>Visayan Fantasy</i></b> and <b><i>Ilocano Fantasy</i></b>, 1984.

He had his elementary education at Colegio de San Juan de Letran and finished high school at the Liceo de Manila. When he was seven, he took piano lessons from a private tutor. Three years later, Santiago studied pianoforte under Blas Echegoyen, and later, under Faustino Villacorta and Primo Calzada. Coming from a poor family, he had to support himself through school. When the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music was founded in 1916, he was taken in as a piano instructor. He studied advanced harmony and counterpoint under Robert Schofield.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1917, Santiago wrote the first artsong-<b>kundiman</b>, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>, Cancion Filipina&rdquo; (Kundiman, Filipino Song) or &ldquo;Kundiman,<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a>-Dalita&rdquo; (Kundiman, Child of Woe).

Obando, Bulacan 16 Jun 1950. Composer, poet, singer. He is the son of Frisco Santiago, a barber and band musician, and Maria Manuel. Santiago is married to poet Lilia Quindoza with whom he has four children. He studied at the Obando Elementary School and the G.G. Sancianco High School, then enrolled at the Philippine School of Business Administration. He supported himself through high school and college by doing odd jobs, until he learned how to make a living by singing in pubs and folkhouses. The political, economic, and cultural developments of the 1970s largely influenced Santiago&rsquo;s music and poetry. His songs touch on the lives of common folk under a repressive order and serve as the social conscience of the times. Among these are &ldquo;Halina&rdquo; (Come), &ldquo;Meme na, Aking <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1134\"><strong>Bunso</strong></a>&rdquo; (Sleep, My Little <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>), &ldquo;Huling Balita&rdquo; (The Latest News), &ldquo;Butil ng Palay&rdquo; (Rice Grains), &ldquo;Hayaan Mangusap ang Aking Gitara&rdquo; (Let My Guitar Speak), and &ldquo;Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> ng Dalita&rdquo; (Children of Poverty).

Pasig, Rizal 25 Feb 1941. National Artist for music. Composer, conductor, musicologist, educator. He is the youngest of six children of lawyer Jose Santos and pianist-singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><strong>Amada</strong></a> Pagayon. He married Lourdes Wong with whom he has two daughters, Monica Fa and Waya. He finished grade school at Pasig Catholic School, high school at the San Jose Seminary, and bachelor of music, major in composition and conducting, at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1965. He also obtained masteral (with distinction) and doctoral degrees in music composition at the Indiana University, 1969, and the State University of New York at Buffalo, 1972, respectively. In 1989, Santos was a visiting scholar in ethnomusicology at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a student at the UP, Santos was attracted to the music of Gustav Mahler and Claude Debussy. Composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> introduced him to Asian traditional and avant-garde music. While in Indiana, his first works had a neoclassic strain, as in <b><i>Children&rsquo;s Suite </i></b>and <b><i>Pied Beauty</i></b>, 1968, and <b><i>Concertino Variations for orchestra</i></b>, 1969. After he was introduced to avant-garde techniques, he wrote a cantata on the lamentations in the Lenten liturgy titled <b><i>Improperia </i></b>for soloist, chorus, orchestra, and <b>kulintang</b>. In New York, he became acquainted with electronic and computer music procedures, as well as indeterminacy and controlled improvisation. He was further exposed to New Music as a fellow at the summer courses in New Music in Darmstadt, followed by a visit at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht in 1974. <br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Santos returned to the Philippines, the reality of life in an Asian society changed his direction. He immersed himself in indigenous Philippine and Asian music, studying Chinese <b>nanguan</b> and Javanese gamelan music and dance. His works assumed open-ended structures of time and space, while exploring the colors provided by local sound sources. At this time, he composed &ldquo;Nabasag ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>Banga</strong></a> at Iba&rsquo;t Ibang Pinag-ugpong-ugpong na Pananalita sa Wikang Pilipino para sa Labing-anim na Tinig&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b>(The Broken Jar and Variously Connected Phrases in the Filipino Language for Sixteen Voices), 1972, where he explored the musical value of everyday sounds. In the early 1980s, he continued to focus on elements in Philippine culture while using Western sound media, as in <b><i>Penomenon </i></b>(Phenomenon), 1979, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1017\"><strong>Tin-ig</strong></a> </i></b>(Voices), 1983, and <b><i>Du&rsquo;A</i></b>, 1986, for orchestra; and a series of pieces for solo instruments titled <b><i>Abot</i></b><i>-<b>Tanaw </b></i>(Horizons), 1981-84. He also produced massive environmental works such as <b><i>Ritwal ng Pasasalamat </i></b>(Thanksgiving <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong></a>), 1976, a modern ritual music for practically all the representative instruments at the UP College of Music; and <b><i>Likas</i></b><i>-<b>An</b></i> (Nature-ing), 1978, which included noncontrollable instruments that he invented, as well as carpenters and electricians.

It was organized in 1985 by the brothers Rodel, vocals, and Naldy Gonzalez, keyboards, who were joined by Joey Benin, bass guitar, Kelly Badon, lead guitarist, Pido Lalimarmo, guitar, and Mar Dizon, drummer. Starting out in hotel lounges in the late 1980s, the band broke into the local mainstream with the release of their self-titled album in 1989, particularly with their songs &ldquo;Eva Marie,&rdquo; written by Benin, and &ldquo;Di Pa Huli&rdquo; (Not Yet Late), written by Rodel Gonzalez. In 1990, singer Joey Generoso and drummer Ernie Severino joined the group. The group went on to produce their most successful recordings: the <b><i>White Album</i></b> and <b><i>Blue Album</i></b> in 1991 and 1992, respectively; <b><i>Hold On</i></b> in 1994; the more popular <b><i>By Your Side</i></b> album in 1995; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a> 12</i></b> in 1997. Side A&rsquo;s discography also includes a string of anthologies and live recording albums in the early 2000s. The group&rsquo;s current members include Gonzalez, Generoso, and Severino, along with Ned Esguerra on bass guitar and Leevon Cailao on lead guitar.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Side A is perhaps best known for their song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/891\"><strong>Forevermore</strong></a>&rdquo; written by Benin, which won numerous awards including the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards&rsquo; Song of the Year in 1996. Side A also received the following recognition from Awit Awards: Best Performance by a Group for &ldquo;So Many Questions,&rdquo; 1994, &ldquo;By Your Side,&rdquo; 1995, and &ldquo;Forevermore,&rdquo; 1996; Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\"><strong>Ballad</strong></a> Recording for &ldquo;So Many Questions,&rdquo; 1994; Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Recording (With Vocals) for &ldquo;True Love Can Always Wait,&rdquo; 1995; and Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The group&rsquo;s overall sound can be characterized as &ldquo;soft rock,&rdquo; their romantic ballads often laced with clean vocal harmonizations constantly achieved by having band members that are equally comfortable with their vocal chops as well as with their respective instruments. Alongside record-breaking album sales and considerable radio airplay, Side A is also known for their solid live performances, playing to sold out concerts in local club venues and performing stages, and in Filipino communities abroad. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byIsidora Miranda</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Sampaloc, Manila 6 Nov 1826 d. 27 Dec 1910. Musician, bandmaster. His father was the owner of several banca and barges used to ferry passengers and cargo across the Pasig River from Nagtahan. Among his eight children with Antonia Enriquez were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Sr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4173\"><strong>Rosalio Silos</strong></a> who became musicians themselves. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his sons, Jose Enriquez Silos, was the father of Salud Silos who was one of the original SSS Trio. Juan Silos Jr is his grandson. As a boy, he was taught by a friend how to play the guitar. By himself, he mastered books on the guitar and on harmony and studied the intricacies of orchestration.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At 16, he was already acquainted with all sorts of musical instruments. He organized and directed an orchestra in Sampaloc. At about 20, he was appointed director of the band of the Spanish Army&rsquo;s Regiment No 5, a position he held for about 40 years until his retirement in 1887. His band followed the regiment wherever it was stationed: from Manila, they went to Jolo in 1870, then to Cebu, back to Manila, once more to Jolo, then to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>, and lastly, to Cotabato. From there he returned to Manila, and after directing the Pasig Band for a while, he gave lessons on the guitar, the bandurria, and then the mandolin and <b>laud</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His musical compositions were not published. A hymn dedicated to Alfonso XII of Spain, composed in honor of his birth, received a golden baton from the Spanish royal family. His &ldquo;Plegaria&rdquo; (Prayer) received a diploma during the tercentenary celebration of Santa Teresa de Jesus in 1882. Silos also wrote a minuet, several paso dobles, and funeral marches.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byEspiridion Arsenio Manuelupdated by Leonardo R.

B. Manila 6 Mar 1925. d. 10 Mar 2015. Composer, arranger, pianist, music director. He is the son of Juan Lorenzo Silos Jr and Marcela Acasio Rigo. Without formal training, he learned music by exposure and imitation in his natal family, which nurtured music making intensely. His father <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Jr was a famous musician and son of Juan Silos Sr, who was, in turn, the son of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4171\"><strong>Leonardo Silos</strong></a>. Both Leonardo and Juan Sr held the position of <b>musico mayor</b> (music director) of Spanish Regimental Bands in the 19th century. Leopoldo&rsquo;s uncles, Rosalio and Jose, as well as his sisters (the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4174\"><strong>Silos Sisters</strong></a>) Dolores, Remedios, Lourdes, and cousin Betty were all professional musicians. At a young age and on a daily basis, he was exposed to his father&rsquo;s guitar music and, later on, frequently attended music rehearsals of rondalla and listened to the singing of his sisters at home. According to his mother, Leopoldo woud play his father&rsquo;s compositions and other popular songs on the piano at age four by ear (<i>oido</i>).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From his recollection, Leopoldo composed a short song at age eight, which his father arranged for rondalla. At age 14, he was already arranging music for local bands. This continued to the time of the Japanese occupation when Leopoldo arranged scores for local orchestras. Later on, he arranged for popular orchestras directed by musicians Serafin Payawal, Tirso Cruz, Cesar Velasco, and Tino Gatchalian, who played in Leopoldo&rsquo;s wedding in 1944. Leopoldo was active in directing six live radio programs. For Bataan Recording <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, he arranged folksongs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/930\"><strong>Lulay</strong></a>&rdquo; (Swaying), as well as original instrumental compositions such as &ldquo;Ay, ay, ay,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cascarita,&rdquo; &ldquo;Todo Pong,&rdquo; and Tumba Levanta&rdquo; (Grave&rsquo;s Opening).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The maturity of his career came with the musical directorship of Villar Recording Company from 1950 to 1973. His first single with Villar was the original composition &ldquo;Manila Bay Rhumba,&rdquo; which outsold all other Philippine records at the time of its release. For Villar Company, he arranged and conducted orchestras, accompanying famous singers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a>, Sylvia La Torre, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3902\"><strong>Cely Bautista</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a>. The first single of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, titled &ldquo;A Million Thanks,&rdquo; which later became the title of her TV show, was Leopoldo&rsquo;s arrangement that he recorded himself.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Leopoldo&rsquo;s main contribution to Philippine music was not only in the realm of arranging, but in film music scoring and directing as well. Before his time, it was common for scorers to utilize canned music as accompaniment to visuals. Leopoldo was among the first Filipino arrangers who composed original music for movies. He was also musical director of several movies, the most notable of which was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/883\"><strong>Dahil sa Isang Bulaklak</strong></a></i></b> (Because of a Flower). Silos composed and arranged the theme song of this movie. In the 1970s, he was the music director for the TV show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1400\"><strong>Aawitan Kita</strong></a> </i></b>(I Will Sing For You)<i>,</i> featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>. He also wrote commercial jingles, the most famous being &ldquo;Zoom Zoom Power&rdquo; for Super Shell. In 1973, at age 48, he went on tour with the Mabuhay Singers and stayed abroad thereafter, disappearing from the local music scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leopoldo has won many awards, including the American Television and Radio Commercial Festival&rsquo;s CLIO Awards in New York, 1970, which hailed him as the first Southeast Asian winner of the award. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his albums also merited the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards and his show <b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b> won for him the Citizens Award for Television (CAT) in the 1970s. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLeonardo R.

Manila 29 Mar 1919), daughters of rondalla exponent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Jr. The group first known as the Silos Trio was founded by Juan Silos Jr, who trained and introduced them to the public in the KZRM&rsquo;s radio program Manila Radiolites in 1934-35.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir debut song was &ldquo;Carmen, Carmela&rdquo; and they appeared in the radio program <b><i>Moonlight Troubadors</i></b> in the 1930s.

Betty later married musician <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4339\"><strong>Joe Climaco</strong></a> and the two eventually became the grandparents of music director Sammy Climaco who was active during the 1980s. During the Japanese Occupation in the early 1940s, the Silos Quartet performed in Avenue Theater in dramas directed by Lamberto Avellana.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the liberation of Manila in Feb 1945, the quartet went from camp to camp with the Cesar Velasco Orchestra performing for the American soldiers.

Manila 8 Oct 1898. d. Mar 1971. Active ca 1910-46. Pianist, composer, conductor. Solis was born to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4177\"><strong>Simplicio Solis</strong></a>, a notable Filipino composer in late 19th century, and Eustaquia Roxas of Bulacan, a <b>sarsuwelista</b> or <b>sarsuwela</b><i> </i>performer. At three, he showed an aptitude for music, and a year later, upon his father&rsquo;s death in 1903, was sent to the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples of the ManilaCathedral. At nine, he left music school and became company director of the Compa&ntilde;ia de Zarzuela Infantil. He conducted operettas such as <b><i>La <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/71\"><strong>Mascota</strong></a> </i></b>(The Mascot), <b><i>La Viuda Alegre </i></b>(The Merry Widow), <b><i>El Conde de Luxemburgo </i></b>(The Count of Luxembourg), and <b><i>El Sue&ntilde;o de un Bals </i></b>(Waltz Dream).<b><i> </i></b><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe traveled to Siam (now Thailand) where he played exclusively for the King under the sponsorship of the Siamese Boy Scouts, and to Hong Kong where he became a bandleader at the Hong Kong Hotel. He proceeded to San Francisco, California, USA in 1921 where he played the <b><i>Grieg <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> </i></b>with the Liechtenstein Symphony Orchestra and eventually became musical director of the Vasquez Spanish Operetta <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. In 1929, he recorded and arranged a number of songs for Victory Company. He later lived in New York. In Broadway, he arranged the music for <b><i>Belmont Varieties</i></b> and <b><i>Manhattan Varities</i></b>, both in 1932.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Solis wrote numerous works including <b><i>Philippine Sketches</i></b>, for orchestra; &ldquo;Hymn to Rizal,&rdquo; for soprano; <b><i>The Pearls of Mindanao</i></b>, an operetta; <b><i>El abanico de Abril </i></b>(The Fan of April), sketches of life in Spain; <b><i>In the Desert</i></b>, a short Jewish cantata; and <b><i>Eight Negro Spirituals</i></b>, for solo voices and chorus. He also worked as a part-time censor for the US Army during World War II and as interpreter for the US Immigration and Naturalization Service and the US Court at Manhattan for Spanish and Tagalog speakers. In 1950, he published a 56-page collection titled <b><i>Selected Songs of the Philippines</i></b><i>. </i> <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3014\"><strong>Ramon Jocson</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Paombong, Bulacan 2 Mar 1864. d. 8 Oct 1903. Violinist, pianist, composer, conductor, music teacher. He was born to Juan Solis and Maria Gonzales, both of whom came from poor families. He married, upon the encouragement of the Jesuits, Eustaquia Roxas, with whom he had 11 children; only three of whom survived. Simplicio is the father of musician Bernardo Solis who was active in theater in the early 20th century. Simplicio died of cholera in 1903.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Solis learned to make and play a bamboo flute at an early age. Like many children of Paombong from the 1860s to 1870s, he was brought by Manuel Tanghal, himself an alumnus of the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, to the <i>colegio</i>, where Simplicio studied solfeggio under Apolinar Calahorra, harmony and organ under Luis Vicente Arche, violin and cello under Ramon Valdez, and piano under Blas Echogoyen. As a diligent student, he rose to the rank of first violin in the Cathedral&rsquo;s orchestra and earned the praises of Fr Joaquin Calpe, then the director of singing and vocalization in the Colegio. In 1879, he left the Cathedral and taught solfeggio<b> </b>and piano at Ateneo de Manila.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as claimed that Solis was one of the greatest Filipino musicians in late 19th century. Solis&rsquo;s achievements in the field of instrumental music performance, composition, and conducting were indeed widely known during his time. In 1882, he played one of first violins in a quintet for Liceo Artistico Literario in an event attended by the Marquis de Estella. In 1886, Solis played the violin part of Mozart&rsquo;s quartet in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3296\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Filipino</strong></a> and in Colegio de Santa Isabel for the farewell concerts of the visiting violin vituoso Eduard Remenyi. Then in Nov 1889, he played in the first violin section of the orchestra that rendered Gounod&rsquo;s <b><i>Mass</i></b> in Quiapo church in honor of Santa Cecilia, who was the patron saint of the famous musicians&rsquo; guild at that time, Sociedad <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Filipina de Santa Cecilia. Before the criollo violinist Manuel Garrido left for Spain, Solis played Rossini&rsquo;s <b><i>La Caridad</i></b> with Garrido and pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3993\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong></a>. His virtuosity on the violin was also showcased in his rendition of Alard&rsquo;s fantasia <b><i>Los Puritanos</i></b> and in Singerlee&rsquo;s fantasia arrangement of Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>Aida</i></b>. Aside from the violin, Solis was also a highly skilled pianist for he accompanied Filipino violin virtuoso Andres Dancel interpreting Beriot&rsquo;s <b><i>12th <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a></i></b>.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Solis also excelled in conducting as demonstrated by his well remembered performance, again honoring Santa Cecilia, of Pacini&rsquo;s <b><i>Mass</i></b> in Quiapo church on Nov 1900. This was under the auspices of another music academy, El Porvenir. In that performance he led prominent musicians of his time: the solo parts were sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4198\"><strong>Fulgencio Tolentino</strong></a>, Atanacio Adonay (the brother of Marcelo), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a>, and the piano was played by Hipolito Rivera and the organ by Gavino Carluen.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of composition, Solis wrote an orchestra piece <b><i>Grateful Indio</i></b> in 1884, a composition that seems likely a self-referential piece about his experience as a native who had climbed the social ladder for he had acquired cultural capital through his musical achievements in Intramuros. He won the 1886 contest organized by the house editor of the music store and publisher of La Lira, Saco del Valle. The winning piece was a triumphant march that earned him a gilded fine baton and writing pen. While in residence in Intramuros and while he was a music teacher at Ateneo Municipal, Solis composed a <b>sinfonia</b> nicknamed &ldquo;Limahong&rdquo; after melodies that he heard from his Chinese neighbors. Because there is no extant score of this work, it is not certain if this might be an overture of a theater piece or if it is a purely instrumental work. If it is the latter, then the piece would seem like an early symphonic work done by a Filipino and is even more significant because that would have been a self-consciously hybrid work that appropriated Asian musical element. He also composed a work for piano and orchestra titled <b><i>Porta</i></b><i>-<b>Vaga</b></i>, an early example of a Filipino concerto.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nonetheless, most of Solis&rsquo;s compositions are for the church and these are &ldquo;Choir of Angels&rdquo; for piano and orchestra, 1888; a hymn dedicated to Pope Leo XIII, 1903; another hymn titled &ldquo;Vincimus&rdquo; (We Conquer) performed at San Juan de Letran in 1892; a prayer song titled &ldquo;Los Cruzados&rdquo; (Crusaders); a farewell piano piece for the Virgin Mary, &ldquo;Plegaria ala Virgen&rdquo; (Prayer to the Virgin) which was dedicated to his former mentor Fr Calpe; a motet titled &ldquo;Oh, Virgen&rdquo; for three voices and organ; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\"><strong>Ave Maria</strong></a>&rdquo; for two voices and organ; and three motets, &ldquo;O Salutaris&rdquo; for solo voice, &ldquo;Ave Verum&rdquo; for three voices, and &ldquo;Tantum Ergo&rdquo; for three voices.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His secular compositions included a hymn set to the music of Rizal&rsquo;s <b><i>Ultimo Adios </i></b>(Last Farewell), which was performed in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3303\"><strong>Teatro Zorrilla</strong></a> in 1901; an elegy set to a Rizal poem; and a romance titled &ldquo;A Mi Hermana&rdquo; (To My Sister) with words by Jose Maria Tatay.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For music theater, Solis composed the music for <b><i>Proteccion Angelica </i></b>(Angelic Protection), a one-act melodrama staged in San Juan de Letran on Mar 1893; <b><i>Los Cruzados</i></b> (Crusaders), a two-act melodrama with words by Joaquin Pellicena; <b><i>Renegado y Martir </i></b>(Renegade and Martyr), a drama; <b><i>El Martes de Carnaval </i></b>(Tuesday Carnival), one-act comic play which was performed in Oct 1892; <b><i>Rizal y los Dioses </i></b>(Rizal and the Gods), an opera set to the libretto by Aurelio Tolentino; <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a> of Love</i></b>, Tagalog drama with words by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4633\"><strong>Ramon Reyes</strong></a>; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/899\"><strong>Hatinggabi</strong></a></i></b> (Midnight), a <b>sarsuwela Tagala</b>. Simplicio also helped his friend Hipolito Rivera write the music for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3060\"><strong>Pantaleon Lopez</strong></a>&rsquo;s sarsuwela <b><i>Ang Infierno</i></b> (Hell).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">None of Solis&rsquo;s music manuscripts have survived time, but his biographer Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as, writing in the early 1920s, claimed that these were kept in Ateneo Municipal library where Solis taught. Solis is remembered to have taught music to Norberto Romualdez who became the chief justice of the Supreme Court in the early 20th century and who wrote an authoritative organology of Philippine music instruments and classification of vocal music. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Cebu City 13 Apr 1866. d. 1939. Composer. He married Desideria Salazar with whom he had five children. Solon studied at the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos, but was not able to finish a degree. He had no formal training in music, but when he was barely 14 years old, he started to compose. Before learning to read musical notes, he had already composed numerous songs on his guitar.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first decades of the century, Solon was a well-known performer in <b>balitaw</b><i> </i>and poetic jousts in Cebu. He composed songs for the <b>sarsuwela</b> of FlorentinoBorromeo and other writers. He is said to have written a thousand songs, including religious hymns and serenades. His best-known work, &ldquo;Garbosong Bukid&rdquo; (Proud Mountain), was written in Badian, Cebu in 1907 while Solon and his family were in jail on trumped-up charges by a local bigwig. His other songs include &ldquo;Dingding&rdquo; (Wall), &ldquo;Mga Bulak nga Sugboanon&rdquo; (Flowers of Cebu), &ldquo;Manulonda&rdquo; (Muse), &ldquo;Hamis nga Aping&rdquo; (Smooth Cheek), &ldquo;Mahay sa Tigulang&rdquo; (Lament of the Aged), and &ldquo;Pagkamaluibon&rdquo; (Treachery).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An American teacher brought &ldquo;Garbosong Bukid&rdquo; and nine other songs by Solon to the United States, where they became popular in nightclubs and hotels in big cities like Seattle. In 1928 representatives of Odeon Recording Co visited Cebu and got a contract to record many of Solon&rsquo;s songs.

The group is composed of Jay Durias, composer, musical arranger, film scorer, musical director, and record producer; Joseph Marco Concepcion, drummer; Manuel Tabunar, bass guitarist; Kell Gatdula, vocalist; Prince Edward Picache, saxophonist and band conductor; and Janno Queyquep, lead guitarist.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Originally from down south Davao, from which their name is taken, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4180\"><strong>South Border</strong></a> first gained prominence in 1996 with the release of their self-titled album. Included here is their very first hit, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/910\"><strong>Kahit Kailan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Whenever), which was recognized as Best Produced Record of the Year by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards in 1996. The band, though having gone through changes in lineup especially of vocalists, has produced some of the most popular Original Pilipino Music (OPM) such as &ldquo;Sa &rsquo;Yo&rdquo; (For You), 1999; &ldquo;Habang Atin Ang Gabi&rdquo; (While the Night is Ours), a movie theme song, 2002; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/985\"><strong>Rainbow</strong></a>,&rdquo; 2003, which is the most downloaded ringback and ringtone in Philippine history; and &ldquo;Ikaw Nga&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Absolutely You), for the TV series <b><i>Mulawin</i></b>, 2003.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe band&rsquo;s keyboardist and current lead singer Jay Durias composes and arranges most of the songs under Sony Music. Not long after receiving triple platinum awards for their debut album in 1997, lead vocalist Brix Ferraris was replaced by Luke Mijares. Nevertheless, the band soon produced their second album, <b><i>Bump!</i></b><i>,</i> which bagged 16 recognitions from Katha Awards in 1999. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of its songs, &ldquo;Sa &rsquo;Yo,&rdquo; received the award for Record of the Year, Best Pop Song, and Best R&amp;B Song. In this same year, they also released <b><i>The South Border Live Album</i></b>, recorded during their major concert at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a> on 30 Jan 1999.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few years later in 2002, they once again garnered the award for Best Pop Song from Katha Awards for the song &ldquo;Habang Atin Ang Gabi.&rdquo; This song became the carrier single of their fourth album titled, <b><i>The Way We Do</i></b>, 2001, released under Sony Music. In 2001, they performed their biggest major concert at the 35,000-seater Philippine Sports Commission&rsquo;s Track and Field Oval. They are the first ever Filipino band to fill up the venue. Another album, <b><i>Retrospective</i></b><i>,</i> was released the following year in 2002. But by the end of this year, Luke Mijares resigned as South Border&rsquo;s vocalist to go on a solo career. He was then replaced by two singers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVince Alaras was a member of La Salle Greenhills&rsquo; Kundirana and Duncan Ramos used to perform as a singer and dancer for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>&rsquo;s shows and tours. The duo performed in the new album, <b><i>Episode III</i></b>, 2004, which was the first release of their independent label, Brownhand Records. The topselling album also garnered numerous awards, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Performance by a Group. <b><i>Episode III Platinum Edition</i></b> was released a year after. In 2006, the band moved to the United States. In 2007, the two front men left the group to pursue solo careers. Durias decided to return to Manila while the rest of the members decided to stay in the United States, where they are all permanent residents. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byCristina Maria P.

After the departure of the band&rsquo;s original drummer, Chris Cantada, due to poor health in 2008, its current lineup features Ysmael &ldquo;Yael&rdquo; Yuzon (vocals, guitar), Erwin &ldquo;Armo&rdquo; Armovit (lead guitar), Reynaldo &ldquo;Gosh&rdquo; Dilay (bass and vocals), and Ted Cruz (drums).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Their single &ldquo;Lunes&rdquo; (Monday), from the 2003 release <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4181\"><strong>Sponge Cola</strong></a></i></b>, an extended play containing five tracks, brought them into the public eye. They have since produced five other albums: <b><i>Palabas</i></b> (The Show), 2004; <b><i>Transit</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Sponge Cola</i></b>, 2008; <b><i>Araw Oras Tagpuan</i></b> (Day Time Setting), 2011; and <b><i>Ultrablessed</i>, </b>2014. <b><i>Palabas</i></b> and <b><i>Transit</i></b> reached gold status while <b><i>Araw Oras Tagpuan</i></b> achieved diamond status. A string of hit singles over the years such as &ldquo;KLSP,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gemini,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jeepney,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bitiw&rdquo; (Let Go), &ldquo;Tuliro&rdquo; (Dumbfounded), &ldquo;Di Na Mababawi&rdquo; (You Can&rsquo;t Take it Back), &ldquo;Wala Kang Katulad&rdquo; (You Are like No Other), &ldquo;Makapiling Ka&rdquo; (To Be With You), which earned the band numerous accolades from NU Rock Awards, MYX, MTV Philippines, and other people&rsquo;s choice bodies, established the band&rsquo;s popularity and influence, revitalizing the Original Pilipino Music (OPM) and the rock music industry with the heavy radio airtime and huge sales of their music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir single &ldquo;Puso&rdquo; (Heart) was adopted as the anthem of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) in Season 71, 2008, and used for the next four years, while &ldquo;Bitiw&rdquo; was the theme song of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s series <b><i>Pedro Penduko</i></b>, which subsequently asked the band to write another theme song for the same show, &ldquo;Tuloy Pa Rin&rdquo; (It Goes On). The band was also the first to release copies of <b><i>Sponge Cola</i></b> in MP3 and MP4 formats.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sponge Cola&rsquo;s appeal lies not only in its catchy lyrics and melodies but in Yuzon&rsquo;s vocals that cover the range from mellow to screamo and the constant three-part harmony in most of their vocal arrangements. The group also has the ability to adapt to changing technologies in the marketplace, thus making it widely popular with the youth. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLara T.

With the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a></i></b>, 2008; and <b><i>Mornings and Airports</i></b> (2009), all under PolyEast Records (formerly EMI Philippines). <b><i>Dramachine</i></b> sold more than 30,000 copies (platinum status) after its initial release in Jul 2004 and was repackaged in 2006. The band is known for its huge hits such as &ldquo;Mariposa,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hari ng Sablay&rdquo; (King of Losers), &ldquo;Burnout,&rdquo; &ldquo;&rsquo;Wag Ka Nang Umiyak&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t Cry), &ldquo;Hangover,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kwarto&rdquo; (Room)&mdash;all whimsical songs that speak of love lost, love reborn, or poignant reminiscences of childhood. They have also produced radio hits such as &ldquo;Makita Kang Muli&rdquo; (To See You Again), the theme song of the TV series, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\"><strong>Ang Panday</strong></a></i></b>, aired in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> in 2005. In 2013, Dancel collaborated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Gloc-9</strong></a> in the popular single about the painful life of young Filipino homosexuals, &ldquo;Sirena&rdquo; (Mermaid).<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sugarfree owes its large following mainly to the voice of its frontman, Dancel. It is no surprise that this creative writing major from the University of the Philippines in Diliman is also the composer of more than 90 percent of the band&rsquo;s songs in their 12-year stint. Inspired and mentored by Pinoy rock icons in the 90s such as Rico Blanco of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a> and Dong Abay of Yano, Sugarfree carved out its own niche with their personalized style of love songs set to raw sound, rock rhythm of unfettered guitar strings, and unbridled drum beats. They have performed in small bars, the large auditoriums, and in open plazas all around the country.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sugarfree&rsquo;s last official concert was at Eastwood Mall titled <b><i>Paalam</i></b><i>,<b> Pilipinas </b></i>(Farewell, Philippines) with members Ebe Dancel (lead vocalist), Jai Taguibal (lead guitar), and Kaka Quisumbing (drums). Kaka replaced Mitch Singson, the band&rsquo;s original drummer. Dancel released his first solo album <b><i>Dalawang Mukha ng Pag-Ibig</i></b> (Two Faces of Love) five months after Sugarfree disbanded under Warner Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLara T.

Maguindanaon <b>kutyapi</b> artist. He achieved the highest level of skill in the art of playing the kutyapi, the two-stringed plucked lute. Practiced in Mindoro, Palawan, and Mindanao, kutyapi is a solo instrument among the Iraya, Palawan, Subanon, Maranao, Maguindanao, Tiruray, Blaan, Tboli, Ata, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Manobo Cotabato, Mansaka, Mandaya, Mangguangan, Bukidnon, Higaonon, and Mamanwa. It is also often paired with bamboo polychordal zither in another type of music. Kutyapi comes in diverse sizes and shapes, and is known by different names.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFundamentally, however, kutyapi music share a basic music organization. On one of its two strings is played a steady part that one would call drone, while on the other string, a melody is crafted on the movable frets. Kutyapi melodies, which are pentatonic, can be based on a scale with semitones or on one with none.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Maguindanaon have excelled in kutyapi music, producing fine finger techniques that are difficult to execute. Traditionally, kutyapi playing is transmitted across generations through imitation and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4185\"><strong>Samaon Sulaiman</strong></a> acquired the ability to play it from his uncle when he was around 13 years old. Sulaiman had since then been engaged with honing his skills and cultivating a wide repertory on the instrument, later becoming one of the most acclaimed kutyapi masters in Libutan and other barangays in the town of Magonoy. Along with kulintang artist Amal Lemuntod, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> presented Sulaiman in concerts in Manila and in Europe and his creativity on the instrument had strongly influenced other instrumentalists of the area such as Esmael Ahmad, Bitul Sulaiman, Nguda Latip, Ali Ahmad, and Tukal Nanalon. In 1998, Sulaiman was featured in the 50th Smithsonian Folklife Festival in the United States.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sulaiman&rsquo;s music can be heard in a field recording that Jose Maceda made in Oct 1980 and which the University of the Philippines Department of Music Research (now Department of Musicology) published in 1988, <b><i>Kulintang and Kudyapiq: Gong Ensemble and Two-string Lute among the Magindanaon in Mindanao</i></b><i>,<b> Philippines</b></i>. In that recording, he demonstrates his extensive knowledge of the instrument&rsquo;s repertoire, playing this in two tunings known as <b>dinaladay </b>and <b>binalig</b>. His music is refined and sensitive. It is rich in melodic and rhythmic invention.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like other distinguished indigenous artists, Samaon also knew how to play the <b>kulintang </b>(graduated gongs laid horizontally in a row), <b>agong</b> (suspended bossed gong with wide rim), <b>gandingan</b> (bossed gong with narrow rim), <b>palendag</b> (lip-valley flute), and <b>tambul</b>(drum).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a traditional musician, Sulaiman earned a living from sources other than his music. He was a popular barber in his community and served as an <i>imam</i> in the Libutan mosque. For his artistry, Sulaiman received the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan recognition in 1993. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Laoag City, Ilocos Norte 13 Oct 1971. Choir conductor, music historian, music educator. He comes from a family of entrepreneurs, headed by his father Domingo Ang Tan and his mother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> Cheng Qui&ntilde;ones. Arwin first studied piano with Emy Lou Nicolas of Nicolas Music Studio in his hometown before enrolling, at age 15, in Yamaha School of Music under a succession of teachers, the most important of whom was Eric Dimson, who trained him to win in the National Electone Contest in 1994. This achievement brought Tan to Thailand where he joined the Asia Oceania Electone Festival. After finishing a dual humanities and accounting degree at De La Salle University in Jan 1991, Tan passed the government licensure examination for certified public accountant in September of the same year. In 1994, he enrolled for a second degree at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music, as piano major under Augusto Espino. Shortly thereafter, however, he shifted to choral conducting, which required recitals that were mentored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4097\"><strong>Joel Navarro</strong></a>. While in UP, Tan also became a member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a> under Andrea O. Veneracion. It was from this experience with Veneracion that Tan&rsquo;s skills in choral conducting were further honed and his knowledge of performance practice and literature further expanded and vastly enhanced. Tan graduated magna cum laude in choral conducting and valedictorian of the graduating class in UP College of Music in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The choir <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4103\"><strong>Novo Concertante Manila</strong></a> was formed out of his choral conducting recitals. So successful was the organization of the choir that Tan continued directing to the next decade. Under his direction, Novo Concertante Manila soared to great heights by winning top prizes in international competitions. Aside from directing Novo Concertante, Tan also directed the University of Asia and the Pacific Chorale, 2003-06, which also won coveted awards in Europe, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Chorale, 2003-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From Veneracion, Tan acquired new ways of musical interpretation, choir management, and even organizing choral workshops. All these skills Tan, along with colleagues nearest to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea Veneracion</strong></a> such as Mark Carpio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4218\"><strong>Jonathan Velasco</strong></a>, brought to the founding of the Philippine Choral Directors Association in 2007. For the last decade, Tan has conducted choral clinics and has served as a member of juries in national and international choral competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition, Tan is a music historian. He finished a master&rsquo;s degree in musicology from UP, with a thesis on the life and works of the brass band leader and composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4014\"><strong>Lorenzo Ilustre</strong></a> from Batangas. This work became the basis for a research dealing with music as a form of cultural capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tan has also taught music history in UP College of Music, and a range of other music courses in St Scholastica&rsquo;s College, Ateneo de Manila University, University of Asia and the Pacific, and the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For his achievements in choral music, Tan&rsquo;s choir was awarded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a> ng Dangal by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015.

They were housed and educated by the Dominican priests. The tradition has been kept till today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Tiple</b>,<b> </b>a Spanish word, refers to the &ldquo;highest and brightest human voice,&rdquo; usually that of a soprano or little boys. The members of the choir are trained to sing in this style. The choir consists of about 28 members whose ages range from six to 13 years old, most of them coming from poor families, though a few from well-to-do clans have been taken in lately. To enable the boys to maintain the quality and continuous development of their voices, the Santo Domingo parish provides them with a total living system. As scholars of the parish, the boys are enrolled at the Angelicum School and are given free board and lodging at the Tiples House in the parish grounds in Quezon City. They visit their families on Sunday afternoon and return to the Angelicum the next day to attend their classes. The choir members are required to attend daily rehearsals in the afternoons for two hours after their classes. Those interested may take piano and organ lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During concert seasons, schedules of rehearsals become more demanding. Since 2000, the choir has been under Eugene de los Santos, who also happened to be a tiple member himself in 1990-94. The Tiples had Engracio Tempongco as their choirmaster from 1970-83.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tiples perform regularly on Sundays at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a>, at 7 and 10 am and 6 pm on weekdays. But the Santo Domingo Church is not the only venue of their performances. The Tiples have given concerts in many locations such as Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, Clark Field, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of their important performances was a command concert for the international delegates of the General Chapter of the Dominican Order held at the CCP Main Theater in 1977. Another performance at CCP took place in 1988 to commemorate the quadricentennial anniversary of the Dominican order in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group usually performs outside the Santo Domingo church during yuletide season, for example, in the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/799\"><strong>Villancico</strong></a>s ng Paskong Pilipino </i></b>(Carols of Philippine Christmas) in which they performed with other choirs at San Agustin Church, Intramuros, in 2011. In 2014, the choir was invited to perform with other top children&rsquo;s choirs of the country in the concert titled <b><i>6th Halina&rsquo;t Umawit </i></b>at the CCP Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>; and at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Organ Festival performing works of Filipino composers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3886\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Joed Balsamo</strong></a></strong></a> and Joy Nilo. The boys&rsquo; choir also had their first television appearance in 1988 when they interpreted Vic Villafuerte&rsquo;s composition, &ldquo;Maligayang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>, Panginoon&rdquo; (Happy Birthday, God). It was also their first recorded musical performance. They are recognized in music circles as one of the leading church choirs in the country today. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> Carununganupdated by Crisancti L.

Baltimore, Maryland, USA 2 Jul 1959. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> musician, saxophonist. He is the son of Arturo David Tolentino and Emma Allid. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4199\"><strong>Tots Tolentino</strong></a> is the grandson of former senator Arturo Tolentino. While in high school, he listened to Jazz Friends with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a> at the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center and at the Bacchus Pub. He started playing flute at the age of 16 with Eli Clamor at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music in 1975 and later on the saxophone after hearing Charlie Parker in the listening room of the school. Aside from Charlie Parker, his major influences are Hubert Laws, Michael Brecker, Sonny Stitt, and John Coltrane. In 1980, Tolentino enrolled at the Berklee College of Music in Boston where he graduated magna cum laude after three years with a degree in professional music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1977, his first group as a horn man was the Sunlight Band headed by pianist-composer, Ed Crisologo Jose, and drummer-composer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\"><strong>Richie Quirino</strong></a>, performing an all-original repertoire under the jazz fusion genre. The following year, he became the founding member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4205\"><strong>UP Jazz Ensemble</strong></a> headed by pianist Fred Robles where he experienced a taste of big band performance. He has performed in numerous overseas jazz festivals such as the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands, the Singapore Jazz Festival, and the Java Jazz Festival in Indonesia. In 1985, under Blackgold Records, Tolentino recorded four albums for Japanese harpist Tadao Hayashi, namely, <b><i>Standing Room Only</i></b>, <b><i>Best of Tadao Hayashi</i></b>, <b><i>Christmas a la Tadao</i></b>, and <b><i>Tadao&rsquo;s Christmas Wish</i></b>.

Years after, he recorded <b><i>Inah</i></b>, 1991, and <b><i>Color Real</i></b>, 1993, with the carrier single, &ldquo;Ethnic Daw&rdquo; (Ethnic They Call It), which raised quite a few eyebrows since it was different from the usual Top 40 grooves.

Except for <b>basso profundo</b> Constancio Cadelina who resigned earlier, the group&rsquo;s original membership remained the same until their disbanding in 1995. They were Gloria Dizon-Coronel, coloratura-soprano, and Erlinda Dacanay-Azcuna, mezzo-soprano, who are both opera and <b>sarsuwela</b><i> </i>artists as well as alumnae and faculty of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music; Lourdes Sauco Francisco, lyric soprano, a corporate lawyer; Vladimir Valera, baritone and a state prosecutor; and Renato Almira, tenor, who worked for a private corporation, and for a time, was executive secretary of the office of Sen Wigberto Ta&ntilde;ada. Julie Mendoza, an alumna of the UST Conservatory of Music alumna, was the group&rsquo;s musical director and pianist, Ed Borbon its choreographer, Reynaldo Torres its production coordinator, and Dolor himself its executive director and producer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The group&rsquo;s repertoire consisted of <b>kundiman</b>, <b>harana</b>, <b>balitaw</b>, and other classical, folk, and standard songs. Their performances were enlivened by novelty songs which featured the unique Filipino way of <i>lambingan</i> (tenderness) and <i>tuksuhan</i> (teasing), capped with theatrical clowning, bringing happiness to their audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1980, the group represented the Philippines in the Cross-cultural Friendship Festival held in Seoul, Korea. They also performed in charity concerts for the National Mental Hospital for rehabilitated patients, Correctional Institute for Women in Mandaluyong, and at the Culion Leper Colony in Palawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1980 and 1983, Tribung Pinoy was cited as the Best Cultural Group by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Awards. It was elevated to the Aliw Awards Hall of Fame in 1986. In Aug 1989, it was honored by the Kapisanan ng mga Propesor sa Pilipino (KAPPIL) for propagating nationalistic songs as well as the Filipino language itself. By 1990 it had given more than 500 concerts throughout the Philippines and in cities in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1995, however, the group has become inactive with the eventual passing of two of its original members: Renato Almira and Erlinda Dacanay-Azcuna. The group&rsquo;s producer, Danny Dolor, continued to manage other activities through the Tribung Pinoy Foundation.

It was established in 1971 by Flora Zarco-Rivera, a professor of music from the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music and chairperson of its Department of Conducting and Choral Ensembles. It is the official children&rsquo;s choir of the University of the Philippines Diliman. The group was a pioneer in the field of the secular, school-based children&rsquo;s choir. The choral quality they developed is the result of experiments undertaken over the years to discover a sound ideal for Philippine children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The members are recruited when they are six to nine years old and train for a year before becoming regular members. They perform until they graduate from high school. The group started with 12 children enrolled in Saturday music extension classes at the College and the group has grown to an average of 25 to 30 members. The present director is Rivera&rsquo;s daughter, ElenaRivera-Mirano, a retired professor in art studies from the UP College of Arts and Letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The choir has developed a unique repertoire consisting of compositions for children by Filipino composers, among them, national artists RamonP.Santos and LucioD.SanPedro; arrangements of folk songs by Antonio Regalario and Fabian Obispo; music by young composers Christine Muyco, Phoebe Roa, and Carlos Pizarro; and popular Filipino songs by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>. Many of the works were commissioned by the group and constitute its contribution to the national musical effort. It also performs songs from the western classical tradition, including choral music written by Schubert, Mozart, and Bach, as well as contemporary compositions by Astor Piazolla, Morten Lauridsen, and Bruno Coulais. The group shares this repertoire through concerts, workshops and music camps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2016 with a restaging of the theater piece for children titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ni Pulau: Dulang-Awit sa Tao&rsquo;t Kalikasan</i></b> (Song of Pulau: Sung Theater for Man and Nature) with libretto by Edgardo Maranan and music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P.

The band has 30 members comprising of current students and alumni of the college and its musical director is Raymundo &ldquo;Rayben&rdquo; Maigue. Its beginnings can be traced to the year 1977 when Joseph Howard, a music professor from the United States under a Fulbright grant, volunteered to teach jazz theory, improvisation, and big and small jazz ensembles classes at UP College of Music. His eight-month stay motivated many students of trumpet, trombone, saxophone, and percussion to pour out their creative energies in the art of improvisation that is different from and which complements the classical music training in the College. After Howard left for the United States, his students continued to hold regular jamming sessions which gave rise to the establishment of the group that is now known as the UP Jazz Ensemble. The College of Music later formalized the jamming sessions into a regular course in the curriculum. Since 1980, it has been handled by one of J. Howard&rsquo;s students, Rayben Maigue, an accomplished trumpet player, composer, arranger, and currently chair of the UP College of Music Department of Winds and Percussion .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UP Jazz Ensemble&rsquo;s repertoire consists of well known works of jazz composers and arrangers like Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Sammy Nestico, George Gershwin, and Count Basie. They also perform jazz arrangements of popular music compositions such as the songs of the Beatles, film music of John <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s, new age music of Dave Grusin, and the works of Filipino jazz artists such as Angel Pe&ntilde;a, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\"><strong>Richie Quirino</strong></a>, and Jon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\"><strong>Palacio</strong></a>. The ensemble has served as a training ground for student arrangers, composers, and conductors. It has also produced many of the country&rsquo;s professional jazz musicians who perform in groups like the Ugoy Ugoy Band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a> Band, Brass Monkeys, Parliament Syndicate, and the AMP Big Band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recognition of their meritorious contributions to the field of jazz music, the group was awarded the First City Jazz Achievement Award by the DWCT FM Station City Lite 88.3 in 1989. In 1999, the UP Jazz Ensemble was recognized by Petron Corporation for being prime movers of jazz in the Philippines with their long years of virtuosity and for dedicatedly leading in the development of Filipino talent in the field of music. The ensemble actively promotes Filipino jazz and live big band jazz performance in order to widen jazz appreciation in the country. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

It offers scholarship to its members by giving free tuition and accommodation at the Department of Military Science and Tactics Complex in the UP Diliman campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Its beginnings can be traced to the late 1960s when Eliseo Clamor, a professor at the UP College of Music, formed a band unit for the university&rsquo;s ROTC program. In the early 1980s, Clamor was succeeded by Rodolfo de Leon under whose directorship the band came to be known formally as the UP ROTC Band. At about the same time, a young trumpet student at the UP College of Music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4058\"><strong>Raymundo Maigue</strong></a>, was inspired by the visiting Eastman Wind Ensemble from the United States to form a small wind ensemble, the members of which were mostly from the UP ROTC Band. Due to the shortage of membership, this small wind ensemble merged with the Philippine Youth Symphonic Band, a government-sponsored project under the Marcos administration which was the result of an annual summer training camp at the Philippine High School for the Arts in Mt Makiling, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna. The summer camp was discontinued during the Aquino administration and the band was adopted by UP. It was renamed the UP-Philippine Youth Symphonic Band (UP-PYSB), with mostly the same members comprising the UP ROTC Band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The directorship of the UP ROTC Band was passed on to Ret Col Peregrino Aledia in the early 1990s, who also taught band conducting in the UP College of Music. In 1998, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3864\"><strong>Rodney Ambat</strong></a> was appointed by then dean Reynaldo T. Paguio to conduct the UP-PYSB, which he later renamed as UP Symphonic Band. Both the UP ROTC Band and the UP Symphonic Band were later assigned under the leadership of Leopoldo Lopez in 2003, from which time onward, both became known under the merged UP ROTC Symphonic Band. In 2011, upon the demise of Lopez, the baton was passed on to Rodney Ambat who continues to lead the band with an active concert schedule. Since 2011, the UP ROTC Symphonic Band (aka UP Symphonic Band) has presented three major concerts: <b><i>Ode to the Common Filipino</i></b>,<i> <b>A Symphonic Metamorphosis</b></i>,<i> </i>and<i> <b>Sound Images</b></i>. They have also participated in the 1st National Symphonic Band Festival organized by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in 2012.

Later Valdez went solo. His first album, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/961\"><strong>Ngayon at Kailanman</strong></a></i></b> (Now and Forever), 1977, was a major hit and an award winner. Nine other albums followed, all of them successful, including <b><i>Corner of the Sky</i></b>,<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a></b></i>,<i> <b>Basil:</b> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/903\"><strong>Hindi Kita Malilimutan</strong></a></b></i> (Basil, I Will Not Forget You), and <b><i>Nag-iisang Pangarap </i></b>(A Single Dream).

He began to write songs for Vicor artists, such as &ldquo;Ayoko na sa &rsquo;Yo&rdquo; (I Don&rsquo;t Like You Anymore) for Pol Enriquez and &ldquo;Sorry Na, Pwede Ba?&rdquo; (Sorry, Please) for Rico Puno. His &ldquo;Mr. D.J.&rdquo; for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>&rsquo;s first record started the young singer&rsquo;s rise to popularity. This was followed by &ldquo;Kahit Maputi na ang Buhok Ko&rdquo; (Even If My Hair Grows White). His other singles include &ldquo;Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo&rdquo; (My Promise To You), &ldquo;Tayong Dalawa&rdquo; (The Two Of Us), &ldquo;Malayo Pa ang Umaga&rdquo; (Morning is &ldquo;Kung Kailangan Mo Ako&rdquo; (If You Need Me), and &ldquo;Walang Kapalit&rdquo; (No Replacement). Among his bestselling albums then are <b><i>Walang Kapalit</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\"><strong>Rey Valera</strong></a>&rsquo;s Greatest Hits</i></b>, and <b><i>Hello</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Valera became known as &ldquo;Mr. Hitmaker&rdquo; and was appointed executive vice-president for artists and repertoire in Vicor&rsquo;s sister company, Blackgold Records. Apart from recordings, he also represented the country in international song festivals and performed in shows abroad with other Filipino artists. In 1984, after several gold and platinum records and at the peak of his fame, Valera decided to quit his job and recharge. In 1987, when he returned to music, he chose to go into film scoring. He worked as musical scorer in more than 50 movies, also doing the theme songs for many of them, such as <b><i>Strangers in Paradise</i></b>, <b><i>Hello Young Lovers</i></b>, <b><i>Exploitation</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1006\"><strong>Sinasamba Kita</strong></a> </i></b>(I Adore You), and <b><i>Annie Sabungera </i></b>(Annie the Cockfighter) where he also co-starred with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4728\"><strong>Ace Vergel</strong></a>. However, the continuing decline of original Pilipino music or OPM goaded him to compose songs once again. Upon Sharon Cuneta&rsquo;s request, he wrote &ldquo;Kahit Wala Ka Na&rdquo; (Though You Are Gone). It was adopted as the title of the movie she was making then and started the trend of using Rey Valera&rsquo;s hits as movie titles and theme songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two of his songs, &ldquo;Pangako sa &lsquo;Yo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tayong Dalawa,&rdquo; became the theme song and title of two popular primetime drama series produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> in 2000 and 2009, respectively. His comeback album, <b><i>Sa Kabila ng Lahat </i></b>(Despite Everything), 1990, turned platinum in two weeks&rsquo; time. When Viva Records sought to revive Cuneta&rsquo;s career as a singer, it was through an album of Valera&rsquo;s greatest hits called <b><i>Sharon Sings Valera</i></b>, 1992. His latest albums are compilations of his hits, one in 1994, a second in 2005, and a third compiling his 18 greatest hits in vinyl in 2009. In 2000, he joined <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4167\"><strong>Vehnee Saturno</strong></a> in the group called SAGA (Songs and Generations After). The group disbanded shortly after producing one album and a concert tour in Canada. He also managed a children&rsquo;s band named Saling Ket, with whom he released the album <b><i>Panghabangbuhay </i></b>(Forever) in 2005. Beginning 2002, he and his contemporaries <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4134\"><strong>Rico J. Puno</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3863\"><strong>Hajji Alejandro</strong></a>, Nonoy Zu&ntilde;iga, and Marco Sison began performing concerts titled <b><i>The Greatest Hits</i></b>. Their group is now known as Greatest Hits 5 or GH5. In 2008, Valera reunited with Eva Eugenio, Rico J. Puno, Claire dela Fuente, and Nonoy Zu&ntilde;iga in a one-night concert called <b><i>The Legends of OPM</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Valera has received numerous awards and citations, among them, the 1981 Most Popular Recording Artist, the 1982 Presidential Award as &ldquo;King of Tagalog Songs,&rdquo; 1982 and 1983 Entertainer of the Year, and 1983 Most Outstanding Recording Artist and Most Popular Singer/Entertainer. He became the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement for Music at the 8th Tinig Awards for the National Club in 2003, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards&rsquo; Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino in 2005, and the MYX Magna Award in 2015. In the same year, the ABS-CBN Philharmonic Orchestra also paid tribute to him in the concert <b><i>The Music of Rey Valera</i></b>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Rosalinda Galang, updated by Cristina Maria P.

Obando (now Misericordia), Manila 19 Dec 1909. d. Tanauan, Batangas 10 Feb 1945. Violinist. Born to Jose Vallejo, an orchestra conductor, and Felipa Arreola, he showed great interest in music, and musical ability, as a child. He would watch his father at rehearsals of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\"><strong>Army and Navy Club</strong></a> Orchestra, after which he would play parts of the music he had heard on his toy violin. Noticing his talent, composer MarceloAdonay gave him a real violin as a Christmas gift. His father taught Vallejo the violin and the guitar, and the young boy excelled in both in a short time. He was not yet five years old when he took part in concerts at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a>Zorrilla and the Columbian Club. At the age of seven, Vallejo was presented by the Asociacion<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>deFilipinas in his first violin concert at the Army and Navy Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1920, BonifacioAbdon, then most notable violin teacher in Manila, became his tutor. In 1921, violin virtuoso Mischa Elman and pianist Godowski, who were on a world tour, were so impressed by Vallejo&rsquo;s playing that they urged the boy to continue his studies in the United States. With the help of philantrophist Ariston Bautista who gave the initial donation of 2,000 pesos, Vallejo was sent to New York in Oct 1923. There he became a student of Franz Kneisel and Sascha Jacobsen, who had been concertmaster of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The teenager gave concerts to thunderous ovations everywhere including the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vallejo returned to Manila in 1929 and made his first public appearance at the ManilaGrand<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>House. It is said that he so completely captivated the Filipino audience that there was a public clamor for him to perform in other places. His success as a violin virtuoso derived from his energetic personality and style of playing, his intelligent interpretation, and his masterful bowing technique. He taught at the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music and later at the Academy of Music of Manila, and became concertmaster of the ManilaSymphonyOrchestra from 1935 to 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vallejo, his wife Nona Gebbert, and three children all died during a massacre by the Japanese forces in Tanauan, Batangas on 10 Feb 1945. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

Berchem, Antwerp, Belgium 29 Aug 1920. d. Manila, Philippines 16 Aug 1987. Choral conductor, educator. He professed his first religious vows on 8 Sep 1939 and was ordained as a priest of the Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) on 16 Jul 1944 in Belgium. He studied organ with Flor Peeters and Msgr Jules Van Nuffel at the Interdiocesan Higher Institute for Church Music, also known as the Lemmens Institute, in Mechelen, Belgium in 1945-46; and at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome, Italy under Edgaro Carducci and Msgr Domenico Bartolucci in 1961-62.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Van de Steen arrived in the Philippines in Nov 1946. His first missionary assignment was at Solano, Nueva Vizcaya as assistant parish priest. He was subsequently assigned to the various missions of the CICM in the Philippines: Paco, Manila, 1948-49; Para&ntilde;aque, 1949-1950; Bontoc, Mountain Province, 1950-1953; and Baguio, 1972. In 1953, when the administration of the San Carlos Seminary was transferred from the Vincentians to the CICM Fathers by the Vatican, Van de Steen served as the seminary&rsquo;s professor of music and art history. He resided at the seminary in Guadalupe, Makati from 1953 to 1971. When the administration of the seminary was later transferred to the Diocesan priests in 1973 by Cardinal Rufino J. Santos, DD, Van de Steen moved to Baguio, serving as the chaplain of the University of Baguio from 1975 to 1985 and the procurator of the Chapel of the Home Sweet Home in Baguio from 1981 to 1985. His last assignment brought him back to San Carlos in 1985 where he served as the seminary&rsquo;s musical director from 1985 until his demise in 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in 1958, on the occasion of the consecration of the Manila Metropolitan Cathedral, that Van de Steen founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> Choir. In 1958, the choir was originally made up of laymen, selected seminarians from the San Carlos Seminary, and the Manila Cathedral Boys Choir. The latter&rsquo;s membership consisted of school boys from the different Catholic Schools at that time: Makati Catholic School, Paco Catholic School, Malate Catholic School, and the Manila Cathedral School. The choir sang at the regular services of the Manila Cathedral, and at the occasional high masses, ordinations, and important events in the liturgical calendar such as Christmas and Easter. Among the group&rsquo;s notable performances were the singing of the entire <b><i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i></b> of Palestrina under the baton of Van de Steen&rsquo;s professor from Rome, Msgr Domenico Bartolucci; singing for the opening of the International Music Festival at the newly inaugurated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) in Sep 1969; and singing for the papal masses, together with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4196\"><strong>Tiples de Santo Domingo</strong></a> who were being trained by Van de Steen&rsquo;s assistant conductor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4195\"><strong>Engracio Tempongko</strong></a>, at the Luneta Park, Quezon Memorial Circle, and the Manila Cathedral during the visit of Pope Paul VI to the Philippines in 1970. The Manila Cathedral Boys Choir holds the distinction of being the first boys choir to sing and perform at the CCP with their participation in <b><i>Dularawan:</i></b><i> <b>Salakot na Ginto </b></i>(Image Play: The Golden Salakot) in 1969. The choir became less active when Van de Steen was assigned to Baguio from 1975 to 1985, but was later revived when he was re-appointed at the San Carlos Seminary in 1985. He conducted the Manila Cathedral Choir for the last time in their concert at the CCP titled <b><i>Papuri VI </i></b>(Praise VI) in Jan 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the alumni of the Manila Cathedral Boys Choir continued singing long after they had retired from the group, founding their own adult male choirs whose membership consisted mostly of singers trained by Van de Steen. The most active among them revere their esteemed mentor&rsquo;s memory by carrying his name, the John Van De Steen Male Choir. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Manila 23 Oct 1913. d. Manila 1986. Composer, conductor, musical director. Born to Miguel Velarde Sr, a doctor, and Dolores Guison, he was married to Luisa Guison with whom he had six children. Velarde spent the first 18 years of his life in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. When he was six, his mother gave him piano and violin lessons. He studied at the Zamboanga Normal School, where he became a member of the school orchestra. He went to Manila and took up medicine at the University of the Philippines, but later realized that music was his true calling. His father objected. To support his music studies, he worked as a bus conductor. Later he ran a weekly how, <b><i>Stardust Program</i></b>, where he sang and played his own jazz arrangements on the piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Velarde learned the basics of harmony and composition from AntonioJ.Molina and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\"><strong>Ariston Avelino</strong></a>, and deepened his knowledge through self-study. He opened a piano-jazz school and worked as song editor of the <b><i>PhilippinesFreePress </i></b>and later of the <b><i>Literary Song Movie Magazine</i></b>. When <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>Pictures was established, he wrote musical scores for its movie productions and managed its advertising. He also became advertising manager for Excelsior and Champion Pictures. During the Japanese Occupation, he worked as a musical director for Avenue Theater, where his concertized arrangements of folksongs like &ldquo;Planting Rice&rdquo; were well-received by the audience. In the 1950s and late 1960s, Velarde was deeply involved in films as musical director, scriptwriter, and/or director. Regarded as his most important works are <b><i>LuksangTagumpay </i></b>(Bitter Victory), 1960, which received the Best Picture award from the FilipinoAcademyofMovie ArtsandSciences(FAMAS), and for which he wrote the story and screenplay, and <b><i>Alaala Kita </i></b>(I Remember You), 1961. He won FAMAS awards for the story of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1217\"><strong>Luksang Tagumpay</strong></a> </i></b>and for his musical direction of <b><i>Alaala Kita</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a composer, Velarde was first influenced by Irving Berlin and Cole Porter. Later, he created songs with his own distinct style, such as: &ldquo;Ikaw&rdquo; (You), for the movie <b><i>Milagro ng Nazareno </i></b>(Miracle of the Nazarene), 1935; &ldquo;Habang Buhay&rdquo; (As Long as I Live), for <b><i>Lagot na Kuwintas </i></b>(Broken Necklace), and &ldquo;DahilsaIyo&rdquo; (Because of You), for <b><i>BituingMarikit </i></b>(Beautiful Star), 1938; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1004\"><strong>Silayan</strong></a>&rdquo; (See Me Through), for <b><i>Pasang Krus </i></b>(Bearing the Cross), 1939; and &ldquo;MinamahalKita&rdquo; (I Love You), for <b><i>Ni&ntilde;a Bonita </i></b>(Pretty Girl), and &ldquo;Ikaw ay Akin&rdquo; (You are Mine), for <b><i>Orasang Ginto </i></b>(Golden Clock), 1940. Among these songs, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/884\"><strong>Dahil sa Iyo</strong></a>&rdquo; was a great hit in the country and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, Velarde&rsquo;s works included a collection of songs for two revivals: SeverinoReyes&rsquo;s <b><i>WalangSugat </i></b>(No Wounds), 1971, and <b><i>Minda Mora</i></b>, 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1970, he won the Best Conductor award at the First International Popular Song Contest in Japan, where his composition &ldquo;As Long as Forever&rdquo; was the Philippine entry. In 1975 the Philippine Government Cultural Association awarded him the Cultural Achievement Award in PopularMusic. He received the CCP Award in 1986.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Menchie R. Tajan</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Manila 31 Dec 1962. Choral conductor, educator, international choral clinician and juror, singer. His parents are Tirso de la Cruz Velasco, a former senior state prosecutor at the Department of Justice who hailed from Gulayon City, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> del Norte, and Corazon Bolinas Montemayor from Santa Barbara, Pangasinan. He is the second among six siblings. He finished his elementary education at San Beda College in 1975 and high school at the University of Santo Tomas High School in 1979. He attended the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music from 1979 to 1989, and studied piano under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3851\"><strong>Nita Abrogar-Quinto</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3941\"><strong>Jose Contreras</strong></a>, and voice under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\"><strong>Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</strong></a>. While he was at the University of the Philippines, he sang for and became the assistant conductor of the UP Saringhimig, a choral group which won several prizes in top competitions in Europe in 1979 and 1980. In 1981, Velasco joined the UP (later Philippine) Madrigal Singers and eventually became its assistant choirmaster. While pursuing his studies, he joined the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) and won in the voice category C when he was 25 years old. In 1989, he moved to Berlin to pursue advanced studies in choral conducting, voice, piano, and music theory at the Berliner Kirchenmusikschule as a scholar of the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>. He also received a scholarship from the Rotary Club of Spandau in Berlin in his first two years in Germany. Under the guidance of Martin Behrmann, he obtained an &ldquo;A&rdquo; Level Church Musician accolade from the Berliner Kirchenmusicschule with distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, Velasco became the first Filipino member of the prestigious World Youth Choir, a yearly gathering of distinguished and select groups of choral singers chosen from different continents, directed by the best choral conductors from around the world. He eventually became the first Filipino and the first Asian to conduct the World Youth Choir, as assistant conductor in its 1993 season, and later, as principal conductor in its 1996 season and its 2001-02 winter session. Aside from the World Youth Choir, he was also invited to be the guest conductor of the Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club (ACGC) in their 2000-01 European concert tours. Under his direction, the ACGC won first prizes in Maribor, Slovenia; Cork, Ireland; and Marktoberdorf, Germany; and a gold diploma in Riva del Garda, Italy. In 2001, upon the establishment of the San Miguel Master Chorale, the first-ever professional choir in the Philippines, Velasco was chosen to be its principal conductor, a position he held until 2003. In 2004, he returned to the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music (AILM) and conducted the AILM Chorale until 2008, the same choir he had conducted earlier in 1995-99. The Chorale made several concert tours in Asia with him, and a special European concert tour in 2006 to celebrate the institute&rsquo;s 25th Anniversary. At present, Velasco conducts the Ateneo Chamber Singers (ACS), a choir formed in 2001 by the graduating members of the 2000-01 batch of Ateneo College Glee Club, which specializes in sacred music. Under his direction, the ACS emerged as the winner in the Musica Sacra Category and recipient of a gold medal in the Chamber Choir Category of the 2014 World Choir Games held in Riga, Latvia, as well as the first prize winner in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/777\"><strong>Habanera</strong></a></strong></a> Category of the 60th Certamen Internacional de Habaneras y Polifonia in Torrevieja, Spain in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since his return to the Philippines in 1993 from his studies in Berlin, Velasco served as voice and conducting teacher at the AILM, and later became its Chairman of Choral Studies and Dean of Studies, until his resignation in 2008. He has also actively been propagating the choral arts through his involvement in numerous local and international choral activities since 1993. These include giving choral workshops and clinics in the Philippines and abroad; adjudicating in prestigious international choral competitions such as those in Marktoberdorf, Tolosa, Maaasmechelen, Budapest, Busan, and Singapore; mentoring young choral conductors; teaching voice; and holding important positions in various choral-related organizations. He has held the position of President of the Philippine Choral Directors Association since its inception in 2004. Velasco is also the lone Philippine representative to the World Choir Council, and a member of the artistic committees of the Polyfollia Festival based in Normandy, France, the 8th World Symposium on Choral Music in Copenhagen in 2008, and the ITB International Choral Competition based in Bandung, Indonesia.

Band leader, arranger, music director, and saxophone player. He is the son of Luis Villena and Rosalina Bragado. Both his parents were music aficionados while a maternal aunt delved into classical music and opera-style training during her younger days but none of them turned out to be professional musicians. He was a student of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music in the late 1970s where he met his future wife, Eleanor &ldquo;Nori&rdquo; Perez, a composition major. They have four children who are all musically inclined. His eldest daughter Ria, graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in music, major in composition, from UP. His twin sons Mark, a drummer, and Miko, a bass player, and his youngest Joshua, a guitarist, are all developing their skills as professional musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In grade school, he played Beatles&rsquo; tunes on an acoustic guitar, while whiling his time away on the street corner near his home. Then he turned to the organ, which introduced him to formal music training, prior to picking up the baritone euphonium which he played in the schools&rsquo; marching band for eight years. A host of other instruments followed, like the soprano, tenor, and baritone saxophones, the piano and synthesizer, and the diatonic harmonica, more commonly called the blues harp. Pop groups of the 1960s first grabbed his attention, then rock music of the 1970s, until he reached seventh grade when his interests turned to more progressive genres interspersed with a lot of blues. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> in the form of big band music came in high school, inspired by legends Duke Ellington and Count Basie. He joined the La Salle Green Hills performing group Kundirana, leading it for two years, while honing his skills as an arranger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taking music more seriously, he enrolled at the UP College of Music from 1977 to 1982. Here he met Eliseo Clamor and decided that the baritone sax and jazz music would be the instruments for his career. He eventually joined the UP Jazz Octet, which later evolved into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4205\"><strong>UP Jazz Ensemble</strong></a>. This is the stage he considered as the most important in his development as a budding musical director and arranger. His first big break came when RPN 9 hired him as the musical director of the comedy series <b><i>Champoy</i></b> in 1982 and later <b><i>NAKUH! Eto Na Po Sila</i></b> (Oh No! Here They Come). He was also the musical director of GMA Network&rsquo;s <b><i>Pare and Pare</i></b> (Dude and Dude), ABC 5&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Idol</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a> Show</i></b>, <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a> Show</i></b>, <b><i>Twist and Shout</i></b>, and <b><i>The Singing Bee</i></b>.

Pakil, Laguna 1 Jun 1921. d. 15 Jun 2010. Musician, community cultural organizer, historian. He is considered the foremost culture bearer of the town of Pakil, Laguna. His parents were Pedro Espina Vito, a <i>sacristan</i>, and Mercedes Martinez Galing, a laundrywoman of a priest. His parents were steeped in the local knowledge of the Southern Tagalog region. His uncle, Ricardo Vito, was a priest, and his sister, Erudita Vito, was a <b>cantora</b><i> </i>(female singer) in church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He finished his sixth grade at Pangil Elementary School and seventh grade at Paco Catholic School in Manila with honors. He studied for the priesthood at the Franciscan Seminario-Colegio Serafico from 1935 to 1939. He studied the Solfeo de Eslava up to lesson 17 under a teacher and the succeeding lessons by himself. His seminary training, however, was not completed due to ill health. He studied at Araullo High School in Manila after years of seminary life. However, after two years in high school, he went back to Pakil due to the onset of World War II. After the war, he began teaching in various schools and colleges in Pakil. In 1946, he established the Dorado Barrio School in Banilan, Laguna where he taught until 1951. While teaching, he studied at the Union College in Santa Cruz, Laguna where he obtained a bachelor of science degree in education and a master of arts degree in education (non-thesis track). On 27 Nov 1947, he married Alodia Macabasco Ybardolaza, a native of Pakil, a cantora in church, and classmate in elementary school. They had 10 children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He rearranged the lyrics of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1312\"><strong>Turumba</strong></a>&rdquo; (Song of Turumba) from <b>balse</b> (three-four time signature) to a <b>marcha</b> (two-four and four-four time signature), and revised some lines of the lyrics of the song. He started to invite people from the neighboring towns to attend the Turumba procession. He also began directing the reenactment of the finding of the image of Our Lady of Virgin of Sorrows at the Laguna de Bay, where he also served as the narrator. He became a member and officer of the Banda Dos of Pakil in 1945 where he played the <b>bajo</b> (bass). He was the <i>hermano</i> (male leader) of the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a></i> in 1946. In 1958, he went back to teaching and served as a classroom teacher and district coordinator. He retired from teaching in 1984. He also taught Spanish and music at the Eastern College in Paete from 1967 to 1989. He was well versed in Spanish, Latin, Filipino, and English, and wrote in all four languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His lifelong interest in local history and culture led him to champion the preservation of tradition in both church and civic life. He served the town as first councilor in the Municipal Council and, later, Chairman of the Pakil Committee on History, Culture and Research for many decades. He was active in the San Pedro de Alcantara Parish as the chairman of the Liturgy Committee and the Committee on Evangelism. He served as president of Parish Pastoral Council for several years. Scholars and students of local culture in Pakil invariably sought his counsel and advice on matters concerning the history and culture of the town and its tradition of theater, music, dance, ritual, and devotional practice. His work with younger scholars, among them Elena Rivera Mirano and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3206\"><strong>Jerry Respeto</strong></a>, assured the transmission, documentation, and retrieval of old traditions in Laguna. He was instrumental in keeping the memory of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a> alive in Pakil, recovering and keeping the composer&rsquo;s music manuscripts safe, tracing his family tree, and organizing the yearly Adonay Day celebrations in the town. In recognition of his unflagging efforts, Vito was recognized as the Outstanding Senior Citizen for Volunteer Service by the Department of Social Work and Community Development in 1989. His family was also acknowledged as the Philippine Centennial Model Family for the Province of Laguna in 1998. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Elena Rivera Mirano and Jerry Respeto</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Sotto III, Marvic &ldquo;Vic&rdquo; Sotto, Valmar &ldquo;Val&rdquo; Sotto, and Spanky Rigor in 1978, thus the acronym V (for Vic and Val), S (for Spanky), and T (for Tito). Their dance songs were part of the repertory of <b>Manila Sound</b> in the late 1970s, a repertory of Filipinized pop music characterized by its lightheartedness, with romantic lyrics in colloquial Tagalog-English or Taglish. Formed to counteract the famed musical group, the Boyfriends, the group appeared at the time when the American disco film by John Travolta <b><i>Saturday Dance Fever</i></b> was a hit. Their goal was to produce music which the people would recognize immediately as a VST song the way people recognized &ldquo;A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night&rdquo; as a Beatles&rsquo; song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The original members singing in falsetto style were composed of seven males, all moustached except for Vic Sotto. They believed that the number seven would bring them luck and success. The members were the Paco boys, namely, the Sotto brothers Vic (lead vocalist, arranger, and lyricist) and Val (rhythm guitar); the &ldquo;461 guys&rdquo; from General Lim Street, San Juan or Little Baguio, namely, the Rigor brothers Spanky (bass guitar and lyricist), Male (keyboard), and Roger (guitar), as well as Celso &ldquo;Chuck&rdquo; Llarina (lead guitar, lyricist), Monet Gaskell (acoustic guitar, keyboard, lyricist), and Jun Medina (drums) who was later replaced after he left the group for the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The group reached its height of fame from 1978 to 1981. Their hit song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>in Mo at Isasayaw Ko&rdquo; (Sing It and I Will Dance It) was aired on the radio in the Philippines as well as in New York, City at Studio 54. They also did ballads such as &ldquo;Ikaw Lang Ang Aking Mahal&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re the Only <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> I Love), &ldquo;Ipagpatawad Mo&rdquo; (Please Forgive Me), &ldquo;Etcetera,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kiss&hellip; Kiss.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All in all, VST &amp; Co. recorded and released several long-playing and compilation albums such as <b><i>Disco Fever</i></b> and <b><i>Ikaw ang Aking Mahal/Awitin Mo </i></b>(You&rsquo;re the One I Love/Sing It), 1978; <b><i>Boogie Woogie Christmas Day</i></b>, 1979<i>;<b> The Best of VST and Co.</b></i>, 2002; <b><i>The Complete Greatest Hits Collection</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>18 Greatest Hits</i></b>, 2009; and <b><i>The VST and Co. Bossa Nova Collection</i></b>, 2010. An album titled <b><i>OPM Back to Back Hits of VST &amp; Company &amp; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4005\"><strong>Hagibis</strong></a></i></b> was released in May 2012 by Vicor Music of Viva Entertainment Inc. All VST albums became gold hits, selling more than 10,000 copies, except for the second album. The group was included in the two-album set titled <b><i>Songs of Life</i></b> produced by Vicor Group of Companies to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the founding of Philippine National Red Cross in 1980. VST songs were also published in <b><i>The Best of Filipino Artists Noon at Ngayon</i></b>, <b><i>Diamond Edition</i></b>, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the height of their fame, VST collaborated with other musicians, like Homer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> (arrangement and keyboards), Chito Ilagan (bass guitar), Ben Escasa (percussion), Fred Concepcion (trumpet), Boy Alcaide (drums), and Clod Baria (trombone). At least 16 of the VST song lyrics were written by Joey de Leon, 16 compositions made by Vic Sotto, and three songs composed by Tito. The group starred with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a> in the movie <b><i>Swing It</i></b><i>,<b> Baby</b></i>.

Composer, arranger, band conductor, musician, teacher. He married Sergia Santos, with whom he had three children. He raised his family and spent most of his professional life in Malolos. He studied with the Jesuits in the Escuela Normal in Manila. He played the violin and the piano, and was familiar with all other instruments of the orchestra. At age 17, he was already teaching music to the orchestras in Malolos and nearby Paombong. He also taught solfeggio, violin, piano, and other musical instruments to students from Malolos and other towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1886, he composed the first version of the &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; (Queen of Heaven, Rejoice), a song in slow triple meter, which is sung during the <i>salubong </i>or meeting of the images of the Virgin Mary and the Risen Christ at dawn of Easter Sunday. To the accompaniment of a brass band, it is sung by a little girl in angel costume after she is lowered from the ceiling of a four-posted structure called the <i>galilea</i> and as she removes the black veil of the Virgin Mary to denote that her mourning is over. Maestrong Asiong made three versions of this work. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the versions is still sung to this day during the Easter Sunday salubong in Malolos parishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1906, Witangcoy completed the music for the <i>panunuluyan</i>, which is also in slow triple time. This is used for the Christmas eve procession, reenacting the search for an inn in Bethlehem by the pregnant Virgin Mary and St Joseph, represented by images on a <i>karo </i>(religious float) and/or by a <i>kantora </i>(female singer) and <i>kantor </i>(male singer) who will sing their parts to the accompaniment of the brass band. In front of about four or five previously designated houses, the singers plead with the <i>maybahay </i>(houseowner) to give them room for the night because all inns are full and they are very tired. Each maybahay sings his response and turns the couple away, leaving them no choice but to seek shelter in an animal shed, which is the one prepared inside the church where the midnight mass will be held. With the approval of the parish priest Fr Juan Gatmaitan, Witangcoy&rsquo;s panunuluyan was first performed in Paombong where the Maestro had already trained a band which he also conducted. Because of its success, it was then performed in Malolos with the permission of the parish priest Fr Osmundo Lim. The Malolos version spread to other towns not only of Bulacan but apparently of the Archdiocese of Manila which at that time included many other provinces of Luzon, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>. Today, the Witangcoy panunuluyan is sung at the <i>maytinis</i> of Kawit, Cavite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1908, Witangcoy composed another important piece for another religious dramatization, this time of Jesus&rsquo;s entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. The &ldquo;Hossana, Filio David&rdquo; (Hossana to the Son of David) had six versions, all in slow triple time. After the blessing of the palms, the priest, representing Christ and carrying a palm of his own, leads the procession of the faithful around the church plaza or on the street, stopping at every decorated <i>kubol,</i> a makeshift balcony of bamboo and wood. At each kubol, little girls dressed in white sing one version of the &ldquo;Hossana&rdquo; to the accompaniment of a band, all the while showering the priest with flower petals and confetti from their baskets. After the last &ldquo;Hossana&rdquo; is sung at the last kubol, the procession winds up in church where the priest celebrates the mass of Palm Sunday. The different versions of Witangcoy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hossana&rdquo; continue to be sung on Palm Sundays in Malolos and neighboring towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the church feasts, Witangcoy also composed or arranged <i>misa cantada</i> (sung on high mass) and <i>misa de gallo </i>(novena masses before Christmas).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the secular pieces that he composed are music for the poems of Pepe Julian, a piece called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><strong>Kumintang</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; which Epifanio de los Santos, another Malolos resident, allegedly collected for the library-museum in Manila, and several <b>balse</b><i> </i>(waltz). Most famous of his balse was &ldquo;Elena&rdquo; which was retitled &ldquo;Malolena&rdquo; (Lady of Malolos) when it was performed in the United States. Maestrong Asiong also composed a <b>sarsuwela</b><i> </i>commissioned by the Bulacan society called Lakas ng Pagkakaisa. This sarsuwela, whose title is missing, was written by Ramon Cruz and featured Horacio Morelos and Vicenta de Leon as lead actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1913, Witangcoy left for Manila to play at the Sine Empire of Albert Yearsley, together with musicians like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>. Other musicians that he played with in the orchestra were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5642\"><strong>Pedrito Reyes</strong></a> (son of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>), Numeriano Lindayag, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1974, the scores of the melodies of two versions of the &ldquo;Hossana Filio David&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>Osana</strong></a>&rdquo;, one version of the &ldquo;Regina Coeli Laetare&rdquo;, and one version of the panunuluyan, composed by Witangcoy and which were and are still in use in Malolos, were written down by Juliano B. Velasco, bandmaster of the Banda Republika of Malolos, Bulacan which accompanied the singers in the performance of these playlets since the 1950s. These scores were commissioned by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G. Tiongson</strong></a> for his book <b><i>Kasaysayan at Estetika ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>Sinakulo</strong></a> at Ibang Dulang Panrelilhiyon ng Malolos</i></b> (History and Aesthetics of the Sinakulo and Other Religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a>s of Malolos), published by the Ateneo de Manila University Press in 1975. At that time, the original copies of the compositions of Maestro Asiong were in the care of his daughter Irene W. Cruz, who would lend out copies of the Maestro&rsquo;s masses to Luis Witangcoy Santos, a relative, so that these could be performed with a small orchestra and a group of singers on Christmas eve and other important religious festivities. The daughter also kept the Maestro&rsquo;s arrangements of musical pieces for the different instruments of the orchestra. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Nicanor G.

Having been influenced by the early 1990s rock band Razorback, Wolf Gemora (born Leslie Gemora) formed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\"><strong>Wolfgang</strong></a> together with guitarist Manuel Legarda. They recruited Basti Artadi (born Sebastian Artadi) as vocalist who was at that time with the band Sin City. Mon Legaspi completed the group as their bassist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The band released their album <b><i>Wolfgang</i></b> under Ivory Music, which reached platinum status in less than a year. Artadi, Gemora, and Legarda were individually nominated at the 1995 NU107 Rock Awards, where the band was also nominated as best new artist and best live act, while Legarda won as Guitarist of the Year. The second album titled <b><i>Semenelin</i></b>,<i> </i>1996, reached almost double platinum status (80,000 albums sold) released under Sony Music Entertainment Philippines. This album was named Album of the Year, and was released as an all-English version in the United States. <b><i>Wurm</i></b>,<i> </i>1997<i>, </i>the third album, reached platinum status. All songs in the album are composed in English and the album was released in Japan early in 1998. The fourth album <b><i>Serve in Silence </i></b>received nominations and awards as well, but did not achieve an international release. In 2000, Wolfgang released a live concert album <b><i>Acoustica</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>with their previous original songs arranged in the acoustic style. Their final album before going on hiatus was <b><i>Black Mantra</i></b>,<i> </i>2001<i>, </i>which included hits such as &ldquo;No Falter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bow Unto Thee.&rdquo; Among their other popular hits are &ldquo;Darkness Fell,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\"><strong>Halik</strong></a> ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>Hudas</strong></a>&rdquo; (Judas&rsquo;s Kiss), and &ldquo;Natutulog Kong Mundo&rdquo; (My Sleeping World)<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jan 2007, members of Wolfgang and Razorback performed at a reunion concert at the Music Museum. Basti Artadi, Mon Legaspi, and Manuel Legarda of the original line-up were present, but Wolf Gemora was unable to join because he had already migrated to the United States and was committed to his new California-based band Lokomotiv. In Dec 2008, Wolfgang, with Francis Aquino playing drums, released their sixth studio album <b><i>Villains </i></b>under Semenelin Music<i>. </i>Their seventh album <b><i>Ang Bagong Dugo sa Lumang Ugat </i></b>(The New Blood in the Old Vein) is produced in Tagalog and features the single &ldquo;Sandata&rdquo; (Weapon). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Cristina Maria P.

Tanauan, Batangas 23 Nov 1931 d. Hanover, Germany 1 Jul 2014. Conductor, violinist, teacher. His father, Alfredo Yatco of Tanauan was former governor of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation; his mother, Jacinta Flores of Alaminos, Laguna, graduated in piano from the Colegio de Santa Rosa in Intramuros. He was married to Brigitte Weld, a German, with whom he had three children, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta, Christine, and Marcela. Yatco was born to a family of musicians and music lovers.

After training at Juilliard School of Music in the United States under Ivan Galamian from 1948 to 1952, he went to Germany to study at the State Academy of Music in Munich under Wilhelm Stross from 1954 to 1960. In 1956, he won first prize in the Music Competition among all-German Music Academies. In 1958, he won second prize in the International Music Competition in Munich.

He established a new standard for symphonic music in the country. He tried to reach out to a wider audience by organizing school concerts and performances in Rizal Park. He also sought to professionalize symphonic music performance by instituting year-round salaries for orchestra members. In 1974, Yatco left once more for Germany with his family. Starting out as principal violist of the National Theater Orchestra in Mannheim, he worked his way up to the concertmaster&rsquo;s chair.

The band was founded by Fr Eliodoro Chico who produced the first generation of band musicians in Gapan during 1820s. Since then, the band has been an essential component in festive church celebrations during Christmas, Holy Week, elaborate Holy Mass, religious processions, and in civic events such as concerts and parades during fiestas. In the early days of the band&rsquo;s foundation, the bandmaster or maestro was nicknamed &ldquo;Damusak&rdquo; (tough) because he was very strict and exacting. They played mostly Spanish music during that time and musicians joined the band purposively to avoid <i>bataris</i> (forced labor), which constructed roads, bridges, churches, and schools as ordered by the Spanish colonial government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1860, the band was named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4235\"><strong>Zabat Band</strong></a> in honor of its new maestro Lorenzo Chico Zabat Sr. He was very active in leading the second generation of band members. The year 1900 saw the sons of Lorenzo Zabat leading the band&rsquo;s third generation, namely, Victorino, Mariano Sr, and Teodoro Garcia Zabat. With the cooperation of these brothers, the band progressed and gained the reputation of being an institution of learning music itself. Lorenzo Zabat died in 1932 and his grandsons led the fourth generation of musicians. They were the seven brothers: Lorenzo Jr, Mariano Jr, Eustaquio, Angel, Panfilo, Miguel, Marcelino ,and cousin Jaime Z. Parungao Sr, a cornet soloist. With the aid of their uncle Exequiel Zabat-Garcia, a composer and arranger, the Zabat Band and Orchestras became more popular in the country, winning several first prizes in competitions in Manila and the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1938, brothers Lorenzo, Mariano, and Eustaquio, including their cousin Jaime, passed the examinations and were admitted to the original <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a> in Manila. The Band sailed for the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco California, from January to May 1939, led by the famous Col Walter H. Loving and Capt Alfonso Fresnido.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the continuation of the fourth, fifth, and sixth generations of musicians, the Zabat Band and Orchestra managed to live with honor and respect. The succeeding band leaders were Homer, Danilo, and Enrique Zabat and their cousin Eduardo G. Parungao, all great grandsons of Lorenzo Zabat. With the noble devotion and selfless interest of the Zabat clan from 1820 up to the present time, the band continues to serve the various musical needs of local communities. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Rodney D.

Vienna, Austria 27 Apr 1904. d. Santa Monica, California, USA 21 Apr 1997. Symphony conductor. He was the son of Emil Zipper and Regine Westreich. His fiancee, Trudl Dubsky, a Viennese ballerina, fled to Manila where the two of them eventually married. Trudl Dubsky was one of the leading ballet teachers and choreographers in Manila. He was educated in Vienna, Austria, where he received an artist&rsquo;s diploma from the Vienna Academy of Music and Performing Arts and his doctorate degree from the University of Vienna. He was an opera and symphony conductor in Germany and Austria before World War II. He was imprisoned in the concentration camps in Dachau and Buchenwald in 1938. In Buchenwald, he recruited fellow inmates who had been in Munich and Vienna orchestras to give secret concerts to raise the morale of other prisoners. He escaped to France, had a short stint with the Theater Pigalle in Paris, then came to the Philippines in 1939 upon the invitation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4070\"><strong>Manila Symphony Society</strong></a>. He became the director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> and with the Japanese invasion in early 1942, he was imprisoned again, this time for refusing to conduct a symphony for the Japanese. Paul Cummins who wrote a 1992 biography of Zipper, <b><i>Dachau Song</i></b>, said that he hid the instruments just outside of town. When the Japanese were defeated in 1945, he conducted a celebratory concert of Betthoven&rsquo;s <b><i>Eroica</i></b> and Dvorak&rsquo;s New World symphonies in the ruins of Manila&rsquo;s Santa Cruz church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He succeeded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a> as music director of the Manila Symphony Orchestra and became director of the Academy of Music in Manila. From 1939 to 1970, he premiered in Manila such monumental works as Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>Requiem</i></b>, Beethoven&rsquo;s <b><i>Ninth Symphony</i></b>, Bach&rsquo;s <b><i>Magnificat</i></b>, and major works of Mahler and Brahms, among others. Zipper left for the United States in 1946, joined the music faculty at the New York New School for Social Research, 1947-53, and served as conductor of the Brooklyn Symphony Orchestra, 1949-50. In Chicago, from 1953 to 1967, he was director of the Music Center of the North Shore, and was at various times conductor of the Music Center Orchestra and Chicago Business Men&rsquo;s Orchestra, and music director of the Fine Arts Quartet Foundation. In 1965, he returned to the Far East, directing several musical and educational projects financed by the JDR III Fund in Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the Philippines, and guest conducting with the Taiwan Symphony and Seoul Philharmonic. In 1967 to 1972, he was executive director of the National Guild of Community Music Schools. He moved to Los Angeles in 1972 and became projects director of the School of Performing Arts of the University of Southern California (USC). He was director/conductor of the USC Orchestra for five years. Later, he was the artistic adviser of the Colburn School from 1980 to his death. He also managed the In School Concert Program, bringing orchestra to underprivileged children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before the World War II, Zipper did some compositions for Radio Vienna and various theaters in Vienna, and a comic opera, <b><i>Le Parapluie</i></b> (The Umbrella), for the Theatre Pigalle in Paris in 1939. In the United States, he published two volumes of <b><i>Choral Series</i></b> in New York and wrote articles for professional journals. For the past two decades, he had conducted concerts for children in the Los Angeles public school system and on 23 Apr 1996, he conducted his last concert. He is survived by a nephew, Henry Holt of Virginia and a niece, Lucy Horowitz of Boston. Two weeks before his death, Zipper was featured in a <b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b> article where he said that he realized in Dachau that the arts in general have the power to keep you not just alive, but to make your life meaningful even under the most dreadful circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the awards he had received were the Louis S. Weiss Prize of the New School for Social Research, 1954; Presidential Award Medal from the President of the Philippines, 1959; Award of the Immigrant Service League for Outstanding Achievements in the Field of Music in the Chicago area, 1962; Cross of Honor for Science and Art, First Class, by the President of the Republic of Austria, 1966; and Distinguished Service Award, National Guild of Community School of the Arts, 1975.

San Nicolas, Cebu City 28 Sep 1911. d. 9 Nov 1969. Composer, actor, radio personality. His father, Jesus Zubiri, was a Spaniard. His mother, a Cebuana, was Sergia Dacayana. She taught him to play the guitar at an early age. In Bohol, he met and later married Luz Butalid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Greg Bacua, a famous Cebuano writer and dramatic actor, discovered Zubiri&rsquo;s talents and asked him to participate in his plays, in which he eventually played major roles. Zubiri then joined the drama group of Toting Villarino and acted in the first Cebuano talking film by Piux Kabahar titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1122\"><strong>Bertoldo ug Balodoy</strong></a></i></b> produced by Hispano-Filipino productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zubiri was known for the songs &ldquo;Karon Ulahi Na&rsquo; (Now It&rsquo;s Too Late) and &ldquo;Ang Palad Nagbuot&rdquo; (Destiny Decides). The genesis for these songs can be traced back to pre-war Cebu when a beautiful girl who admired Zubiri caught his heart. The closeness was interrupted by Zubiri&rsquo;s sojourn in Manila to represent Cebu in the &ldquo;Amateur Hour&rdquo; national finals and also to record his songs with Victor Recording Studios. When World War II broke out, he went home to Cebu on the <i>Corregidor</i>, a passenger ship bound for the Visayas. The boat sank but Zubiri made it to Cebu together with other famous radio personalities like Antolin Alcudia, Suix Cabase, George Nator, and Maning Villareal. However, by the time he returned, the girl he loved was married, thus the titles of the songs above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During World War II, Zubiri joined the guerillas under Col Cushing. While with the resistance movement, Zubiri wrote the well-loved Cebuano song, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/942\"><strong>Matud Nila</strong></a>&rdquo; (So They Say), &ldquo;Ngano Bang Mipakita Ka&rdquo; (Why Did You Come), and &ldquo;Pukawon Ko Ikaw&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll Wake You Up). Well loved too were his &ldquo;Ikaduhang Bathala&rdquo; (Second God), &ldquo;Katulog na Inday&rdquo; (Sleep, Inday), &ldquo;Tuhoi&rdquo; (Believe), &ldquo;Pasayawa ko, Day&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Dance, Day), &ldquo;Mito-o Ako&rdquo; (I Believe) and &ldquo;Gugmang Gibati Ko&rdquo; (The Love I Feel).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war, Zubiri returned to the newly established radio station KZRC where he sang once more. He also became the director of musical programs such as <b><i>Haranista</i></b> (Serenader) and <b><i>Gabii sa Tirana</i></b> (Night of the Love Song). He also became the director of <b><i>Camay Theatre of the Air.</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1950, Zubiri managed the radio dramas of Philippine Manufacturing Corporation (PMC) starting with <b><i>Ligid sa Kapalaran</i></b> (Wheel of Life), a daily morning serial drama on radio and <b><i>Asa ka Inday?</i></b> (Where are You Inday?) which aired in the evenings. He also had other morning programs like <b><i>Sinugatan sa Bag-ong Adlaw</i></b> (Presents of a New Day) and <b><i>Mugrazu Time</i></b>. From 1951, Zubiri managed the long-running and record-breaking <b><i>PMC Amateur Hour</i></b> in Cebu, a one-hour weekly musical-variety show. Zubiri&rsquo;s management of the <b><i>PMC Amateur Hour</i></b>, under the pseudonym Iyo Karpo, made him an immediate household name. People crowded to hear his programs which were played in the plaza because the studio was too small to hold the audience. Zubiri&rsquo;s jokes entertained his listeners and his program also helped to find radio talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1955, he started another radio program <b><i>Pangutan-a Ako</i></b> (Ask Me), a program that responded to inquiries from the listeners. It was a successful DYRC program. He also worked on the weekly Darigold program and the television variety program <b><i>Channel 3 Presents</i></b> for three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later, Zubiri had his own television program with ABS titled <b><i>Ang Banay ni Iyo Karpo</i></b> (Iyo Karpo&rsquo;s Family). Then he also starred in the 30-minute radio program <b><i>Dear Iyo Karpo</i></b> and <b><i>Dahon nga Natagak</i></b> (Fallen Leaf), a radio serial under his direction. He was also recruited by Boie Laboratories to star in the DYSS drama <b><i>Langit ang Paghigugma</i></b> (Heaven is Love). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Hope Sabanpan-Yu</strong> </em></p>\r\n"
