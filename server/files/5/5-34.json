Its ancient Asian roots are still seen in highland and in lowland out-of-the-way barangays where indigenous cultures have thrived, despite Western influences that have seeped through the country&rsquo;s borders via technology and the people who constantly move between local and global spaces. In the urban areas, Hispanic, American, and other transnational influences are highly evident in the social, economic, and political aspects of life. Shaped by cross-cultural contacts with Western and non-Western traditions, Philippine music of today consists of several streams: indigenous, Hispanic-influenced, and the American- or transnational-influenced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>The Indigenous and Islamic Traditions and Transformations</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The so-called indigenous and Islamic-influenced traditions are practiced by about 14-17% of the total population of 100 million Filipinos, based on the 2014 Philippine Census. Around 33% of this group is represented by ethnolinguistic groups living in the mountains of northern Luzon, and 61% is in the islands of Mindanao and Sulu in southern Philippines. The rest live in Palawan and in the highlands of Mindoro in western Philippines.

They include the lip-valley <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>, pipe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/825\">reed pipe</a>, transverse flute, bamboo and shell trumpets, polychordal bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">zither</a>, parallel-stringed zither, bamboo mouth organ, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>, and the cylindrical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a>. Similar instruments are found throughout Southeast Asia. These instruments may be made of bamboo, shell, wood, skin, vine, hair, and other materials found in the tropics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, musical instruments peculiar only to the north are flat <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/805\">bamboo buzzers</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\">clappers</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/824\">quill-shaped percussion tubes</a>, and brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harps</a>. The presence of these types of instruments associates this tradition with continental Southeast Asia. Instruments found only in the south are a variety of bossed gongs, ring flutes, plank drums, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/831\">xylophones</a>, single-stringed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violins</a>, and suspended beams, which indicate links with Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and South China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Islamic music tradition in the south is part of the musical heritage of the pre-Islamic cultures of Mindanao. Thus, they share similar instruments as well as vocal forms. Instrumental music includes a gong ensemble consisting of a graduated set of 5 to 11 gongs laid in a row played with other larger gongs like the <b>agung</b>, <b>gandingan</b>, and percussion instruments like the drums or split bamboos. The combination of instruments in the ensemble varies among the different groups. Aside from these, there are suspended wide-rimmed bossed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>, two-stringed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lutes</a>, mouth harp, percussion beams, and bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/827\">slit drums</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The vocal repertoire is performed either in responsorial or solo manner. The singing style found among the northern groups differs from that of the south. The northern style uses a marked and rhythmic enunciation of vowels to form syllables or slides, half-speech sounds, and frequent pauses. By contrast, the southern style uses melisma, long phrases, a narrow range, fluid singing, and tremolo. A newer Islamic style superimposed on this tradition has a distinct vocal delivery, with a high tessitura, a strained voice of various timbres, and a nasal enunciation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An example of responsorial singing of the leader-chorus type is the Ibaloy <b>ba-diw</b>. It is used in ceremonies for the dead called <i>du-udyeng </i>or <i>ta-tamiya</i>, as well as on such occasions as weddings, <i>peshit</i> or anniversary feasts, and thanksgiving rituals. The leader-chorus singing is also employed by the Bontok during important feasts like the <i>chuno</i>, in celebration of a victory or <i>kay-aya</i>,<b> </b>or in a curing ritual like the <i>siyenga</i>.<b> </b>Among the Tagbanwa, one ceremony has a woman leader singing and dancing around jars of rice wine as she tries to communicate with the spirits. As she dances, a group of young girls follows her, and as she sings, the chorus repeats the last syllables of her lines. Another type of responsorial singing are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/796\">song debates</a> such as the Bukidnon <b>sala,</b> Kankanaey <b>day-eng</b>,<b> </b>and the Tagbanwa <b>taval-tavalan</b>. These debates, usually between a man and a woman, are about everyday topics, particularly love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">Epic songs</a> may be chanted at weddings or in gatherings to entertain guests, or may be simply used as evening entertainment for the villagers themselves. Epics may last for one or more nights and are attended with keen interest. Common among ethnic groups in the Philippines, epics describe the lives of heroes and gods. Some of these are the Ata <b><i>Tulalang</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the Blaan <b><i>Aflulok</i></b>,<i> </i>the Bukidnon <b><i>Olaginon </i></b>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1831\"><b><i>Agyu</i></b></a>,<b> </b>the Ifugao <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1877\"><b><i>Hudhud</i></b></a>,<i> </i>the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1878\"><b><i>Hinilawod</i></b></a>,<b><i> </i></b>the Maguindanao <b><i>Raja Madaya</i></b>, the Maranao <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the Mandaya <b><i>Daut</i></b>,<i> </i>the Mangguagan <b><i>Tad-um</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the Manobo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1974\"><b><i>Ulahingan</i></b></a>,<b> <i>Agyu</i></b>,<i> </i>and<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><strong>Tuwaang</strong></a></b></i>,<i> </i>the Mansaka <b><i>Manggob</i></b>,<i> </i>the Subanon <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1962\"><strong>Ag Tobig nog Keboklagan</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>and<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1940\"><b>Keg Sumba neg <strong>Sandayo</strong></b></a></i>,<i> </i>the Tboli <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1966\"><b><i>Tudbulol</i></b></a>,<i> </i>the Tagbanwa <b><i>Dumarakol</i></b>,<i> </i>and the Tiruray <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1848\"><b><i>Berinarew</i></b></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Solo songs are sung for all kinds of occasions. They may be accompanied by instruments and/or dancing. Generally, there is no generic term for song&mdash;only names of particular song genres. Among the Kalinga, the <b>dango</b>,<b> ading</b>,<b> </b>and <b>oggayam </b>song genres are traditional in important ceremonies like peace pacts, weddings, and community gatherings. They are used to express a declaration, greeting, or statement related to the occasion. The Maranao <b>bayok </b>is usually sung at weddings and festivities. The singers are specialists who become the center of attraction in social gatherings where, as protagonists, they vie with each other in extemporizing allusions and double meanings, much to the delight of their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs in connection with life-cycle events abound among all groups. Most common are lullabies like the Tiruray <b>ambay</b>,<b> </b>the Sama <b>ngindung</b>,<b> </b>the Palawan <b>linggayen pa iga</b>,<b> </b>the Maranao <b>bomboman</b>,<b> </b>the Mansaka <b>uyug-uyug</b>,<b> </b>the Manobo <b>buwa-buwa</b>,<b> </b>the Maguindanao <b>sengal</b>,<b> </b>the Bugkalot (Ilongot) <b>emaga</b>,<b> </b>the Ibaloy <b>tami</b>,<b> </b>the Blaan <b>yadadang</b>,<b> </b>and the Aeta <b>adiyadi</b>.<b> </b>Some groups have special songs to accompany rituals for children such as the Kalinga <b>dopdopit</b>,<i> </i>sung on the first bath of the child outside the house. During the Subanon circumcision ritual <i>khundit</i>,<i> </i>the <i>baylan </i>(shaman)<i> </i>chants the <b>manambay</b>.<b> </b>The Kalinga sing the <b>dinnayan, dawak</b>, and <b>paliwat</b> during an <i>egam </i>ritual, which celebrates the rite of passage from boyhood to manhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most numerous of the life cycle songs are those sung during courtship and marriage ceremonies. In Sagada, young Bontok boys sing the <b>tigtigaddo</b> when visiting girls in their sleeping house. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2331\">Ata Manobo</a> maiden of Davao del Norte sings the <b>uranda</b> to her swain, and he in turn sings the <b>kumapuy</b> to his beloved. Manobo courtship songs called <b>sangong-sangong</b> are often accompanied by an instrument: the <b>saluray</b><i>,</i> <b>kugot</b>, or <b>kitara</b>. Courting songs of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2368\">Zambales Ayta</a> are called <b>awara</b>. In Negros Oriental, the Negrito love song is called <b>balak</b>. The Palawan <b>kulilal</b> is a love song accompanied by the <b>pagang</b><i>.</i> Wedding feasts are celebrated with much music making. There are songs which form part of the ceremony such as the <i>sapo</i><b> </b>and <i>ayyeng</i> of the Kankanaey. The Kalinga sing the <b>sugsugna</b> to express gratitude to the couple. In the south, the Manobo sing the <b>pamada</b> (introduction) at a wedding and the <b>pamal-i kagum</b> as a wedding ceremony speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Death is an occasion for extolling the departed through song. The Bontok have special songs for the dead. The <b>didiyaw</b> expresses grief and is a prayer for a good afterlife for a small child, while the <b>fulayao</b> recalls the good deeds of the newly departed. This genre is similar to the <b>day-eng</b> of the Kankanaey of Benguet, which eulogizes the dead. The Kalinga sing the <b>dassar</b> before the burial of a murdered person so that vengeance for the murderer will take place sooner. Manobo mourning songs are the <b>dalinday</b>, <b>tud-um,</b> and <b>diaga</b>. At the funeral, they sing the <b>tamandag</b> in the presence of a <em>baylan</em> so as not to attract evil spirits. On a death anniversary, the Subanon sing the <b>bahay-bahay</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Occupational songs abound among the different groups. These are sung in connection with farming, fishing, or doing simple chores. Particularly numerous are songs connected with the rice planting and harvesting cycle. The Mandaya sing the <b>indowan</b> to call people to plant rice. While working in the field, the Bontok sing the <b>ayoweng</b>. To protect the field from pests, the Kankanaey sing the <b>soswa</b>. Harvest songs by the Manobo are the <b>layad-layad</b> and <b>balutuking</b>. In the north, the Ifugao and Kalinga sing the <b>liwliwa</b> and <b>sugiyaw/owayat</b> in thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest. The <b>tiyasha</b> is a Bontok rice-pounding song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Special rituals with corresponding music are performed for various purposes. There are rituals for curing the sick such as the Subanon <i>khundit</i> where the <em>manambay</em> is chanted. The Bontok chant the <b>kapya</b>; the Ibaloy, the <b>angba</b>; the Ifugao, the <b>mangolhod</b>; and the Bugkalot (Ilongot), the <b>bariling</b> to ask the spirits to cure illnesses. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2329\">Agusanon Manobo</a>, the voice emitted from the ritual specialist medium called babaylan in a curing ritual called <i>hinang</i> is perceived to be that of the guardian spirit. The chant is called tud-om. Rituals are also performed for thanksgiving such as the Aeta <i>diniwata</i> or the Batak <i>didayu</i>; for weddings, such as the Blaan <i>andaray</i> and <i>bansula</i>; for blessing a new house, as in the Bontok <i>sabosab</i>; for victory, like the Ibaloy <i>bindayan</i>; for war, as in the Ifugao <i>chajang</i>; for the datu (chieftain), like the Manobo <i>dumalongdong</i>; or for seeking special favors, as in the Subanon <i>somodiot</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Muslim tradition, the celebration of important feasts such as the visits of dignitaries or the inauguration of new officials are lavish affairs which include the participation of epic singers invited from different parts of the province, several instrumental ensembles, and dancers. Parts of the Quran are sung, and gongs are played during weddings. On the other hand, no instrumental music is played during the religious celebrations of Ramadan, the birth of Muhammad, or the Friday noon service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Traditions and Transformations</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1521 the travel of Ferdinand Magellan, who reached the Philippines by chance while in search of an alternative trade route, marked an important watershed in the Westernization of the world, which has resulted in what is known today as globalization. This eventually led to the Spanish colonization and Christianization of the country, and it planted the seeds of European harmonic music, which was totally unknown to Asia at that time. In over 300 years, from 1565 to 1898, these seeds took shape and produced religious music both connected to and outside the liturgy of the Catholic Church; secular music from Europe and even a European type of music that was developed by Filipinos; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk songs</a>; and music of string and brass ensembles. These forms and types of music took hold of every segment of the society, from the rural villages to the urban centers of the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early Spanish missionary contacts, the importance placed by the religious orders on music sprang from the belief that music was a most powerful means to win the spirit of a people and make them understand Christian ways and beliefs. The friars were given special musical training in Spain before coming to the Philippines. Among the friars who taught music from late 16th to 18th centuries were the Franciscans San Pedro Bautista, who was assigned to Lumban, Laguna in 1586; Juan de Santa Marta, who arrived in 1606; Geronimo Aguilar, who arrived in 1582; and arriving two centuries after, Jose de la Virgen, who composed a treatise on plain chant in the Bikol language in 1727 which is now lost. From the 18th to 19th centuries, the Augustinians had musician-priests like Lorenzo Castello, Juan Bolivar, and Manuel de Arostegui.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Augustinian church in Intramuros produced noted Filipino musicians like Marcelo de San Agustin in the 17th century, who is the first <i>indigeno</i> (native) named in historical sources to have composed music in the Western idiom (Irving 2010, 172-3). From mid-18th century, the Dominican <i>santuario</i> San Juan del Monte produced a set of devotional hymns in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/799\">villancico</a> form, one of which had a text in Tagalog. This manuscript is doubly significant;&nbsp;not only is it the first extant evidence of local compositional production in the country, but also the mixing of Western melody and vernacular text as seen in the manuscript is inaugural. From that period up to the early 19th century, choir books of cowhide parchment containing collections of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/783\">liturgical music</a> had been preserved in a number of churches around the country, a good example of which was that from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon, Bohol</a>. By late 19th century, noted church music composers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Marcelo Adonay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3926\">Jose Canseco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\">Pedro Navarro</a>, with the latter two also active as maestros of military bands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Throughout the islands, the Church and its clergy had a commanding impact on the musical life of Christianized Filipinos. The clergy&rsquo;s sociopolitical influence, backed by the colonial policy of unity between Church and State, extended to the secular sphere. Many secular priests founded town bands and had the power to decide on how a fiesta, both a sacred and profane event, was to be celebrated. There was even a native priest named Fr&nbsp;Jose Zamora, who translated a fundamental music theory tutor book in Tagalog in 1888. The first and only book of its kind in Philippine history, it could be understood as an intervention made by a civic-minded clergy who felt that the islands lacked musically literate citizens and musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New forms of Latin-influenced extraliturgical and secular folk music emerged from the cross-cultural encounters between Hispanic and local Philippine cultures. These became part of Philippine lowland music culture, particularly outside of towns and cities. Today, these folk traditions and practices in Catholic rituals and celebrations are still vigorously practiced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the start of the liturgical year, during advent, carolers roam the town streets, serenading households in the tradition called <b>pastores </b>in Bicol, <b>tambora</b> in Cuyo, and <b>daigon</b> in the Visayas. An elaborate outdoor folk drama variously called <i>panunuluyan</i>, <i>pananawagan</i>, and <i>pananapatan</i> in the Tagalog areas, and <i>kagharong</i> in Bicol reenacts, in sung dialogue and on the streets, Mary and Joseph&rsquo;s search for a lodging in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve. The Lenten season is the occasion for the <b>pabasa</b> or the chanting of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><i>pasyon</i></a>, the versified story of the life and passion of Jesus Christ. In May, the <i>flores de Mayo</i>, a procession in honor of the Blessed Virgin, is held and adults and children sing popular songs and hymns. Before the procession, while flowers are offered at the foot of the Virgin&rsquo;s altar, the <b>salve</b>,<b> loa</b>, <b>saludo</b>, and <b>despedida</b> in the 19th-century romantic idiom are sung. Also in May, the <i>santacruzan</i> features songs during the procession for the Santa Cruz. In Siquijor in southern Philippines, the <i>sinulog</i> is a dance ritual that recalls the fight between Christians and Moors, with the Christians emerging victorious through the intercession of Santiago. In the Bicol region, the <b>kristianong turog</b> is sung during the <i>aurora</i>&mdash;dawn processions celebrating a good harvest or a thanksgiving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important school in the mid-18th century was the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples de la Santa Iglesia Catedral where many future Filipino musicians received their training in solfeggio, vocalization, and playing of instruments. By the last half of the 19th century, the school had adopted a curriculum patterned after that of the Conservatory of Madrid. Some of the Catedral&rsquo;s teachers that time were well-known Spanish composers like Apolonio and Remigio Calahorra. Products of this school included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3993\">Antonio Garcia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4177\">Simplicio Solis</a>, Salvador Pi&ntilde;on, Hipolito Rivera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4198\">Fulgencio Tolentino</a>, Jose Muezo, Antonio Escamilla, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4176\">Bernabe Solis</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Further and systematic instruction in Western secular music was given in schools for the children of the native elite. In boys&rsquo; colleges in the 19th century, music was taught as part of a number of subjects that included philosophy, physics, and metaphysics. At the Universidad de Santo Tomas, Colegio de San Jose, and the Ateneo de Manila, students had the opportunity to take up advanced studies in European arts and sciences. Similarly, young girls, especially after the educational reforms in basic education in 1863, were taught instrumental music, particularly the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a>, especially in the girls&rsquo; colleges like Colegio de Santa Rosa, Colegio de Santa Isabel, Colegio de la Concordia, and Colegio de Santa Catalina. In addition, other Filipinos got a Western music education beginning in the 1890s from a number of private music academies that were often staffed by successful local or visiting foreign musicians who also gave private lessons in solf&eacute;ge, singing, piano, and violoncello. Notable among them were Spanish musician Oscar Camps y Soler and singers Enrico Capozzi, Santino Coppa, Ciro Cavalieri, and Vincenzo Gambardella. The products of such an education became the admirers of European music as performed by Filipino and visiting European artists. Europeanized in taste and manners, the elite group organized art societies, patronized concerts and operas, or played host to <i>tertulias</i> (soirees) in their homes where poetry and music formed part of the evening fare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The circulation of printed sheet music, thanks to the lithographic print production technology like that introduced in Manila in the middle of the 19th century, could not have generated interest without these educational institutions that ensured the formation of urbane Hispanic colonial subjects who understood and were capable of producing the Western forms and styles of music. Printed sheet music, either for piano solo or for melody with piano accompaniment, was therefore principally marketed to this educated sector in Philippine society. They were the consumers who bought sheet music and other instrumental music collections from stores on Escolta like La Lira Almacen de Musica and La Estrella del Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important music publication of the last half of 19th century was Diego Perez&rsquo;s piano medley <b><i><strong>Recuerdo</strong>s de Filipinas y Sus Cantares</i></b> (Memories of the Philippines and Its Songs) (1886), which paraphrased Philippine folk songs and dances. By the 1890s, a local print music industry had already produced notable publications such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\">Julio Nakpil</a>&rsquo;s piano music in various styles and the ever-popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">kundiman</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/909\">&ldquo;Jocelynang Baliwag&rdquo;</a> (Jocelyna of Baliwag), which is believed to have circulated in this form in 1896 among the Filipino revolutionaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Numerous instrumental groups performed actively, particularly in the second half of the 19th century. These included orchestras, bands, <b>comparza</b>, and <b>rondalla</b>. Orchestras in Manila included the San Juan del Monte Orchestra, Oriental Orchestra, Marikina Orchestra, Rizal Orchestra, and Molina Orchestra, and they often had the same members but different conductors. As early as 1885, a musicians&rsquo; union, Union Artistica Musical, was already in place, indicating the burgeoning cultural life of Manila. It had in its mandate the code of conduct that stipulated regularized fees for their engagements. Filipino musicians skilled in western idioms found themselves in great demand. Some musicians were contracted in the 1880s to augment the size of the Shanghai Municipal Band. By the end of 19th century, a number were performing in Singapore. Back home, these musicians were members of orchestras that played for solemn masses during church feasts in both Intramuros and the churches in the <i>arrabales</i> (outlying districts) like Quiapo, Santa Cruz, Binondo, San Sebastian, San Miguel, Pandacan, and San Juan del Monte. The orchestras also assisted visiting opera and zarzuela companies, performing the overtures and the intermezzi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From mid-19th century to around the 1930s, a music concert would have presented a mixed program such as the one performed at the Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol de Sibacon in the mid-19th century, which consisted of a <b>sinfonia</b> arranged by Frances Doce Uno; a dance intermission by the best students of Maestro Appiani; a comic skit by Don Ramon Valladores y Saavedra; and two songs in Spanish by a Se&ntilde;ora Ojeda. Other program favorites were popular arias by Rossini, Thomas, Auber, and Waldteufel. The performance of a complete symphony or the concept of modern concert programming where large-scale works were presented did not occur until the American period, notably when the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a> began giving concerts in 1926 under the Viennese-trained conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 19th century, Western music was also played by the prestigious regimental bands. Their performances of band music at the Luneta were received with great enthusiasm by the public and praised even by European visitors. As mentioned, almost every town had a brass band outside Manila, with some towns having two or more. The bands participated in town fiesta celebrations, which lasted for three or more days. They started playing in the early morning, marching through all the streets. A major function was to play in processions in which religious images of saints in elaborately decorated carriages were paraded through the major streets of the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A popular ensemble was the rondalla, a group of plucked or picked stringed instruments made up of a <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/804\">bandurria</a></strong>,<b> piccolo bandurria</b>, <b>laud</b>, <b>octavina</b>, <b>bandola</b>,<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>,<b> </b>and bass. This ensemble was most likely inspired by similar popular music ensembles in Spain from the mid-19th century, though the bandurria itself may have predated this, having reached Philippine shores during the time of the galleon trade with Mexico (1565-1815). Though not as widespread as the brass bands, the rondalla nevertheless enjoyed a certain following. Today, there is a resurgence of interest in the rondalla, and many elementary and high schools have their own groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A favorite solo instrument from the mid-19th century onwards was the piano. In Manila, pianos by Pleyel Wolff, Steinway and Sons, M.F. Rachals, Grotian Steinway, and Winklemann adorned the spacious living rooms of the rich. Many upright pianos found their way into the smaller towns in Luzon and the Visayas. Visitors to the Philippines in the first half of the 19th century wrote that the piano and the harp were the most common instruments encountered in homes. Almost all young ladies were taught the piano or harp, which they were asked to play to entertain visitors at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila audiences were strongly attracted to opera presentations, particularly those presented by visiting European companies. Eventually, arias from famous operas like <b><i>Aida</i></b>,<b><i> Tosca</i></b>, <b><i>La Traviata</i></b>,<b><i> Rigoletto</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i><strong>Lucia</strong> di Lammermoor </i></b>were heard in Philippine households where they were sung, played on the piano, or whistled by both young and old, masters and servants alike. In 1902, the first Filipino opera, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\"><strong>Sangdugong Panaguinip</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), was composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a>, with libretto in Spanish by Pedro Paterno translated to Tagalog by Roman Reyes. It was followed by two more, <b><i>Magdapio</i></b> and <b><i>Ang Gayuma</i></b> (Love Potion), with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2817\">Alejo Carluen</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The same audience that graced the opera also attended the zarzuela, which were plays with music and dance. The Spanish zarzuela was introduced to the Philippines through the performance of <b><i>Jugar con Fuego </i></b>(Playing with Fire) by the troupe of Dario Cespedes at the Teatro de Novedades in Arroceros, Manila in 1879. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2865\">Alejandro Cubero</a>, who came to the Philippines in 1880, is credited for having trained native artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2823\">Jose Carvajal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3274\">Venancia Suzara</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3276\">Patrocinio Tagaroma</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2936\">Praxedes Julia Fernandez</a>&nbsp;in the Spanish zarzuela. Eventually, Filipino playwrights wrote the native <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><b>sarsuwela</b></a><i>.</i><b> </b>Vernacular sarsuwela, the first documented of which was the Tagalog <b><i>Budhing Nagpahamak</i></b> (Tragic Conscience), ca 1890, appeared in Pampanga, Cebu, Bicol, Pangasinan, Ilocos, and the Tagalog provinces in the early 1900s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In rural areas, folk dramas which had music flourished even before the advent of the zarzuela and opera. These included the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a>,<b> </b>the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><i>sinakulo</i></a>,<b> </b>and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\"><i>karilyo</i></a>.<b> </b>The komedya, a drama in verse which depicted the conflict between Christians and Moors, had entrances, exits, duels, and fight scenes accompanied by music that was made up of stock pieces or music that was popular or in vogue. First performed in open spaces, these stylized dramas eventually made their way to the stages of more formal theaters. In Manila, several theaters specialized in the presentation of the komedya: the Teatro Comico, Teatro Lirico de Tondo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3293\">Teatro de Binondo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sinakulo,<b><i> </i></b>a passion play staged during Holy Week, was performed in town plazas or church patios, attracting an audience that traveled by cart or on foot from outlying barrios. The traditional sinakulo found in Tagalog, Pampango, and Bicol provinces had chanted dialogue and marches performed by local bands. The <b>carillo<i> </i></b>was introduced to Manila in the latter part of the 19th century by Navarro de Peralta. It was a shadow play using cardboard figures whose shadows were projected by a lamp on a white screen. Deriving its themes from European medieval tales and legends, the carillo was also performed to occasional music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from stage plays, other native musical forms, songs, and dances utilizing European idioms emerged. Some of these forms were the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\">jota</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/777\">habanera</a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/72\"><strong>mazurka</strong></a>, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/789\">polka</a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><b>kumintang</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a>,<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/770\">balse</a></b>, <b>danza menor</b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\"><b>pandanggo</b></a>, and <b>basultu</b>.<b> </b>The music of these songs and dances were in major and minor tonalities, with simple harmonic progressions and usually in binary form.

Of the kundiman, the so-called &ldquo;Kundiman ng Himagsikan&rdquo; (Kundiman of the Revolution) or &ldquo;Jocelynang Baliwag&rdquo; was the most popular. The steady but stimulating rhythm of marches invigorated the fighting temper of the revolutionaries, while the melancholic funeral marches written for fallen heroes kindled their deep-seated yearning for freedom. The most popular march played during the revolution was &ldquo;Alerta Katipunan&rdquo; (Katipunan, Alert), which was originally a Spanish march adapted by the Katipunero for their own use. Moving funeral marches composed by Julio Nakpil were &ldquo;Pahimakas&rdquo; (Last Farewell), written for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, and &ldquo;Sue&ntilde;o Eterno&rdquo; (Eternal Sleep), a eulogy for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\">Antonio Luna</a>. But Nakpil is most remembered for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/940\">&ldquo;Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan&rdquo;</a> (Noble Hymn of the Tagalog Region) which was written upon request of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> who wanted a national anthem. However, after Bonifacio&rsquo;s defeat by Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s cohorts, it was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\">Julian Felipe</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/902\">&ldquo;Marcha Nacional&rdquo;</a> that eventually became the national anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Tradition and Transformations</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The three centuries of Hispanic musical influence gave way to the colonial ideologies and norms introduced by the Americans from 1901 to 1946. Through the new system of public education established in early 1900s, American teachers introduced the singing of Philippine songs in Western style as well as other hymns and simple tunes from Europe and America&mdash;all in English. These songs became known to children all over the archipelago, including areas not reached by the Spanish-period teachers such as the Cordilleras in the north and the Muslim provinces in the south.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the tertiary level, a number of music schools, variously referred to as conservatories or departments of music in colleges, were formally organized such as those of St Scholastica&rsquo;s College founded in 1906; Centro Escolar de Se&ntilde;oritas, 1907; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>, 1912; Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, 1925; and Santa Isabel College, which re-opened in 1930. The most comprehensive music institution, however, was the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music, which opened in 1916. The proposal for this conservatory was made in 1914 by Senator Joaquin Luna, the brother of the violinist and conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4054\">Manuel Luna</a>, and the scientist and soldier Gen Antonio Luna. Patterned after European conservatories, its curriculum included special studies in piano, music theory, harmony, counterpoint, orchestration, and composition. Gradually, studies in other instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, woodwinds, and brasses were added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These schools produced singers and instrumentalists, some of whom extended their operatic and concert careers to principal cities of Europe and the United States. Among these schools, though, the UP Conservatory of Music produced the most number of composers, many of whom also became leading figures in Philippine music: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4008\">Juan de Sahagun Hernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4084\">Antonio J.

Comprising the first generation of UP-trained Filipino composers, they wrote music in Western classical forms and idioms. Most of their instrumental works were inspired and influenced by the European romantic literature of Liszt, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and the works of the nationalist schools in Russia, Bohemia, and Scandinavia. Late 19th-century European music provided models of works with distinctive thematic materials and programmatic character&mdash;two elements that served as vehicles for the expression of nationalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1920s, these UP composers wrote large-scale Western music genres like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\">concertos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\">sonatas</a>, tone poems, overtures, and symphonies, though the first Filipino to have written a complete symphony in 1928, titled <b><i>Filipinas</i></b>, was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3979\">Jose A. Estella</a>, who belonged to the generation before Abelardo and Santiago. All of them took musical materials from Filipino folk and popular music genres so that their works could all be construed as embodiments of nationalism, the ideology that was dominant at that time, especially among intellectuals of the period in the UP Conservatory of Music. Examples of compositions in classical forms were Abelardo&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Concerto</strong> in B-flat Minor,</i></b> 1923; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3942\">Rodolfo S. Cornejo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sonata for Violin and Piano,</i></b> 1932; Jose Estella&rsquo;s <b><i>Ultimo Adios Symphonic Poem,</i></b> 1927; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Concert Overture</i></b>, 1930; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Taga-ilog Symphony, </i></b>1938. Even Alexander Lippay, the Viennese-trained director of the said institution between 1925 and 1930, appropriated local materials in his symphonic variations in the late 1920s that were performed by the Manila Symphony Orchestra. But most significant during this period was the elevation of local genres into an art form, as exemplified by the kundiman. Familiar with both the art music of Europe and the folk music of the Philippines, Abelardo and Santiago carefully wedded music and words, in effect creating a refined music composition that qualified as an artistic expression known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\">art song</a> kundiman. Performed by such artists as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\">Jovita Fuentes</a>, a soprano whose career in the 1920s caught the attention of major European opera composers, these works became part of the national repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of research, nationalism compelled historicism and motivated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5089\">Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as</a> and scholar Alfredo Roa to document Philippine music history, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a> published his important book on organology and the classification of vocal music, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1030\"><strong>Filipino Musical Instruments and Airs of Long Ago</strong></a></i></b>. During the school summer breaks of the early 1930s, field research documentations of Philippine folk dances were undertaken by Francisca Reyes-Tolentino, Antonino Buenaventura, and Ramon Tolentino. The materials were later published and circulated as textbooks for use in physical education classes in the schools. Reyes-Tolentino&rsquo;s books of dances, including the accompanying music recorded in the field by Buenaventura as well as his own compositions for some dances became canonic in the ensuing decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside the academe, the American colonial period was mainly characterized by the rapid ascendance of popular culture, which, it must be emphasized, had already been on the rise during the last quarter of the 19th century as a result of increasing world trade. As has already been noted, the popularization of Philippine folk music was made possible by the lithographic technology begun in late 1850s, catering to the few colonialists and literate criollos and mestizos living in urban areas. The production of sheet music continued in the American period and accelerated when a new generation of American-educated Filipino composers such as Nicanor S. Abelardo and Francisco Santiago published their kundiman and danza. Another printed kundiman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3958\">Constancio de Guzman</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo;</a> (My Country), has become the most famous Filipino song of all time after the national anthem. Popularized by sarsuwela star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\">Atang</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\"> de la Rama</a>, the song has been sung at rallies by workers and peasants. Aside from sheet music, the mechanical reproduction technology that produced audio recordings helped popularize Philippine music during the American period. Business enterprises with investments from French company Pathe, then American Victor and Columbia, and later German Odeon, recorded then sold Philippine music, whether folk songs, art songs, or songs from the sarsuwela, as commodities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American colonial period, the semiclassical traditions consisted of music for theater, particularly from the sarsuwela, together with folk songs, rondalla music, and band music. Composers appropriated western music conventions to write for genres that were unique to the Philippines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4198\">Fulgencio Tolentino</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></i></b> (No Wounds), 1902; Jose Estella and Severino Reyes&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipinas para los Filipinos </i></b>(The Philippines for the Filipinos), 1905; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></i></b> (Country Maiden), 1919, represent the popularity of sarsuwela in the first decade of the 1900s. With the screening of the first Filipino sound film in 1933, the establishment of the major film studios from 1933 onwards, and the rise of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a> in the 1920s, the sarsuwela began to lose its audience in the theaters. Coopting the form, Filipino film producers now either adapted the existing popular sarsuwela to film (i.e., filmed sarsuwela) in productions such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b> or commissioned sarsuwela originally created for film (i.e., sarsuwela films) such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></a></i></b> (My Beloved), 1939, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4170\">Juan Silos</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4170\"> Jr</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\">Ariston Avelino</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At this time, the research and popularization of traditional folk songs in the native languages was in vogue. Norberto Romualdez reprinted folk songs such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/878\">&ldquo;Comintang de la Conquista&rdquo;</a> (Comintang of the Conquest) and &ldquo;Cachucha&rdquo; in the <b><i>Progressive Music Series</i></b> anthology used in most schools. The proliferation of rondalla groups prompted the creation of many adaptations of folk songs such as &ldquo;Lawiswis Kawayan&rdquo; (Sounds of Bamboo) and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\">&ldquo;Paruparong Bukid&rdquo;</a> (Country Butterfly). Band music came in many forms such as overtures and marches. Examples of works for band were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4098\">Pedro Navarro</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Olimpia,&rdquo; 1925, and Antonio Escamilla&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philippine Airs,&rdquo; 1927.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the sales of another American consumer item&mdash; the radio&mdash;in the 1930s, American jazz and Tin Pan Alley songs were heard alongside local Filipino music which refused to surrender to American cultural domination. This American popular music eventually shaped the production and broadcast of Filipino popular music, which later became the preferred music of the Filipino masses. Early radio hits included &ldquo;Singing in the Rain,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Magic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Dreams.&rdquo; Much of the aired music consisted of recordings of Filipino singers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a> and Bimbo Danao singing American-style pop music and the songs were sometimes performed live in the studio, accompanied by radio orchestras such as the Lux Orchestra. Some of these orchestras were organized for radio stations like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4867\">KZEG</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\">KZIB</a>, and KZRM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, live entertainment bodabil, the local rendering of vaudeville&mdash;a variety show that included American or American-inspired pop songs, dances, comedy skits, and even circus acts&mdash;offered an alternative to sarsuwela and formal concerts of classical music. Bodabil was performed in theaters like the Manila Grand Opera and later, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>. In 1921, the first bodabil company was established by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">&ldquo;Borromeo Lou&rdquo;</a> (Luis Borromeo), an entertainer who had seen such groups in the United States. Bodabil competed with dance halls like cabarets, where bigger live orchestras directed by highly skilled Filipino musicians found work. It featured dances in styles such as the fox-trot, swing, charleston, cakewalk, and tango. Foreign and local songs were also presented in productions and skits with titles like &ldquo;April Showers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blue Hawaii,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Magandang Juaning&rdquo; (Beautiful Juaning). Juan Silos Jr continued to propagate Filipino rondalla music, with his daughters (aka the SSS Trio) singing arranged folk songs, while Katy de la Cruz sang bodabil songs like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\">Balut</a>&rdquo; (Duck Egg). Light classical composers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4221\">Manuel Velez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\">Santiago Suarez</a> composed their balitaw and danza for this theatrical form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a brief yet sudden reversal of fate, American domination would be drastically erased in favor of an anti-Western rhetoric from 1942 to 1945&mdash;a four-year period known popularly as the &ldquo;Japanese Occupation.&rdquo; Propagandistic songs commissioned by the Japanese military government, such as &ldquo;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Filipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines) by Felipe Padilla de Leon Jr, were composed and performed in public, alongside Japanese nationalistic hymns such as &ldquo;Nippon Zyunkyosya no Uta&rdquo; (Hymn of Japanese Martyrdom) and &ldquo;Umi Yukada&rdquo; (Yukada Sea). Public entertainment was censored, and only shows that did not carry associations with American culture were allowed. Despite the enforced Japanese cultural, political, and economic agendas, Japanese occupation in the country did not leave a lasting effect on Filipino culture, for after the country was &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; from the Asian aggressors, the Filipinos returned to their preferred music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>The Period of the Republics </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, the third Philippine republic witnessed a period of national and cultural reconstruction. The capitalist political economic structure specially favoring the country&rsquo;s colonial master, the United States, and the usual rule of the few were reestablished. It was the resumption of the social clout of the few property-owning ruling class that was contested by the underground peasant movement, which believed in a socialist vision of property relations, and this set the stage for the burgeoning of protest songs in the 1950s. There was a resurgence in the singing of these as well as newer protest songs in the 1970s and 1980s with the student activist movement and the reestablishment of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The middle and upper classes who were allied to the United States upheld the status quo both politically and culturally. In the realm of classical music, many composers of the period continued to compose and perform western-type forms. The audiences for concertos, symphonic poems, and suites thrived in the 1950s. Classical music stood firm as a symbol of stability and marked the return to the old system of social hierarchy. In this decade, active concertizing was done by the Manila Symphony Orchestra under the Jewish-American conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\">Herbert Zipper</a>, and by middle class Filipino conductors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\">Luis Valencia</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4150\">Redentor Romero</a>, the last two of whom would perform well into the 1980s. Noted classical musicians of the period were pianists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3968\">Nena del Rosario</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\">Regalado Jose</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4201\">Benjamin Tupas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4141\">Reynaldo Reyes</a>; singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3953\">Fides Cuyugan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3978\">Aurelio Estanislao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4133\">Irma Potenciano</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4193\">Luisa &ldquo;Isang&rdquo; Tapales</a>; and instrumentalists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\">Sergio Esmilla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\">Oscar Yatco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4052\">Carmencita Lozada</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\">Basilio Manalo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1955, four important national music organizations were put up. These were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</a>, a grant-giving government agency in support of artists headed by Jovita Fuentes; the Philippine Music Educators Group with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4111\">Eliseo Pajaro</a> as chair; the National Band Association led by Felipe de Leon Sr; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4039\">League of Filipino Composers</a>. The last organization underscored the importance of developing a Filipino classical repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some representative works of composers during this period were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3848\">Rosalina Abejo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Pagtubos </i></b>(Redemption), oratorio, and <b><i>Thanatopsis</i></b>,<i> </i>symphony;<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3914\">Alfredo S.

A number of these compositions won the Republic Cultural Heritage Award, which was then the main form of recognizing Filipino creativity in the field of music from the 1950s to the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Idiomatically, these compositions were written in the tonal language of the late 19th-century European classical music, in different degrees of sophistication. Modern methods of composition, however, were also formally adopted in the works of those who studied abroad in the 1950s and 1960s, many of them under American government scholarships. American neoclassicism strongly influenced the music of Eliseo M. Pajaro and Lucrecia R. Kasilag, while the French avant-garde movement provided <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4056\">Jose Maceda</a> structural models by which to realize new concepts derived from non-Western musical traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose Maceda, who was a concert pianist before World War II, turned maverick in the 1950s to begin his career as an ethnomusicologist. He published his analysis of Sagada songs, collaborated with eminent American anthropologist Harold Conklin from Yale University in studying Hanunuo Mangyan music, and ended up doing fieldwork on a dissertation on Maguindanaon music in 1963. Maceda is considered the &ldquo;Father of Musicology&rdquo; in the Philippines, for the kind of empirical knowledge he produced on Philippine music was unprecedented at the national level as he explored both indigenous and acculturated Philippine music. An offshoot of his research was the institutionalization of courses on indigenous music at the Department of Asian Music, with Maguindanaon kulintang artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3919\">Aga Mayo Butocan</a> teaching kulintang music at UP, later followed by Ben Pangosban, a Kalinga. The next generation of Filipino composers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4165\">Ramon P. Santos</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3980\">Francisco F. Feliciano</a> were heavily influenced by Maceda&rsquo;s vision and philosophy of music education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1958, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Folkloric Dance Company</a>, with Kasilag as music consultant and director, began the very successful world tours that so impressed audiences worldwide and started the trend for &ldquo;staged&rdquo; folkloric dance and music among foreigners and diasporic Filipinos. Bayanihan&rsquo;s achievement paralleled that of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4122\">University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers</a> (PMS), founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\">Andrea Veneracion</a> in the early 1960s, whose impact in the quality of choral music performance among non-church based choirs in the country was unprecedented. PMS was known for its imaginative arrangements of Philippine folk, art, and pop songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1966 Music Education Law, which required the teaching of music in public schools, contributed to the popularization and institutionalization of many folk and art songs. Semi-classical music also got a boost with the establishment of the most important music recording company in the 1950s and 1960s: the Mabuhay Recording Company (MARECO), later renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\">Villar Records</a>. This company played a most important role in disseminating Philippine music nationwide. Not only did it record kundiman, balitaw, and danza genres that were already well circulated pre-World War II, but it also showcased local singers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3902\">Cely Bautista</a>, the Tres Rosas trio, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\">Ruben Tagalog</a>. These singers recorded and popularized many important songs from earlier composers like Jose Estella&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/943\">&ldquo;Ang Maya&rdquo;</a> (The Sparrow), Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\">&ldquo;Bituing Marikit&rdquo;</a> (Beautiful Star) and &ldquo;Nasaan Ka, Irog?&rdquo; (Where are You, My Love?), Francisco Santiago&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\">&ldquo;Pakiusap&rdquo;</a> (Plea) and &ldquo;Madaling Araw&rdquo; (Dawn), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4182\">Santiago Suarez</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bakya Mo, Neneng&rdquo; (Your Wooden Shoes, Neneng), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3958\">Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;</a>s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\">Maalaala Mo Kaya</a>?&rdquo; (Will You Remember?) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\">Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig</a>&rdquo; (My Only Love) for the younger generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Semiclassical works which cover music written for bands, rondallas, and other instrumental groupings highlighted the folk song genre as a symbol of nationalism in the third Philippine Republic. Many marches for bands were written such as Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Martsa ng Republika ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (March of the Republic of the Philippines), 1948; and Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Festival March,&rdquo; 1969. Other band music such as concert overtures, tone poems, and symphonies also abound, such as Eduardo Parungao&rsquo;s <b><i>Suite for Band, </i></b>1960, and Hilarion Rubio&rsquo;s <b><i>Three Kings Overture</i></b>, 1970. Juan Silos&rsquo;s rondalla propagated the arrangement, performance, and recording of folk songs and dances such as Eliseo Pajaro&rsquo;s <b><i>Himig Pilipino No. 1</i></b>, 1956, and <b><i>Philippine Medley</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1959.<b><i> </i></b>These were widely disseminated throughout the archipelago and used by public schools in their Physical Education classes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\">Leopoldo Silos</a> and his orchestra played light classical arrangements, which resonated with the style of movie music of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Original Filipino ballads in semiclassical style&mdash;aka middle-of-the-road songs&mdash;written by composers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4217\">Miguel Velarde</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3935\">Josefino Cenizal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4221\">Manuel Velez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4047\">Minggoy Lopez</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4059\">Antonio Maiquez</a> were sung by singers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\">Diomedes Maturan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\">Ric Manrique</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\">Mabuhay Singers</a>.

But some had begun to be influenced by Latin music of the 1950s that had spicy African rhythms like rhumba, mambo, and cha-cha, introduced through records, radio, film, or television. Groups called <b>cumbancheros</b> played Latin music in the 1950s using improvised instruments made out of gasoline, cooking oil, and biscuit tin cans referred to as combos by the time of The Beatles. Later in the 1960s, the same media targeted youth cultures around the world, and this time, rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll was the hip thing that drew young people to buy into the images of industry&rsquo;s stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through radio, television, cinema, and the recording industry, Filipinos were inundated with the latest songs and dances from the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. It was also during this time that foreign music was sung by Filipino performers who excelled in mimicry. The proclivity of the Filipinos to imitate and assimilate foreign music was more pronounced in the field of popular entertainment music, prompting cultural theorist Arjun Appadurai to comment that Filipino music mimicries even surpassed their originals. Filipino counterparts of singing idols Nat King Cole, Perry Como, Elvis Presley, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, Doris Day, Timi Yuro, and Tom Jones proliferated and were commercially promoted on the airwaves and on TV. <b>Plakang-plaka</b> or the ability to duplicate a foreign singer&rsquo;s voice, enunciation, and general singing style became a compliment for such singers. Some musicians who had very good ears for imitating found their way into jazz bands and combos of the hotels and nightclubs in Manila and other Asian cities like Tokyo, Taipei, Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Jakarta, and later, in the Middle East and Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This period also saw the proliferation of American-influenced Filipino pop music as heard in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1025\">&ldquo;Waray-Waray&rdquo;</a> (a person from Samar or Leyte), which had blues chords; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/894\">&ldquo;Hahabol-habol&rdquo;</a> (Chasing After), which was in rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll style; and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/981\">&ldquo;Pitong Gatang&rdquo;</a> (a street in the notorious Tondo district of Manila), which was in country and Western style. At the same time, foreign band music invaded and inundated the country with groups such as The Ventures, The Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. During this period, the American electric guitar, British amplifier, and trap drum set were the favored instruments. The repertoire of musicians and amateur groups in the provinces were mostly cover versions of anything that was fashionable, but notable was the rise of Filipino rock bands doing both foreign and local music, such as RJ and the Riots and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4025\">Juan de La Cruz Band</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The declaration of martial law by Ferdinand E. Marcos ushered in the fourth Philippine Republic, which lasted from 1972 to 1986. The main thrust of Marcos&rsquo;s New Society was to nationalize Philippine industries, including music. This thrust was reflected in the centralization of music cultural production via the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, which was built in 1969. Through President Marcos&rsquo;s wife, Imelda, CCP acquired unsurpassed glamor and glory, albeit at the expense of silencing the majority of artists from the grassroots cultures. Support for certain arts and artists was lavish and could only be described as &ldquo;Imeldific.&rdquo; Imelda was criticized for spending a lot of money on the American pianist Clifford van Cliburn and ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn. A few resident companies in dance, music, and theater were instituted and were favored with grants and the use of the new CCP venues. The undemocratic process discouraged local artists from participation and drew criticism, especially among the intellectuals and artists from UP, many of whom were tortured and incarcerated by the regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Classical works that came out during this period include compositions specifically written for the Marcoses such as Lucino Sacramento&rsquo;s two concertos for piano and orchestra <b><i>Ang Maharlika</i></b> (The Nobility), 1973, and <b><i>Ang Bituin</i></b> (The Star), 1974, obviously dedicated to Ferdinand and Imelda; and Rodolfo de Leon&rsquo;s musical setting of the regime&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa&rdquo; (One Country, One Spirit), 1974. Other composers continued to write in the classical tradition, dramatically influenced by new compositional techniques developed in the West. Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Suite for Flute, Clarinet, Viola, Cello, and Piano</i></b> and <b><i>Four Movements</i></b> for chamber orchestra, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\">Francisco Feliciano</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Fragments </i></b>and<b><i> Die Verkl&auml;rung</i> <i>Christi </i></b>(<em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1020\">Transfiguration</a></strong></em>) for large orchestra were written in atonal language. Experimentations were also prominent, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\">Chino Toledo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ugnay </i></b>(Link) and <b><i>Kulambo: Isang Kayumangging Puntod </i></b>(Mosquito Net: A Brown Grave), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3962\">Verne de la Pe&ntilde;a</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>N</i></b>(<b><i>y</i></b>)<b><i>uma for 36 Voices and Asian Instruments</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Focused as it were on &ldquo;highbrow&rdquo; music, CCP did not sufficiently nurture semiclassical music such as the music of the rondalla and the band, the former only finding a new source of material in modern compositions by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3964\">Bayani Mendoza de Leon</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3954\">Jerry Dadap</a>, and the latter finding a performance venue in the weekly concerts at Luneta. Concerts at the Park and later concerts in heritage sites like Puerta Real in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">Paco Park</a> received funding from the government to broadcast over national TV. A look into the content of these aired broadcasts would reveal that classical music lorded it over semiclassical music, again reflecting the elitist priorities of the Marcos administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The few musical productions for theater, rondalla, and band music during the Marcos administration included the restaging of old sarsuwela such as <b><i>Walang Sugat </i></b>and <b><i>Ana Maria</i></b>, and the staging of new ones such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4110\">Reynaldo Paguio</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sumpang Mahal</i></b> (Sacred Vow), 1976, and <b><i>Miss Philippines</i></b>, 1980<b><i>. </i></b>Others wrote sarsuwela that were mainly anti-martial law and anti-Marcos such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonfacio</a> and Fabian Obispo who penned <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong>Ang Bundok</strong></a></i></b> (The Mountain), 1977, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3156\">Louie Pascasio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3051\">Lucien Letaba</a> with their <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong>Pilipinas Circa 1907</strong></a></i></b>, 1982. Foreign musicals were also frequently presented in the capital such as <b><i>Jesus Christ Superstar </i></b>and <b><i>Godspell</i></b>. New music for rondalla and band were anthems and marches labeled as New Society songs such as &ldquo;Bagong Lipunan&rdquo; (Hymn of the New Society), &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo; (March of the New Society), and &ldquo;Magtanim, Magtanim&rdquo; (Plant).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Critical thinkers and artists from the academe, many of whom were influenced by the ideology of the democratic Left, strongly reacted against Marcos&rsquo;s authoritarian rule and the abuses of the military. There was an abundance of protest songs coming from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\">Heber Bartolome</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\">Banyuhay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4164\">Jess Santiago</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4016\">Inang Laya</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4116\">Patatag</a> who expressed their sentiments through songs such as &ldquo;Sino Ang Manggagawa&rdquo; (Who are the Workers) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a> of Patatag and &ldquo;Butil ng Palay&rdquo; (Grain of Rice) by Jess Santiago and Inang Laya. Similarly, theater productions of the Philippine Educational Theater (PETA), like the rock musical <b><i>Nukleyar I </i></b>and<b><i> II</i></b><i>,</i> 1981 and 1985, respectively, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/593\"><b><i>Macli-ing</i></b></a>, 1988, were a condemnation of military rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music industry also underwent Filipinization in the 1970s and 1980s. The association of broadcasters, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4861\">Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP)</a>, adopted the policy passed by the Broadcast Media Council (BMC) of airing Filipino pop music every hour, while annual pop music competitions like the Metro Manila Pop Music Festival led to more new songs being written by Filipino songwriters. Filipinization of popular music was realized first through the vernacularization of the texts and the use of soft rock accompaniment in what was labeled as <b>Manila Sound,</b> and later in the production of original compositions that were to be subsumed under the umbrella term <b>OPM</b> (Original Pilipino Music). The styles generally remained faithful to or were somehow influenced by their foreign models&mdash;i.e., country western, Broadway rock, punk rock, heavy metal, folk, and rap. Particularly influential was the American music industry&rsquo;s Top 40 chart, which popularized the music of Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, the Bee Gees, the Village People, and Karen Carpenter, among others. A long string of names that topped the charts in Filipino pop music included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3947\">Willy Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\">Hotdog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\">Apo Hiking Society</a>, Heber Bartolome, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a>, Maria Cafra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\">Mike Hanopol</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4224\">Yoyoy Villame</a>, with songs such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/915\">&ldquo;Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika&rdquo;</a> (How Beautiful is Our Music), &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You are the Miss Universe of my Life) <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/996\">&ldquo;Sana&rsquo;y Wala nang Wakas&rdquo;</a> (May It Never End), <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/922\">&ldquo;Laki sa Layaw&rdquo;</a> (Spoiled Brat), <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/961\">&ldquo;Ngayon at Kailanman&rdquo;</a> (Now and Forever), and the biggest hit of all, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\">&ldquo;Anak&rdquo;</a> (Child).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Aug 1983, the murder of exiled senator Benigno Aquino Jr on the airport tarmac at the hands of the military presaged the end of the decades-old dictatorship of the Marcoses. Discontent with the government escalated and culminated in the botched national election that then brought about the bloodless EDSA Revolt in Feb 1986. This peaceful revolt led <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\">Jim Paredes</a>, a member of the APO Hiking Society, to write the song <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/897\">&ldquo;Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo&rdquo;</a> (Filipino Offering to the World), inspiring people around the world to overthrow monolithic governments through non-violent means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the wife of Sen Aquino, Cory Aquino, took office as the President of the fifth Philippine Republic, Filipino artists representing different art forms came together to craft new policies in culture that would be more democratic. The result of this was the creation of the Presidential Commission for Culture and the Arts, 1987, which became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> in 1992. The commission&rsquo;s establishment ushered in a new era in the management and promotion of Philippine music and arts in which non-governmental art agencies were encouraged to participate. The NCCA, which became the coordinating organization for all affiliated government cultural agencies, implemented its grants assistance program for the development, protection, preservation, and dissemination of Philippine culture and arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the new leadership, the CCP reoriented its thrusts and programs. The five new directions of the post-Marcos CCP were Filipinization, democratization, decentralization, promotion of artistic excellence, and reorientation of international exchanges. An important component of the Filipinization goal of the CCP was to present outstanding Filipino musicians through the Filipino Artists Series launched in 1987 at the Tanghalang Aurelio V. Tolentino (formerly Little Theater), and to give grants to different music groups. To push for democratization, the CCP outreach program brought Manila artists such as Inang Laya and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a> to the regions and regional artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a> to Manila and to other provinces as well. In support of decentralization, the CCP organized artists in regional centers such as Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod, and Davao so that they could contribute to the creation of original works from their region and thus enrich the national culture from the grassroots. To promote artistic excellence, the CCP emphasized the highest standards of excellence and encouraged artists to be rooted in their traditions but at the same time be open to the best of world cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is significant that during this period, patronage of the arts was no longer the exclusive purview of CCP as in the Marcos period, but was extended to corporations who built venues in Makati and Alabang, among other places, and supported symphonic organizations as part of their corporate responsibility. San Miguel Corporation&rsquo;s sponsorship of an orchestra (now defunct), directed by Ryan Cayabyab is the best example. Without San Miguel, Cayabyab could not have composed his cheerful orchestrations of folk songs that sounded Bernstein-like and yet Filipino at the same time. Meanwhile, the Manila Symphony Orchestra was revived under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4063\">Basilio Manalo</a>&rsquo;s leadership. Throughout its history, this orchestra was supported by well-endowed citizens like the Legarda family. Other orchestras of this period are the Metro Manila Community Orchestra (now renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4082\">Metro Manila Concert Orchestra</a>) led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4197\">Josefino &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Toledo</a> and Manila Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Rodel Colmenar, which is organized like a musician&rsquo;s union and run independently by musicians themselves. Some orchestras, like the ABS-CBN Orchestra, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\">Gerard Salonga</a>, is a pop orchestra, specializing in light Philippine orchestra music and at the same time supplying works for the multinational media conglomerate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composers during this period continued to write in the classical Western tradition, with strong inclination toward experimentation marking the contemporariness and social relevance of their creations. On the traditional side were Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto for French Horn and Orchestra,</i></b> 1987; and Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s <b><i>Violin Concerto No. 2, </i></b>1994<b><i>.</i></b> Examples of the dominant style focusing on experimental sonic combinations include Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Time Space,</i></b> for two orchestras, 1990; Jose Maceda&rsquo;s <b><i>Music for a Chamber Orchestra,</i></b> 1997; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\">Jonas Baes</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i>Patangis-Buwaya </i></b>(Cry of the Crocodile), 2003; and Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Hoy! </i></b>(Hey!), 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music for dance theater showcased ballets such as Joey Ayala&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a> </i></b>as choreographed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a>, who introduced neo-ethnic dance movements which lent a unique Philippine flavor to contemporary ballet. Another collaborative work of Locsin and Ayala was <b><i>Sayaw LikhANG KIUKOK, Atbp</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Meanwhile, Fabian Obispo did the music for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>&rsquo;s<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/144\"><strong>For the Gods</strong></a></i></b>, 1988,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/187\"><strong>Siete Dolores</strong></a> </i></b>(Seven Sorrows), 1988.<b><i> </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Theatrical productions have also experienced enormous growth as new and old theater companies present newly composed operas, sarsuwelas, and musicals. Examples of these productions are Ryan Cayabyab and Fides Cuyugan-Asensio&rsquo;s opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a>, </i></b>2003; and Chino Toledo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Andres B</i></b>, 2014. New sarsuwelas created during the Philippine centennial celebrations of 1998-99 included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a> and Minda Azarcon&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></i></b> (Palace of Valentin), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a> and Lucien Letaba&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></i></b> (Plaint and Rebellion of Victoria Laktaw and Others), George de Jesus III and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i>Paglayang Minamahal</i></b> (Beloved Freedom), and Melba Maggay and Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s <b><i>Bayan Ko, Isang Paa na Lang</i></b> (My Country, Just One Step More).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New musicals are exemplified by Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/581\"><b><i>Katy! The Musical</i></b></a>, 1988, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\">Larawan</a> </i></b>(Portrait), 1997, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>; and <b><i>Alikabok </i></b>(Dust), 1995, with Noel Balmaceda. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4378\">Vincent de Jesus</a> composed the music for <b><i>Walang <strong>Himala</strong> </i></b>(No Miracle), 2003, with a libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4510\">Ricardo Lee</a>; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/667\"><strong>Skin Deep</strong></a></i></b>, 2008, which he also wrote; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/529\"><strong>Care Divas</strong></a></i></b>, 2011, with a libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\">Liza Magtoto</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3193\">Floy Quintos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/499\"><strong>...</strong><b><i>And St Louis Loves Dem Filipinos</i></b></a> became a musical in 2005, with music by Antonio Paterno Africa. In 2013, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3175\">Nick Pichay</a> adapted the film <b><i><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1257\"><strong>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo </strong></a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1257\"><strong><strong>Oliver</strong>os</strong></a> </i></b>(The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros) into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/602\"><b><i>Maxie: The Musicale</i></b></a>, with music by William Manzano, JJ Pimpinio, and Janine Santos. In 2013, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2785\">Carol Bello</a> composed the music for Rody Vera&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/561\"><b><i>Ibalong</i></b></a>. In 2014, the music of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Aegis</a> was used for Liza Magtoto&rsquo;s libretto of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/647\"><strong>Rak of Aegis</strong></a></i></b>, which is now one of the longest running musicals in the country.

(PASAMBAP, Inc.) leading the herd. The compositions of Lucio San Pedro have been among the staple repertoire of brass bands in Rizal, Pandacan, and Cavite, and these include<b><i> Victory on Parade March</i></b> and<b><i> Festival March. </i></b>Similarly, the proliferation of rondalla groups has been attributable to the efforts of the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) and Musicological Society of the Philippines&rsquo; <b><i>Kuwerdas ng Pagkakaisa: International Rondalla Festival</i></b> under the leadership of Ramon P. Santos. Among the new musical works written for rondalla are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4092\">Ma. Christine Muyco</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>PagpiPiko</i></b> (Playing Hopscotch), Christi-Anne Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>Gabi ng mga Aswang</i></b> (Night of the Evil Spirits), and Nelson Espejo&rsquo;s <b><i>Minsan sa Isang Taon </i></b>(Once A Year)<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular music comes in a variety of forms&mdash;ballads, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/785\">novelty songs</a>, folk songs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a>, jazz fusion, rap, and alternative music. The establishment of the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM) in the late 1980s contributed to the development of the pop music industry. Many of the songs which became popular were also winning compositions in pop music festivals, examples of which are &ldquo;Sometimes You Just Know&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4192\">Danny Tan</a>, Makko Pals, and Edith Gallardo, &ldquo;Shine&rdquo; by Trina Belamide, and &ldquo;Malayo Man, Malapit Din&rdquo; (Even if it&rsquo;s Far, It&rsquo;s Also Near) by Bayang Barrios. Competitions abroad also contributed to the popularity of winning songs such as Danny Tan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Easy to Love You,&rdquo; and Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paraiso&rdquo; (Paradise). Novelty songs celebrating the humorous side of Filipino character provided a marketable variation of popular music, examples of which are &ldquo;Spaghetti&rdquo; by the Sex Bomb Girls, &ldquo;Papa Cologne&rdquo; (Father Cologne) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\">Parokya ni Edgar</a>, and &ldquo;Otso Otso&rdquo; (Move Like Number Eight) by Bayani Agbayani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The success of commercial music is evidenced by the rise of alternative rock from the 1980s to the present. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\">Eraserheads</a>, Parokya ni Edgar, and later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\">Gloc-9</a>, whose works are as much local as they are global, continued the legacy of the first wave of local rock in the 1970s. A few of the rock hits have been the Eraserheads&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/905\">&ldquo;Ang Huling El Bimbo&rdquo;</a> (The Last El Bimbo), Kamikazee&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/958\">&ldquo;Narda,&rdquo;</a> and Aegis&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\">&ldquo;Halik&rdquo;</a> (Kiss). Pinoy rap also became a commercial success. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/946\">&ldquo;Mga Kababayan Ko&rdquo;</a> (My Countrymen) by Francis M. is perhaps the most popular Filipino rap song of all time. Andrew E.&rsquo;s hits include &ldquo;Humanap Ka ng Pangit&rdquo; (Look for an Ugly One), and &ldquo;Huwag Kang Gamol&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t be an Ass). Present-day original Filipino rap music conveys a tenderness characteristic of Filipinos, which departs from the more edgy and confrontational rap of the youth crews in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular music continues to enjoy mass appreciation and support especially with the advent of new distribution technologies. In the late 1980s, the distribution mechanism was primarily through television, radio, and film. As the technological revolution of the last years of the 20th century reached the Philippines, the dissemination of pop music accelerated and intensified and now, the flow of media and information via interactive telecommunications technology has inspired more independence in the creation of original works, and this is also manifest in art forms like film and literature. In the field of music, the rise of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/797\"><b>sound art</b></a> is a perfect example of how international influences reach local shores&mdash;via on-off telepresencing in social media and not through the usual channels of formal music education. The use of contemporary music technology is being done in schools like the College of St Benilde of La Salle that has been specializing in digital music media production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contemporary Philippines, three kinds of music&mdash;old aboriginal Asian music, religious and secular music patterned after Hispanic and European forms, and American/European-inspired classical, semiclassical, and popular music&mdash;stand side by side, offering Filipino artists a wealth of options and possibilities. Given all these contexts and the many musical forms and styles that continue to be unearthed by researchers, the musical artists of today continue to discover many alternative concepts, values, and perspectives as they endeavor to create music that will express the history and way of life of the Filipino and display an unmistakable national character.<v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251658240\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"><v:textbox></v:textbox></v:shape> <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jose M.

Today, indigenous vocal and instrumental music and dances are perpetuated by linguistic groups that comprise some 14-17% of the total population of 100 million Filipinos (National Statistics Office 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"background\" name=\"background\"></a>Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine musical traditions are diverse. Although they have common instruments and life cycle functions, these vary considerably in form and structure, performance media, style, aesthetics, and theories such as tuning temperaments, scales, modes, and terminologies. Such cultural pluralism is the result of prehistorical periods of human interaction and exchanges in the region. Currently accepted Austronesian dispersal theories propose sequential migrations from Taiwan to the Philippines beginning ca&nbsp;4,500 to 4,000 years ago (Bellwood 1997). There is archeological evidence that point to &ldquo;considerable maritime interaction&rdquo; in Island Southeast Asia even before the appearance of Austronesian languages (Donohue and Denham 2010, 223). Subsequent migrations within the larger Southeast Asian region gave rise to many separate regional settlements and extended family communities, with their own laws and customs, animist religious beliefs and practices, and distinct artistic expressions (Patanñe 1977, 85-9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 10th century, there was dynamic trade between the people of Ma-i<i> </i>(now Mindoro) and Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, and Arab merchants. They exchanged not only goods but also religious and social ideas. Hinduism and other elements of Indian culture, for example, reached the Philippines via Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, leaving strong imprints on religious concepts, patterns of social behavior, manner of dressing, and artifacts, and a Sanskrit-influenced system of writing (Churchill 1977; Nicolas 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 14th century and perhaps even earlier, Islam was introduced in the southernmost island of Sulu. The new religion was adopted by various communities at different times and under different conditions and levels of assimilation. Thus, pre-Islamic practices were retained by the native converts while Islamic art forms enriched the indigenous arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Spain ruled the Philippines from 1565 to 1898, conquering the islands primarily by converting inhabitants to Christianity, especially those who belonged to the eight biggest lowland ethnolinguistic groups. The friars taught the people not only how to recite the Christian prayers and speak a new language, but also how to read music, sing European songs, and play European instruments. Just the same, even the Spanish conquest could not eradicate indigenous musical traditions and instruments, which survived and even assimilated Christian elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The long history of cultural assimilation shaped the highly varied Philippine cultural profile. The numerous ethnic and language groups with orally transmitted cultural practices may be categorized into six clusters based on history, geography, topography, kinship of artistic forms, material culture, and social structures: the Cordillera highland cultures and outlying communities, consisting of the ethnolinguistic groups of the Apayao or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, Applay, Bago, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, Balangao <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>; the central west highland cultures of the Alangan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2333\">Batak</a>, Buhid, Hanunuo, Iraya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a>, Magahat, and Sulod; the Mindanao highland cultures of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>, Kalagan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2364\">Mansaka</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, Matigsalug, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> communities represented by groups like the Ati, Agta, Abyan, Dumagat, and Kabihug; the Islamic communities of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a>, Ilanun, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, Sangil, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a>; and the rural Christian communities, including the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2342\">Cuyunon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Kinaray-a</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many communities in the fifth group were converted to Islam. Although the last few groups are more integrated into the lowland political and economic mainstream, some of their indigenous musical traditions are still widely practiced, especially those that have found areas of accommodation with dominant religious and social norms. Practices of animist provenance still exist, although not as widely as before (Hislop 1971, 144-55). Music marks rites of passage and life cycle events such as birth, initiation, courtship, wedding, death; seasonal events such as planting, harvest; religious-cycle events; and other special occasions such as thanksgiving, war, peace pacts, and anniversaries. Music that accompanied extinct practices such as tribal wars and headhunting have either disappeared or are performed now but in new contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In lowland community celebrations, group instrumental playing is common, as are dancing, welcome <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chants</a>, panegyrics, laments, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a>, allegorical songs, and extemporized poetry. Solo instrumental playing is done at intimate, informal gatherings, for courting or for self-amusement while the player watches over the fields, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Islamic cultures are mostly found in the coastal and lowland areas of western Mindanao. Their musical traditions are generally pre-Islamic, integrating folk culture and court music dating back to the 10th century or earlier. Despite the fundamental Islamic view that frowns on music, the musical practices of these communities remain an important element in their social life and one of the chief sources of their ethnic identities. Moreover, the musical traditions of earlier Islamic peoples, such as Arabs and Persians, and the modes of rendition of religious literature, have enriched the musical life of Filipino Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The distance of rural Christian communities from cities was significant in their cultural development. Western ideas did not come in a constant stream but were filtered and modified. Although many communal activities were replaced by Christian-oriented or Christian-derived forms of social practice, particularly those related to the Christian liturgical calendar, aspects of pre-Christian culture remained. Varying degrees of acculturation and a syncretic blend of Western and non-Western ideas are still evident in their musical practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indigenous music of Asiatic provenance may be classified into three categories in relation to social context. First is the function-specific music performed only on specific occasions such as the Kalinga <i>dopdopit </i>for the first bathing of a child outside the house, the Yakan <i>kwintangan kayu </i>for the growth of rice seedlings, and the Ifugao <i>bangibang </i>for revenge for a person&rsquo;s untimely death. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><b>pasyon</b></a><i> </i>for the Lenten <i>pabasa </i>also falls under this category. Second is music that may be performed on similar occasions, usually identified by melody or rhythm or both, such as the Maguindanao <b>tagunggo</b>,<b> </b>a rhythmic mode played only for solemn activities, or the Ibaloy <b>ba-diw</b><i> </i>and Maranao <b>bayok</b>,<b> </b>both sung with extemporized texts modified to fit the event (Figure 1). The third category is music that may be performed anytime for any occasion, consisting of <a href=\"http://https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk songs</a>, epics, narrative and allegorical ballads, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical theater</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional music activities relate to the social status, age, and gender of the performers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">Rituals</a> are usually reserved for priests and shamans. Elders and community leaders sing greeting songs and songs of wisdom and advice such as as the Ibaloy <b>ba-diw</b><i> </i>and the Ilocano <b>dallot</b>.<b> </b>Some instruments are usually played by women, such as the Maranao <b>kulintang</b><i> </i>and Bagobo <b>saluray</b>, and those played by men are the Maguindanao <b>kudyapi, </b>Ibaloy <b>sulibao</b>,<b> </b>and Kalinga <b>gangsa pattung</b>.<b> </b>Individual artistry and creative skill are admired in performers of such difficult forms as epics and extemporized poetic genres like the Kalinga <i>ading</i><b>.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"musical\" name=\"musical\"></a>The Musical Instruments</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most pre-Hispanic instruments are related to those in Southeast Asia, South China, and Oceania such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>, bamboo aerophones (blown instruments), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">zithers</a>, two-stringed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lutes</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/831\">bamboo xylophones</a>, and other wooden and metal idiophones.

The bamboo mouth harp, for example, is found almost everywhere, while the musical bow is limited to the Aeta cultures. The lip-valley flute and the polychordal zithers are found in northern Luzon and the Mindanao highlands. Flat gongs predominate in northern Luzon, while the bossed gongs are widespread in Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan. Other instruments, such as the half-tube zither (ayudding) of the Ifugao and the stopped-pipe ensemble (saggeypo) of the Kalinga, are specific to some ethnolinguistic groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The instruments are played either in ensemble or solo.

Conversely, borrowed Western instruments have been used to play non-Western music such as the Hanunuo gitgit, Tausug biyula, and Aeta biyulin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"vocal\" name=\"vocal\"></a>The Vocal Genres</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In most tribal communities that have no generic name for vocal music or music for that matter, each vocal genre bears a specific name, usually referring not only to the musical and textual contents but also to its social role. The vocal repertoire consists of a great variety of types, forms, styles, uses, and functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While instrumental music is generally performed on different occasions&mdash;except for the bangibang music of the Ifugao which is heard exclusively at the ritual and the Yakan kwintangan kayu or <b>daluppal</b><i> </i>music played only for agricultural purposes&mdash;vocal music is function-specific. Songs refer to particular occasions or activities and express individual feelings and emotions. Many songs are as specific as the Bugkalot (Ilongot) <b>dinaweg</b>,<b> </b>sung when trapping a wild pig, and the <b>amamet</b>,<b> </b>sung when hunting a pig with bow and arrow, and the Manobo <b>sinda-ay</b>,<b> </b>a wedding chant sung before inviting the groom&rsquo;s party to enter the bride&rsquo;s house. Among the Manobos of Agusan Valley, their most important song genre called <b>tud-om</b> is sung during face-to-face meetings as a ritualized gesture to formally recognize the co-presencing of self and other (Buenconsejo 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Song genres are named differently depending on their content. The Kalinga lullaby is an <b>owiwi</b><i> </i>when it tells of a child&rsquo;s life or a <b>dagdagqay</b><i> </i>when it foretells the baby&rsquo;s future (Maceda 1972, 522). Some songs are general, such as the Kalinga <b>salidummay</b>,<b> </b>Tagalog <b>awit</b>,<b> </b>Mandaya <b>bayok</b>,<b> </b>Manobo <b>limbay</b>,<b> </b>and ballads such as the Ibaloy <b>ta-miya</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vocal genres may be classified according to their functions. The life cycle songs are lullabies, songs related to birth, courtship, wedding rites, and laments for the dead. Lullabies are as general as the <b>langan bata-bata</b><i> </i>of the Tausug and <b>bua</b><i> </i>of the Subanon, or as specific as the Kalinga <b>oppiya</b><i> </i>which is sung while cradling a child on the singer&rsquo;s lower leg, and the <b>kawayanna</b><i> </i>which accompanies the wearing of a child&rsquo;s first necklace (Maceda 1972, 518). Songs related to love, courtship, and marriage negotiations include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/796\">song debates</a> like the Kankanaey <b>dai-eng</b>, Batak <b>inanen,</b> Tagakaolo <b>estijaro</b>, Tboli <b>setolu</b>; incantations such as the Manobo <b>kambong</b>; and expressions of secret love like the Bontok <b>chag-ay</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The different phases of the marriage rites have corresponding songs: the Manobo <b>antang</b> is<b> </b>a matchmaker&rsquo;s song; the Pangasinan <b>abuten</b> is<b> </b>a duet of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law; the Tausug <b>tarasul </b>is<b> </b>a song of advice to the wedded couple; and the Ilocano <b>dal-lot</b> is a song debate between the couple&rsquo;s parents. The Kalinga <b>donop</b>,<b> </b>which refers to the marriage proper, may be in the form of the <b>tamuyong</b><i> </i>or appeal for spiritual blessing; <b>dango</b><i> </i>or expression of gratitude; <b>oggayam</b><i> </i>or greeting and advice to the newlyweds; and salidummay and <b>dangdang-ay</b>,<i> </i>which are love songs for entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs for the dead can be as specific as the Bontok <b>didiyaw</b><i> </i>or the Matigsalug <b>balow</b>,<b> </b>which are sung for a dead husband. Some songs are sung during wakes: <b>iring-iring</b><i> </i>of the Manobo, dirges such as the Ilocano <b>dung-aw</b><i> </i>and the Isneg <b>sangsangit</b>, epic songs like the Manobo <b>ulaging,</b><i> </i>and lamentations like the Ilonggo <b>panaghoy</b>. Among the Kankanaey of Benguet, mourners eulogize the dead by performing the <b>day-eng&shy;</b><i>. </i>Here, a singer extemporizes the text comprised of couplets A1 and B1 (Figure 3). Each couplet is then repeated by the entire group who perform the <i>asbayat</i> (response). Each singer is allowed as much time to sing as he or she wishes, although this commonly lasts anywhere from five to ten minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Work songs accompany the different phases of the agricultural cycle, fishing, hunting, wine making, and gathering of firewood. Examples are the Aeta <b>dururu</b>,<b> </b>the general term for work song; the Subanon <b>gagonapu</b>,<b> </b>referring to hunting or fishing; the Ata <b>panubad</b>,<b> </b>a prayer before planting; the <b>balatuking</b>,<b> </b>harvest song of the Manobo; the <b>sowe-ey</b>,<b> </b>rice-pounding song of the Bontok; the Kalinga <b>daku-yon</b>,<b> </b>for hunting bats; the Bugkalot (Ilongot) <b>dinaweg,</b><i> </i>for catching wild boar, and the <b>dandannag </b>and <b>owayat</b>,<b> </b>sung while gathering firewood; and the Batak <b>didayu </b>for wine making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There is a vocal repertoire for the religious cycles of Islamic communities. Islamic rites include the <i>Salathul Juma </i>(Friday prayer), the <i>Tarawe </i>(prayer during the Ramadan), and the Maranao <i>dekir </i>or Maguindanao <i>dikil </i>(a dirge sung on the last night of the vigil). In indigenous animist cultures, the presence of spirits in the world is so real that they are always called upon or invoked in frequent life cycle and occupational activities and rituals. These are conducted or led by elders, medical specialists such as herbalists and bonesetters, and especially spirit-mediums when the occasion warrants their expertise in dealing with the spirit world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some vocal music among Christian groups clearly reveal Christian origins. An example is the chanted reading of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a>, the lengthy narrative of the passion of Christ set in versified form with five lines called <b>pie</b> (foot or stanza), each with eight syllables (Rivera Mirano 1984, 103). The text is read from published sources, the most popular version of which is titled <b><i>Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat lpag-alab nang Puso nang Sino-mang Babasa</i></b> (An Account of the Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord Which Should Inflame the Heart of Anyone Who Reads It), also known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><b><i><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g Henesis</i></b></a><i> </i>(Genesis Passion), dating back to 1814. This text may be set to a number of melodies learned by rote and passed on through oral transmission. Each locality has its own set of melodies or <b>punto</b>, ranging from very old, extended and melismatic tunes sometimes known as <b>sampay bakod</b> (literally &ldquo;to hang over a wall&rdquo;) to perky tunes based on popular songs. In the town of Sariaya in Quezon province, tunes are ascribed to their places of origin such as <b>sinariaya</b><i> </i>(from Sariaya, Figure 4)<i>, </i><b>tinayabas</b><i> </i>(from Tayabas, Figure 5) and <b>binatangan</b><i> </i>(from Batangas).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of indigenous instruments for Christian rituals is exemplified by the <b>subli</b>, which is performed in honor of the Holy Cross in Batangas. In the subli, the women devotees dance to the music of the indigenous drum <b>tugtugan</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are rituals in which vocal music plays a significant role: during curing ceremonies such as the Batak and Subanon <i>diwata</i>,<i> </i>Bontok <i>kapya</i>, Ibaloy <i>angba</i>,<i> </i>and Bugkalot (Ilongot) <i>dawak</i>;<i> </i>and<i> </i>during supplication rituals and offerings such as the Kankanaey <i>alasan, </i>Tagalog <i>sanghiyang</i>, Maguindanaon <i>bpagipat</i>, and Agusanon Manobo <i>hinang</i>. Normally, these are officiated by mediums who call upon their tutelary spirits who would demand that a pig or a chicken be sacrificed so that its meat is consecrated (<i>bayaw</i>) and eaten in a commensal feast. In the case of the Agusanon Manobo curing ritual, the animal sacrifice is termed <i>saliling</i>, which means &ldquo;substitute,&rdquo; and it is literally burnt after the killing as an act of dedication (<i>sinugbahan</i>)&mdash;a gift so to speak in order for a sick patient to live (Buenconsejo 2002). On these occasions, human sociability matters more than anything else. In effect, the dogmatic distinction between religious and secular expressions is undermined and rendered irrelevant. Other ritual genres are<i> </i>the Ibaloy <i>bendiyan </i>to celebrate victory in headhunting and the Kalinga <i>kayuyugan </i>and Manobo <i>pamansag </i>to celebrate victory in a tribal war;<i> </i>peace pacts, which are celebrated with the oggayam, <b>ullalim</b>, and dango;<i> </i>and thanksgiving rites like the Manobo <i>pangangando</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are children&rsquo;s songs, songs for fun like the Subanon <b>bongotat</b><i> </i>which is about old age and falling hair, drinking songs, greeting songs, and farewell songs. Philippine oral literature is also rich in extended narrative forms such as the <b>folk epics</b> and the <b>metrical romances</b>. The epics express not only the historical and literary aspects of a cultural tradition but also the people&rsquo;s beliefs and entire system of social values. Some representative Philippine epics are the Blaan <b><i>Aflulok</i></b>,<i> </i>the Ifugao<i><b> </b></i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1877\"><b><i>Hudhud</i></b></a>,<i> </i>the Kalinga <b><i>Gasumbi</i></b>, Ilocano <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>the Sulod <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1878\"><b><i>Hinilawod</i></b></a>,<i> </i>the Palawan <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1887\"><strong>Kudaman</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>the Maguindanao <b><i>Rajah Indarapatra</i></b>,<i> </i>the Maranao <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></i></b>, the Sama <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1945\"><b><i>Silungan Baltapa</i></b></a>,<i> </i>the Manobo <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><strong>Tuwaang</strong></a></i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1831\"><b><i>Agyu</i></b></a><i> </i>and<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1974\"><b>Ulahingan</b></a></i>,<i> </i>the Mansaka <b><i>Manggob</i></b>,<i> </i>the Subanon <b><i>Gambatutu</i></b><i> </i>(Maceda 1972; Pfeiffer 1975, 204-48), and Tboli <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1966\"><i>Tudbulol</i></a> </b>(Mora 2008). Some epics are shared by two or more cultural groups, such as the <b><i>Rajah Indarapatra</i></b>, known to both the Maguindanao and the Maranao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In most Christian communities, indigenous epics have been replaced by metrical romances introduced by the Spanish colonizers and some may even consider the pabasa as an epic. The popularity of metrical romances peaked in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the stories were originally written, these have been orally transmitted through the years, assuming different versions in the process. The <i>awit</i> and <i>korido</i>, differing only in poetic structures and style of rendition, are tales of heroism populated by European knights, princes, and princesses, and based on Biblical stories and Greco-Roman literature (Eugenio 1987). Recited or intoned on preexisting melodic formulae such as the Tagalog awit, metrical romances are an established tradition among the Tagalog, Pampango, Ilocano, Cebuano, Bicol, and Ilongo. Philippine metrical romance literature includes both adapted works like <b><i>Erastro</i></b>,<b><i> Floristo at Blanca Flor</i></b><i> </i>(Floristo and Blanca Flor), <b><i>Adriana at Pantinople </i></b>(Adriana and Pantinople), <b><i>Mariang Alimango </i></b>(Maria the Crab) which is an adaptation of the Cinderella story, and original works like <b><i>Don Juan Ti&ntilde;oso</i></b>,<b> <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</a> </i></b>(Florante and Laura), and<b> <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\">Ibong<strong> Adarna</strong></a> </i></b>(Adarna Bird). The stories of the metrical romances have also provided material for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><em>komedya</em></a>,<i> </i>a popular theater form in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Based on field research in Batangas that is part of Southern Tagalog region, awit also means dance song, which is characterized by dodecasyllabic quatrains called <i>plosa</i>. These are chanted using melodic formulae, often with ornamentation and accompanied by rhythms on the guitar in <i>pandanggo</i> style. In the awit, one evidently sees the indigenous elements, such as chanting and dancing, being mixed with Western elements, such as the 12-syllable versification influenced by the literary metrical romances from Spain and use of guitar playing local version of fandango (Rivera Mirano 1984).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"style\" name=\"style\"></a>Styles, Concepts, and Structures</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While affinities exist in instrumental inventories and social functions among music cultures, there are distinctions in the styles of performance, structural elements such as scales, tune formulae and rhythmic modes, and aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Differences in performing styles can be very apparent even between related cultures. In the Cordillera highlands, the Kalinga play their gangsa (flat gongs) in groups of six or more, either in the <b>pattong</b> <b>style</b> (beaten with hard sticks) while dancing at the same time, or in the <b>toppaya style</b> (beaten with the palm, Figure 6) with gongs resting on the lap as the musicians half-kneel around the dance area, playing for dancing couples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Ibaloy, the <b>kalsa</b> and <b>pinsak</b> together with the <b>palas</b><i> </i>players follow in step behind a dancing couple, while the two drums, <b>sulibao</b> and <b>kimbal</b>, are played by two seated musicians. The Ifugao play their <b>gangha</b> in a group of three, using both mallets and hands, remaining in position while accompanying the dancers. Benguet Kankanaey dancers on the other hand perform <b>tayaw</b> in public celebrations accompanied by two gongs (Figure 7), gangsa and pinsak, <b>takik</b> (iron bars) and <b>solibaw</b> (conical drum).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the inland Muslim peoples, kulintang music has greater musical autonomy, except when used in rituals such as the <i>kapagipat </i>curing ceremony of the Maguindanao, where the medium dances the <i>sagayan </i>to the accompaniment of the kulintang (Butocan 1987). During major celebrations, players exhibit virtuosity in highly competitive performances. They render improvisations on rhythmic modes classified into two types: an older style called <b>a</b> <b>minuna</b><i> </i>and the new style known as <b>a</b><i> </i><b>bagu</b><i>. </i>The latter, preferred by younger musicians, is much faster than the former (Table 2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;

The Maguindanao kutyapi is played in a sitting position, while players of the Manobo <b>kuglong</b> and the Tboli hagelong dance to their own music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The styles of vocal rendition can be classified as solo singing, leader-chorus (solo and group alternating with each other), song debate (two singers, each alternating with sung verses), and group singing, with or without accompaniment. All of these have been observed in the diverse styles of reading the pasyon throughout the archipelago. Lullabies, songs for entertainment, laments, epics, and ritual chants are sung solo. The identity of solo songs with extemporized texts is based on tune formulae and social functions, as in the Kalinga <b>gasumbi</b>, <b>oggayam</b>, and Tagalog <b>huluna</b>. Song debates such as the Visayan balitaw and Ilocano dallot are usually performed in courtship and wedding rites, either by the two lovers or their parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The leader-chorus style, such as the Ibaloy ba-diw and Ifugao <b>alim</b>,<b> </b>is common among indigenous cultures. In the alim,<b> </b>two groups of singers reply to two male leaders. Group singing predominates in the music of lowland Christian communities. Folk songs are either sung in unison or in harmony. Members of folk religious sects in the provinces of Quezon, Laguna, Cavite, and Batangas, sing hymns in semi-extemporized harmonization (Santos 1975, 93-117). In indigenous cultures, work songs such as the Bontok <b>chey-assa</b>,<b> </b>a rice-pounding song, are sung in groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Accompanied solo songs are popular among highland communities of Mindanao and Palawan and Islamic coastal groups. Among the Mindanao highland peoples such as the Manobo, Bagobo, and Matigsalug, the singers play the two-stringed lute or the zither and dance to the music at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Christians, accompanied singing is the predominant style of vocal music, and the guitar is the most popular and readily available instrument. Improvised folk singing among rural Christian groups shows an integration of non-Western and Western musical elements such as the awit in San Juan, Batangas. The preexisting tunes are loosely cast in major and minor tonalities, while phrases are repeated in drone-like fashion over nonfunctional chordal accompaniment of the guitar or the local harp. The songs are based on certain metric patterns, which are not strictly complied with in actual performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The melodic structures vary from the most ornamented or melismatic to syllabic and speech-like renditions. Vocal techniques include trills, vibrato, slides, and glottal stops. In the <i>sanghiyang</i> ritual of the rural Tagalog, for example, the shamans start their dialogue in exaggerated speaking style and gradually modulate these to more musical or chant-like vocal undulations as they reach a state of trance. This music process is in contrast to the Agusanon Manobo ritual song tud-om, which starts with a section using dark constricted nonlexical vowels in a sound called <b>ajenged.</b> This is made up of minor seconds and microtones (Figure 8). This ends up with a burst in a bright tonal space using open lexical vowels in high register called <b>te-ak.</b> The dark-to-bright ajenged section is described by the Manobo as &ldquo;weeping&rdquo; and it alternates with sections that can be called &ldquo;speech paragraphs.&rdquo; These are made up of improvised textual couplets delivered in <i>parlando</i> speech style (not shown in transcription above). The Manobo call the ajenged section as the part of the song where <i>habag</i> (pity) is expressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each cultural tradition has its own set of musical concepts and aesthetic values. In many cultures, music is not purely auditory or affective: the musical or sound component may be part of a larger artistic act. In most vocal repertoires, the text serves as the main artistic element more than the musical sound, and poetry and rhetoric determine the value of a song as a whole. The performer also composes by extemporaneously creating text in vocal music or by innovating and improvising on melodic motifs or rhythmic patterns in instrumental music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the use of five- or six-tone scales&mdash;sometimes even less than five tones in indigenous music&mdash;and the manufacture of more or less similar instruments, the tuning, sizes, scales, and modes are all relative to individual groups, families, or even individual artists. No kulintang is tuned exactly like another, and the lengths of flutes and overall size of other instruments are dependent on the preference of the performers who usually make the instruments themselves. Thus, musical excellence and aesthetic satisfaction are not determined by exact intonation and other quantitative factors deemed significant in Western music such as pitch range, amplitude, formal clarity, and compositional complexity. Rather, aesthetic pleasure is derived from individual timbres, tonal resonance, improvisation, poetic depth, and the relationship of the musical elements with other elements of the artistic activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Drone and melody are the underlying principles in the organization of the musical elements. Drone, a basic element in Asian music, reflects a concept of infinity and stability in the spiritual world. Musicologist Jose Maceda (1976) first described the different ways that cultures developed their musical languages according to the structural principles of drone and melody. First, drone and melody are an integrated structure of interlocking repeated individual parts (hocket) or patterns, such as in the music of Kalinga saggeypo and gangsa music, and Tiruray agung. Second, drone and melody are played as separate parts. Third, drone accompaniment alternates with song melody, as in the Palawan <b>kulilal</b>.<b> </b>Last, drone and melody are combined in one line, as in the Maguindanao kutyapi or Yakan solo gabbang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The concept of tonal harmony hardly exists in orally transmitted musical idioms, except in the use of chord structures, usually the tonic and dominant, in rural Christian music. However, these chord structures provide drones rather than harmonic function relative to the European tonal system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine indigenous music is generally free rhythmically. While a basic pulse unifies a group performance, there is little synchronism or tyranny of the downbeat. Formal elements such as opening and closing formulae function only in instrumental ensemble music, without necessarily affecting the freedom to improvise with indefinite duration on the microstructural elements (i.e., motifs, phrases, rhythms) of the music or the body of the music itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The structural and stylistic elements of traditional musical practices represent different concepts of artistic expression, most of which are not confined to the purely sonic dimension but integrate sound, movement, space, and poetry, and fuse the performers&rsquo; creative and interpretative roles. Furthermore, improvisation and the absence of fixed systems in the formulation and formation of basic musical materials reflect not only individuality and specificity, but a concept of individual freedom of choice in the selection and organization of these materials. Improvisation and variation pervade even the seemingly closed and limited compositional system based on drone and melody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The great variety of musical repertoires and styles in oral traditions reflects a highly pluralistic culture. There is no simple definition or description of the totality of Philippine music. Social changes&mdash;religious, economic, or political&mdash;affect musical practices, transforming them and giving rise to substitutes or causing their disappearance. Thus, the diversity in the archipelago&rsquo;s music stems from highly dispersed ethnic origins as well as long periods of contact with outside traditions, both Asian and Western, and from the transformation of new impulses into integral parts of a Philippine cultural heritage.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P.

The <i>conquistadores</i> had various motives for coming. Among these was the desire to gain control over the trade routes supplying the European market with spices and other exotic merchandise from Asia. To accomplish this, they needed to have control over the native rulers. At the same time, they had to compete with the growing influence of Islam and the Islamic leaders all over the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Every Spanish expedition included a group of missionaries tasked to bring the Christian faith to the natives. Conversion involved not only embracing a new set of religious beliefs but also turning away from existing cultural practices. Thus, the Spanish colonial regime from 1565 to 1898 set out to reshape Philippine culture, including Philippine music. Songs on the exploits of epic heroes and the rhythms of the native drums and gongs gave way to the chants of the Christian church and the harmonized music of the organ, harp, and guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"liturgical\" name=\"liturgical\"></a>Liturgical Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spanish discovered that the Filipinos were a singing people. In 1604, Pedro Chirino noted how government and religion is &ldquo;&hellip; founded on tradition &hellip; They preserve it in songs, which they know by heart and learn when children, by hearing these sung when they are sailing or tilling their fields, when they are rejoicing and holding feasts, and especially when they are mourning their dead. In these barbarous songs they relate the fabulous genealogies and vain deeds of their gods&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson 1973, 263) .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early dictionaries written by the missionaries to enable them to teach the Christian faith to new converts revealed an already long and varied list of native song types. Pedro de San Buenaventura&rsquo;s 1613 <b><i>Vocabulario de la</i> <i>Lengua Tagala </i></b>(Vocabulary of Tagalog Words) contained the following under the entry &ldquo;cantar&rdquo;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-top:0in; margin-right:.25in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-left:.25in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">auit (romance), hila (remeros), sambitan (llorando muertos), nananambitan (llorando difuecto), sambotanin (emborrachera), hilirao (emborrachera), diyona (de borrachera), oyayi (arrolando los ni&ntilde;os), dayao (victoria), tagumpay (la victoria) [141]</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The famous <b><i>Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala </i></b>by Juan de Noceda and Pedro de Sanlucar (1860) added &ldquo;talindao &hellip; indolanin, dolayanin (en el calle)&hellip; soliranin, manigpasin (los remeros), holohorlo &hellip; (arrulos al ni&ntilde;o), umbayi (triste), umiguing (suave) &hellip; dopayanin &hellip; balicongcong&rdquo; (19) to Buenaventura&rsquo;s list. Unfortunately for Philippine music, the sentiment prevailing among the clergy at the time of conquest was that such rich material was the province of the devil and therefore a barrier to the spread of the Christian faith. To clear the way for the latter, the sights and sounds of the old rituals had to be eradicated. As a whole, the performance and practice of what must have been a rich music culture was discouraged so that much of it virtually disappeared. Only a few genres survived, albeit in altered form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As they suppressed native music, the missionaries doubled their efforts in teaching European religious music to the newly converted Christians who proved to be adept and enthusiastic in learning the plainsong, the flute, the harp, and the guitar. Thus, fifty years after the Spaniards&rsquo; arrival on Philippine shores, the Church was able to establish schools for teaching the <i>indio<b> </b></i>(Christianized native) the music of the faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In monasteries and churches, the first sounds of the Christian church that the natives heard was the Gregorian chant or plainchant, an austere, unaccompanied monophony. This body of systematically codified and organized songs believed to have been put in order in the 6th century by Pope Gregory I represents one of the oldest surviving Western music traditions. Pope Gregory ensured the disciplined, uniform practice of the plainchant. His legacy lived on in the founding of the Schola Cantorum, a singing school for the training of church musicians in Rome in the 9th century. The schola became the center of training for all musicians within the church and an authoritative body that determined the character of church music and developed the musicians that would teach this practice all over the Christian world. Thus, the uniformity of style as well as practice, and the quality of music were ensured, which then convinced the Roman Catholic Church to include church musicians and music teachers among its missionaries to the Philippines. Notable among these were Juan Bolivar, Lorenzo Castelo, and Manuel Arostegui, all Augustinians; Pedro Bautista, Geronimo de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, and Jose de la Virgen, Franciscans; and Domingo Cera, Recollect. According to Church histories, these missionary musicians&rsquo; duties were to provide musical training for young boys, write books on music and music theory, compose music for liturgical purposes, provide music during masses, and, particularly in the case of Fr. Cera, train young musicians to manufacture musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1601, the first church orchestra was organized by the Augustinians in Guadalupe. In 1606, the Franciscans, under the leadership of Juan de Garrovillas, founded a seminary in Lumban, Laguna where 400 boys were trained to sing, play, and manufacture musical instruments. The first director of the seminary was Juan de Santa Marta, who arrived in the Philippines in 1618 and who had been a singer at the Cathedral of Zaragosa. By 1609, there were already, according to de Morga (1890), fine choirs of chanters and musicians, especially around Manila. De Ribadeneira (1601) noted that the young boys in such schools play very well together and very softly; and as a whole are lovers of music. They serve Masses either by singing plainchant or playing the organ. Some are very good readers, such that to hear them sing an epistle and place accents, it seems they knew Latin.

Solfeggio, vocalization, composition, organ, and strings were part of the basic curriculum. Subsequent graduates of the Colegio were Salvador Pi&ntilde;on, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4177\"><strong>Simplicio Solis</strong></a>, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong>, Maximo Nazario, Manuel Lopez, Antonio and Hipolito Rivera, FulgencioTolentino, Jose Muezo, Antonio Escamilla, Crispino Reyes, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4176\"><strong>Bernabe Solis</strong></a>. They were taught by noted Spanish peninsular composers like Remigio and Apolinar Calahorra; Hispanics Oscar Camps y Soler, Blas Echegoyen, and Luis Vicente Arche; and Filipino instrumentalists Ramon Valdez and Ignacio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the Colegio was the most important conservatory in the 19th century, other churches had their own boys&rsquo; choirs (e.g., Letran and Santo Domingo) which trained boys to become singers and sacristans as well. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> outstanding product of the San Agustin Church choir in Intramuros was the composer of Filipino liturgical music MarceloAdonay (1848-1928) of Pakil, Laguna. He began to serve at the age of eight when he apprenticed as a sacristan. He later became a choirboy and would, during his off-hours, escape to the choir loft and learn to play the organ by himself. He also learned to play the piano and violin, and to compose in both the contrapuntal and harmonic styles. He was later named <b>maestro de capilla<i> </i></b>and by 1870 was director of the church orchestra. He was praised by AntonioJ.Molina for keeping his religious music in &ldquo;harmony with the severe regulations of the church liturgy,&rdquo; while projecting the &ldquo;vitality&hellip; religious fervor and &hellip; Christian faith, hope, love, and charity&rdquo; that were often absent in the theatrical, showy music that was in vogue in his day (Manuel 1955, 38). Other 19th century composers who started out as boy sopranos at the San Agustin Church were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3926\"><strong>Jose Canseco</strong></a> Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong>Pedro Navarro</strong></a> Jr. Both later became famous military band maestros. Navarro was Adonay&rsquo;s pupil and the first Filipino conductor of the famed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a> in the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Native-born musicians were the backbone of music practice in the Philippines as they sang, played, and composed for the church. Prominent local artists active in church music in the 19th century were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4021\"><strong>Cayetano Jacobe</strong></a>, violinist from Lumbang, Laguna; Pedro Casta&ntilde;eda from Santa Cruz; BalbinoCarrion, tenor; his son, Juan Carrion, singer and violinist; Andres Ciria Cruz, who also sang with visiting Italian opera companies; and NatalioMata, organist and teacher from Quiapo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this setting, religiousmusic flourished, varying in style, depending on the prevailing liturgical requirement and function. From the mid-18th to the early 19th century, church music consisted of <b>canto llano</b> (plainchant), <b>canto llano figurado</b> (chant with meter), and <b>canto organo</b> (polyphonic music). Extant large choirbooks called <b>cantorales</b>, handwritten on cowhide parchment and preserved at the San Agustin Church in Intramuros and in the parish church of Baclayon, Bohol, are reminders of the liturgical music from that early modern period. In the latter part of 19th century, the music celebrating a patron saint&rsquo;s day was festive and symphonic, such as Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Missa Solemnis in D Major&rdquo; which was performed at the San Agustin Church in the late 1870s. A partial listing of works composed by Fr Manuel Arostegui, who was referred to as &ldquo;Augustino Filipino,&rdquo; gives us an idea of the range of genres and repertoire that might have been familiar to a church musician of the 19th century: a grand mass for full orchestra, with organ or piano and four or eight voices; &ldquo;O Salutaris Hostia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Motete al Santisimo,&rdquo; for solo baritone, with violin and harmonium accompaniment; &ldquo;Salve,&rdquo; for three voices, with organ or piano accompaniment; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> de Maria,&rdquo; for three voices, with organ or harmonium accompaniment; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\"><strong>Ave Maria</strong></a>,&rdquo; for tenor solo with piano or harmonium accompaniment. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s <b><i>Peque&ntilde;a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a> Solemne Sobre Motivos de la Missa Regia del Canto Gregoriano</i> </b>(Short Solemn Mass using the Motives of the Missa Regia of Gregorian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>), first sung during the feast day of San Augustin in Intramuros in 1904, was in the tradition of this grand mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rest of church music was written for vocal and instrumental ensembles in various combinations. Instrumental ensembles usually included the violin and other strings, piano, harmonium, and the queen of church instruments, the pipe organ, which was usually imported from Spain, like the one from the old church of Santo Domingo in Intramuros which is supposed to have possessed a &ldquo;fine double open diapason on the pedals, its longest pipe rising 18 ft above the floor&rdquo; (Ba&ntilde;as 1969, 30). In time, some of the organs were manufactured locally. Pioneers in this effort were the Recollects who established a school for organ builders. In 1818, a native organ made of bamboo was constructed in Las Pi&ntilde;as under the direction of Fr. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a>. Nine hundred pieces of bamboo were used, and great care was taken to ensure the proper treatment of the fragile material. The builders had to wait until the proper season to cut the bamboo pieces, which they then buried beside the sea for half a year to protect them from weevils and ensure their durability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In all aspects of music practice, the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines brought in Western musical norms and ideals that, through the centuries, took firm root in fertile and receptive soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"extra\" name=\"extra\"></a>Extraliturgical Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because the Christian religion was such a powerful force during the Spanish colonial period, its influence extended outside the confines of the church liturgy and into the domain of daily life. Extraliturgical music was still tied, in varying degrees, to Christian belief. Some were initiated by the clergy themselves, a good example of which was the set of original devotional music in <b>villancico </b>form, which was composed for the <i>cofradia</i> of the <i>santuario</i> of San Juan del Monte in the 18th century. One piece in this collection was titled &ldquo;Letra en Tagalo&rdquo; (Lyrics in Tagalog) as it had a Tagalog text. This is the oldest extant Philippine music in Western notation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other types of extraliturgical music might originally have been church-sponsored but later on moved away from church supervision and lost much of their religious character. Those that developed outside church supervision still combined Christian and non-Christian elements and forms. Through time, Church authorities had mixed feelings about these practices, alternately encouraging them as expressions of simple piety and banning them as works of the devil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These extraliturgical devotions abound in Philippine society until today. Some of these are practiced by all the major Christianized ethnolinguistic groups. Probably the most widespread of these practices are the Lenten <b>pabasa</b>; the Marian <i>Flores de Mayo<b> </b></i>and the <i>santacruzan</i>,<b><i> </i></b>both held in May; the Easter <i>salubong</i><b> </b>and <i>bati</i>; and<b> </b>the Christmas <i>panunuluyan</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pabasa is<b> </b>the public chanting of the <i>pasyon</i>,<b> </b>a long verse narrative on the life and death of Jesus Christ. Gaspar Aquino de Belen&rsquo;s monumental Tagalog poem<b><i> Mahal na Passion ni Jesu Cristong Panginoon Natin na Tola </i></b>(Sacred Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Verse), first published in 1703, was the earliest of these verse narratives set in octosyllabic<b> quintillas</b>. Other pasyon in other Philippine languages were published later, many of them translations of the anonymous 1814 Tagalog poem <b><i>Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa</i></b> (An Account of the Sacred Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ Which Should Inflame the Heart of Anyone Who Reads It). It is not known when the pasyon first came to be performed in public, but by 1827, when a parish priest complained in a letter about erroneous doctrinal ideas being spread by such performances, it could be assumed that the pabasa was already a well-entrenched custom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, the pabasa thrives as a Lenten practice all over Catholic Philippines, performed during the entire season, from Ash Wednesday to Black Friday. The style of chanting varies not only from region to region but also from town to town. Some <b>punto </b>or basic melodies are sung in unison and resemble plainchant. Others are borrowed from current popular melodies and are sung in two or three-part Western harmony. Still others are accompanied by instruments in many different groupings. The vocal quality is tense with a raised upper palate. A much admired type of voice is called <b>matinis</b>&mdash;high-pitched and penetrating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <i>punto</i>, a term used in pabasa singing in Batangas, is an interesting feature of the form. It refers to the basic or skeletal melodies associated with the pabasa. Almost any melody, whether a traditional one from the early centuries of Spanish rule or one from the newest popular song, can form the basic punto. Thus, in the town of Balayan, there are punto based on &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Nipa Hut), &ldquo;Aloha Oe,&rdquo; and even the Philippine National Anthem, alongside such venerable tunes as the <b>tres caidas</b>, <b>kinalamyas</b>, and <b>biniyulin</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While a given punto is fixed and easily recognizable, it is also usually the practice to weave ornaments&mdash;slow tremolos, slides and mordent-like embellishments&mdash;into the punto. This practice, called <b>pagduduyan<i> </i></b>in San Mateo, Rizal, adds to the beauty and grace of the melodic line. Such ornamentation also gives the individual singers a chance to add their individual stamp to the chanting. This elaborate use of ornaments, coupled with the unusual vocal quality, aside from giving the pabasa color and variety, suggests an earlier, pre-Spanish vocal style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the disparate melodies, textures, and performance practices, all pabasa are linked together by several characteristics. First, they are all communal performances of a long narrative poem on the life of Christ. Second, the pabasa is performed for a long period of time, usually lasting at least 12 hours. Finally, this communal effort is considered the fulfillment of a <i>panata</i>.<b><i> </i></b>The panata, an element found in many folk Christian practices that developed outside the Christian Church, is a vow made to God, the Virgin Mary, or to one&rsquo;s favorite patron saints, in which a person promises to perform a difficult act or task in return for a favor bestowed by the deity such as deliverance from illness or misfortune, passing a government examination, or securing a good job. The task often takes the form of a long and elaborate ritual involving, among other things, singing or chanting praises to the <i>patron<b> </b></i>(the aspect of God or the deity invoked).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Easter Sunday has its own set of extraliturgical celebrations. These commonly include the <i>salubong</i>, which begins with separate processions of the veiled Mater Dolorosa and the Risen Christ, sometimes accompanied by the choral singing of the &ldquo;Stabat Mater&rdquo; or a brass band. The processions wind up in the churchyard, where the meeting of the Virgin and Christ is dramatized. The Virgin&rsquo;s black veil of mourning is lifted by a little girl dressed as an angel, while a chorus of girls and young women sing the &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; (Queen of Heaven, Rejoice), with antiphonal alleluias. Sometimes, <b>balse</b> and mazurka are performed before and after the removal of the veil. Sometimes, the salubong also includes a special dance called <i>bati</i>, where performers wield flags and banners to the accompaniment of the drum. These songs and dances were most likely disseminated and encouraged by the church during the Spanish period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A Maytime ritual is the <i>santacruzan</i>, a devotion to the Holy Cross that reenacts the finding of the true cross of Jesus Christ by Queen Helena, mother of the Roman emperor Constantine. The procession, accompanied by brass bands and choirs of singers, moves through the town&rsquo;s main streets. The participants, dressed in elaborate costumes, personify characters from the story of the finding of the cross. Further secularization in the 20th century led to the festivity becoming the vehicle for a grand display of gowns and finery by the young elite members of the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also dedicated to the Holy Cross is the <b>subli </b>of southwestern Batangas, a devotion-celebration with music, poetry, dance, and prayer. Its most famous version is found in the town of Bauan, Batangas where participants seek the favor of the Mahal na Poong Santa Cruz (Beloved Lord Holy Cross), a miraculous wooden cross that is the popularly accepted patron of the town. The ritual, which may last from six to eight hours, features uninterrupted dancing to the beating of drums and chanting in unison of mystic verses narrating the story of the Mahal na Poon. The major celebrations of the subli coincide with the Maytime santacruzan. At one point in the ritual, the distinction between the story of Queen Helena and the tale of the Mahal na Poon disappears as the two merge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Performed in May, the Flores de Mayo, also known by the name <i>alay</i>, is a devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Although each region and sometimes each town have a slightly different practice and a different set of songs for the occasion, the basic form remains the same. In the afternoons of May, processions of young women and girls carrying flowers wind their way through the town&rsquo;s main street, singing songs in honor of the Virgin Mary. In the church, pairs of girls (or girls and boys) offer flowers to the statue of the Virgin as they sing in two-part tertial harmony, to the accompaniment of the guitar, organ, or a small orchestra. The Flores is climaxed by the big procession at the end of the month, which features the Virgin on a <i>carroza<b> </b></i>(float), preceded by the <i>zagala<b> </b></i>or young girls and ladies bearing symbols of the attributes of the Virgin Mary. As clerical control over these practices weakened, there was a tendency to combine the Flores with the Santacruzan, leading to some confusion over the nature and character of both celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the period of <i>hondras</i>, the November festivals for the dead also known as <i>undas</i> or <i>todos los santos</i>, singing groups called <b>mangangaluluwa </b>surface. They represent the wandering spirits of the dead that carol from house to house, begging for alms and playing pranks on stingy house owners. The villancico, <b>danza</b>, <b>habanera</b>, and balse that form the bulk of their repertoire are based on popular Spanish or Mexican tunes and are unrelated to the music of the Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A good example of how a secular form separated itself from an originally church-sponsored practice is seen in the <b>panunuluyan</b> (seeking entry) and its related form, <b>pamamasko<i> </i></b>(Christmas caroling). The former is a nativity pageant staged in various places around the town. Townsfolk dressed as characters in the Christmas story take part in this sung reenactment. A choir and orchestra performing Christmas carols accompany the actors in their journey through the town. This church-sponsored play might have been the origin of the practice of pamamasko, in which bands of young folk travel from house to house during Christmas time singing for alms. In the Leyte and Bicol regions, they are called <b>pastores, </b>usually composed of 12 girls and/or boys headed by a <i>capitana<b> </b></i>(lady captain), all garbed in colorful costumes. Most of the tunes they sing are in the traditional Spanish villancico<b> </b>time of 6/8. In practice, however, folk musicians often change the rhythm and phrasing to balse or pasodoble or even irregular time, altering the character of the original songs to suit local tastes. An example of this is the Catalonian villancico &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>Pastores</strong></a></strong> a Belen&rdquo; (Shepherds at the Nativity) by the pastores of Camalig, Albay which has been transformed into a paso doble. The pamamasko, once part of the panunuluyan, has also become part of the secular side of the Christmas celebration. Divorced from the religious pageant, it has been transformed into a fund-raising event, and all proceeds raised by the young people are used to fund social dances or fiesta events for the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite Spanish control, some extraliturgical music that was considered native ritual music persisted, because on the surface, they seemed to honor Christian icons. This is exemplified by the sanghiyang of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a> which invokes the basic icons of the Christian pantheon such as the Virgin Mary and the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. But the sanghiyang mediums are also possessed by numerous other spirits such as the <i>hari ng kailaliman<b> </b></i>(king of the underworld) and San Juan Sambanog Tiwan-tiwan.<b><i> </i></b>In a trance state, they perform unmetered chants, half-spoken and half-sung. The entire ritual calls upon these deities to bestow health, good fortune, and prosperity upon the celebrating community with food offerings, chanted prayers, incense, and flames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"secular\" name=\"secular\"></a>Secular Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more important type of secular music that evolved during the Spanish colonial period can be lumped together under the umbrella term folk music. Like the paraliturgical genres, this was an organic product of music acculturation or of the intercultural encounter between indigenous and Western cultures. This encounter spawned the bidirectional processes of music exchange, that is, syncretism or hybridity. One process pointed toward the Hispanization of indigenous pre-Hispanic genres like epic chanting and song debate. As Christianity spread, epic chanting was lost in lowland areas but was supplanted by the long hagiographic chant pabasa. Similarly, in the indigenous song debate, elements of European secular genres from Spain and/or Mexico were incorporated to the existing local expression, as in the use of harmonic tonality using the imported guitar that eventually replaced the native <b>kudyapi</b> and bamboo zither. In this process, <i>mestizaje</i> genres like <b>kumintang</b>, <b>balitaw,</b> and <b>curacha</b> emerged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other intercultural process was the reversal of the first, i.e., the Filipinization of imported genres like villancico, fandango, polka, jota,<b> </b>and most importantly, the<b> </b>danza. The villancico was the root of the Visayan <b>pastores</b> music and the Cebuano <b>daygon</b>. The fandango was so assimiliated by the indios that it spread to far-flung regions of the archipelago and may have been the source of the Tagalog <b>kundiman</b> because both kundiman and fandango were generally binary in form in the 19th century. These imported music genres were indigenized, later becoming the main body of folk songs known today among lowland Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>berso golpeado<i> </i></b>of the Ibanag of Cagayan Valley, a joyous song for greeting guests in the northern Cordillera, is a traditional song in triple time accompanied by a <b>cinco-cinco </b>guitar which strums out chord progressions. The strumming at first appears to be simple attempts at simulating Western harmonies. Upon closer inspection, however, it expresses a different concept of sound in which two alternating clusters of tones are played repeatedly to create a continuous, unbroken sound over which a vocal melody may be built. This feature may be seen in song forms in other Christianized regions of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Secular ballads narrating historical events, heroic deeds, or humorous anecdotes may still be heard in Hispanized areas, like Cuyo, Palawan or Panay. The <b>composo</b> is<b> </b>a ballad which is a vehicle for the spread of local news. At festive gatherings in Aklan such as after-work drinking parties, ordinary townsfolk compose and perform songs that retell the tales of the last devastating typhoon, the exploits of rebels or bandit leaders, and even the latest juicy gossip. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>ly, its diatonic melodies and chordal accompaniment on the guitar show the influence of Western melody and harmonic progression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most famous of all of these Hispanized hybrid music is the dance-song kumintang<i>.<b> </b></i>In the 19th century, numerous writers referred to it as the national song, perhaps because it was indigenous to a particular place and people. Originating from Batangas, a province known in early times as &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><strong>Kumintang</strong></a></strong>,&rdquo; it was actually a regional variant of the <b>awit</b>,<b> </b>a song in slow triple time. Cast in <b>plosa </b>verse or quatrains with 12-syllable lines, the text usually dealt with love and courtship, although it could also be about more general topics such as the hypocrisy and the folly of man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kumintang was first notated in a print by Nicolas de la Cruz <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a> dating back to 1734. The first extant example of notation was the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/878\"><strong>Comintang de la Conquista</strong></a>&rdquo; (Comintang of the Conquest) found in Jean Mallat&rsquo;s travelogue <b><i>Les Philippines</i></b>, published in 1846. Epifanio de los Santos, writing in 1916, warned that portions of this transcription were not characteristic of the authentic kumintang. This was because Mallat&rsquo;s publisher wrongly conflated the guitar accompaniment with a piano accompaniment whose harmony followed the learned classical style. The piano accompaniment was tacked on to the piece by a certain Henry Cohen who, in all likelihood, did not visit the Philippines. Indeed, if the piano accompaniment were eliminated and the guitar sounds alone accompanied the voice, this early transcription would bear striking structural similarities to the awit still performed in the mountains of Batangas today. The <b>kinanluran<i> </i></b>(&ldquo;of the west&rdquo;) and <b>sinilangan<i> </i></b>(&ldquo;of the east&rdquo;) awit styles, as well as the awit&rsquo;s guitar-plucking technique, resemble not only the &ldquo;Comintang de la Conquista&rdquo; but also other 19th-century transcriptions, and provide a valuable link to an ancient tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Secular music from Spain also made an impact in the form of light, popular songs and dances. The styles of these imported music were transmitted through spectacles in public spaces such as indoor theaters, outdoor plazas where events such as <i>loa</i>, <b>komedya</b>, <b>serenata </b>(open-air concert), and <b>baile</b> were held, and even inside the church whose religious music was heavily influenced by popular styles in 19th century. These were also transmitted via the Spanish school system which provided instruction in Western music to the children of the affluent criollos, mestizos, and native elites. This system also cultivated in them a taste for Italian operas such as <b><i>Aida </i></b>and Spanish zarzuela such as <b><i>Jugar con Fuego</i></b> (Playing with Fire) brought to the islands by troupes visiting from Europe, especially after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. In boys&rsquo; colleges in the 19th century, music was taught as part of a number of subjects, which included philosophy, physics, and metaphysics. Similarly, young girls, especially after the educational reforms in basic education in 1863, were taught instrumental music, particularly the piano, in the girls&rsquo; colleges. Familiarity with these European forms became a mark of gentility. Young women of good breeding were expected to play the waltz, the habanera, and mazurka on the piano or harp, and sing popular arias. Prominent families sponsored <i>tertulias</i>,<b><i> </i></b>informal parties where the main activity was the reading of Spanish poetry and the performance of light classical works by Italian composers such as Rossini and Verdi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine songs and dances modeled on these European forms developed and thus, Spanish music was Filipinized. By the 19th century, writers for the propaganda movement could point with pride to song and dance forms in the European style developed in the islands. The most famous of these was the kundiman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kundiman is a lyrical song in moderate triple time. From the early 1800s to about the 1840s, it was a folk dance-song as witnessed by observers like the Augustinian Martinez Zu&ntilde;iga in 1800 and Gervasio Cironella and Jose Lozano in 1847. By about the 1860s to the 1890s, as evidenced in the music recorded in Karl Scherzer&rsquo;s travelogue, 1861, and in the collection of popular music in the Philippines by Manuel Walls y Merino, 1892, it had lost its dance component. Unlike the kumintang, which has a strophic or a verse-and-refrain structure, the 19th century kundiman is divided into two separate sections, each with a different melody. Its binary sectioning makes it akin to other Filipino folk songs. By the 1920s, however, it developed into a &ldquo;cultivated art&rdquo; form, with an expanded second section to make three. Also, unlike the kumintang and the berso golpeado, where two chords or clusters of tones alternate repeatedly to produce a continuous, unchanging sound, the kundiman uses a clear harmonic progression in the Western sense and even modulation. While it is possible for the 19th century two-sectioned kundiman to be in a single key or tonality, it is more likely that each section is in a different mode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lyrics of the kundiman are about romantic love, although love of country and sorrow over the loss of a loved one are common themes as well. During the Philippine revolution against Spain, the kundiman became a metaphoric expression of love for the motherland. The most famous kundiman which fired the patriotic sentiments of <i>revolucionarios<b> </b></i>(revolutionaries) from 1896 to 1898 in the struggle for liberation from colonial rule was &ldquo;JocelynangBaliwag&rdquo; (Jocelyna of Baliwag).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other Western forms were adopted by Filipinos. The habanera, named after its place of origin of Havana, Cuba, and also known as danza or <b>danza habanera, </b>is in duple time, and is typified by &ldquo;La Bella Filipina&rdquo; by Massaguer. This piece is a landmark composition because it is one of the earliest sheet music prints that was produced in the colony. The polka,<b> </b>a lively Bohemian dance in fast duple meter, is exemplified by the popular &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\"><strong>Pamulinawen</strong></a>&rdquo; (Stone-hearted) of the Ilocos. The jota,<b> </b>originally a Spanish folk dance, has sections in duple and quadruple time, as seen in the <b>jota moncade&ntilde;a</b>.<b> </b>The mazurka, which originated from Poland, is usually danced in 3/4 or 6/8 time by eight to 16 couples. The paso doble, a dance in duple meter slightly faster than the march, is exemplified by &ldquo;No Te Vayas a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>&rdquo; (Do Not Go to Zamboanga). The <b>rigodon de honor</b>, in duple meter, is<b> </b>based on the French court dance, and was once performed for official and formal functions.<b> </b>The <b>marcha<i> </i></b>or march in duple time is exemplified by &ldquo;Alerta Katipunan&rdquo; (Alert, Katipunan) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\"><strong>Julian Felipe</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a> Magdalo&rdquo; (Magdalo March), which became the Philippine National Anthem. The most famous of all, the balse or waltz, is an Austrian dance in lilting triple time, an example of which is the famous waltz-song &ldquo;AngMaya&rdquo; (The Sparrow) composed in 1905 by the Filipino &ldquo;Waltz King&rdquo; JoseEstella.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical education and career of LadislaoBonus, the prominent 19th-century composer-conductor from Pandacan, gives us an idea of the range of experience of the Filipino secular musician. Outside of the church, the elite regimental band, and the <i>colegios</i>, no formal system for musical education existed. Bonus learned his skills by taking lessons from older musicians and by sitting in as assistant and apprentice player in the bands and orchestras that were often hired to accompany visiting zarzuela and opera troupes. In short, much of the music that Bonus learnt he absorbed in a community setting, as still happens in many parts of the country today. Eventually Bonus became a highly regarded contrabass player, versatile in other string instruments as well. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E. Arsenio Manuel</strong></a>, in his <b><i>Dictionary of Philippine Biography</i></b>, noted that sometime in 1886 or 1887, an all-Filipino opera company was organized in Pandacan under Bonus&rsquo;s directorship. Among the operas performed by the company were <b><i>Lucrezia Borgia</i></b>,<b><i> Linda di Chamounix</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor</i></b>,<b><i> La Traviata</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Fra Diavolo</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Teodora San Luis was its prima donna. Other soloists included Josefa Tiongson, soprano; Victoria Medina, mezzo-soprano; Andres Ciria Cruz, Pedro Alcantara, and Alejo Natividad, tenors; Domingo Guanzon, baritone; and Eduardo Ciria Cruz and Jose Canseco (who doubled as stage director), basses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the opera company, Bonus also directed the famous Orquesta Feminina de Pandacan, an all women&rsquo;s ensemble immortalized in painting and lithograph by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3548\"><strong>Simon Flores</strong></a> de la Rosa. Organized and managed by Raymundo Fermin, also known as &ldquo;Maestrong Mundo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mundong Bulag,&rdquo; this unique group of singers and instrumentalists actively performed in Pandacan as well as in neighboring towns and provinces. Bonus was also known as a composer, his best-known work being the first full-length Filipino opera, <b><i>SangdugongPanaguinip </i></b>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), which premiered in 1902, with libretto by PedroPaterno. Aside from Bonus, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong> was another musical luminary, but unlike Bonus, Nakpil may have acquired his music knowledge and skills from the Matas who were organists at Quiapo Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because there was no separation between church and state during the Spanish colonial period, the church and its clergy had direct control even of the secular musical culture of Filipinos. The parish curates approved what komedya was to play during fiestas where the popular songs of the day were played as incidental music for <i>intermedios</i> or intermissions. They also founded town musical organizations. Two famous examples of such curates were Fr Eliodoro Chico who produced the first generation of band musicians in Gapan, Nueva Ecija in the 1820s called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4235\"><strong>Zabat Band</strong></a>, and Fr Cipriano Gonzales of Pandacan. Another priest named Jose Zamora even contributed to the advancement of the civic discourse in music by publishing a fundamental music theory tutor book in Tagalog, <b><i>Breve Explicacion de los Principios Elementales de la Musica en Idioma Tagalog </i></b>(Short Introduction to the Elementary Principles of Music in Tagalog), 1888, the only book of its kind in Philippine history. In the preface to the book, Fr Zamora justified the need for such a book, claiming that it was meant for the many musically illiterate indios in his midst, that is, Filipinos who played music <b>oido</b> or &ldquo;by ear.&rdquo; Music literacy in late 19th century quickly spread due to the rapid pace of urbanization in the colony and the rise in demand for band and orchestral music for social occasions. Musical skill became a form of cultural capital because there were so many bands and orchestras that needed performers capable of score and sight reading that such individuals found themselves in great demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as 1885, a musicians&rsquo; union&mdash;Union Artistica Musical&mdash;was in place. This was indicative of the already rich musical life of Philippine cities because the Union created a musicians&rsquo; code of ethics and regulated the amount of their salaries, a sign of the professionalization of the occupation. The reputation of the Filipino musician was so well-established that some of them had been contracted to augment the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a> Municipal Band earlier in the decade. Local orchestras did not only accompany visiting opera and zarzuela companies but also played in solemn masses during church feasts in both Intramuros and the churches in the <i>arrabales</i> such as Quiapo, Santa Cruz, Binondo, San Sebastian, San Miguel, Pandacan, and San Juan del Monte. In 1892, Albert Friedenthal noted that, &ldquo;as musicians the inhabitants have won fame all over the Orient.&rdquo; The district of Pandacan was known in the 19th century as &ldquo;Little Italy&rdquo; because of its many skilled musicians, musical troupes, and orchestras (Ba&ntilde;as 1969, 50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The light classical 19th-century style spread into the far areas of Christian Philippines. European staples such as the balse, danza, and polka, as well as popular overtures like those from <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Tell</i></b>,<b><i> El <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>llo de Hierro </i></b>(The Ring of Iron), and <b><i>Poet and Peasant</i></b>,<b> </b>were familiar to the <b>rondalla</b> and <b>comparza</b>,<b> </b>ensembles of string instruments. While the composition of these ensembles differed from place to place, they usually included the piccolo, bandurria, laud, octavina, guitar, bandola, and <b>bajo de u&ntilde;as</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another ensemble that was to have considerable impact on the music of Spanish Philippines was the brass band. The first bands were organized to provide marching music for the military. In time, this music was also used for all the major civic parades and functions, religious festivals, and processions. As the band grew in popularity, civic organizations and even prominent families organized bands for their pleasure. At the serenata held on the eve of town fiestas, competing bands showed off their technical prowess and dexterity and their knowledge of band repertoire, which included marches and overtures from operas by famous Italian composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An indigenous offshoot of the brass band that deserves some mention is the <b>musikongbumbong</b>. According to local accounts, these groups were attempts by 19th-century nationalists and revolutionaries to create a uniquely Filipino sound. These attempts led to the creation of the all-bamboo ensembles organized along the lines of the marching band, playing music composed by Filipino composers. The members of the St Anthony Original <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Band of Tonsuya, Malabon, Rizal are fourth-generation descendants of a band of Katipunero (Filipino revolutionary) musicians who organized a musikong bumbong ensemble in 1896. Their theme piece,<b><i> Veteranos de la Revolucion </i></b>(Veterans of the Revolution), attributed to an Amando Buencamino, was a typical example of the band music in vogue before the turn of the century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The active careers of 19th-century Filipino musicians trained in Western classical music proved that at that time, the local music scene was already populated by individuals who were well-equipped to staff a musical establishment patterned after that of Spain and the rest of Europe. Aside from the instrumentalists, there was a growing number of skilled composers, increasingly well-versed in Western compositional techniques by the second half of the 19th century. This time though, not only did these composers write music for the church; they also wrote for the literary and musical publics comprised of the growing middle class whose members projected their status in society by buying compositions in the form of sheet music that they played on their pianos imported from Europe. By this time, pianos and violins became important instruments that marked social status. The proliferation of these instruments could be gleaned from the number of shops in Escolta and Quiapo that specialized in repairing the instruments. By the 1890s, Pio Trinidad had already fashioned the first Philippine piano, which was later exhibited in the 1904 St Louis Exposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the last decades of the 19th century, there was a demand for sheet music from the urbanized population who cultivated their own knowledge of arts and culture as part of their <i>urbanidad</i>. The lithographic printer in Manila who printed the first sheet music in the country, the danza habanera &ldquo;La Bella Filipina&rdquo; mentioned in an earlier part of this essay, was the German businessman Oppel. In the 1870s, Fr Pedro Parra published a monumental four or five volume set of religious music, <b><i>Manual Cantoral</i></b>, for the liturgical and extraliturgical use of the Franciscans. A series of music compositions appeared in the <b><i>La Lira</i></b> <b><i>Filipina</i></b> magazine in the 1870s, although no copies have survived. The appearance of secular music in a literary periodical suggests the growing interest in music by subscribers living in a rapidly urbanizing Manila. By the 1870s, musical compositions for public consumption had become part of the local economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most important music print from the last half of 19th century was Diego Perez&rsquo;s 1886 piano medley, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas&rdquo; (Memories of the Philippines). Its importance lies in the fact that it paraphrased Philippine folk songs and dances&mdash;a proto-nationalistic attempt that was affected by the prevailing interest in folklore that journalists Jose Felipe Del Pan and Isabelo de los Reyes pursued in their own writing projects. This was followed by Julio Nakpil&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/986\"><strong>Recuerdos de Capiz</strong></a>&rdquo; (Memories of Capiz), which was so popular that it was reprinted five times by a French publisher. Dolores Paterno, a student of Perez, also printed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/890\"><strong>La Flor de Manila</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Flower of Manila) in 1878.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1890s, the print music industry in Quiapo was already flourishing in the Philippines. Names like Chofre and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a> y Trill became known. But there were other music publishing houses which were not named. &ldquo;Jocelynang Baliuag&rdquo; was believed to have been published in this manner and was circulated in 1896 in the form of sheet music. Aside from &ldquo;Recuerdos de Capiz,&rdquo; Nakpil composed &ldquo;Salve Patria&rdquo; (Save our Homeland), which was based on the Katipuneros&rsquo; anthem &ldquo;MarangalnaDalitngKatagalugan&ldquo; (Noble Hymn of the Tagalog Region). The other prolific composer of print music was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a>, who composed &ldquo;La Tagala&rdquo; (The Tagalog Woman), &ldquo;Natalicio&rdquo; (Birthday), and other popular works in cosmopolitan styles like the gavotte and the <b>tanda de valses</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the last quarter of the 19th century, the growing interest in local customs had kindled an interest in indigenous culture. Scholarly publications by European ethnologists and enthusiasts of Philippine culture such as Wenceslao Retana&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a> Batangue&ntilde;o</i> </b>(The Batangue&ntilde;o Indio) and Manuel Walls y Merino&rsquo;s <b><i>La Musica</i></b> <b><i>Popular de Filipinas</i></b> (Popular Music of the Philippines) provided the first detailed picture of musical life in various parts of the archipelago. Later works by Philippine scholars included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>El Individuo</i></b> <b><i>Tagalo y Su Arte</i></b> (The Tagalog People and Their Art) and Isabelo de los Reyes&rsquo;s <b><i>El Folklore Filipino</i> </b>(Filipino Folklore). Their combined efforts give us insights not only into the forms of Philippine music but the social practices that surrounded the performances of these indigenous forms. The pasyon, the kumintang, and the kundiman were among the most closely studied and described, but other dance songs such as the <b>pandanggo<i> </i></b>and <b>balitaw</b> were also mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Efforts to incorporate local musical elements into original compositions continued well into the early 20th century, accelerating even more in production with the imposition of American capitalist rule. Utilizing local musical melodies, rhythms, and harmonies in an attempt to define and articulate a national music became a feature emulated by later scholars and composers. Fueled by such figures as Epifanio de los Santos and by the nationalist movement in the first half of the century, the preservation and documentation of the native music that had absorbed strong Spanish elements led to the writing of more and more art music based on these forms. In the 1920s and 1930s, composers such as NicanorS.Abelardo, FranciscoSantiago, FranciscoBuencamino, BonifacioAbdon, JuanS.Hernandez, and AntonioJ.Molina were to enshrine the kundiman and its related forms as the embodiment of Philippine music. &ldquo;NasaanKa,Irog?&rdquo; (Where Are You, My Love?) and &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\"><strong>Pakiusap</strong></a></strong>&ldquo; (Plea), both kundiman; &ldquo;MutyangPasig&ldquo; (Muse of Pasig), a kumintang; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/899\"><strong>Hatinggabi</strong></a>&ldquo; (Midnight), a danza habanera; and other so-called classics of the American period actually sprang from and were nurtured by an earlier time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1950s to the present, many Filipino composers of serious music have looked to lowland folk music for inspiration for their own compositions. Many of them built on the melodies of some famous songs such as Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s <b><i>SuitePastorale</i></b>, where the most famous piece, &ldquo;SaUgoyngDuyan&ldquo; (As the Cradle Rocks), was inspired by an Angono lullaby; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3952\"><strong>Bernardino Custodio</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pauli-uli&rdquo; (Repetition), whose passacaglia was based on &ldquo;BahayKubo&rdquo; (Nipa Hut); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Mayon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a></i></b>, whose principal theme was taken from &ldquo;SarungBanggi &ldquo; (One Night); and Redentor Romero&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Portraits</i></b>, which anthologized and interpreted several folk songs. Today, many of the regional folk songs have become popular beyond their places of origin. They have become part of the national song repertoire through choral renditions by vocal ensembles and choirs like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a>; folk dance performances of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han PhilippineDance<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> and the RamonObusanFolkloricGroup which have incorporated songs into their dance suites; choral competitions where the usual repertoire includes Philippine ethnic and folksongs; radio and television programs which feature these songs in contests or as themes; and the physical education courses in the primary and secondary public schools where these songs are taught.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nearly four centuries of Spanish rule brought irrevocable changes to Philippine music. European forms were introduced, taught, and imbedded in the Christianized Filipino&rsquo;s consciousness and psyche. They did not remain simple transplants, for they were not only appropriated by the Filipinos and Filipinized but they were intricately woven into existing indigenous Asian sonic expressions that were organically forced to undergo the process of adaptation and Hispanization. These bidirectional intercultural strains have resulted in an exciting and dynamic soundscape that continues to flourish not only in the countryside that produced these hybrid folk musical forms, but also in the urban centers. These forms have become synonymous with the very identity of the contemporary Filipino who is heir to a rich colonial history.<em><strong>Written by Elena Rivera Mirano, u</strong> </em><em><strong>pdated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

The American regime introduced a new form of government and economic supervision, established a system of public education, and developed a mass culture that promoted various forms of social entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In music, a new influence was introduced during the American colonial period from 1901 to 1946 that continues to be felt to the present. The American influence may be seen in the three types of music which evolved and gained adherence among various levels of Filipino audiences: 1) classical music, which includes both Western classical music and art music composed by Filipinos in the Western classical and modern idioms; 2) semiclassical music, which encompasses stylized folk songs, <b>sarsuwela<i> </i></b>music, hymns and marches, and band and <b>rondalla<i> </i></b>music; and 3) popular music, comprised mainly of music from the <i>bodabil</i> (Filipinized &ldquo;vaudeville&rdquo;) and the movies such as jazz, blues, and novelty songs, along with <b>balitaw</b> and <b>kundiman</b>, which were made accessible to the public through film, recording, print, and radio broadcasting. These categories of music are not entirely exclusive of one another, for even as they differ in form, style, and social function, they nevertheless share the same Western music language, musical contents, and composers. Thus, Nicanor S. Abelardo, Juan S. Hernandez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3942\"><strong>Rodolfo S. Cornejo</strong></a> wrote concert pieces as well as music for the Filipino sarsuwela and dance halls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"historical\" name=\"historical\"></a>Historical Overview</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These Philippine musical forms evolved because of the conditions which provided the reason or context for musical creativity: the establishment of professional music schools which trained and produced musicians and artists of high caliber through formal programs of instruction; the introduction of formal music education in the public school system, which heightened the awareness for music as both artistic and social activity among the people; the proliferation of musical organizations and cultural institutions promoting musical activities and providing opportunities, incentives, and support to Filipino musicians in the fields of composition, performance, teaching, and research; the introduction of new musical idioms and the development of a taste for music related to American popular entertainment and mass culture; the crystallization of a nationalist ideology in music; the introduction of new perspectives and techniques in the study of indigenous musical cultures; and the intensification of printing which facilitated the dissemination of information on Philippine music and the spread of musical activities in Filipino homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Professional Music Schools. </b>The professional training of Filipino musicians was given greater impetus with the institutionalization of the public educational system during the American colonial regime. The religious community still continued to dominate the operation of exclusive schools in the urban areas and centers of population. Except for the state-funded University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music opened in 1916, majority of the music schools were either part of sectarian colleges and universities or private academies. These include the School of Music of St Scholastica&rsquo;s College which had its beginnings in 1906, the Academy of Music of Manila established in 1930, the Manila Conservatory of Music founded in 1934, and the Music Departments of the following colleges: Centro Escolar de Se&ntilde;oritas founded in 1907; Santa Isabel College which opened in 1930; Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) organized in 1939, although music lessons were already being offered as early as 1925; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a>, established before World War II; St Paul College which opened in 1940; and the Philippine Conservatory of Music, an affiliate school of PWU, which operated only during the war years, 1943-4. Worth noting is the establishment of Escuela de Musica de Tabaco by Isidra Villanueva in Albay, 1910, and Academia Santa Cecilia by Lolita Heras in Manila, 1925. The last two signify the individual efforts of private citizens to propagate music education in the provinces in the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American colonial period, music training was no longer the exclusive purview of priests and nuns as it was during the Spanish period but was handled by outstanding Filipino musicians and professional European and American artists, not a few of whom stayed in the Philippines for extended periods of time. Some of the foreign pedagogues of the period were Wallace George, Guy Harrison, Robert Schofield, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a>, Vladimir Elin, Wilma Hillberg, Vassily Prihodko, Edoardo Ferretto, Santino Coppa, Vincenzo Gambardella, Ciro Cavalieri, Josefina Gonzales Salvador, Sr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3901\"><strong>Baptista Battig</strong></a>, OSB, Michael Wexler, Sergei Stupin, Carmen Kleinman, Henry Ore, Regina Feldman, Emma Moore, Julio Esteban Anguita, and Carmen Abella. Among the Filipino musicians who taught voice or instruments were Victorina Lobregat, Rosario Lopez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>, Rosita Sandejas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4216\"><strong>Ernesto Vallejo</strong></a></strong>, Rodolfo Cornejo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from instruction in vocal and instrumental performance, theory courses in harmony, counterpoint, and analysis were also emphasized in professional music schools. At the UP Conservatory of Music, these subjects were taught by both foreign and local personalities, including Guy Harrison, Carlyle Smith, Jeno von Takacs, Nicanor S. Abelardo, Francisco Santiago, Juan S. Hernandez, and Antonino Buenaventura. Due to these developments, the Filipino-composed literature expanded from religious music, short instrumental pieces, <b>kundiman, </b>preludes, arias, and interludes for musical theaters, to such major forms as the opera, concerto, symphony, and sonata. A number of composers were able to study abroad to advance their creative skills such as Francisco Santiago, Nicanor S. Abelardo, and Rodolfo S. Cornejo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Education in the Public Schools. </b>The American colonial government made an effort to advance music literacy among the Filipinos by including the teaching of music in the curriculum of the public school system. Music was taught in relation to social values and the development of artistic consciousness and basic musical skills. In the early decades of the 20th century, music instruction was based mainly on the syllabus of the <b><i>Progressive Music Series</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>with a special edition compiled by Norberto Romualdez and edited by Charles Griffith Jr intended for Philippine schools. The syllabus was in anthology form, containing songs and choruses from the folk song literature of various countries, classical works, and contributions by living American and Filipino composers. The songs were annotated and prescribed according to the needs of the different grade levels. The syllabus emphasized the development of skills in sight singing, and solo and choral singing, and aimed at the growth of the cognitive and affective faculties of the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Organizations and Institutions.</b> Music societies and organizations with a variety of aims ranging from holding concerts and conferences to giving lessons in the different musical disciplines, as well as protecting the interests of music teachers, were known to have existed as early as the 1870s. Formed by professionally trained musicians, art patrons, and enthusiasts, the organizations multiplied and flourished during the American era, providing opportunities, incentives, and support for local musicians in the form of scholarships, competitions, concerts, and commissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Organizations founded before World War II include Centro Artistico, 1901; Centro de Bellas Artes, 1902; Monday <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Club, 1902; Centro de Artistas, 1904; Philippine Musical Association, 1907; Club Euterpe, 1907; Artistico Literario, 1909; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion Musical de Filipinas</strong></a>, 1907, 1919; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4067\"><strong>Manila </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\"><strong>Chamber Music</strong></a> Society</strong>, 1921; Orfeon Filipino, 1921; Smiles Club, 1924; Philippine Philharmonic Association, 1925; Amihan Musical Society, 1927; Choral Art Association, 1930; Pro Arte Trio, 1933; National Federation of Music, 1933; the Philippine Cultural Concerts Society, 1935; Manila Music Lovers&rsquo; Society Inc., 1935; Philippine Society for Chamber Music, 1936; Philippine Society of Oriental Culture, 1940; Camia Musical Society, 1943; Pe&ntilde;aranda Music Lovers&rsquo; Society, 1946; Cabuyao Music Lovers&rsquo; Society, 1946; and Iloilo Musical Association. Except for the last three, all the groups were based in Manila. Many of these organizations sponsored and maintained specific musical groups such as orchestras, bands, and theater companies. The three groups considered to have contributed the most to Philippine musical arts in the 1930s were the Monday Musical Club, the Asociacion Musical de Filipinas, and the Manila Chamber Music Society. Asociacion supported the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> from its founding by Alexander Lippay in 1926 until 1931, after which the orchestra was supported by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4070\"><strong>Manila Symphony Society</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The organizations also presented musical events that were mainly orchestral and choral concerts; piano, vocal, and chamber music recitals; and opera and other theatrical productions. These featured leading Filipino musicians, as well as renowned foreign artists and groups, mostly opera companies. The early years of the American occupation brought in visiting groups from the United States such as Charles Pollard&rsquo;s American and English Comedy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in 1908 and his Juvenile Comic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> a few years before that. A number of opera companies from Europe, mainly from Italy and Spain, continued to present well-loved operas and they also introduced new works for the stage. From 1925-1930, the country welcomed various theater groups from Spain&mdash;Compania Vi&ntilde;as, Gonzales Opera Company, and Compania Iberia&mdash;and the Italian Opera Company from Italy. They staged operas, zarzuelas, and straight plays such as <b><i>La Condeza de Montmartre </i></b>(The Countess of Montmartre), <b><i>Los Gavilanes </i></b>(The Sparrowhawks),<b><i> El Gato Montes </i></b>(The Wild Cat),<b><i> El Pajaro Azul </i></b>(The Blue Bird),<b><i> La Monteria </i></b>(The Hunt),<b><i> Venganza de Buena Ley </i></b>(Revenge of the Good Act),<b><i> El Pardon Municipal </i></b>(Town&rsquo;s Pardon),<b><i> Exhumados <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s </i></b>(Exhumed Memories),<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> La <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a> de Cadiz </i></b>(The March of Cadiz). Prominent instrumentalists and singers also performed in front of Filipino audiences in Manila, Iloilo, Cebu, and Silay. Among the celebrated foreign visitors were Australian soprano Pauline Bindley and her accompanist Ernest Empson in 1917; French-Canadian tenor Paul Dufault in 1917; organist Guy F. Harrison in 1918; American soprano Mary Jordan in 1925; Russian violinist Jascha Heifetz in 1927; violinist Cecilia Hassen and her husband-accompanist Boris Zahkaroff in 1928; soprano Galli Curci in 1929; Spanish tenor Miguel Fleta in 1929; Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia in 1929; French pianist Youra Guller in 1930; and violinist Michael Wexler in 1930. Harrison and Wexler eventually stayed in Manila for a few years to teach at the UP Conservatory of Music and the Academy of Music of Manila, respectively. A few choral groups also came over such as the Swiss Glee Club in 1927 and the Royal Russian Choir of Princess Slaviansky, which was organized in 1845 and embarked on their 77th annual tour of the world in 1928 by visiting the Philippines. A notable production was Manila Chamber Music Society&rsquo;s staging of <b><i>Aida</i></b> by Verdi in the 1930s, with an all-Filipino cast and under the direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>, signaling the emancipation of Filipino productions from its dependence on foreign musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The frequent venues for such performances were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand Opera House</strong></a>, Colegio Medico Farmaceutico Building, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Zorrilla</strong>, and the Casino Espa&ntilde;ol. After its inauguration in 1931, the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong> on Plaza Lawton became the preferred venue for performances. However, the Met was severely damaged at the end of World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Popular Entertainment. </b>The most significant influence of American culture on Philippine musical life is reflected in the popular music movement, which catered to the growing need for entertainment and leisure of a mass audience. American institutions such as the dance hall (cabaret), vaudeville, radio, jukebox, cinema, and later on, the American Broadway theater and television, provided the mediums for disseminating jazz and various types of popular music which were mostly based on prevailing dance music styles and American theater-related songs. Filipinos readily accommodated the popular music culture not only by adopting the institutions and absorbing the American-made models but also by learning the performance practice then composing their own local versions of the different genres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kundiman, balitaw, danza, and other traditional forms continued to be popular since they were first noted by Manuel Walls in 1892. During the American occupation, these genres increasingly became mass-mediated and circulated through print, film, and radio. With the capitalist&rsquo;s concern for profit, popular music truly became a commodity whose overall value was based not only on its artistic attributes but also on its potential to generate commercial and material profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Benefiting from the popularity of theater and its derivatives as the form of mass entertainment in the early years of the 20th century, American record producers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Anderson and Isaac Beck recorded well-loved kundiman and other song forms from the sarsuwela and bodabil. They established representative offices for US-based Victor Records and Columbia Records in the Philippines, and made the kundiman and other song forms available to the masses through recording. Eventually, these recordings were promoted through radio broadcasts from stations such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4867\"><strong>KZEG</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>, and KZRM. By the late 1930s, the movies overtook sarsuwela and bodabil in popularity, and soon after, songs from the movies became the repertoire for recording. Among the early Filipino recording artists were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\"><strong>Maria Carpena</strong></a>, Victorino Carreon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> de la Rama, Katy de la Cruz, Vicente Ocampo, and Tinay Arellano. Odeon Records in Germany engaged famed Filipino opera singers who were in Europe taking advanced studies in voice in the late 1920s and early 1930s and pioneered the recording of Filipino folksongs in Europe. Jovita Fuentes recorded &ldquo;Ay, Kalisud!&rdquo; (Ah, Misery!) and Mercedes Matias recorded &ldquo;Madaling Araw&rdquo; (Dawn) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\"><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong></a>&rdquo; (Maiden of Pasig) for the Odeon label.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Nationalist Ideology in Music. </b>The nationalist sentiment, which was nourished by the reform movement between 1882 and 1896 and the revolutionary movement from 1896 to 1901, resurfaced during the American regime. Philippine nationalism during this period manifested itself in two seemingly irreconcilable tendencies: the first, to affirm one&rsquo;s unique identity as a people, and the second, to take pride in one&rsquo;s ability to assimilate, master and replicate the forms imposed by the colonial regime. In music, Filipino composers continued to master the techniques of writing classical Western music even as they sought to assert their cultural identity and repudiate the symbols of colonial subservience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During World War II, the Japanese exploited the issue of nationalism in Philippine music by promoting Filipino musicians and their works, and indoctrinating the public on the evils of Anglo-American music, more specifically American jazz and popular music. The most prominent Filipino composer during the Japanese occupation was Felipe Padilla de Leon, who was tasked by the Imperial Army to compose the music for the award-winning poem of Catalino S. Dionisio, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> sa Paglikha ng Bagong Filipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of A New Philippines) in 1942. The music de Leon wrote, better known as &ldquo;Tindig, Aking Inang Bayan&rdquo; (Stand Up, My Mother Country), was regarded as the national song of the Philippines during the Japanese period. He was tasked to compose two more songs: &ldquo;Day-atiw ng Kalibapi,&rdquo; the official march of the Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong Filipinas (Organization for Serving the New Philippines), 1943, and &ldquo;Awit ng Magdaragat&rdquo; (Song of the Fisherman), 1944.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Realizing the importance of religion in the life of the Filipinos, the Japanese used it to advance their propaganda by forming the Catholic Unit of the Religious Section, a branch of the Japanese Propaganda Corps of the Imperial Japanese Army. A landmark religious occasion of this time was the celebration of a commemorative mass for the Venerable Lord Justus Ukon Takayama, a Japanese feudal lord who refused to renounce his Christian faith and who was consequently exiled to Manila in the 17th century where he died in 1615. The mass, which was held at the St Vincent de Paul Church on 20 Sep 1942, was aired on KZRH radio station to all the nations that comprised the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to herald a new period of cooperation between the Imperial Army and American and Filipino church authorities. The commemorative mass was marked by the singing of two Japanese nationalistic hymns &ldquo;Nippon Zyunkyosya No Uta&rdquo; (Hymn of Japanese Martyrdom) and &ldquo;Umi Yukada&rdquo; (Yukada Sea) by the seminarians of San Carlos Seminary who were later joined by the entire congregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The Study of Indigenous Philippine Music. </b>Scholarship in the field of culture and the arts was given due attention under the educational and literacy programs of the United States government. It is interesting to note that one of the associations formed during the American colonial regime was the Philippine Society of Oriental Culture. Founded in 1940, one of its aims was to &ldquo;enrich our own music, painting, sculpture, and the body of our literary heritage from the past by studying our own and by drawing from other cultures&rdquo; (Ba&ntilde;as 1975, 165). Initial efforts were made by foreign scholars, mostly anthropologists, who also showed great interest in the music cultures of the non-Christian Filipinos. Some of them were missionaries assigned to Christianize indigenous communities. Among them were Fay Cooper Cole, Albert E. Jenks, Otto Scheerer, James Alexander Robertson, Roy F. Barton, Dean Worcester, and Henry Otley Beyer. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the first serious attempts at analyzing Philippine indigenous music was made by Frances Densmore who came to the conclusion that the music of the Philippine Aeta represents what could be the oldest forms of musical expression in the world. The study was made in connection with the St Louis Exposition of 1904, where native Filipinos were made to present various aspects of their indigenous music and other aspects of their cultural traditions. On the same occasion, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a> wowed American audiences by displaying their musical versatility and a high standard of performance of Western classical music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two important compilations of extensive researches on the Philippines by American scholars were Emma Helen Blair and James A. Robertson&rsquo;s 55-volume <b><i>Philippine Islands, 1493-1898</i></b> published from 1903-9, and Wenceslao Emilio Retana&rsquo;s three-volume <b><i>Aparato Bibliografico de la Historia General de Filipinas</i></b> (Bibliographic Apparatus of the General History of the Philippines) printed in 1906. Filipinos also undertook serious research on Philippine folklore and traditional music at the turn of the 20th century. Interest in the study of folklore and ethnologies among Filipinos began in the late 1880s with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a> and Isabelo de los Reyes&rsquo;s attempts to highlight the precolonial civilization of the Philippines in publications that came out during the propaganda movement led by the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated). The research works included Paterno&rsquo;s <b><i>La Antigua Civilizacion Tagalog </i></b>(The Old Tagalog Civilization), 1887, and <b><i>Los Itas </i></b>(The Aeta), 1890; and de los Reyes&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipinas: Articulos Varios Sobre Etnografia, Historia y Costumbres del Pais </i></b>(Philippines: Various Articles on the Ethnography, History and Traditions of the Country), 1887, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1607\"><strong>El Folk-Lore Filipino</strong></a> </i></b>(Philippine Folklore), 1889. Initial studies such as these reverberated in the later examinations of traditional cultures and musical circumstances of their time by scholars such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\"><strong>Fernando Canon</strong></a>, Alfredo Roa, Epifanio de los Santos, Norberto Romualdez, Francisco Santiago, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>, and Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as during the first half of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fernando Canon published his article &ldquo;Kuriapi&rdquo; in <b><i>Cultura Filipina Revista Mensua Artes I Ciencias</i></b> in 1910, delivered a lecture titled &ldquo;La Musica Filipina en Filipinas&rdquo; in 1921, and printed his article &ldquo;Philippine Music in the Philippines&rdquo; in the 22 Jun 1921 issue of <b><i>La Vanguardia </i></b>(The Vanguard). Alfredo Roa wrote a three-article series featuring the biographies of Filipino musicians and composers of his time titled &ldquo;De Nuestra Musica y Nuestros Musicos&rdquo; (Of Our Music and Our Musicians), 1927. Epifanio de los Santos published &ldquo;Literatura Tagala&rdquo; (Tagalog Literature) in 1909, and &ldquo;Folk-Lore Musical de Filipinas&rdquo; after 1914. In 1931, Judge Norberto Romualdez presented his collection of Philippine indigenous instruments as well as transcriptions of some native songs in a public lecture at UP. Antonio J. Molina and Francisco Santiago, the first Filipino director of the UP Conservatory of Music, also contributed essays on folk music. Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as&rsquo; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1036\"><strong>The Music and Theater of the Filipino People</strong></a></i></b>, 1924, presented the various facets of Philippine musical culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the summers of 1934 to 1938, a research team composed of composer Antonino Buenaventura, dancer Francisca Reyes-Tolentino, and her husband photographer Ramon Tolentino recorded the folk music and dances from the different parts of the archipelago under a cultural committee organized and mandated by UP president Jorge Bocobo. The collected materials were later stylized in folk dance productions for the UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> and Dance Group by Buenaventura and Reyes-Tolentino according to existing norms of Western music and dance. The wealth of information on Philippine native music that was realized through these researches opened fresh musical perspectives and offered new possibilities in the modern Filipino&rsquo;s search for a cultural identity in the interest of nationalism. The collected data did not only provide musical materials for use in new compositions but were also sources of musical thought that were rooted in the traditional Asiatic cultures of the Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Printing and Dissemination of Philippine Music. </b>The dissemination of Philippine music and music scholarship was accelerated through printing, particularly through the daily newspapers, periodic journals, pamphlets, and books. Newspaper articles on music included announcements of musical events, feature articles on musicians, new compositions, criticism, pictures, and serialized versions of long documents pertaining to music. Jose Felipe del Pan opened his Imprenta de la Oceania Espa&ntilde;ola in the late 19th century, and Isabelo de los Reyes&rsquo;s printing press published daily newspapers such as <b><i>La Lectura Popular</i></b> (The Popular Reading) and <b><i>El Ilocano </i></b>(The Ilokano). Their printing presses were active until the first decades of the 20th century. Other important newspapers during the American period were <b><i>La Opinion</i></b>,<b><i> El Debate</i></b>,<b><i> La Vanguardia</i></b>,<b><i> El Renacimiento</i></b>,<b><i> El Pueblo</i></b>,<b><i> Taliba</i></b>,<b><i> Philippine Herald</i></b>, <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>ne</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> The Manila Times</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many new music pieces were also printed during this time, bringing the works of Filipino composers into the homes of music enthusiasts. Printed pieces for piano solo, voice and piano, chamber music, and choral music proliferated and were distributed by music stores such as La Lira Almacen de Musica in Escolta, owned by Blas Echegoyen. Coupled with the popularity of the piano, guitar, and harp as household instruments, the availability of printed sheet music created an encouraging atmosphere for amateur music-making in Manila and contributed to the unprecedented advancement of music during the American period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"classical\" name=\"classical\"></a>Classical Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Americans took over the reins of the Philippine government, they found a vibrant cultural life that was characterized by a highly Westernized artistic environment. Filipino painters, writers, and musicians had already learned the techniques of producing worthy replicas of European art forms during the Spanish period. In music, Filipino performers&mdash;singers, instrumentalists, and conductors&mdash;were already active in the performances of Western zarzuela<b> </b>and operas being staged by visiting foreign companies, even as the Filipino sarsuwela were already being written, composed, and produced by Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Western Classical Music</b>. The influence of European classical music was made stronger by visits of individual foreign artists before and after the American occupation. The more notable visitors included violinists Agustin Rubio who was a pupil of Nicolo Paganini, Eduardo Remenyi, Mischa Elman, guitarist Andres Segovia, pianist-composer Rudolf Friml, and cellists Regina Feldman and Pierre Fournier. At the same time, a number of Filipino musicians that included Jovita Fuentes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4193\"><strong>Isang Tapales</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\"><strong>Ramon Tapales</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3861\"><strong>Dalisay Aldaba</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3996\"><strong>Conchita Gaston</strong></a>, Mercedes Matias, Federico Elizalde, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a> achieved prominence abroad. Recitals and concerts featured mostly European music from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods, while serious music theater leaned towards the operas of Giuseppe Verdi (<b><i>Aida</i></b>,<b><i> Il Trovatore</i></b>,<b><i> La</i></b> <b><i>Traviata</i></b>),<b><i> </i></b>Giacomo Puccini (<b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>,<b><i> La Boheme</i></b>),<i> </i>Gaetano Donizetti (<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor</i></b>), Georges Bizet (<b><i>Carmen</i></b>),<b><i> </i></b>and Pietro Mascagni (<b><i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i></b>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Filipino Works in Western Classical Idiom. </b>At the beginning of the 20th century, Filipino composers took pride in having cultivated the ability to write operas, symphonies, and concertos&mdash;symbols of European high art in the field of music. A survey of the literature written in the first half of the 20th century shows that the treatment of the standard classical forms was basically programmatic or descriptive. The abstract aspects of Western music were hardly explored. Only a few symphonies in the traditional three- to four-movement formats were actually written. Among these are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipinas Symphony</i></b>, 1928; Francisco Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Taga-ilog Symphony </i></b>(From the River Symphony),<b><i> </i></b>1938; and Rodolfo Cornejo&rsquo;s <b><i>The Allies Symphony</i></b>, 1943. Nicanor S. Abelardo wrote <b><i>Sinfonniette</i></b> in 1932 and left a symphony unfinished due to his untimely death in 1934. A few of the symphonic works in concerto form included Abelardo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> in B-flat Minor,</i></b> 1923; Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto in B-flat Minor</i></b>, 1924; Hernandez&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Concerto in D Minor</i></b>, 1939; and Cornejo&rsquo;s <b><i>First Piano Concerto in D Minor</i></b>, 1933.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One-movement orchestral works proliferated and they came in the form of overtures, symphonic poems, suites, and fantasies.

The result was the following seven symphonic poems: <b><i>Rizal en el Alba de la Vida</i></b> (Rizal at the Dawn of Life) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>; <b><i>Rizal Bajo el Manto de Minerva</i></b> (Rizal under the Cloak of Minerva) by Crispino Reyes Mijares; <b><i>Rizal Sobre el Pegaso</i></b> (Rizal on Pegasus) by Tereso Zapata; <b><i>Rizal Cruzado de la Patria</i></b> (Rizal Crusader of the Country) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4008\"><strong>Juan Hernandez</strong></a>; <b><i>Rizal en Las Tristezas de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/447\"><strong>Dapit</strong></a>an</i></b> (Rizal in the Sorrows of Dapitan) by Gavino Carluen; <b><i>Rizal en Su Ultima Noche</i></b> (Rizal on His Last Night) by Antonio Escamilla; and <b><i>Rizal Glorificado </i></b>(Rizal Glorified) by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another genre favored by the Filipino composers was chamber music. Works in this genre included Francisco Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>String Quartet in G Major, </i></b>1924, and <b><i>Remembrance for Violin, Cello and Piano</i></b>, 1930; Nicanor S.

Numerous solo piano pieces composed included Rodolfo Cornejo&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Sonata</i></b>, 1929; Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s <b><i>Sonata in G Major</i></b>, 1921, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/889\"><strong>First Nocturne</strong></a>,&rdquo; 1921, and &ldquo;Valse in D Flat,&rdquo; 1922; Antonio Molina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scherzo in D,&rdquo; 1923, &ldquo;Impressiones,&rdquo; 1927, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/937\"><strong>Malikmata</strong></a>&rdquo; (Phantasm), 1939, &ldquo;A Dove Came Down in Sunshine,&rdquo; 1941, &ldquo;Camia,&rdquo; 1942, and &ldquo;Dancing Fool,&rdquo; 1942; Lucino Sacramento&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prelude and Fugue,&rdquo; 1934, &ldquo;A Song Without Words,&rdquo; 1934, and &ldquo;Romance in B flat,&rdquo; 1939; Amada Santos Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Sonata in D Flat</i></b>, 1942, &ldquo;Impromptu,&rdquo; 1942, and &ldquo;Romance in G,&rdquo; 1943; Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sayaw ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a>&rdquo; (Igorot Dance), 1939, &ldquo;To a Flower,&rdquo; 1942, and &ldquo;Song of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a>,&rdquo; 1943; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4014\"><strong>Lorenzo Ilustre</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Recuerdo a Un Amor&rdquo; (Memory of a Beloved), 1900, &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\"><strong>Jota</strong></a></strong> Rizal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Banahaw,&rdquo; &ldquo;Funebre&rdquo; (Funeral March), &ldquo;Rosal Danza,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tagala Batangue&ntilde;a&rdquo; (Batangas Lady), ca 1920.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The appropriation of Western forms by American-educated Filipino composers such as Abelardo, Santiago, and Cornejo drastically changed the listening habits of the Filipino people. Classicism was introduced to the masses through large orchestral works such as symphonies and concertos, as well as through miniature piano pieces that echoed well-loved Romantic favorites such as Chopin and Debussy. The audience started to appreciate long concerts that featured abstract instrumental music as an alternative to the more popular sarsuwela and bodabil. It was also a period when the kundiman was elevated into an art form through the delicate marriage of poetry and music in the works of Filipino composers such as Bonifacio Abdon, Nicanor S. Abelardo, and Francisco Santiago and their lyricists like Jose Corazon de Jesus and Deogracias A. Rosario. Through their works, this particular song genre developed into the classical kundiman. Representing a high point in musical romanticism and chromatic harmonic writing, the kundiman art song was exemplified by Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/960\"><strong>Nasaan Ka Irog?</strong></a>&rdquo; (Where Are You My Love?), 1923, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/918\"><strong>Kundiman ng </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Kundiman of Tears), 1924, &ldquo;Magbalik Ka Hirang&rdquo; (Come Back, My Love) and &ldquo;Pahimakas&rdquo; (Last Farewell), 1925, and &ldquo;Mutya ng Pasig&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig), 1926; and Santiago&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kundiman&rdquo; (Love Song), 1917, &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\"><strong>Pakiusap</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Plea), 1921, &ldquo;Ang Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Love), 1922, and &ldquo;Alaala Kita&rdquo; (I Remember You), 1929.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The large repertoire of music for stage included major operas and operettas like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\"><strong>Ladislao Bonus</strong></a>&rsquo; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\"><strong>Sangdugong Panaguinip</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), 1902; Jose Estella&rsquo;s <b><i>Veni</i></b>,<b><i> Vidi</i></b>,<b><i> Vici </i></b>(I Came, I Saw, I Conquered), 1904; Gavino Carluen&rsquo;s <b><i>Gayuma </i></b>(Love Potion), 1902; and Rodolfo Cornejo&rsquo;s operetta,<b><i> Together, </i></b>1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the same time that the nationalist movement in Philippine music was being realized mainly through works in chromatic harmony, developments in European and American contemporary music also reached the consciousness of several Filipino composers. Early contact with 20th-century music was made through the few local musicians who trained in the West, as well as foreign teachers and artists who came to settle or worked in the Philippines. The music of important Western composers such as Stravinsky, De Falla, Prokofiev, Ravel, Debussy, Shostakovitch, and Khatchaturian gradually found their place in recital and concert programs, in spite of some resistance on the part of teachers and audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nicanor S. Abelardo, upon his return from his studies in the United States, was the first to break away from traditional musical idioms and to apply a new harmonic language in his landmark compositions <b><i>Cinderella Overture</i></b>,<b><i> Sinfonietta for Strings</i></b>,<b><i> Panoramas</i></b>,<i> </i>and other works written in and after 1931. Abelardo&rsquo;s modern style of writing showed the strong influence of the expressionist school of Arnold Schoenberg, characterized by ambiguous tonalities, long-drawn and disjunct melodic lines, and polyrhythmic structures. His early death in 1934 prevented what could have been an earlier spread of modernism in Philippine art music. Having established himself as a highly respected pedagogue, Abelardo could have very easily disseminated knowledge of modern music to his disciples. In the years immediately following the death of Abelardo, a number of compositions were written with some elements of early 20th-century idioms. Highly precipitous rhythms and dissonances were used by Ramon Tapales in the &ldquo;Savage Dance&rdquo; of his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/980\"><strong>Philippine Suite</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1937. Ambiguous and dissonant tonalities were also used by Antonio J. Molina in his piano pieces &ldquo;Malikmata&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b>(Phantasm), 1939, and &ldquo;Dancing Fool,&rdquo; 1942, while impressionist tonal structures served as main texture materials in Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s symphonic works <b><i>Rhapsodietta on a Manobo Theme, </i></b>1937, <b><i>By the Hillside</i></b>, 1941,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Youth</i></b>, 1946.<i> </i>In these works, however, the modern elements were used more as coloristic dressing and programmatic effects rather than as part of an acquired language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"semi\" name=\"semi\"></a>Semiclassical Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino popular music of the 20th century covers a wide range of forms: folk songs, music from the Filipino theater and films, songs and ballads, band music, rondalla music, and the newly introduced American song and dance genres such as jazz, blues, Charleston, and fox-trot. They were made popular through the most common form of entertainment during the American period: theater, film, and radio. With the exposure of the mass audiences to entertainment music of various types, Philippine popular music became a major industry and a source of commercial profit for entrepreneurs and musicians alike. This body of music was widely disseminated in lowland centers of population and was usually heard in semiformal musical events like open-air concerts, programs, parades, singing contests, in the electronic media, and, on rare occasions, in formal concerts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Folk Songs. </b>The field collection of folk songs undertaken in the 1920s and the 1930s yielded a substantial body of regional songs from different language groups all over the country. Initially transcribed in Western staff notation, many of these were arranged for chorus and published as educational materials for the school system. These songs were later popularized in musical performances that called for native music, including folk dance presentations. One of the first anthologies that contained Filipino folk songs was the <b><i>Progressive Music Series</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>where traditional tunes such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/878\"><strong>Comintang de la Conquista</strong></a>&rdquo; (Comintang of the Conquest) and &ldquo;Cachucha&rdquo; were harmonized by Norberto Romualdez. The book also contained songs with named composers such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/890\"><strong>La Flor de Manila</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Flower of Manila) attributed to Dolores Paterno and &ldquo;Nena&rsquo;s Lullaby&rdquo; by Francisco Buencamino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music for Theater. </b>Early Philippine theater forms such as the <b>komedya</b> and the sarsuwela served as sources of light entertainment music. Although music played an incidental role in the komedya, it nevertheless fulfilled certain functions&mdash;providing an overture; accompanying the dances, fight scenes, entrances and exits of principal personalities; providing background to sentimental scenes; and breaking the monotony of the straight dialogue format with some sung parts. Instrumental ensembles such as the <b>comparza</b><i> </i>(plucked instruments) or a small band of wind instruments and drums always complemented komedya productions. Signature music for the choreographed battle between Christians and Muslims was the &ldquo;Himno de Riego,&rdquo; a march in 6/8 time which was continuously repeated until the fight was over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spanish zarzuela was adapted in the Tagalog region as well as in other parts of the country like Pampanga, Ilocos, Bicol, and the Visayas.

The bodabil was an entertaining variety show that featured brassy American songs, dances, comedy skits, and circus acts, while the talking picture presented melodramas, comedies, and musicals in a new form featuring a motion picture with synchronized sound. By the 1930s, many film studios were founded, among which were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\"><strong>Filippine Films</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\"><strong>Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\"><strong>LVN Pictures</strong></a>, and X&rsquo;Otic Films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese occupation, there was an attempt to revive the then moribund zarzuela to offset the Japanese ban on Anglo-American entertainment music.

The popularity of these songs stemmed not only from the amount of exposure they enjoyed in the media, but also from a structural simplicity that made the music easy even for amateur musicians to perform. The latter repertoire was characterized by dance-oriented rhythms like those of the <b>balse</b>, tango, balitaw, danza, and fox-trot. The melodies were lyrical yet simple, sometimes folk song-like; and their lyrics were in traditional 19th century Tagalog style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few of the well-loved sarsuwela arias which became popular included Jose Estella&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/943\"><strong>Ang Maya</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Sparrow) from <b><i>Filipinas para los Filipinos</i></b>;<b><i> </i></b>Leon Ignacio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nabasag ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>Banga</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Clay Jar Was Broken) from <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b>;<i> </i>Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Beautiful Star) from <b><i>Dakilang Punglo</i></b>;<b><i> </i></b>and Juan S.

Tracing its roots to the regimental music in the Spanish garrisons, the local band has become an indispensable feature in military affairs, town fiestas, and other community events. Its extensive repertoire includes music for parades, folk theater like the komedya and <i>sinakulo</i>, social dancing in town plazas and cabarets, religious and funeral processions, as well as indoor and outdoor concerts. A particular band&rsquo;s musical prowess is tested during competitions in the traditional serenatas that are held within the nine-day period before the actual celebration of a town fiesta. In this competition, the depth of one&rsquo;s repertoire in terms of quantity and degree of difficulty receives equal rating as the musical and artistic quality of the performance. A standard concert program usually includes marches for warming up, concert overtures, medleys of folk songs or popular tunes, character pieces, concertante<b> </b>compositions (with soloist/s), and symphonic works. The latter are usually band adaptations of well-known orchestral pieces by Western composers like R. Wagner&rsquo;s <b><i>Tannhauser Overture</i></b>, G. Rossini&rsquo;s <b><i>William Tell</i></b>, F. von Suppe&rsquo;s <b><i>Light Cavalry Overture</i></b>.<b> </b>In some instances, an enterprising band would attempt to play formidable works such as Dimitri Shostakovitch&rsquo;s <b><i>Symphony No. 5</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine band as an institution produced hundreds of outstanding musicians during the American regime. The Philippine Constabulary Band under General Walter S. Loving received the highest accolades at the St Louis Exposition in 1904 and was later invited to play during the inauguration of Pres William Taft in 1909 and at the Panama Canal Exposition in 1915. During the American period, weekly concerts at the public parks such as Luneta and Binondo were given by the Philippine Constabulary Band and the 7th and the 30th Infantry Bands. Right up to the 1920s, they were performing standard band repertoire from Western composers, ending their program with the playing of the &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo; By 1925, works of Filipino composers began to be included in their repertoire such as Pedro Navarro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Olimpia,&rdquo; 1925, &ldquo;Enharmonica Chromatica March,&rdquo; 1927, and &ldquo;Resident Commissioner Osias March,&rdquo; 1929; Lakandazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhapsodical Overture,&rdquo; 1925, and &ldquo;Atong Awit: Visayan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>s,&rdquo; 1926; and Antonio Escamilla&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philippine Airs,&rdquo; 1927.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the same time, civilian bands proliferated in towns all over the country. Some of the outstanding ensembles that flourished at the turn of the century were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4235\"><strong>Zabat Band</strong></a>, the Pe&ntilde;aranda Band of Nueva Ecija, the Pasig Band, and the Banda Arevalo. The Banda Arevalo, founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3413\"><strong>Bonifacio Arevalo</strong></a> and based in Quiapo, was reported to have received a compensation of 2,000 dollars per month in 1904 as it was alternating with the 7th and 30th Infantry Bands and the Philippine Constabulary Band in rendering concerts at the Luneta Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It should be noted that many of the classical music composers received early musical training as band members or as members of a band musician&rsquo;s family. Prominent among them were Alfredo S. Buenaventura, Antonino Buenaventura, Felipe Padilla de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>, Hilarion F. Rubio, Lucino T. Sacramento, Lucio D. San Pedro, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a>. Local composers wrote many Philippine marches commemorating the important events in the country&rsquo;s political history. These included <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Salve Patria&rdquo; (Save the Homeland), 1903, and &ldquo;Victory March,&rdquo; 1944; Lorenzo Ilustre&rsquo;s &ldquo;Imno al Recibimiento de los Restos del <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a>&rdquo; (Hymn at the Reception of the Remains of Apolinario Mabini), 1921; Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s &ldquo;Triumphal March,&rdquo; 1930; Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Triumphal March,&rdquo; 1937, &ldquo;Martsa ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (March of the New Philippines), 1942, and &ldquo;Victory in Parade,&rdquo; 1943; and Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magiliw&rdquo; (Affectionate) Symphonic March, 1947.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Larger works for band consisted mostly of concert overtures, concertante pieces, tone poems, and even symphonies like Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s<b><i> Overture in B-flat Major</i></b>, 1935;<b><i> </i></b>Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Fantasy for Trombone and Band</i></b>, 1932;<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> </i></b>Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Echoes from the Philippines</i></b>, 1938, <b><i>Dedication</i></b>, 1940, and <b><i>The Corps on Parade</i></b>, 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the bands, another favorite ensemble among the native musicians for light classical music playing was the <b>rondalla</b>, a group consisting of plectrum instruments which evolved from the Spanish <b>murga</b><i> </i>(band of street musicians) and the <b>estudiantina</b><i> </i>(student musical groups). During the American period, it was more popularly known as the comparza<i> </i>and it was made up of five to six plucked string varieties, which included the bandurria, octavina, <b>laud</b>, guitar, and double bass. The comparza&rsquo;s wide repertoire ranged from native folk tunes and ballroom music to classical pieces, including operatic overtures. Early pieces for the rondalla repertoire included the &ldquo;Romance&rdquo; from Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo; <b><i>Samson and Delilah</i></b>;<b><i> </i></b>H. von Tizler&rsquo;s &ldquo;All Alone,&rdquo; and Czibulka&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Dream After the Ball.&rdquo; Locally composed and adapted pieces consisted of marches and folk songs like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\"><strong>Paruparong Bukid</strong></a>&rdquo; (Country Butterfly), &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Nipa Hut), &ldquo;Lawiswis Kawayan&rdquo; (Murmuring Bamboo) in mambo, cha-cha, and calypso rhythms, as well as love songs such as &ldquo;Bakya Mo, Neneng&rdquo; (Your Wooden Clogs, Neneng) and &ldquo;Tapis Mo, Inday&rdquo; (Your Skirt, Inday). Some of the outstanding groups in the first four decades of the 20th century were the all-girl Comparsa Santa Cecilia, 1908; Rondalla Ideal of Antonio J. Molina, 1909; Comparsa Gumamela and Rondalla Apollo of Juan Silos Jr; and the Yellow Taxi Rondalla, 1940, which was supervised by Antonio J. Molina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"popular\" name=\"popular\"></a>Popular Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular music was first heard in the dance halls called <i>kabaret </i>and in bodabil shows, which combined slapstick-comedy acts, tap-dance numbers, skits with renditions of popular songs, and even serious kundiman. In the dance halls, live orchestras and dance bands played the latest dance rhythms such as the fox-trot, swing, Charleston, tango, and waltz. Some of the instrumental groups that specialized in dance music were the Abelardo Orchestra which played at the Santa Ana Cabaret, the Ilaya Orchestra managed by Santiago A. Cruz, the Batangas Rizal Orchestra conducted by Lorenzo Ilustre, and the groups of Juan Silos Jr, Tito Arevalo, and Serafin Payawal. Aside from the Santa Ana Cabaret, other famous cabarets in the 1930s were the La Loma Cabaret in Rizal and the Lerma Park Cabaret in Caloocan. They were also referred to as dancing pavilions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bodabil provided a venue for song and dance performances, among others, which helped popularize American entertainment, particularly jazz and fox-trot. In 1920, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\"><strong>Lou Borromeo</strong></a> founded the first Filipino bodabil company, Borromeo&rsquo;s Follies, which featured an orchestral band that played jazz music at the Manila Grand Opera House, the Philippine Carnival, and other theaters. He is credited for having popularized the big band jazz sound in the country, and his compositions included &ldquo;My Beautiful Philippines,&rdquo; 1921, and &ldquo;Manila Mia&rdquo; (My Manila) and &ldquo;Oh! Pancho,&rdquo; 1922. Borromeo&rsquo;s bodabil company also boosted the careers of many stage performers such as Katy de la Cruz, Diana Toy, Miami Salvador, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2424\"><strong>Bayani Casimiro</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\"><strong>Canuplin</strong></a>. Other prominent jazz bands in the era of the bodabil in the 1920s were the Oriental Syncopators, headed by Santiago Suarez; the Nifties, led by Vitang Escobar; and Electric <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a>, which performed in different venues such as the Luz, Rizal, and Zorrilla Theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both foreign and local songs were performed in bodabil productions, and among the popular tunes in the 1920s-30s were &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t We Got Fun,&rdquo; &ldquo;Second-Hand Rose,&rdquo; &ldquo;All By Myself,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Man,&rdquo; &ldquo;April Showers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Careless Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let Me Call You Sweetheart,&rdquo; &ldquo;You are My Sunshine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ma, He&rsquo;s Making Eyes at Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blue Hawaii,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ramona,&rdquo; &ldquo;Magandang Juaning&rdquo; (Beautiful Juaning), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\"><strong>Balut</strong></a>-Penoy&rdquo; (Duck Eggs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Similar to sarsuwela&rsquo;s migration into the movies, many of the songs from well-loved sarsuwela also enjoyed airtime on the newly established radio stations. Among the earliest radio stations were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4870\"><strong>KZKZ</strong></a>, established by Henry Herman in 1924; KZIB, founded by Isaac Beck in 1925; KZRM, 1927; and the first radio station in Cebu, KZRC, 1929. These radio stations aired reports, press news, sports news, religious services, advertisements, educational programs, and music. Live singing and drama renditions took a big percentage of airtime, and by the 1930s, much of the radio personalities enjoyed celebrity status comparable to movie stars. Among these were singers <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>, Priscilla the Kolynos Girl, Alma Corro, Ramon Escudero, Diana Toy, Ramon Alberto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>, Enya Gonzales, Dalisay Aldaba, Conchita Gaston, Tinay Arellano, Dionisia Castro, Vicente Ocampo, Katy dela Cruz, Atang dela Rama, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\"><strong>Cecil Lloyd</strong></a>, more popularly known as &ldquo;the Mystery Singer.&rdquo; They sang foreign and local songs, and the airing of kundiman and balitaw revived the popularity of these Philippine musical traditions such that a few of the local singers were even brought to the United States to record them. Some of the Tagalog favorites were &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\"><strong>Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Only Love), &ldquo;Dahil Sa Iyo&rdquo; (Because of You), &ldquo;Paalam sa Pagkadalaga&rdquo; (Farewell to Maidenhood), &ldquo;Ang Dalagang Filipina&rdquo; (The Filipino Maiden), &ldquo;Aking Bituin&rdquo; (My Star), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a>?&rdquo; (Will You Remember?), recorded by prominent Filipino singers such as Tinay Arellano, Maria Carpena, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3931\"><strong>Victorino Carrion</strong></a>, Katy dela Cruz, and Atang de la Rama under Victor or Columbia Records. Other early Filipino popular music compositions popularized via the radio and variety shows consisted of folk songs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1000\"><strong>Sarung Banggi</strong></a>&rdquo; (One Night) and &ldquo;Bahay Kubo&rdquo; (Nipa Hut), arranged in dance rhythms and movie theme songs. These compositions were published as sheet music by such companies as the St Cecilia Chamber of Music and Jose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a> Successors and sold at leading music outlets such as Fajardo Music Store, Ideal Music Store, Philippine Music Store, and Nanawa&rsquo;s Music Store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese Occupation, jazz and popular dance music were banned by the government, which branded them as symbols of American cultural decadence. After World War II, the resurgence of popular music introduced new dance styles such as samba, rhumba, guarracha, appalachicola, and mambo. The jukebox was a principal conduit in popularizing music from the United States. Most of the styles of the immediate postwar period were derived from Latin American dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine music in the American period shows how Filipino composers have appropriated the Western idiom earlier introduced during the Spanish colonial period in creating works that represented their mastery of the musical language of the Western colonizers in their quest to bring the Filipino composer at par with international standards. Their efforts resulted in the two-fold direction of bringing out the Philippine soul in their musical output: the Filipinization of western genres through the use of folk materials in composing concertos, symphonies, chamber music, operas, among others, and the westernization of existing Filipino musical forms such as the elevation of the kundiman into an art song and its popularization, together with other indigenous traditional forms such as the danza and balitaw, due to the advent of film and radio.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P.

The population boomed, and economic growth ensued. The old social order before World War II that supported the few rich&mdash;the oligarchs&mdash;was restored in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the context of music as a cultural product, the burgeoning middle class, comprising what one would call &ldquo;civil society,&rdquo; continued to patronize classical music from the West and supported activities of music institutions, especially music education, through musical organizations that mushroomed in a society wanting an appearance of stability. The Philippine government invested in the arts, especially the conservative classical music type, in order to reestablish the old social order (Attali 2003; Small 2007). Thus, conservativism became the distinctive character of this period, especially from 1946 to 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, another characteristic of the period, the move towards democratization and Filipinization of music, became visible from 1960 to 1970. After 1946, infrastructure rebuilding resumed, boosting the manufacturing sector and developing educational and social services that created opportunities for many people to climb the social ladder. As a result, new aspirants to the upper status group&mdash;the middle class&mdash;arrived. They bought commodities like records, record players, radio, and TV sets and gained access to American popular culture. It was in the first Philippine Republic that the first Filipino recording company was born, leading to the propagation of American cultural products. However, even as American culture was propagated, many Filipinos continued to work for the independence of the country from the United States. Their efforts were supported by artists who sought to define a native Filipino culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Civic Organizations</b>. While many private associations had been organized to support musical activities during the years before the war, the government became more actively involved in the promotion of culture, establishing state institutions that oversaw activities in support of the arts, with emphasis on music. Following the creation of the United Nations and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Music Council (IMC) was instituted as one of the artistic advisory bodies, and the UNESCO encouraged member nation-states to establish their own National Music Councils. Thus the Philippine National Music Council was organized in 1953 under the auspices of the UNESCO &ndash; IMC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jun 1955, under Republic Act No 1370, the government established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a>, which offered scholarships so that gifted young artists could study in the Philippines and abroad. The foundation was headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>. Occasionally, it sponsored opera productions and concerts in different venues in Metro Manila. The organization also published <b><i>An Album of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\"><strong>Art Song</strong></a>s</i></b>, which contained 27 works by 17 composers&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3848\"><strong>Rosalina Abejo</strong></a>, Nicanor S.

Also in 1955, the Philippine Music Educators Group was founded by leading music educators under its first president, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M.

The first national and international conferences were held that year with the intent to advance musical discourse and enhance the understanding of the role of music in society. The First Regional Conference of Southeast Asia was held in Aug 1955, organized by the Philippine government in cooperation with the International Music Council headed by its President Stuart Wilson and with the assistance of the Asia Foundation and the UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines. With the theme &ldquo;Understanding Our Neighbours Through Music,&rdquo; the conference drew participants from Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, West and East Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Ramon Tapales was the Chairman of the Regional Commission of Southeast Asia and the President of the National Music Council of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first major international music symposium that was held in Manila was &ldquo;Musics of Asia,&rdquo; which was organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> under the auspices of the International Music Council and the UNESCO in 1966. The symposium conjoined the two disciplines of ethnomusicology and composition, and was attended by renowned musicologists and composers such as W.D. Amaradeva of Sri Lanka; Chou Wen Chung of China and the USA; Shigeo Kishibe and Yuji Takahashi from Japan; Ton de Leeuw from Holland; Mantle Hood, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Malm, David Norton, and Robert Garfias from the USA; Rulan Chiao Pian from China; Ravi Shankar from India; Prasidh Silapabanleng from Thailand; Tran Van Khe from Vietnam; Tsai Ping Liang from Taiwan; and Iannis Xenakis from Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From its founding in 1953, the National Music Council also organized conferences with themes such as &ldquo;Revitalizing Music for Contemporary Living&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Role of Music in a Changing Society.&rdquo; Aside from holding conferences, the National Music Council also served as the umbrella organization for specialized groups that were later established, which included the Piano Teachers Guild of the Philippines, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4120\"><strong>Philippine Choral Society</strong></a>, the Jeunesses <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>es (in affiliation with its international mother organization), the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4126\"><strong>Philippine Society for Music Education</strong></a> (PSME), the LFC, the Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas (PASAMBAP), the Philippine Association of Recording Industries (PARI), and the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3987\"><strong>FILSCAP</strong></a>). Although the FILSCAP was organized by Felipe Padilla de Leon Sr, an art music composer, it later became a copyright agency, primarily for popular songs in the music industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Government Initiatives</b>. Meanwhile, the national government established the Republic Cultural Heritage Award to honor distinguished artists, especially in literature and music. The composers who received the award for their works were Lucrecia Kasilag in 1960 and 1966, Antonino Buenaventura in 1961, Lucio San Pedro in 1962, Eliseo M. Pajaro in 1964 and 1970, Antonio Molina in 1965 and 1972, Rosalina M. Abejo in 1967, Jose Maceda in 1968<i>, </i>Felipe Padilla de Leon in 1971, and Alfredo Santos Buenaventura in 1972. The award gave way to the National Artist Award in April 1972 by virtue of Proclamation No. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>1 issued by then President Ferdinand Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The late 1960s saw the growing involvement of the national government in the promotion of the arts. Then First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Romualdez Marcos focused on the appreciation and the cultivation of music as her priority program. Under her initiative, the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) was built amidst protests from political opposition and inaugurated in 1969 with a festival of different musical and dance activities that featured both international and local artists. It premiered such works as Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s drama-tableux<b><i> Dularawan: Salakot na Ginto</i></b> (Image Play: The Golden Salakot) and Eliseo Pajaro&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/168\"><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></a></i></b> ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Headed by Jaime Zobel de Ayala and later by composer Lucrecia Kasilag who was its artistic director from 1969 to 1986, the CCP was responsible for: 1) the dramatic increase in the production of new commissioned works (symphonic, chamber music, and ballet music) by members of the LFC which were premiered in an annual Philippine Music Festival; 2) the hosting or funding of international and national music festivals, conferences, symposia, and summer music camps; 3) the production of full length operas such as <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, <b><i>Tosca</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor</i></b>, <b><i>The Magic Flute</i></b>, <b><i>La Traviata</i></b>, <b><i>La Boheme</i></b>, <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Touch Me Not), and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Subversion), the latter two by Felipe Padilla de Leon; and 4) the establishment of the CCP Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (now <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong>) which commissioned many original works for their performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Education. </b>In Philippine music, the government took the initiative in supporting and promoting the activities of musical artists. Congress passed the Music Law in 1966 (Republic Act 4723) directing all public schools to teach music as a regular subject in the curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The major effort to improve music literacy among the Filipinos begun by the American colonial government was later continued by local music educators. The passing of the Music Law spawned various endeavours towards the improvement and development of music teaching in the Philippines. In-service trainings for music teachers were held by the Bureau of Public Schools (BPS), and later, the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), in cooperation with professional music institutions. The Philippine Society for Music Education was founded in 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New materials authored by Philippine musicians were published for the elementary and high schools, mostly in the form of multi-volume series aimed at providing Filipino students with pedagogical materials that highlighted folk songs from the different regions of the country. Commemorative and institutional hymns that instilled love for one&rsquo;s heritage and respect for specific social institutions were also commissioned and sung at school events. Some examples of these are Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;General De Jesus Academy Hymn,&rdquo; 1948, &ldquo;University of the East Hymn,&rdquo; 1951, and &ldquo;Zonta Blessing,&rdquo; 1968; Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s &ldquo;St. John Academy Hymn,&rdquo; 1952, &ldquo;University of Baguio Hymn,&rdquo; 1969, &ldquo;Angeles University Hymn,&rdquo; 1970, and &ldquo;Philippine National Red Cross Jubilee Song,&rdquo; 1972; and Eliseo Pajaro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Mental Health,&rdquo; 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Eventually, the music of upland and Islamic cultural communities was also included in the curriculum of schools and universities, notably, in the University of the Philippines (UP). In 1968, Jose Maceda of the UP College of Music invited <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3919\"><strong>Aga Mayo Butocan</strong></a>, a Maguindanaon educator, to teach kulintang at the university. She was soon followed by Ben Pangosban, who likewise taught Kalinga musical instruments to UP students. Thus, Filipino students belonging to lowland Christian culture were able to learn indigenous music as a secondary tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"classical\" name=\"classical\"></a>Classical Music </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Western Classical Music</b>.<b> </b>Despite the rapid development of the repertoire of music written by Philippine composers, concert programs generally consisted of western classical music performed by leading artists who had studied and concertized abroad. They performed a standard musical repertoire, which was comprised of the masterpieces written by western composers. Many European-educated Filipino singers rendered arias from favored operas of Verdi, Puccini, Donizetti, Bizet, and Mascagni in their concerts&mdash;works which had first been performed in the late 19th century by visiting Italian opera troupes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more significant classical music events from the 1950s to the early 1960s were the season concerts of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> which, under the musical and artistic direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\"><strong>Herbert Zipper</strong></a>, presented varied programs of symphonic works, including premieres of modern pieces such as Modest Mussorgsky&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/181\"><strong>Pictures at an Exhibition</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>and Arnold Schoenberg&rsquo;s <b><i>Transfigured Night</i></b>, as well as operas such as Johann Strauss&rsquo;s <b><i>Die Fledermaus </i></b>and Georg Friedrich Handel&rsquo;s <b><i>Acis and Galatea</i></b><i>. </i>Regular concerts were also presented by the Filipino Youth Symphony Orchestra (FYSO) under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a>; the UP Symphony Orchestra, which regularly presented pops concerts at the St Cecilia&rsquo;s auditorium, under Ramon Tapales; the Quezon City Philharmonic Orchestra, which had a regular season at the Rizal Theater in Makati, also under Ramon Tapales; the Manila Concert Orchestra; the National Philharmonic Orchestra under Redentor Romero; the Manila Little Symphony Orchestra under Federico Elizalde; the Artists&rsquo; Guild of the Philippines; the Philippine Choral Society; and the Jeunesses Musicales of the Philippines.

Occasionally, the Rizal Memorial Coliseum was used for such large visiting ensembles as the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, as well as the Boston Pops Orchestra. The acoustically sound Philamlife Auditorium constructed in 1961 at the United Nations Ave provided the venue for many notable classical music performances. In 1962, the Abelardo Hall Auditorium of the UP Conservatory of Music (renamed UP College of Music in 1968) served as the main venue for serious classical music concerts in the Quezon City area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Filipino Classical Works. </b>Since the beginning of the 20th century, Filipino composers took pride in having cultivated the ability to write operas, symphonies, and concertos&mdash;symbols of European high art in the field of music.

There were major productions like the celebrated <b><i>Noli Me Tangere</i></b>, 1953, by Felipe Padilla de Leon Sr, followed by his <b><i>El Filibusterismo</i></b><i>,</i> 1970, as<i> </i>well as Eliseo Pajaro&rsquo;s <b><i>Binhi ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan</i></b><i> </i>(Seed of Freedom), 1961.

Eliseo Pajaro developed a neoclassic style based on counterpoint and fugal devices, pandiatonic harmonization, chromatic sequence of melodic fragments, and syncopation. His repertoire of works includes symphonies and tone poems such as <b><i>The Life of Lam-Ang, </i></b>1951; concertos and choral odes, operas, quartets, and song cycles like <b><i>Himig Iloko No. 3</i></b> (Ilocos Melody No. 3), 1966, and <b><i>Himig Iloko No. 4</i></b>, 1968, which mostly quote from Ilocano folk songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lucrecia Kasilag also studied theory and composition in the United States and learned the stylistic techniques of the neoclassic school. Through her involvement as music director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a> Philippines Dance Company of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, Kasilag was exposed to traditional Philippine music. She collected and made studies on native instruments, as well as other types of Asian music during her travels. Her concept of East-West fusion became the main basis for her numerous works, where she combined timbres of native and Western instruments and scales of different musical systems. Her major works include <b><i>Toccata for Percussion and Winds</i></b><i>, </i>1958<i>; <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/888\"><strong>Divertissement for Piano and Orchestra</strong></a></b></i>, 1960; <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/161\"><strong>Legend of </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong>Sarimanok</strong></a></strong></i></b><i>,</i> 1963; <b><i>Filiasiana</i></b><i>, </i>1964; and the grand-scale <b><i>Dularawan: Salakot na Ginto</i></b> for indigenous instruments, soloists, and chorus. The works of Lucrecia Kasilag, using native instruments and scales in a neoclassic idiom, marked another phase in the Filipinization and indigenization of art music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other composers using neoclassic school techniques were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4072\"><strong>Manuel Maramba</strong></a>, Eduardo Parungao, Angel Pe&ntilde;a, Rosendo Santos, and Amada Santos-Ocampo. Alfredo Buenventura was known for his programmatic works and his extensive repertoire of symphonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s saw a dramatic change in Philippine art music literature. A leading role was played by Jose Maceda who abandoned his career as a concert pianist and piano pedagogue in favor of ethnomusicology and composition. His contact with the <b>musique concrete movement</b> in France as well as his in-depth studies of the music, philosophies, and social structures of village cultures provided the basis for his unique compositions. Maceda&rsquo;s compositions in the 1960s and 1970s featured the exclusive use of Philippine and Asian instruments, the combining of mass structures of timbres or sound colors and durations, and explorations in the simulation of the village as sonic space. These may be seen in <b><i>Ugma-Ugma </i></b>(Structuers), 1964, <b><i>Agungan </i></b>(A Play of Gongs), 1966, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/965\"><strong>Pagsamba</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Worship), 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"semi\" name=\"semi\"></a>Semiclassical Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>Sarsuwela</strong></a> and Western-Style Musicals. </b>During this period, the traditional sarsuwela, together with the komedya, had disappeared from Manila and was struggling to survive in the regions. In the Ilocos and the Ilocano-speaking provinces, the Iloko sarsuwela was produced by writers and/or directors like Pascual Agcaoili, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3044\"><strong>Isaias Lazo</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3139\"><strong>Barbaro Paat</strong></a></strong>. Coexisting with the sarsuwela was the komedya, which continued to be shown in towns like Santa Lucia and Santa Catalina, Ilocos Sur. By this time, the new sarsuwela written after the war had begun to integrate popular rhythms like the cha-cha into the forms traditionally associated with the genre like the kundiman, balitaw, and paso doble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sarsuwela had bowed out of the Manila stage even before World War II with the ascendancy of <b>bodabil</b>. In the post-war era, bodabil, now known as stage show, dominated the theaters of Manila and even the annual fiesta celebrations in the provinces. As before, the stage show was a showcase of American pop songs and dances. However, it now also began to witness the rise of original Filipino pop songs like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1025\"><strong>Waray-Waray</strong></a>&rdquo; (a person from Samar or Leyte), &ldquo;Ikaw Kasi&rdquo; (Because of You), &ldquo;Hahabol-Habol&rdquo; (Chasing After), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/981\"><strong>Pitong Gatang</strong></a>&rdquo; (a fictional street in Tondo). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>Bodabil</strong></a> eventually deteriorated into burlesque and declined in the early 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But even as stage shows continued to entertain the masses in Manila, sarsuwela began to enjoy a revival, perhaps brought about in part by the nationalist or activist ferment that began to be felt in the mid-1960s. In the 1970s, a revival movement emerged with the restaging of <b><i>Sundalong Mantika </i></b>(Sluggish Soldier),<b><i> Ang Mestisa </i></b>(The Half-Breed Lady),<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></i></b> (Country Maiden) by the Centro Escolar University, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></i></b> (After the Darkness) by the Ateneo de Manila University. The Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines was established by columnist Teodoro Valencia, specifically to restage old sarsuwela and commission new ones. With these fresh initiatives, classic sarsuwela like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></i></b> (No Wounds) and Antonio Molina&rsquo;s <b><i>Ana Maria</i></b> were reconstructed and reproduced. Meanwhile, the sarsuwela contest yielded new works like Bayani M. De Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Ako!</i></b> (Me!), 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s and early 1970s, Filipino audiences especially in Manila witnessed the proliferation of Broadway musicals not only on screen but also on stage because of the locally produced versions of these musicals. Some music schools, like the UP Conservatory of Music, St Paul&rsquo;s College, and Santa Isabel College took to producing musicals such as <b><i>My Fair Lady</i></b>, <b><i>The King and I</i></b>, <b><i>Carousel</i></b>, <b><i>The Sound of Music</i></b>, and <b><i>West Side Story</i></b>. Outstanding baritone Aurelio Estanislao starred as the king in <b><i>The King and I</i></b> conducted by Ramon Tapales, while <b><i>West Side Story</i></b> was conducted by Eliseo M. Pajaro. Later, the Broadway hit <b><i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i></b> was produced in Manila, making stars of Boy Camara and Marilen Martinez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Now familiar with the spirit and style of the modern Broadway musical, Filipino composers began to create original musicals. A pioneer in this genre was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/555\"><strong>Halimaw</strong></a></i></b> (Monster), 1971, by Isagani Cruz and Lutgardo Labad, staged by the Philippine Educational Theater Association at the new Dulaang Rajah Sulayman in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>. This musical alluded to a kingdom that would soon be established by the ongoing Constitutional Convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Traditional Songs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\"><strong>Ballad</strong></a>s. </b>Ballads are narrative songs displaying romantic feelings or special events in the life of a community which are commonly performed by a solo singer. Some traditional ballads use materials from existing folk songs, and are typically arranged in rounded binary form. Ballads have been composed and are still being composed in abundant numbers, catering to the everyday musical needs of a wide listening public. The native form of ballads is exemplified by the kundiman, which was widely circulated by Philippine recording companies, particularly, the Villar Recording Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A varied repertoire of kundiman, love songs and folk songs in several local languages, marches, and folk dance music were recorded by musical ensembles and famous singers contracted by Villar. The instrumental groups consisted of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Rondalla, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a> and his Orchestra, and the Villar Recording Symphonette and Band conducted by Clod Delfino. For kundiman and folk ditties in all the Philippine languages, Sylvia La Torre topped the list of recording artists. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3902\"><strong>Cely Bautista</strong></a> were the idols associated with the Tagalog love song, the former recording Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (My Country). Rey Lucero recorded traditional Ilocano love songs such as &ldquo;Bannatiran&rdquo; (a mythical bird), &ldquo;Biag ti Balasang&rdquo; (The Life of a Maiden), and &ldquo;Dungdung-wen Kanto&rdquo; (I Love You So), while Nora Hernandez specialized in Visayan pieces.

It should be noted that a good number of these artists were discovered in amateur singing contests, the most famous of which was Procter and Gamble&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a> </i></b>(Call of the Stage)<i>, </i>which was first aired on radio in 1954 and then on television in 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The initial song repertoire of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a> consisted mostly of kundiman by Abelardo, Santiago, Buencamino, and Hernandez, as well as lighter genres and movie songs such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ikaw&rdquo; (You), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/874\"><strong>Buhat</strong></a>&rdquo; (Ever Since), &ldquo;Gabi at Araw&rdquo; (Night and Day), and &ldquo;Habang Buhay&rdquo; (While I Live); Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ilaw ng Langit&rdquo; (Light of the Sky), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/857\"><strong>Babalik Ka Rin</strong></a>&rdquo; (You Will Come Back); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3935\"><strong>Josefino Cenizal</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/904\"><strong>Hindi Kita Malimot</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Cannot Forget You); Juan Silos&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a>&rdquo; (Tears); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5760\"><strong>Ruben Vega</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Lumuluha&rdquo; (I Am Crying); and songs by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4221\"><strong>Manuel Velez</strong></a>, Leopoldo Silos, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\"><strong>Santiago Suarez</strong></a>.

Mirasol and T. Villa contributed songs in Ilongo such as &ldquo;Sa Tuburan&rdquo; (By the Spring), &ldquo;Daw Pispis Nga Bukaw&rdquo; (Like an Owl), and &ldquo;Dalawidaw&rdquo; (Yellow Bird). A leading lyricist for many Tagalog songs was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\"><strong>Levi Celerio</strong></a>, a violinist, a musical comic, and master of light poetry. He was lyricist to major songwriters like Santiago Suarez, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong>, Leopoldo Silos, Antonio Maiquez, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Ernani Cuenco</strong></a></strong>, Josefino Cenizal, but also contributed some of his original tunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s and 1970s, the Filipino love songs in the lyric style of the kundiman maintained their presence in the overall popular music repertoire and became known as ballads. While the sarsuwela-derived movie formats were no longer dominant as in the previous decades, many of the songwriters who produced ballads in the second half of the century were active in musical scoring for the movie industry. Some of the leading works include Mike Velarde&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pangarap Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw Rin&rdquo; (My Dream, Too, Is You), 1947, &ldquo;Tanging Ikaw&rdquo; (Only You), 1948, &ldquo;Hanggang Ako&rsquo;y May Hininga&rdquo; (While I&rsquo;m Still Breathing), 1948, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/961\"><strong>Ngayon at Kailanman</strong></a>&rdquo; (Now and Forever), 1949, and &ldquo;Kung Nasaan Ka&rdquo; (Wherever You Are), 1962; Leopoldo Silos&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/883\"><strong>Dahil sa Isang Bulaklak</strong></a>&rdquo; (Because of a Flower), 1966; and Restie Umali&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ikaw ang Lahat sa Akin&rdquo; (You are Everything to Me), 1969, &ldquo;Pag-ibig, Ikaw ang Maysala&rdquo; (Love, You are the Cause), 1969, &ldquo;Habang Ako&rsquo;y Nabubuhay&rdquo; (While I am still Alive), 1969, &ldquo;Gintong Alaala&rdquo; (Golden Memory), 1970, and &ldquo;Life Everlasting,&rdquo; 1971. The songs that were recorded by a number of companies that succeeded Villar&rsquo;s pioneering effort captured a market of music listeners belonging to the 21-and-above age bracket. The pop ballads did not only cater to a listening public but also were considered appropriate music for programs, convocations, weddings, party socials, and occasionally for funeral rites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, outside of mainstream middle class culture, semiclassical genres like kundiman and danza were used as the formal basis for protest songs. The Visayan <b>composo</b>, another folk ballad form used for protest songs, also came from the grassroots. This appropriation was advocated by members from the peasant and urban workers who formed the socialist group Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan in 1949 to resist American imperialism and class oppression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> Collection, Compilation, and Arrangement. </b>Another favored source of songs and ballads were the existing folk songs which had been arranged for solo voice or choir with instrumental accompaniment. Many of these were published for school use. <b><i>Filipino Folk Songs</i></b>, 1950, was a collection arranged by Emilia Reysio-Cruz and harmonized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>. It contained choral arrangements of &ldquo;Chichiritsit,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Nipa Hut), &ldquo;Leron-leron Sinta&rdquo; (Leron-leron Beloved), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/886\"><strong>Dandansoy</strong></a>&rdquo; (Unfaitful), and &ldquo;Si Nanay, si Tatay, Namasol sa Dagat&rdquo; (My Mother, My Father, Went Fishing in the Sea), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/853\"><strong>Atin Cu Pung Singsing</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Have a Ring), &ldquo;Ti Ayat Ti Meysa nga Ubing&rdquo; (Love of a Child), and &ldquo;Chua-ay.&rdquo; In the same year, the <b><i>Selected Songs of the Philippines</i></b><i>,</i> compiled by Bernabe Roxas Solis and containing &ldquo;Ay, Kalisud!&rdquo; (Ah, Misery!) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/930\"><strong>Lulay</strong></a>,&rdquo; among others, was published in New York by the Soledy Music Society. In 1952, Ramon Tapales, then director of the UP Conservatory of Music, published a series titled <b><i>Singing and Growing for Primary Grades</i></b>, whose selections were mostly Filipino compositions and folk songs but included songs from the United States and<i> </i>Europe. In 1953, Corazon S. Maceda and Crispina C. Garcia published <b><i>Philippine Choruses for All Occasions</i></b>. It was a compilation of compositions by Antonio Molina, Lucio San Pedro, Buencamino Sr, Francisco Santiago, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4008\"><strong>Juan Hernandez</strong></a>. Another anthology edited by Corazon Maceda, this time with Candida B. Bautista, featured choral works by Alfredo Buenaventura, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\"><strong>Julian Felipe</strong></a>, Salvador Imperio, Leon Ignacio, Lucrecia Kasilag, Felipe de Leon, Antonio Molina, Cayetano Rodriguez, Vicente Sales, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3239\"><strong>Jose Sanchez</strong></a></strong>, Lucio San Pedro, Francisco Santiago, Miguel Velarde, and Manuel Velez. These anthologies were widely disseminated in the school system as Maceda, Garcia, and Bautista mentored many school teachers bred in the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, the Philippine Normal College, and in the public schools. In 1963, composer Felipe Padilla de Leon and Luz Odulio Villanueva, the supervisor of music of the Division of City Schools in Manila, published <b><i>Music Time</i></b> for both the lower and higher primary grades. These likewise contained Filipino compositions and folk songs. Still another set of materials was issued in 1966: the two-volume <b><i>Sing and Be Happy</i></b>, jointly authored by Antonino Buenaventura, Jose M. Hernandez, and linguist <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5565\"><strong>Jose Villa Panganiban</strong></a></strong>. These focused on aspects of Filipino history and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1957-8, Priscilla Venturanza Magdamo published the multivolume <b><i>Philippine Folk Songs: Songs of the Visayas</i></b> through the Silliman Music Foundation Inc. The different folk songs were collected in the field from different singer-informants, transcribed and arranged by Magdamo herself. The volumes contain folk songs from the Ilongo, Aklanon, Cebuano, and the Waray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection of folk songs is an ongoing task and is still being undertaken by both scholars and teachers all over the country. While many of the folk songs included in anthologies and collections were initially transcribed for educational purposes, many of them, too, were arranged as medleys and short pieces for chorus, band, and rondalla ensembles. Examples are <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\"><strong>Paruparong Bukid</strong></a></i></b>, 1949, and<b><i> Bahay-Kubo</i></b>, 1953, for band<i> </i>by Felipe de Leon Sr; <b><i>Himig Pilipino No. 1 </i></b>(Filipino Melody No. 1), 1956, <b><i>Himig Pilipino No. 2,</i></b> 1958, <b><i>Philippine Medley,</i></b> 1959 and <b><i>Himig Iloko No. 3</i></b>, 1966, for choir by Eliseo Pajaro; and the <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><strong>Balitaw</strong></a></strong> Series for Rondalla </i></b>progressively written between 1958 and 1963<i> </i>by Jerry Dadap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Instrumental Music. </b>In this period, Philippine band music produced hundreds of outstanding musicians such as Hilarion Rubio, Lucio San Pedro, Felipe Padilla de Leon, Antonino Buenaventura, Alfredo Buenaventura, Lucino Sacramento, Eliseo Pajaro, Rosendo Santos, Eduardo Parungao, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>. It was through the contributions of these composers that the Philippine band tradition has developed an extensive repertoire ranging from marches, patriotic pieces, and folk song arrangements to large-scale symphonic compositions. Many Philippine marches were composed after the World War II like Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Martsa ng Republika ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (March of the Republic of the Philippines), 1948, &ldquo;The Tamaraw March,&rdquo; 1950, &ldquo;The Ilocano National Association March,&rdquo; 1958, and &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo; (March of the New Society), 1972; Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s &ldquo;President Magsaysay March,&rdquo; 1954, and &ldquo;President Eisenhower March,&rdquo; 1969; and Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philippine Independence,&rdquo; 1964, &ldquo;Festival March,&rdquo; 1969, &ldquo;Golden Heart March,&rdquo; 1971, and &ldquo;Angononian March,&rdquo; 1972. Other than the marches, composers wrote longer works for band such as concert overtures, tone poems, and even symphonies. Examples of these are Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Karomata</i></b><i> </i>(The Carriage), 1948, <b><i>Fantasie for Trombone and Band,</i></b><i> </i>1949, <b><i>Mayumi Theme and Variations, </i></b>1950,<b><i> Bulaklak ng Lahi </i></b>(Flower of the Race)<b><i> Symphonic March,</i></b> 1952, <b><i>Philippines Forever Military March</i></b>, 1952, and<b><i> Ang Watawat</i> </b>(The Flag), 1952; Eduardo Parungao&rsquo;s <b><i>Suite for Band, </i></b>1960,<i> </i>and <b><i>Philippine Airs Medley No. 1</i></b>, 1968; Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s <b><i>Lahing Kayumanggi </i></b>(Brown Race)<b><i>, </i></b>1961; and Hilarion Rubio&rsquo;s <b><i>Three Kings Overture, </i></b>1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When lavish fiestas were discouraged by the austerity program of the government in the 1960s, band activities declined. However, this was not permanent. Band competitions under the auspices of the Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas (PASAMBAP) reinvigorated the fading medium. These national band competitions were first held at the Rizal Coliseum in cooperation with Manila Lion&rsquo;s Club and the Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines. Later, these were co-sponsored by the Folk Arts Theater and the Balik Banda program of the San Miguel Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another popular medium for light classical music during the period was the rondalla, an ensemble consisting of plectrum instruments. Prominent composers like Antonio Molina, Lucino Sacramento, Lucio San Pedro, Jerry Dadap, and Bayani M. de Leon explored this instrumental group and wrote art music compositions for these ensembles. Examples of these pieces are Jerry Dadap&rsquo;s <b><i>Symphonic Balitaws Nos. 1-7,</i></b> 1958-1963, and <b><i>Philippine Symphonic Rondalla, </i></b>1967; and Bayani de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Tatlong Bulaklak</i></b><i> </i>(Three Flowers) for symphonic rondalla, 1968<i>.</i> Juan Silos composed and arranged marches, folk songs, kundiman, and balitaw for the rondalla and recorded them through the Villar Recording Company. At the same time, <b>comparza </b>groups remained in the countryside, with members coming from the older members of the community who generally played and harmonized tunes by ear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Competitions, likewise, became a venue for the development of the rondalla. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most well known was &ldquo;Hamon sa Kampeon&rdquo; (A Challenge to the Champion) in the 1960s, broadcast on radio and television (DXZL, Channel 3, and DZAQ) and hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a> and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></strong>. Dominic Salustiano, who was a regular adjudicator of the competition, also composed many pieces for the rondalla. In 1967, the Manila Times sponsored the National Symphonic Rondalla Composition Contest in which Jerry Dadap&rsquo;s composition <b><i>Philippine Symphonic Medley for Rondalla</i></b><i> </i>won the much-coveted prize. In 1970, Felipe Padilla de Leon organized the Taliba National Rondalla Contest, and the Pio del Pilar High School Rondalla from Makati, conducted by fifteen-year old Rosario Tobias, won. Other groups that won prizes were the Round Table Rondalla from Bulacan, the Ramon Magsaysay High School Rondalla, and the Araullo High School from Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1966, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4112\"><strong>Pangkat Kawayan</strong></a> was organized by Victor Toledo. It was an ensemble of elementary school children playing different types of bamboo instruments&mdash;flutes, marimba, clappers, angklung, <b>bumbung</b>. It was an attempt to revive the <b>musikong bungbong</b>, an ensemble of bamboo instruments patterned after those of the marching band that became popular during the revolutionary wars of the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. By the 1960s these ensembles had almost disappeared. The Pangkat Kawayan, whose repertoire of folk songs and dances was similar to that of the rondalla, was usually featured in school programs and was showcased in the tourist industry especially during the Marcos administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"popular\" name=\"popular\"></a>Popular Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, the global Euro-American music recording industry fuelled investment in local music recording and live and media entertainment companies that promoted the recordings. The recording artists of the period were the same personalities who had graced the live shows in Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> Houses and Savoy Theater. Commercial enterprises distributed Euro-American music commodities&shy;&mdash;songs in rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, Broadway, jazz, American dance, ballad &ldquo;standard,&rdquo; and later disco styles and idioms&mdash;as well as a wide array of local popular music genres. These local popular music genres included Philippine popular and folk music as well as older forms such as the kundiman, balitaw, and danza. All these types of music, commodified through 33 RPM or long-playing vinyl records and 45 RPM or singles, catered mostly to the urban youth and originally reached them via radio and TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the transistor radio and stereo playback machines with a record player, the coin-operated jukebox was a distinctive conduit for popularizing music from the Euro-Americas. Most of the styles of the immediate postwar period were derived from Latin American dances. Xavier Cugat, the &ldquo;King of Rhumba,&rdquo; visited the Philippines in 1953 and had a strong impact on local amateur musicians. In the next few years, the <b>cumbanchero</b>, an instrumental group that featured the harmonica, guitar, bongos, maracas, conga drum, and one-stringed bass improvised from an empty gasoline tank, proliferated in towns and barrios. Its repertoire consisted mainly of folk songs and medleys of local tunes arranged to different Latin American beats. Cumbanchero groups livened up town fiestas and other public gatherings, including competitions, with their musical renditions and their colourful costumes fashioned after Xavier Cugat&rsquo;s <i>conjunto</i> attire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the mid-1950s to the 1960s, rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll gained widespread popularity among the middle-class youth. The new music drew elements from blues, gospel, boogie, country, and western. Rock and roll stars included Billy Haley who introduced the new style with &ldquo;Rock Around the Clock,&rdquo; Chubby Checker, Buddy Holly, Cliff Richards, and the &ldquo;King of Rock and Roll&rdquo; himself, Elvis Presley. The electronic media also introduced other styles identified with such personalities as Neil Sedaka, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Tom Jones, the Platters and others. Because Filipino singers sang imported music with an English cultivated by the public school system for a local audience just as well versed in the language by the system, the few attempts to translate English lyrics into Filipino failed to flourish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When singing idols such as Neil Sedaka, Nat King Cole, Timi Yuro, Johnny Mathis, and Harry Belafonte visited the Philippines, Filipino singers tried hard to sound just like them. The popular noontime show <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a> even launched contests to search for local versions of Elvis Presley (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4546\"><strong>Eddie Mesa</strong></a>), and Johnny Mathis (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4100\"><strong>Bert Nievera</strong></a>). Diomedes Maturan, winner of <b><i>Tawag ng Tanghalan</i></b>, another amateur singing contest, was called the Philippine Perry Como.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contrast to this mimicry, there were original compositions based on the new styles of this period. Among the interpreters of such a repertory was Sylvia la Torre, a graduate of the Conservatory of Music of the University of Santo Tomas, who had ventured into musical comedy and bodabil. She recorded the hit song &ldquo;Waray-waray&rdquo; (Juan Silos Jr) with a blues chord progression under Villar Records in the 1950s. This hit was followed by Bobby Gonzales&rsquo;s version of Clod Delfino&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/894\"><strong>Hahabol-habol</strong></a>&rdquo; in rock n&rsquo; roll style and by Fred Panopio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pitong Gatang&rdquo; in country and western style. These works exemplify attempts to localize appropriated foreign musical styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also in the 1950s, Philippine love songs and other light classical pieces were further popularized in record discs, which were played on the radio, home phonographs, and jukeboxes all over the country. The burgeoning record industry that promoted Filipino music was led by Mabuhay Recording Company, which issued recordings under two labels, Villar Records and Mabuhay Records beginning in the 1950s. This company had a tremendous impact on the production of Filipino music coming from different regions of the country. The commercial circulation and consumption of semiclassical Philippine music helped bring about the Filipinization and nationalization of Philippine music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, rock and roll reached its peak and during the first half of the decade, instrumental groups such as the Ventures and the Shadows inspired many young people from both the affluent and the working class to learn to play the guitar. The phenomenal rise of the Beatles towards the mid-1960s provided the impetus for the emergence of other pop groups. These included the Rolling Stones, Cream, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Chicago, Procol Harum, and Santana, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The local pop music industry grew as radio and television shows such as the <b><i>Night Owl Dance Party </i></b>and <b><i>Jam Session</i></b> promoted the latest dance crazes. Discotheques competed with cocktail lounges. Local groups imitated the Beatles and other pop idols. The successful groups in the 1960s include RJ and the Riots, Technocolors, Electromaniacs, the Hijacks, the Deltas, the Moonstrucks, and the Downbeats. They popularized rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, the twist, mashed potato, and watusi. Some leaders of these local rock groups like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\"><strong>Ramon Jacinto</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>, and Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith would later on contribute to the development of Pinoy rock in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was also in the late 1960s that classical music was overshadowed by popular entertainment and Broadway musicals. Some music schools like the UP Conservatory of Music, St Paul&rsquo;s College, and Santa Isabel College even took to producing musicals such as <b><i>My Fair Lady</i></b><i>, <b>The King and I</b>, <b>Carousel</b>, <b>The Sound of Music</b>, </i>and<i> <b>West Side Story</b>. </i>Outstanding baritone Aurelio Estanislao starred as the king in <b><i>King and I </i></b>in a University of the Philippines production<i> </i>conducted by Ramon Tapales, while the <b><i>West Side Story</i></b><i> </i>was conducted by Eliseo M. Pajaro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Pop Ballads. </b>Most local compositions in the 1960s were love songs such as those by Antonio Maiquez, Mike Velarde, and Manuel Villar. Songs of love in English, inspired by American ballads, also found their place in the local popular music repertoire. Ballads in English and Filipino were later written by local composers such as Alice Doria Gamilla with her &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/947\"><strong>A Million Thanks to You</strong></a>&rdquo; and were called middle-of-the-road songs. Mike Velarde&rsquo;s contribution to the genre includes &ldquo;Dedicated to You,&rdquo; 1949; &ldquo;Be Mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eternally Yours,&rdquo; 1953; &ldquo;Sa Hirap at Ginhawa&rdquo; (Through Hardships and Comfort), 1954; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s You,&rdquo; 1963; &ldquo;What Else Can I Ask For,&rdquo; 1963; &ldquo;Since You Went Away,&rdquo; 1970; and &ldquo;As Long as Forever,&rdquo; 1970. Restie Umali also wrote a few ballads such as &ldquo;Ang Hangganan ng Aking Buhay&rdquo; (The End of My Life), 1969, and &ldquo;Dearest Forever,&rdquo; 1971. Leading arrangers of ballads were Danny Holmsen, Pastor de Jesus, Nestor Robles, and Josefino Cenizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Earlier, local balladeers were influenced by the Platters, Nat King Cole, Everly Brothers, Harry Belafonte, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis, and Cliff Richards. Later, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, Carmen Soriano, Carmen Pate&ntilde;a, Mercy Molina, Ric Manrique, and other local singers developed their own styles, departing from the usual trend of merely imitating foreign idols. Succeeding them were a younger generation of recording artists led by Nora Aunor, Tirso Cruz III, and Eddie Peregrina. Among the singing groups of the 1960s, the Ambivalent Crowd, the Sheraders, and the Fourth Generation figured prominently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Rock. </b>Pinoy Rock is the offshoot of the rock boom of the 1960s, when groups equipped with electronic instruments, then known as combos, began to make their presence felt in the local music scene. Among the better-known combos then were the Downbeats, Birth of the Cool, D&rsquo;Bankers, Mon Pesta&ntilde;o and the Robins, Skylark, Red Fox, Bits and Pieces, and RJ and the Riots. The lesser known sported such names as Hydraulic Banana Rag Band, Intensity, and Fastback 2 + 2. Their repertoire consisted mostly of cover versions of early hits by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Chicago, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane. They also belted out soul music performed by black artists under the Motown label. Considered as the pioneer Philippine rock group is the Juan dela Cruz Band, founded in 1968, whose members include Wally Gonzalez, Mike Hanopol, Pepe Smith, and Edmund Fortuno, among others. Their first album, <b><i>Up in Arms</i></b>, was released in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Folk. </b>The influence of the 1960s American folk balladeers Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Peter Paul and Mary, and Judy Collins was felt within Filipino popular music culture, which adapted not only the singing style and structural elements of the music but also the general character of the text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino artists then used the folk ballad to communicate nationalist ideas and semi-didactic messages and to convey their rebellion against authority and convention. The counterculture protest songs of the leftist student activists from the mid-1960s consisted of simple strophic melodies combined with texts that were poetic and steeped in political rhetoric and issues that covered a wide range of topics&mdash;Filipino colonial mentality, freedom from tyranny, or an espousal of positive Filipino values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\"><strong>Novel</strong></a>ty Songs. </b>Novelty songs were distinguished from the other popular music genres of the period for the humor they contained, their satirical nature, and their use of catchy and novel musical techniques. When American rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll was introduced to Filipinos in the 1950s, the new musical phenomenon prompted musicians and the staff of Villar Records to come up with songs, some of them written by American country and western songwriters, with humorous Tagalog texts. The mix localized or Filipinized the foreign, and thus struck a chord among the Filipino masses. Sylvia la Torre, a classically-trained singer, recorded &ldquo;Bahala Na&rdquo; (Come What May), &ldquo;Puting Texas&rdquo; (White Fighting Cock), &ldquo;Golpe de Gulat&rdquo; (Kick of Surprise), and &ldquo;No Money, No Honey.&rdquo; Other singer-songwriters of novelty songs were Fred Panopio who sang &ldquo;Ang Kawawang Cowboy&rdquo; (The Pitiful Cowboy), a comic ditty sung to the tune of Glen Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhinestone Cowboy.&rdquo; Original novelty songs were also composed by Filipinos. The Big Three Sullivans wrote the text and sang the song &ldquo;Aswang&rdquo; in 1966 to the tune of Antonino Buenventura&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\"><strong>Pandanggo</strong></a></strong> sa Ilaw.&rdquo; Original novelty songs would continue to be written by songwriters like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4187\"><strong>Max Surban</strong></a> from the 1970s to the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a>. </b>Appreciation of jazz as a unique genre of musical entertainment came into its own in the Philippines in the 1950s and 1960s after Filipino musicians had been emancipated to a degree from the stereotype connection with music of the dance bands of the swing era before World War II. Immediately after the war, jazz was heard principally in American military bases in Pampanga, Zambales, Baguio, and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>. In Manila, it was patronized by the affluent sectors of Philippine society who formed clubs such as the Army Navy Club, Bayside Club, and Men&rsquo;s Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jazz music in the period flourished mainly in hotels and cocktail lounges such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, and later, Cafe Indonesia, which were important in the cultivation of this genre which requires the technique of improvisation. Jazz concerts such as the annual Upsilon Sigma Phi concerts at the UP, which drew fairly large audiences, were also occasionally held. Some of the more prominent artist-exponents of Philippine jazz from the 1950s were Chino Santos, Tirso Cruz Sr, Pete Aristorenas, Exequiel &ldquo;Lito&rdquo; Molina and the Jazz Friends, Romy Posadas, Angel Pe&ntilde;a, Piding Alava, Romy Katindig, and Fred Robles. They sometimes experimented on the use of folk tunes as basic melodic materials for improvisation and imbued the tunes with characteristic jazz rhythms and chord progressions. Original jazz compositions by local composers were scarce since many Filipino jazz musicians played the standard and readily available American repertoire. Examples of the few pieces of jazz music written by Filipino composers in the years before 1972 are Angel Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blues-a-Nova,&rdquo; 1960, &ldquo;Theme in F,&rdquo; 1960, and &ldquo;Igorhythm,&rdquo; 1963. The prevailing jazz music repertoire from America played by the local artists includes &ldquo;Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Softly as in a Morning Sunrise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lover Come Back to Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jazz Me Blues,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sophisticated Lady,&rdquo; and &ldquo;One O&rsquo;clock Jump.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, the fusing of elements of rhythm-and-blues and the heavy, highly amplified variety of rock music came to be known as jazz fusion. Later, the term referred to the merger of jazz with other pop music genres, as exemplified by the music of Larry Coryell, Stanley Clarke, and George Duke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music of the First Philippine Republic is important for three main reasons. First, it was in this period when music institutions that nurtured, protected, and regulated the musical life of the nation were founded: the Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines; the League of Filipino Composers; the grassroots band association Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas; and the Cultural Center of the Philippines. It was also in this period that music education became a requirement in the public schools throughout the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Second, it was in this period that the Philippine music industry was born. Products of the industry, mostly semi-classical pieces for band and rondalla, consisting of traditional forms such as the kundiman, danza, and balitaw, were broadly circulated through radio, TV, and film. As with the indigenized sarsuwela and bodabil, imported western semiclassical forms and styles were fused to local texts and tweaked to suit the local tastes and thus, genres like the novelty song were produced and enjoyed by the broader Filipino population. Forms, styles, and performers from regional music also entered the national consciousness through the music industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Third, the period saw the beginnings of original popular music. Upon seeing the effect of recorded music circulated through radio, television, and film, Filipino composers realized the lucrativeness of writing music with popular mass appeal. A number of these composers capitalized on accepted American forms such as rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, Broadway-inspired songs, ballads, and jazz, and adopted these in their original compositions. Pioneering original songs such as this paved the way for the rise of Original Pilipino Music (OPM) in the next decade.<em><strong>Written by</strong> </em><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P.

Marcos won his first term as president of the Philippine Republic in 1965. Drug dealing, arms smuggling, and oligarchic control over the vast resources of Philippine society were some of the major issues that hounded him up to the end of this term. In 1969, he won a second term in what was considered as one of the most corrupt elections in Philippine history. During this term, militarization of the countryside, cronyism, and abuse of power at all levels of government drove some of the people to take up arms in a protracted war to challenge the Marcos regime and its cohorts. Dissidence from the rural areas crept into the urban jungle when students and artists started to identify with the plight of the peasantry and the working class. Turning the mounting dissent and the perceived threat of communism to his advantage, Ferdinand Marcos signed on 21 Sep 1972 Proclamation No. 1081&mdash;the law that placed the Philippines under martial rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It would take almost a decade for martial rule to be lifted through Proclamation 2045 signed in Jan 1981. This proclamation, however, ensured that all proclamations and decrees that Marcos issued during martial law would still be enforced. In effect, martial rule continued, albeit with a more &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; mien. Marcos continued to control the country, but his grip on power started to weaken in 1983 when Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino II was assassinated. Aquino was seen by the Filipinos as a martyr. Not long after, Aquino&rsquo;s wife, Corazon or &ldquo;Cory,&rdquo; was fielded by the PDP-LABAN Party to challenge the strongman in the Feb 1986 Snap Presidential Election that ultimately toppled the Marcos regime in the ensuing, and now historic, EDSA People Power Revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under martial law, Marcos attempted to build his Bagong Lipunan or New Society, which later on turned out to be a society controlled by him, his wife <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a>, and their powerful cronies. On paper, though, the New Society recognized that the Filipino consciousness was deeply colonial and that political will was needed to rectify it. The philosophy behind the New Society&rsquo;s transformative thrusts paralleled the World War II Japanese occupation policy of &ldquo;decolonizing&rdquo; the Filipino in the &ldquo;New Order&rdquo; under the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The regime&rsquo;s concept of the New Society, outlined in Marcos&rsquo;s <b><i>An Ideology for Filipinos</i></b>, was skillfully fed to the people through the schools and media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The New Society encouraged a sense of nationalism by emphasizing the native and the local. It encouraged the use of Filipino as the national language, and the use of local materials for clothes (e.g., through the Bagong Anyo fashion shows) and buildings (e.g., Coconut Palace or Bahay Pilipino). It promoted as well as the translation of local architectural concepts and motifs into large-scale projects (as in the Baguio Convention Center and National Arts Center) and the creation of Filipino music that embodied the Filipino in both the popular and classical idioms. Through all these, the &ldquo;New Filipino<i>&rdquo;</i> was supposed to be defined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the sociocultural aspect of the New Society aimed at developing a reconstituted Filipino consciousness, its sociopolitical aspect was designed to answer the corporal needs of the people. Both aspects needed infrastructure to effect changes. Among the structures built under Marcos&rsquo;s presidency and the New Society were the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP), Folk Arts Theater, Manila Film Center, Philippine International Convention Center, Nayong Pilipino (Philippine Village), Philippine High School for the Arts, and National Arts Center. Luneta Park, Intramuros, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong> were also revived or restored from the ravages of World War II while government hospitals like the Philippine Heart Center, National Kidney Institute, Lung Center of the Philippines, and Philippine Children&rsquo;s Hospital mushroomed in the Quezon City government center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imelda Marcos, in her 1974 book <b><i>Seven Tasks</i></b>, enumerated the following priority projects: Bagong Anyo, Design Center, Asian Handicraft Center, Nayong Pilipino, Bagong Anyo ng Industriyang Pilipino, Philippine Assistant on National Minorities, Museum of Traditional Culture, Cultural Center of the Philippines, Young Artists Development Foundation, National Arts Center, National Artist Award, and National Parks Development Committee. Through the Young Artist Foundation of the Philippines, talented young Filipinos received music scholarship grants that enabled them to pursue advanced music studies abroad. Promising young artists like Cecil Licad (Curtis Institute), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3874\"><strong>Rowena Arrieta</strong></a> (Moscow Conservatory), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3946\"><strong>Jovianney Emmanuel Cruz</strong></a> (Manhattan School of Music), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3975\"><strong>Joseph Esmilla</strong></a> (Juilliard School of Music), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3907\"><strong>Alfonso Bolipata</strong></a> (New School of Music in Philadelphia), Ma. Elenita Buenaventura (University of Texas), Dionisia Fernandez (Juilliard School of Music), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\"><strong>Antonio Maigue</strong></a> (Conservatoire National de Musique Rueil Malmaison), and Conrado del Rosario (Universit&auml;t der K&uuml;nste Berlin) studied abroad through the support of the foundation. Today, many of these musicians are considered beacons of Philippine music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the support of the CCP, music organizations also flourished. Annual music competitions like the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) were established to identify and encourage young artists from all over the archipelago who excelled in vocal and instrumental music. Young talents discovered by NAMCYA performed during the regular concerts at the Paco Park, Puerta Real, and Rizal Park. These concerts were broadcast over TV for many years and thus were important in the dissemination of art music or classical music to the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music books, choral and instrumental, were also published under NAMCYA auspices, including the National Music Competition for Young Artists series for children&rsquo;s choirs, with the 1973-8 and the 1979-1982 compilations both published in 1983; and the 1975-8 compilation for youth choirs coming out in 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Marcos regime knew the importance and role of propaganda music in controlling the people as well as winning their support. The regime invested heavily in both political and police powers in wresting control of mass media companies to directly influence the content, tone, and general themes of both broadcast and print. Radio, television, and newspaper became the New Society&rsquo;s primary tools in disseminating mediated information to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As music was utilized by the Marcos regime to celebrate advances in its political aspirations, it was also used by activists among the academe and the masses, and the middle and upper classes to voice dissent against the regime in the 1970s and even more so after 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Protest music during the martial law period was given much color and meaning by the songs that emanated from the revolutionary movement, guided by Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse Tung thought. These songs embodied the revolutionary ideology and themes of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), the New Peoples Army (NPA), and the National Democratic Front (NDF). Monta&ntilde;ez (1989) stated that the &ldquo;songs of the countryside&rdquo; foregrounded &ldquo;three basic themes: the national democratic revolution, the armed struggle, and the revolutionary peasant mass movement.&rdquo; The anti-Marcos national democratic revolution songs &ldquo;present[ed] the necessity, principles and line of the national democratic revolution, the leadership of the proletariat and the basic alliance of workers and peasants, the international character of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, the history of exploitative rule in the country, and the conditions obtaining in a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society.&rdquo; Under the armed struggle theme, &ldquo;the songs depict[ed] the armed struggle carried out by the New People&rsquo;s Army and the revolutionary masses. These songs deal[t] with the principles and policies which guide the people&rsquo;s fighters in their work, the experiences which undergo in combat, and their attitude towards sacrifice and martyrdom.&rdquo; Under the last category, &ldquo;the songs in the countryside deal[t] with the revolutionary peasant movement. These songs unite[d] the peasants and farm workers to fight against economic oppression and military brutality, to support the armed struggle and carry on the agrarian revolution&rdquo; (5-8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Ninoy Aquino was assassinated on 21 Aug 1983, the ranks of the protest movement swelled in number and became even bolder in expressing anger and bitterness against the dictatorial government. A newly conscienticized middle class, whose symbol became the yellow ribbon, formed a strong counterhegemonic bloc with the nationalist Left, symbolized by the color red, in opposing the Marcos regime. This period ended with the abdication of the Marcoses from power in the famous People Power Revolt in 1986 that set a model for social change among other countries of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"classical\" name=\"classical\"></a>Classical Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s cultural projects revolved around the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</strong></a>, which was inaugurated on 10 Sept 1969. Imelda became the main patron of classical music. During the Marcos era, national Filipino music performing groups were established and/or supported by the state such as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 1973 (known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a> since 1982), the UP Madrigal Singers, founded in 1963 (known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a> since 1980), and the Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, founded in 1983. Local artists who represented the best in Filipino artistic expression were also honored with the National Artist Award, the highest honor given by the nation to Filipinos who have distinguished themselves in the different fields of the arts. The National Artist Award was signed into law through Proclamation <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>1 on 27 Apr 1972. Musicians given the said award during martial law years were composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>, 1973, and soprano <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>, 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The regime also honored foreign artists for their contributions to the world of music. Imelda Marcos gave the International Artist Awards to Van Cliburn and Margot Fonteyn. Moreover, CCP hosted internationally recognized names in music like Cliburn, Mstislav Rostropovich, and the New York Philharmonic. The San Francisco Opera Association was even invited to perform <b><i>Tosca</i></b>, the renowned opera by Giacomo Puccini in 1979, with a cast that included Eva Marton (Floria Tosca), Justino Diaz (Baron Scarpia), and Placido Domingo (Mario Cavaradossi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Local artists were also encouraged to feature Western music. The yearly Philippine Music Festival of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC) always presented a program of newly commissioned ballet works in cooperation with the CCP Dance Company (now <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a>Philippines). In addition, Filipino adaptations of foreign operas and other stage works were produced such as Bizet&rsquo;s <b><i>Carmen</i></b>, Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>Gianni Schichi</i></b>, Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>La Traviata </i></b>by RolandoTinio, and Stravinsky&rsquo;s ballet-cantata <b><i>Les Noces </i></b>(The Wedding) by RamonP.Santos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imelda Marcos also met with the members of the LFC and challenged classical music composers in the Philippines to create distinct Filipino music. A few became very actively involved in the efforts of the Marcos regime, and their names would later be identified with projects launched by the regime. Eliseo Pajaro published a collection of songs titled <b><i>Himig Pilipino ng Bagong Lipunan </i></b>(Filipino Tunes of the New Society), 1974. Kasilag wrote <b><i>Philippine Scenes for Orchestra</i></b>, 1974, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>ng Pilipino No. 2</i></b> (Filipino Mass No. 2), 1974. Rodolfo de Leon set to music the regime&rsquo;s slogan, &ldquo;Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Country, One Mind), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4156\"><strong>Lucino Sacramento</strong></a> composed two concertos for piano and orchestra dedicated to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos titled <b><i>Ang Maharlika</i></b> (The Noble Man), 1973, and <b><i>Ang Bituin</i></b> (The Star), 1974. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3848\"><strong>Rosalina Abejo</strong></a> came up with <b><i>Overture 1081</i>,</b> 1974, and <b><i>Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Bayan</i> </b>(Love of the Native Country), 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the composers centered on music that was Filipino in design and sentiment. This was achieved by using themes from epics, folk tunes, and Filipino ethnic instruments. Well-known operas with this thrust were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Binhing<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan </i></b>(Seed of Freedom) and <b><i>Balagtas at</i> <i>Celia </i></b>(Balagtas and Celia); Alfredo S.

The initial successes of the UPMadrigalSingers inspired some composers to write choral pieces in madrigal style, the first being Ramon P. Santos with &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1021\"><strong>Tuksuhan</strong></a>&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b>(Teasing) and &ldquo;Tula-tula&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b>(Poetica), followed by Fabian Obispo with &ldquo;Telebong.&rdquo;<i> </i>NAMCYA commissioned solo pieces and short choral works such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3952\"><strong>Bernardino Custodio</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong> Dance,&rdquo; Kasilag&rsquo;s &ldquo;Derivation V,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> M. de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kimkim&rdquo; (Clenched), and Ramon P.

With the discovery of new sources of musical thought, a new path was opened, suggesting alternative materials and processes of composition. JoseMaceda, ethnomusicologist and composer, played a leading role during this period. His contact with the <b>musique concrete</b> movement during his performance training in France as well as his in-depth studies of the music, philosophies, and social structures of village cultures provided the basis for the unique character of his compositions. What may be regarded as Maceda&rsquo;s writing idiom stemmed from the combination of musical and extramusical concepts such as mass structures of timbres (sound colors) and durations. After his <b><i>Ugma-Ugma </i></b>(Structures),<b><i> </i></b>1964, <b><i>Agungan </i></b>(A Play of Gongs), 1966, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/965\"><strong>Pagsamba</strong></a> </i></b>(Worship), 1968, he continued &ldquo;experimenting&rdquo; with the slow permutation of events in time in his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a></i></b>, 1978, and <b><i>Siasid </i></b>and<b><i> Aroding</i></b>,<i> </i>1983, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a> </i></b>(Coordination), 1974, <b><i>Udlot-Udlot </i></b>(Fluctuation), 1975, and <b><i>Suling-suling</i></b>, 1985. Most of his works were supported by the University of the Philippines that was outside of Marcos&rsquo;s control.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first among a younger generation of composers to respond to the challenges of New Music movement was Ramon P. Santos. During his studies in the United States, Santos first wrote pieces in the neoclassic idiom such as <b><i>Suite for Flute, Clarinet, Viola, Cello, and Piano</i></b>, for chamber orchestra, and in atonal language like <b><i>Music for Nine Instruments</i></b>, and <b><i>Pied Beauty</i></b>. He later focused his creative energies on experimental procedures, as in his <b><i>Time Improvisations</i></b>, Toccata for one piano and two performers, and open-ended forms, like his <b><i>Five Pieces for Two Pianos</i></b>. He began to use timbres from Philippine instruments in his <b><i>Ding Ding Nga Diyawa</i></b> (Beat the Gongs) and in the two-act opera-tableau <b><i>Ang Puting Waling-Waling</i></b> (The White Orchid). Upon his return to the Philippines, he expanded his compositional horizons by incorporating concepts of other musical traditions that he was able to study&mdash;Chinese, Indonesian, and northern and southern Philippines. His interest in the functional aspects of traditional music was shown in <b><i>Para Sa Intermisyon</i></b> (For the Intermission) and <b><i>Ritwal ng Pasasalamat</i></b> (Thanksgiving Ritual). His concern for nature and the environment could be gleaned from <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/927\"><strong>Likas-an</strong></a></i></b> (Nature-ing), and his love for multiart forms from <b><i>Siklo </i></b>(Cycle),<b><i> Awit </i></b>(Song), <b><i>Ta-O </i></b>(Per-son), <b><i>Awit ni Pulau </i></b>(Song of Pulau), and <b><i>Daragang Magayon</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos&rsquo;s contemporary, FranciscoF.Feliciano, studied in Germany and the United States, where he mastered the latest techniques in textural writing and creating sound architectures from simple tonal materials. Some of his major works included <b><i>Fragments </i></b>and<b><i> Verkl&auml;erung</i> <i>Christi </i></b>for large orchestra; <b><i>Transfiguration </i></b>for orchestra, chorus, and narrator; <b><i>Isostasie III </i></b>for strings and woodwind; and <b><i>Eight Character Pieces </i></b>for solo timpani, five timpani, trombone, bassoon, and contrabass.<i> </i>Two of his large-scale contributions to modern music theater were his ballet <b><i>Yerma</i></b><i> </i>and the full-length modern opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a> </i></b>on the libretto of the diva and opera director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\"><strong>Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</strong></a>. In his orchestral work <b><i>Pagdakila sa Kordilyera </i></b>(Ode to Cordillera), Feliciano incorporated Philippine ethnic instruments in his score. In addition to composition and conducting, Feliciano also established the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music, a school devoted to the exploration of traditional musical idioms in Asia for utilization in Christian liturgy and worship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, a notable degree of ideas surfaced in some of the works of the older colleagues of Santos, Feliciano, and De Leon. In 1972, Lucrecia R. Kasilag wrote <b><i>Ekologie I: On a</i> <i>Day Off</i></b> for tape recorder and indigenous instruments, <b><i>Five Portraits: A Parody </i></b>for two amplified pianos, gongs, and transistor radio, and <b><i>Diversions </i></b>for violin, cello, harp, piano, percussion, and taped sounds of Kalinga instruments. In 1971, RamonTapales composed <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\"><strong>Sonata</strong></a> Satirica</i></b>, an improvisation piece for solo violin. Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Fantasy for Four Flutes and Percussion</i></b>,<i> </i>1975,<i> <b>Tatlong Tunog Larawan </b></i>(Three Sound Portraits) for orchestra, 1976, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> for Flute and Orchestra</i></b>,<i> </i>1980, all represented a departure from the conventional harmonic idioms and attempt new tonal combinations and textures. Other works by romanticist-impressionist composers who had been influenced by 20th-century art music included <b><i>Suite No. 2 </i></b>for string quartet,<i> </i>1971, by AntoninoBuenaventura, <b><i>The Strutting Peacock </i></b>and <b><i>Ang Manok at ang Bayawak </i></b>(The Rooster and the Iguana) by HilarionF.Rubio, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/989\"><strong>Reminiscence</strong></a> </i></b>by AlfredoS.Buenaventura.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">BayaniM. deLeon, son of FelipePadilladeLeon, almost of the same age as Santos and Feliciano, started his career as a composer by writing sarsuwela, such as <b><i>Handog ng Diyos </i></b>(God&rsquo;s Offering), <b><i>Hibik Sa Karimlan </i></b>(Cries in the Dark) and progressive pieces for the rondalla<b> </b>like <b><i>Tatlong Bulaklak </i></b>(Three Flowers) and <b><i>Mulawin </i></b>(Molave Tree). He tried to contradict his own basic materials from existing folk melodies, transforming them into new structural elements that assumed different characters. He applied the technique in such major works as <b><i>Pagkamulat </i></b>(Awakening) symphonic poem, <b><i>Bahay-bata </i></b>(Mother&rsquo;s Womb), and <b><i>Arok-Diwa</i></b> (The Depths of the Soul). De Leon&rsquo;s interest in the relationship between the material symbols of sound and the cosmic universe is illustrated by two of his compositions written while learning avant-garde techniques at the University of California in San Diego: <b><i>Puso </i></b>(Heart), based on yin<i> </i>and yang,<i> </i>and space and time; and <b><i>Okir </i></b>which is about the forces that shape agents in the universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Young composers of new music in this period included Ruben Federizon whose works combined new music techniques and structural properties of Philippine and Asian music, and were characterized by percussive rhythms and imaginative fusion of tone colors derived from the sounds of native instruments as in <b><i>RitmosTabulare</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1018\"><strong>Tinig ng Lupa</strong></a> </i></b>(Voice of the Earth). Chino Toledo created constantly permuting sound architectures made up of mode-oriented melodic layers in <b><i>Ug-nay </i></b>(Link) and <b><i>Kulambo: Isang Kayumangging Puntod </i></b>(Mosquito Net: A Brown Grave).<b><i> </i></b>He explored improvisational procedures in <b><i>Samu&rsquo;t sari </i></b>(Variety) and <b><i>Terminal Lamentations</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Contemporary issues also found their place in Toledo&rsquo;s writings, as in <b><i>For Edwin Thumboo and All of Us Who Suffer Through English in Asia </i></b>for soprano, clarinet, oboe, vibraphone and cello. Verne de la Pe&ntilde;a expanded the idea of the drone in <b><i>N</i></b>(<b><i>y</i></b>)<b><i>uma for 36 Voices and Asian Instruments</i></b>. He also composed several interesting multimedia works such as the puppettheater <b><i>Si Suan</i></b>,<b><i> Si Suan </i></b>(It&rsquo;s Suan, It&rsquo;s Suan). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a> used nonconventional sound sources such as scrapers and leaves, and involved the audience in his works, as in <b><i>Pangtawag </i></b>(Music for Calling People) and <b><i>Kalipay </i></b>(Happiness).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"semi\" name=\"semi\"></a>Semiclassical Music </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional sarsuwela continued to be produced in the countryside like in the Ilocos region where it had a continuous life. In Manila, however, it lost an audience after mass media, i.e., radio, sound film, and TV dominated the entertainment scene since the 1930s. In the late 1960s to early 1970s, a revival movement emerged with the restaging of <b><i>Sundalong Mantika </i></b>(Sluggish Soldier) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Country Maiden)<i> </i>by the Centro Escolar University, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a> </i></b>(After the Darkness)<b><i> </i></b>by the Ateneo de Manila University, and <b><i>AngKiri </i></b>(The Flirt)<b><i> </i></b>by the CCP and by the management of the newly restored MetropolitanTheater. The Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines was established by the famous columnist Teodoro Valencia specifically to reproduce old sarsuwela and commission new ones. With these fresh initiatives, works such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a> </i></b>(No Wounds)<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Ana Maria </i></b>were reconstructed and reproduced, while new works were written and composed such as Isagani Cruz and Lutgardo Labad&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/555\"><strong>Halimaw</strong></a> </i></b>(Monster).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modern sarsuwelas tackled socially relevant issues of the day such as militarization, the foreign-dominated local economy, and the colonial tendencies of the Filipino. Thus, creative nationalists who were mainly anti-martial law and anti-Marcos like Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonfacio and Fabian Obispo came up with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong>Ang Bundok</strong></a></i></b> (The Mountain), 1977, and Nicanor Tiongson and Lutgardo Abad, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3156\"><strong>Louie Pascasio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3051\"><strong>Lucien Letaba</strong></a> finished <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong>Pilipinas Circa 1907</strong></a></i></b>, 1982. Some sarsuwela, however, were not politically themed like <b><i>Sumpang Mahal</i></b> (Sacred Vow), 1976, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5435\"><strong>Domingo Landicho</strong></a> and Reynaldo Paguio, <b><i>Miss Philippines</i></b>, 1980, by Isagani Cruz and Reynaldo Paguio, and <b><i>Ang Palabas Bukas </i></b>(Tomorrow&rsquo;s Show), 1979, by Bienvenido Lumbera and Lucio San Pedro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the music world was roused by the success of rock operas such as <b><i>Hair</i></b>,<i> <b>Jesus Christ Superstar</b></i>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Godspell</i></b>, the local popmusic scene saw the creation of Pinoy counterparts in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2192\"><strong>Gomburza</strong></a></i></b> written by Philip Monserrat and Chinggay Diaz-Lagdameo, <b><i>TalesoftheManuvu</i> </b>by Nonong Pedero and Bienvenido Lumbera, the Philippine Educational Theater Association&rsquo;s <b><i>May-I</i>, <i>May-I</i></b>, 1979, <b><i>NukleyarI</i></b>, 1983<b><i>,</i></b>and<b><i> NukleyarII</i></b>, 1985, and<b><i> </i></b>Ateneo de Davao&rsquo;s <b><i>Sa Bundok ng Apo </i></b>(At Mount Apo).

Felipe de Leon Sr composed many of these anthems and marches, the most popular of which were the &ldquo;Bagong Lipunan&rdquo; (Hymn of the New Society) and the &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo; (March of the New Society). Other songs in the repertory were &ldquo;Mabuhay&rdquo; (Long Live), &ldquo;Masagana 99&rdquo; (Prosperous 99), &ldquo;Magtanim, Magtanim&rdquo; (Plant), and &ldquo;Ako Ay Pilipino&rdquo; (I Am A Filipino). These were used to gather support for Marcos&rsquo;s projects, even from among its avowed enemies. As Ferdinand Marcos once said of the New Society songs, &ldquo;these songs very well express what I have conceived of the New Society. I am confident that these will tame the restless hearts of some of our countrymen who have bitterness and hate in their hearts&rdquo; (as cited in de Leon 1974, 13). Imelda, on the other hand, highlighted the importance of music in the fulfillment of the New Society&rsquo;s goals. According to her, &ldquo;it is our ardent hope that this collective work of our artists&hellip;will further inspire our people to greater heights of achieving the aims of national reformation to which we are all committed&rdquo; (7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Designed to sell the concept of &ldquo;democratic revolution or the revolution from the center,&rdquo; this type of propaganda music was disseminated through vinyl record albums. &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo; (New Birth), &ldquo;Bagong Lipunan&rdquo; (New Society), &ldquo;Bagong Buhay&rdquo; (New Life), &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Magtanim&rdquo; (Let Us Plant), &ldquo;Awit ng Magsasaka&rdquo; (Farmer&rsquo;s Song), &ldquo;Masagana 99 &ldquo; (Bountiful 99), &ldquo;Karunungan&rdquo; (Wisdom), &ldquo;Magandang Pilipinas&rdquo; (Beautiful Philippines), &ldquo;Pasko sa Bagong Lipunan&rdquo; (Christmas in the New Society), and &ldquo;Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa&rdquo; (One Nation, One Spirit) were regularly played on the radio. They were printed in the book <b><i>Mga Awit sa Bagong Lipunan</i></b> (Songs in the New Society), 1974, and sung in the classroom as part of the everyday activities in school. Some children were even brought to the political rallies held at the Luneta Park to help increase attendance and to make them experience firsthand the euphoria at rallies hailing the strongman. Probably the most popular march then was &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo; (March of the New Society), with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\"><strong>Levi Celerio</strong></a> and music by Felipe Padilla de Leon:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;

The regime exerted much effort towards this end. This was in essence a policy towards decolonization. Songs in the vernacular proliferated during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The New Society was more than an attempt to create an ideal society. It was also an imagined birthing of the new Filipino, with Imelda as the Society&rsquo;s mother, and Ferdinand, the father. The couple had themselves depicted as the mythical Filipino progenitors, Malakas and Maganda (&ldquo;The Powerful&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Beautiful,&rdquo; respectively) to legitimize their claim of having authority over the Filipino nation. In this created society, everyone was pictured as living in a truly happy state in an ideal place&mdash;a utopia. Songs like &ldquo;Magandang Pilipinas&rdquo; (Beautiful Philippines), composed by Julian Balita, emphasized this point:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lupa ng kagandahan, ating masdan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lahing magiliw na tunay, kayumangging kulay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tayo ay may kundimang awit ng buhay,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sa suyuang walang hanggan ay tapat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sa langit ng ating bayan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang buwan at bit&rsquo;win kay inam tingnan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dito&rsquo;y may saganang lupa na nagpapasigla sa madla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Magandang Pilipinas, mabiyaya at mapalad,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Laging kay saya ng buhay at may bago nang lipunan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Let us gaze upon this land of beauty!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This loving brown race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">We have kundiman, our song of life,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Honest in endless courtship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under the heavens of our land,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The moon and the stars are lovely to gaze upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Here land is bountiful, it energizes the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lovely Philippines, blessed and fortunate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Life is ever cheerful, and there is a new society.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To further boost state propaganda in the time of military rule, the Department of Education and Culture, through the initiative of the First Lady, launched the National Song Writing Contest in 1973. The winning works of the competition, which were also included in the book <b><i>Songs in the New Society</i></b>, were &ldquo;O <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong>ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (My Country Philippines) by V.

These were sung by groups like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a> whose repertoire best illustrates music that was <b>kundimanin</b> (kundiman-like) in approach for its tender lyricism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imelda Marcos herself had used the traditional danza, in particular Miguel Velarde&rsquo;s danza &ldquo;Dahil Sa &lsquo;Yo&rdquo; (Because of You), to enchant the public with her singing persona. She started this to elicit support during her campaigns for her husband in the previous decade. After 1986, she used the same song to solicit sympathy from TV audiences during interviews connected with her public trials on corruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But some traditional kundiman became associated with the anti-Marcos movement. Originally a protest song against the American imperialists, the most popular semiclassical kundiman of 1928 by Constancio de Guzman resurfaced as the radical anthem of the underground movement against the Marcos dictatorship and later of the middle class protesters after the Aquino assassination. &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; was sung by the huge crowds that staged the 1986 People Power Revolt. Another song, which used lyrics from an old poem related to the fight against Spain, reawakened the revolutionary impulse. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1918\"><strong>Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa</strong></a>&rdquo; (Love for the Native Land) was given a new melody by Salvador Jorque to condemn both colonialism and authoritarianism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"popular\" name=\"popular\"></a>Popular Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular music produced by the music industry gained more presence in the national landscape with the availability of portable radios, cassette recorders, and especially TV. They were marketed as commodities in the physical forms of vinyl records and audiocassettes. The bombardment of American rock and pop music in the Philippines intensified, along with the marketing of consumer electronic products that played it. Songwriter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\"><strong>Jim Paredes</strong></a> conceded that majority of Filipinos grew up with American music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hit songs, which were decided by the American music industry&rsquo;s Top 40 chart, spawned local imitations across different music genres. From having local versions of Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Peter and Paul and Mary in the 1960s, the martial law years saw the proliferation of Bee Gees, Village People, and Karen Carpenter wannabes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These developments pushed Filipino entrepreneurs to respond to this Anglo-American music invasion. On 8 Mar 1977, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4131\"><strong>Popular Music Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a> (PMPF) was established by people from the music industry and the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP). PMPF was founded to systematically promote the development of Filipino popular music, which had begun to rise in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Broadcast Media Council (BMC) also passed resolution B75-31, mandating the airing of at least one Filipino composition every hour in all music radio stations. With the overflow of new compositions and the tremendous response of the record industry in providing a steady supply of &ldquo;musical commodities,&rdquo; Resolution 77-35 was then passed requiring the playing of two original Filipino works for every hour of broadcast. The number of works was raised to four later on. This helped counter American domination of local music radio broadcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The launch of PMPF&rsquo;s Metro Manila Popular Music Festival or MetroPop on 15 Aug 1977 signaled the gathering momentum of the Filipino popular music industry. The grand prizewinner of the first Metropop in 1978 was Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/915\"><strong>Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika</strong></a>&rdquo; (How Beautiful is Our Music) sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3863\"><strong>Hajji Alejandro</strong></a>. The second prize went to Nonoy Gallardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pagdating Mo&rdquo; (When You Arrive), which was sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a>. Third and fourth prizes went respectively to Nonong Pedero&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/959\"><strong>Narito Ako</strong></a> Umiibig&rdquo; (I Am Here, In Love) sung by Maricris Bermont and Vic Villafuerte&rsquo;s and Tinio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ibig Kong Ibigin Ka&rdquo; (I Want to Love You), which was interpreted by Anthony Castelo. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong>&rsquo;s song &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (Child) was only a finalist in that competition, but it was such an international hit that it merited translations in more than 20 foreign languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Metropop and the BMC ruling gave original Pilipino music (OPM), the umbrella term for all locally produced Filipino pop music, a stronger presence over the airwaves and made it more marketable. Radio became a level playing field for both the foreign and the local. As a result, OPM flourished in the 1980s and 1990s. Philippine popularmusic started to reflect the Philippine situation. More and more composers began to use street lingo to deliver their message. Inspired by the commercial success of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/894\"><strong>Hahabol-habol</strong></a>&rdquo; (Chasing After) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a> winning the Best Singer award at the Tokyo Music Festival for her rendition of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\"><strong>George Canseco</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Daughter,&rdquo; they wrote more songs in both Tagalog and English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\"><strong>Ballad</strong></a>s.</b> The popular songs of the 1970s combined elements from the American ballad, Broadway, and light kundiman. These included Atek Jacinto&rsquo;s &ldquo;People Gotta Save the World,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\"><strong>Willy Cruz</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Araw-Araw, Gabi-Gabi&rdquo; (Every Day, Every Night), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Refrain,&rdquo; Philip Monserrat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Puso Kong Nagmamahal&rdquo; (My Heart that Loves), Canseco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ngayonat Kailanman&ldquo; (Now and Forever), Gines Tan&rsquo;s &ldquo;MagsimulaKa&rdquo; (Take the First Step), <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4106\"><strong>Louie Ocampo</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ewan&rdquo; (I Don&rsquo;t Know), and Charo Unite&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lupa&rdquo; (Earth).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Heavy, heart-wrenching ballads were also very popular. Their lyrics spoke of unrequited love, lost love, free love, and unfaithfulness. &ldquo;Sige, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a> Ka Na&rdquo; (Sure, You&rsquo;re Free to Go) by singer Eva Eugenio, &ldquo;Bakit Ako Mahihiya&rdquo; (Why Should I Be Ashamed) by Didith Reyes, and Dulce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ako ang Nasawi, Ako ang Nagwagi&rdquo; (I Failed, I Triumphed) were big hits with the masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">International popularmusic competitions like the World Popular Song Festival and Tokyo Music Festival, as well as local contests like Metropop, which ran from 1978 to 1985, and Himig Awards, catapulted to fame many young singing talents, many of them balladeers: BasilValdez, Ray-An Fuentes, Leo Valdez, HajjiAlejandro, Jun Polistico, RicoJ.Puno, Didith Reyes, CelesteLegaspi, Jacqui Magno, ReyValera, Janet Basco, Imelda Papin, Leah Navarro, KuhLedesma, among others. Noted groups and other solo singers also became popular like the New Minstrels, Ambivalent Crowd, the ApoHikingSociety, and the Circus Band and singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>, Nonoy Zu&ntilde;iga, Eva Eugenio, and Anthony Castelo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This period was also a creative time for film music writers who wrote songs that were substantially balladic in style. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Ernani Cuenco</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diligin ng Hamog ang Uhaw na Lupa&rdquo; (Drench the Parched Earth with Dew), 1975, &ldquo;Ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/860\"><strong>Bakya Mo Neneng</strong></a>&rdquo; (Your Wooden Clogs, Neneng), 1977, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/868\"><strong>Bato sa Buhangin</strong></a>&rdquo; (Pebble in the Sand), 1976, were just few of the notable songs for movies that had substantial airtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Rock</b>. Pinoy rock was the offshoot of the rock boom of the 1960s, when groups equipped with electronic instruments, then known as combos, began to make their presence felt in the local music scene. The distinct and politically charged Pinoy rock, with the typical gritty voice of its vocalists, were unique products of the early 1970s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Juan de la Cruz Band</strong></a> released the single &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/901\"><strong>Ang Himig Natin</strong></a>&rdquo; (Our Hymn) and opened the floodgates of Pinoy rock. The Juan de la Cruz Band consisted of drummer/vocalist Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith, guitarist Wally Gonzalez, and bassist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>. &ldquo;AngHimigNatin&rdquo; was an anthem of sorts for a generation of Filipino youths. Other hits by the band were &ldquo;Beep-Beep,&rdquo; &ldquo;Balong Malalim&rdquo; (Deep Well), &ldquo;Project,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sarap ng Buhay&rdquo; (Good Life), &ldquo;LakisaLayaw&rdquo; (Spoiled Brat), and &ldquo;Panahon&rdquo; (Time). When the band broke up years later, Mike Hanopol embarked on a solo career, producing his own albums <b><i>Buhay Musikero </i></b>(Musician&rsquo;s Life) and <b><i>Awiting Pilipino </i></b>(Filipino Songs), while Wally Gonzales also waxed a solo album, <b><i>Tunog Pinoy</i></b><i> </i>(Filipino Sound). The grand old man of Pinoy rock, Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith, has kept a low profile, but appears from time to time in concerts and TV shows. Other notable Pinoy rock songs of the time included Maria Cafra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pangako&rdquo; (Promise) and &ldquo;Cool Ka Lang, Pare&rdquo; (Keep Cool, Man); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/873\"><strong>Bonggahan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Razzle-dazzle), &ldquo;Laguna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nosi Balasi&rdquo; (Who Are They), and &ldquo;Tao&rdquo; (Man); Anak Bayan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Probinsiyana&rdquo; (Country Girl) and &ldquo;Jeepney Rock&rdquo;; Frictions&rsquo; &ldquo;Perwisyo sa Lipunan&rdquo;; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Mga Pinoy&rdquo; (We Are Filipinos).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, Pinoy rock slowly faded while its various spin-offs took center stage: folk rock as created by FreddieAguilar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a> and Banyuhay, Coritha, Bag-iw, Buklod, and Mike Hanopol; ethnic rock as popularized by Pen-Pen; and punk rock, featuring repetitive riffs and deliberately offensive lyrics by the Betrayed, Chaos, and Urban Bandits. In the 1990s, Pinoy rock further evolved, with new and old names such as the Dawn, Color It Red, Binky Lampano, Advent Call, Tropical Depression, Jerks, and Coco Jam. Bands such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a>, Neocolours, Introvoys, and Afterimage were identified with soft rock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Manila Sound</b>. An important type of OPM came with the &ldquo;Manila Sound,&rdquo; which was characterized by romantic lyrics, often in &ldquo;Taglish,&rdquo; the urban jargon of students in Manila&rsquo;s exclusive schools which combines Tagalog and English words and phrases. These catchy tunes catered mainly to teenagers. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a> band started the trend with &ldquo;Ikaw Ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You Are the Miss Universe of My Life). This was followed by &ldquo;Pers Lab&rdquo; (First Love), &ldquo;Manila,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bitin Ako sa Iyo&rdquo; (You Keep Me Hanging), which captured the fancy of young people from all walks of life. Hotdog&rsquo;s other hits include &ldquo;Annie Batungbakal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bongga Ka &lsquo;Day&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Fabulous, Girl). Another stalwart of the Manila Sound, Cinderella, capitalized on Hotdog&rsquo;s success and came out with their own monster hits: &ldquo;T.L. Ako sa Iyo&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m Truly in Love With You), &ldquo;Superstar ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (Superstar of My Life), &ldquo;Ang Boyfriend kong Baduy&rdquo; (My Gaudy Boyfriend), and &ldquo;Mr. DJ&rdquo; that was popularized by Sharon Cuneta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Childlike songs like Nonoy Gallardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1283\"><strong>Saranggola</strong></a> ni Pepe&rdquo; (Pepe&rsquo;s Kite), sung by Celeste Legaspi, and Jose Mari Chan&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>ng Sorbetero&rdquo; (Ice Cream Man), also sung by Celeste Legaspi, were some of local pop music&rsquo;s hits that competed with the American top hits of that period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Disco</b>.<b> </b>Pinoy disco began in the Philippines with the introduction of salsa music from New York Latinos in the mid-1970s.

Filipino artists have used the folk ballad to communicate nationalist ideas and semididactic messages, and to convey their rebellion against authority and convention. Simple strophic melodies were combined with texts that were either poetic or steeped in political rhetoric. The songs could be a diatribe against Filipino colonial mentality, a plea for freedom from tyranny especially in the context of the Marcos regime, or an espousal of positive Filipino values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Florante rose to fame with &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Pinoy&rdquo; (I Am a Filipino), which celebrated love for the local national language, and &ldquo;Handog&rdquo; (Offering), while HeberBartolome and his band Banyuhay came out with &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Mga Pinoy&rdquo; (We are Filipinos) and &ldquo;Nena.&rdquo; FreddieAguilar&rsquo;s international hit &ldquo;Anak&rdquo; (Child) was a semibiographical ballad about Filipino family values. InangLaya, composed of KarinaConstantino-David and Becky Demetillo-Abraham, specialized in protest music, dwelling on such issues as feminism in &ldquo;Babae&rdquo; (Women) and US military presence in the Philippines in &ldquo;Base Militar&rdquo; (Military Base). Folk singer Coritha sang of love and longing for the home in &ldquo;Si Lolo Jose&rdquo; (Grandfather Jose) and &ldquo;Sierra Madre.&rdquo; Other names that gained prominence in the Pinoy folk idiom, singing songs against oppression, political corruption, and environmental pollution were Susan Fernandez-Magno, JessSantiago, GaryGranada, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3922\"><strong>Noel Cabangon</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk groups penetrated the mainstream popular music scene and left their mark on the period&rsquo;s soundscape. Like its mainstream pop variety, they were self-conscious, if not more so, of their Filipino identity. Banyuhay carried with it the trademark <b>kubing</b> (mouth harp) sound in &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Mga Pinoy.&rdquo; Asin, a folk music band, combined indigenous with mainstream band instruments. Some of the albums the band released included <b><i>Asin</i></b> (Salt), 1978, <b><i>Himig ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Melody of Love), 1979, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1444\"><strong>Himig ng Lahi</strong></a></i></b> (Melody of the Race), 1983, and <b><i>Ang Mga Awitin ng Bayan Kong Pilipinas</i></b> (Songs of My Country the Philippines), 1984.

Protest songs that were performed during street demonstrations or in underground meetings were usually in folk music style that intersected with diverse idioms&mdash;from pop to rock. The use of an amplified acoustic guitar, however, was characteristic of most of these songs. Handclapping and simple percussion instruments like drum and tambourine were also utilized to underscore the spirited protest, and the audience usually sang along with the singer/s. Performers like Susan Fernandez-Magno and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4016\"><strong>Inang Laya</strong></a> were at the forefront of anti-martial law demonstrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The songs of resistance narrated the lives and struggles of the proletariat.

Some of the more prominent artist-exponents of Philippine jazz were Exequiel &ldquo;Lito&rdquo; Molina and the Jazz Friends, Romy Posadas, Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a, Piding Alava, Romy Katindig, and Fred Robles.

Later, the term referred to the merger of jazz with other pop music genres as exemplified by the music of Larry Corel, Stanley Clarke, and George Duke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, among the pioneers in jazz fusion were Eddie Munji and RyanCayabyab. Munji came out in the 1970s with his <b><i>First Modern Pinoy Jazz </i></b>album<b>, </b>where he set traditional Filipino songs to jazz rhythms. Cayabyab, a composer whose academic background afforded him wider exposure to different musical idioms, adapted traditional tunes and rhythms into the jazz idiom in his experimental <b><i>From Roots to Routes</i></b>. The fusion of jazz, Broadway music, and Philippine indigenous music characterizes the music of Cayabyab, as deemed from his more serious compositions like <b><i>Misa </i></b>(Mass), <b><i>Maria Makiling</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>Kapinangan</i></b>,<i> </i>to his lighter pop songs like &ldquo;KayGandangAtingMusika&ldquo; (How Beautiful is Our Music), &ldquo;Isang Awit&rdquo; (One Song), &ldquo;Tsismis&rdquo; (Gossip), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/642\"><strong>Paraisong Parisukat</strong></a> (Square Paradise).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other Filipino artists in the 1970s who were identified with jazz fusion were Bong Pe&ntilde;era and his Batucada band, whose music consisted of blending Tagalog lyrics and the Brazilian samba beat. The Vanishing Tribe also fused ethnic melodies and rhythms with progressive jazz-rock forms. Later exponents of Pinoy jazz fusion included Boy Katindig, EddieKatindig, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4199\"><strong>Tots Tolentino</strong></a>, Rudy Lozano, Menchu Apostol, and Pete Canzon. John Lesaca introduced the classical violin as an effective jazz instrument, while internationally acclaimed jazz pianist Bobby Enriquez awed listeners with his unorthodox piano technique and musical intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Ethnic Pop</b>. The 1980s saw a new trend in the evolution of Philippine popular music. While the music of the previous decade Filipinized and vernacularized popular song styles, leading to the discovery of many talented local performers and songwriters, Pinoy pop remained Western in concept and idiom. Taking their cue from the art music researches and experiments with indigenous elements as well as from the innovative efforts of RyanCayabyab, folk music groups began to incorporate sounds and elements from indigenous and folk music traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of Philippine folk instruments and motives in pop music like in the <b>Bagong Tunog</b> (New Sound) of Ryan Cayabyab became a fad. This neoethnic style was both incorporative of and oppositional to Anglo-American pop. Asin sung traditional folk songs to rock beat. Their hits included &ldquo;Masdan Ang Kapaligiran&rdquo; (Look at the Environment), &ldquo;Ang Bayan Kong Sinilangan&rdquo; (The Land of My Birth), and &ldquo;Pagbabalik&rdquo; (Return). Their songs were sometimes preceded by short preludes played on native instruments. Indigenous instruments such as the <b>kubing</b>, <b>kulintang</b>, <b>tongatong</b>, <b>agung</b>, and <b>faglong</b> were also used by rock groups like Lokal Brown and Grupong Pendong. Ethnic pop, in essence, sought to integrate ethnic elements&mdash;musical structures, instruments, costumes&mdash;into pop music culture. Emil Sanglay, who sought to promote this type of sound, even experimented with Muslim-inspired rhythms in 1970, with his band Penpen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the above ventures into the realms of ethnicity were still anchored on Western pop culture, recent endeavors reflect the desire to create new music and musical idioms from indigenous sources within the context of mass culture. EdruAbraham and his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4033\"><strong>Kontra-Gapi</strong></a> (Kontemporaryong Gamelang<b> </b>Pilipino), a University of the Philippines-based group, experiment on new compositions by fusing various Philippine music traditions (i.e., pre-Christian, rural folk music) and modern song styles. JoeyAyala incorporates instrumental sounds from Mindanao highland cultures in his music, which can be characterized as a spontaneous fusion of folk ballad style and minimalist structural elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Aug 1983, the anti-Marcos movement used the American pop song &ldquo;Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,&rdquo; originally sung by the pop music group Tony Orlando and Dawn, to welcome Ninoy Aquino from exile. When Ninoy was assassinated at the Manila International Airport tarmac, yellow became the color of both mourning and defiance. As the regime&rsquo;s hold on the society started to weaken, the people&rsquo;s voice began to gather strength. By 1986 dissent had two colors: the yellow, which came to be associated with the pro-Aquino movement, and the red of the democratic Left. Whether red or yellow, the anti-Marcos forces found a common voice, a common enemy to fight, and a common occasion to celebrate&mdash;that of freedom from the repressive Marcos regime. During and after the EDSA People Power Revolution, the songs in mainstream pop song style, namely, &ldquo;Magkaisa&rdquo; (United), composed by Tito Sotto and sung by Virna Lisa, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/897\"><strong>Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo</strong></a>&rdquo; (Filipinos&rsquo; Gift to the World) by Jim Paredes, celebrated the end of the dictatorship.

For six years, the Aquino government toiled to restore democracy in the country, ratified a new constitution in 1987, and revitalized government agencies, nongovernment organizations, and private institutions. The Concerned Artists of the Philippines spearheaded the formation of a broad alliance of artists (later to form the Samahan sa Kultura at Sining or SAKSI). This ad hoc group called the Alliance of Artists for the Creation of the Ministry of Culture (AACMC) clamored for democratic change in the arts establishment, proposing the creation of a new ministry dedicated to the administration of the cultural affairs of the country, which later became the basis for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a> Bill proposed by Sen Leticia Shahani. The AACMC&rsquo;s people-oriented approach to governance contrasted with the &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; approach of the Marcos administration, which emphasized the cultivation of Western high art culture. Majority of Filipino artists who had worked underground during the martial law years resurfaced and became involved in the new administration, as did progressive employees working at the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP). Their voices heralded a major social and cultural shift in outlook in the new government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Change in Cultural Policy.</b> After the EDSA Revolt and the change in administration, Pres Aquino appointed a new team to administrate the CCP. Ma. Teresa Roxas took over the helm of the institution from Lucrecia Kasilag who had been its artistic director from 1969-86, and concurrently, its president from 1976-86. Roxas then invited Nicanor Tiongson to be CCP&rsquo;s artistic director in July of 1986. It was during Roxas and Tiongson&rsquo;s incumbency that CCP&rsquo;s thrusts were reconceptualized and pertinent policies implemented. The post-Marcos CCP established five new guiding principles towards the development of state policy in the arts: Filipinization, democratization, decentralization, promotion of artistic excellence, and reorientation of international exchanges. Filipinization meant that CCP should first and foremost actively support Filipino artists and their works; democratization implied that CCP should encourage the participation of audiences from all the social classes in its programs; decentralization, which involved the creation of regional councils in arts and culture, entailed the participation of all regions and sectors towards the creation of a Filipino national culture; promotion of artistic excellence meant CCP should always work towards the highest artistic standards but relative to form and circumstance of production; and reorientation of international exchanges emphasized the promotion of Filipino artists abroad (Tiongson 2009b).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These five principles have guided CCP&rsquo;s operations since 1986. They influenced the goals of other similar agencies throughout the archipelago, encouraging a more people-oriented representation in the creation and the articulation of the national culture. The institutional goals were to &ldquo;achieve a national culture evolving with and for all Filipinos ... [through the formation of] a unified cultural consciousness among all Filipinos and the creation of original Filipino works that are rooted in the country&rsquo;s traditions&rdquo; (Tiongson 2009b). The encouraging environment fostered the development and growth of art works and productions. Regional artists, as well as those working in Manila, were inspired to produce works that were unique to their local situations and circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Succeeding leadership at the CCP continued the established democratization thrust of the Roxas-Tiongson administration, aligning the programs of the center to serve the political agenda of each subsequent Philippine president. During the terms of Nestor O. Jardin, who served as president from 2001 to 2009 with Fernando Josef as artistic director from 2001 to 2008, the institutional programs of the CCP were reoriented towards the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo Administration&rsquo;s poverty alleviation programs. Another priority program was the CCP Complex Development Project. During the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, the CCP administration, under the leadership of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a> as president with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\"><strong>Chris Millado</strong></a> as artistic director, established new programs supporting the Aquino government&rsquo;s political agenda, such as Arts Therapy Programs to different communities which suffered disasters, calamities, and even armed conflicts, and intensive outreach and training programs for artists, teachers, students, local government units, and other depressed and disadvantaged communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In response to the AACMC proposal, the Aquino government, under Executive Order (EO) 118 dated 30 Jan 1987, created the Presidential Commission for Culture and the Arts (PCCA), which eventually became the NCCA by virtue of Republic Act (RA) 7356, passed on 8 Apr 1992. NCCA was placed directly under the Office of the President and was tasked to strengthen a Filipino national identity by formulating cultural policies and coordinating the activities that promoted the culture of the people. Section 9 of RA 7356 stated that the commission should be comprised of the undersecretaries, directors, heads, and chairs of various government agencies that are connected to cultural development, among which are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</strong></a>; the National Historical Institute (NHI); the National Museum; the National Library; and the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), presently reorganized as the Department of Education (DepEd).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The NCCA evolved from its initial mandate to formulate and implement policies and plans for Filipino cultural and artistic development and has worked as a coordinating body for all governmental cultural agencies as mandated by Executive Order 80 passed on 5 Mar 1999, the Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001 or RA 9155 passed on 11 Aug 2001, and the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009 or RA <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>66 passed on 26 Mar 2010. As the coordinating organization for all affiliated government cultural agencies, NCCA&rsquo;s grants assistance program for the development, protection, preservation, and dissemination of Philippine culture and arts, was also centralized. Pursuant to RA 7356, the National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1158\"><strong>Endo</strong></a>wment Fund for Culture and Arts (NEFCA) was established and its administration assigned to the NCCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Effects of Changes in Cultural Policy.</b> The music of the period reflected changes in national cultural policies as well as other developments. The period saw an enormous increase in new works being created, performed, and recorded, and old theatrical productions being restaged. Many musicians were now invigorated by the openness of the new government and the financial and logistical support for their projects provided primarily by the CCP and NCCA. Musicians from the capital enjoyed the freedom to create new provocative works defining the new spirit of the nation. Composers and singers of protest music marginalized during the Marcos presidency found legitimate venues for their performances. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>, Susan Fernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4002\"><strong>Gary Granada</strong></a>, and the protest-groups <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4016\"><strong>Inang Laya</strong></a>, Buklod, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4116\"><strong>Patatag</strong></a> rose to national prominence as artists after 1986. There was greater music collaboration between composers and artists using other art forms such as Joey Ayala and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong>&rsquo; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a> </i></b>(Enchantress) and Ramon Santos&rsquo;s full-length dance drama, <b><i>Daragang Magayon: An Istorya ni Mayon </i></b>(Beautiful Maiden: The Story of Mayon).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe period also witnessed the construction of innovative alternative concert venues such as the Casa San Miguel in Zambales and the Hiyas ng Bulakan Convention Center in Bulacan, the proliferation of national and international music festivals, and the increased participation of Filipino musicians in festivals abroad. Music festivals that featured hundreds, if not thousands, of Filipino and foreign participants were mounted in the different regions of the country and supported by national and regional government offices. Local artists in greater numbers pursued higher musical training in Europe and the United States, formerly supported personally by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos but now supported by a variety of sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Musicologists, music scholars and music critics, also assisted by the new grants and incentives offered by the state agencies, contributed to the national effort by actively participating in the production of books and other publications on Philippine music. The new dispensation fostered an environment open to critical judgments of musical works as seen in the published critiques in new periodicals and journals. Associations of artists, composers, and performers which operated as independent entities in civil society continued to flourish, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\"><strong>Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP)</strong></a> and the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New awards were also established to recognize artistic excellence such as the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA), the equivalent of the National Artist Award given to indigenous artists, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a> ng Dangal Award conferred annually by the NCCA since 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Groups from the regions also benefitted from the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program that supported their tours and performances to other parts of the country and enabled them to come into the national consciousness. Among these were the Barasoain Kalinangan Ensemble of Malolos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\"><strong>Sining Kambayoka</strong></a> Ensemble of Marawi, Dagyaw Dance and Theater <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> of Iloilo, and Joey Ayala at ang Bagong Lumad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">CCP embarked on an aggressive campaign to showcase a wider selection of artists and Filipino original works by instituting full grants, venue grants, and production grants. The full grant allowed for the free use of CCP venues and provided financial assistance to cover production costs. The venue grant allowed for the use of Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\"><strong>Aurelio V. Tolentino</strong></a> (formerly Little Theater) or Tanghalang Huseng Batute (formerly Bulwagang Gantimpala) for a total of six performances during the year. Chameleon Dance Company took advantage of this grant and was able to present the dance concert <b><i>Unang Hakbang</i></b> (First Step) at the Tanghalang Aurelio V. Tolentino in 1991. The production grant provided financial assistance to produce a play outside the CCP. Through this grant, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2506\"><strong>Enrico Labayen</strong></a></strong> created <b><i>Lab Projekt II</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2545\"><strong>Douglas Nierras</strong></a> produced <b><i>Dating Gawi, Bagong Anyo</i></b> (Old Habits, New Forms) in 1991. Aside from the three grants, the CCP also initiated a residency program in which artists lived in locales of their choice for an extended period to conduct workshops that culminated in community-based performances. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a> and Ballet Philippines II were able to conduct dance workshops in Davao and Iligan in 1991 through this program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important component towards the Filipinization of the CCP was the Filipino Artists Series at the Tanghalang Aurelio V. Tolentino. Since its launch in 1987, many outstanding Filipino musicians have been featured such as classically trained instrumentalists and singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3851\"><strong>Nita Abrogar-Quinto</strong></a>, Jonathan Zaens, Mariel Ilusorio, Wilfredo Pasamba, Rene Dalandan, Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro, Ronan Ferrer, Jasper Andra, Margarita Yulo Gomez, Aima Labra, Peter Porticos, Clarissa Ocampo, the Kabayao Family Quintet, Denise Huang, Greg Zuniega, Adolfo Mendoza, Camille Lopez, Andrew Fernandez, Manuel Cabrera II, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3929\"><strong>Mark Anthony Carpio</strong></a>, Abelardo Galang II, Victor Asuncion, and Ariel Dechosa. The Series also showcased ethnic pop composer-singer Joey Ayala and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Band&mdash;nonclassical musicians who espouse alternative music and non-commercial jazz, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The impressive output of Filipino composers, singers, actors, dancers, music educators, and musicologists after the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolt created a vibrant musical environment that resulted in a more participative national culture for the Filipino people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Universities and Institutions. </b>The years after 1986 were a period of growth in the musical arts and scholarship. Many Filipino artists and musicologists who studied in Europe and the United States returned to perform, teach in the academe, and embark on cultural and historical research projects. The growth of universities offering music degrees gave more opportunities for advanced musical training. In addition to performance (also known as applied music), the period saw a considerable number of publications of musical works and musicological books by a new generation of musicians and writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Formal music education flourished in 13 universities and institutes recognized by the state: the University of the Philippines (UP), University of Santo Tomas, St Scholastica&rsquo;s College, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, St Paul University of Manila, Santa Isabel College, De La Salle University-College of St Benilde, Centro Escolar University, Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music, Unibersidad de Santa Isabel in Naga, University of San Agustin in Iloilo, University of the Immaculate Conception in Davao, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a> in Dumaguete. The College of St Benilde offers a music course that specializes in music technology, the Bachelor of Arts in music production, which is geared towards the technologically oriented music industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2011, the UP College of Music instituted a PhD in music studies degree with emphasis on music research. At about the same time, the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University School of Music also started to offer a doctor of philosophy in music, with a major in ethnomusicology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2004, the Department of Education started to implement a special program focusing on the arts in selected secondary public schools all over the nation. Called Special Program in the Arts (SPA), it was envisioned to develop young students with strong inclination toward music, visual arts, theater arts, creative writing, media arts and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Patronage of Private Companies. </b>During this period, corporate patronage of the arts intensified. Many national and multinational companies in the Philippines ventured into corporate responsibility programs, setting aside a budget for cultural investments and sponsoring artistic groups and their projects. These contributed to nation building for corporate sponsorships enabled public music activities, thus enhancing the quality of social life in local communities. Big Filipino companies such as San Miguel Corporation (SMC), Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Toyota Motor Corporation, The Manila Peninsula, Philippine Airlines (PAL), among many, have a long track record of supporting Filipino music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">SMC was a staunch supporter of Philippine ballets and symphonies, the Balikbanda contests, and regular events such as the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> and the <b><i>Cenaculo at Rizal Park</i></b>. In 2002, it founded the San Miguel Foundation for the Performing Arts, which housed a symphony orchestra and a master chorale. Through its musical director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, the foundation concertized extensively in the capital and some regions of the Philippines, employing more than a hundred instrumental and vocal artists until it was disbanded in 2007. Aside from the SMC Foundation, Toyota Motor Corporation has sponsored concerts by visiting orchestras, chamber groups, and instrumental and vocal soloists at the CCP through its <b><i>Toyota Classics: A World of Harmony</i></b> concerts held annually since 1990. PLDT has funded the CCP&rsquo;s Filipino Artists Series, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Pilipino, PPO Concert Series, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2444\"><strong>Dance Theater Philippines</strong></a> productions. Visiting artists have been flown into the country by airline companies such as PAL, and they were billeted at sponsoring five-star hotels such as the former Manila Holiday Inn (now Traders&rsquo; Hotel), Philippine Plaza, and the Peninsula Manila. Corporate financial and economic support for the arts has exposed audiences to diverse types of Filipino music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Mass Media and Technological Advances. </b>Since 1986, mass media has played an important role in the promotion of musical activities. After all, it is the recording, broadcasting and film industries, supported by the rapid developments in telecommunications technology in the late 1980s; the affordability of electronic equipment and computer software made available to consumers in early 1990s; and the shift from analog to digital audio recording in late 1990s, that facilitated the circulation of music for individual and collective consumption. Through the efforts of the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM), an organization that promotes original Filipino music and seeks to protect the welfare of those who are part of the music industry, the government issued Executive Order 255, dated 25 Jul 1987, which required radio stations with music programs to play at least four original Filipino music compositions every hour. Television programs, particularly drama anthologies, also began to use OPM as background music in their shows. This helped create a steady market for the local pop music industry and gave Philippine artists a steady source of income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the recording industry, an artist&rsquo;s success can be measured by the number of recordings he or she has sold. Various recording companies such as Vicor Records, OctoArts International, and Viva Records have awarded their artists with gold, platinum record, and diamond record certifications according to their respective guidelines. Since 1990, the awarding of certificates has been assigned to the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI), and since March 2012, PARI has awarded the Gold Record for every 7,500 units sold, the Platinum Record for every 15,000 units sold, and the Diamond Record for every 150,000 units sold (PARI website).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the beginning of the 21st century, electronic gadgets such as mobile phones, laptops, iPads and tablets, which have the capacity to store digital files, midis and videos, became more affordable to the wider populace. These gadgets and the Internet have revolutionized the creation, distribution, and even production of music. The traditional channels of distribution via the recording industry were replaced by 21st century technology that allowed for the direct distribution of music from artists to consumers. The internet has become the main tool for transferring recorded music bypassing traditional industry channels and allowing musicians to reach a broader audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Live performances such as international choral competitions where many Filipino choirs have participated have been made available to the Philippine public electronically via telepresencing or livestreaming. Recorded performances are uploaded on the internet site YouTube. Current and relevant issues in the entertainment industry, classical concert scene, and university-based artistic groups are now enthusiastically discussed in public fora such as pinoyexchange.com, thus opening the discussion to those with internet access. Some Filipino piano students today even avail of lessons from friends from abroad via Skype.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the Internet having been able to democratize knowledge dissemination and the promotion of musical activities and productions, it has also been used as a venue for selling digital recordings, albeit this is still regulated by PARI. The regulation is set in place because the easy acquisition of recording equipment and the reproducibility of music expressions have contributed to the increase of music piracy which is financed by an international syndicate of thieves who distribute them through petty itinerant music peddlers in Philippine cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Associations and Organizations. </b>Many of the existing musical organizations such as the Filipino Society of Composers Authors and Publishers (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3987\"><strong>FILSCAP</strong></a>), PARI, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC), which became a national chapter of the Asian Composers&rsquo; League in 2005, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4126\"><strong>Philippine Society for Music Education</strong></a> (PSME) and its corollary Piano Teachers&rsquo; Guild of the Philippines, and the Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas (PASAMBAP) continued with their mandates. New associations have also emerged. The AACMC and SAKSI were formed to lobby for the creation of a separate government agency to administer cultural affairs, right after the change of government in 1986. The Philippine Federation for Choral Music (PFCM), organized in 1996, was geared towards the promotion and appreciation of choral music. However, this organization did not last long. The Philippine Choral Directors Association (PCDA), founded in 2008, continued the aims of PFCM. Since its foundation, the PCDA has been actively propagating Philippine choral arts through its annual conventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> Company (separate from the 1983 Philippine Opera Company) was founded in 1999. This is the only opera company in the country that regularly presents staged drama with music. The Jazz Society of the Philippines was launched on 16 Mar 2003 as a venue for jazz enthusiasts to get together to enjoy, promote, and advance jazz music in the Philippines. In Oct 1986, the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM) was founded with the mission to promote original Pilipino music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Critical Appraisal of Music. </b>Classical music performances in the various venues in the capital receive immediate feedback through performance reviews that are printed in the daily newspapers. Music critics, who have been writing even before 1986, continue to share their opinion about these performances. Among them are Antonio Hila, Rosalinda Orosa, and Pablo Tariman who regularly write for periodicals such as <b><i>Manila Bulletin</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Star</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b>. Scholarly criticism of performances, recordings, and publications about music have also been written, and these are published in scholarly refereed journals such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1041\"><strong>Musika Jornal</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, <b><i>Asian Studies</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Budhi</i></b>, <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Humanities Review, Perspectives in the Arts and Humanities</i></b>, and <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another form of critical appraisal is the conferring of awards by respected institutions to encourage artistic excellence in the field of music. The highest award that is bestowed to a Filipino artist remains the National Artist Award, which was established in 1973 through Presidential Proclamation 1144. In the field of music, the following have been accorded the National Artist Award after 1986: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, 1988; Lucrecia Kasilag, 1989; Lucio San Pedro, 1991; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\"><strong>Levi Celerio</strong></a>, 1997; Felipe Padilla de Leon, 1997; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>, 1997; <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Ernani Cuenco</strong></a></strong>, 1999; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea Veneracion</strong></a>, 1999; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>, 2014; and Ramon Santos, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA) or the National Living Treasures Award, on the other hand, is a recognition given to indigenous cultural bearers. Enacted through RA 7355 passed in April 1992, the GAMABA Award is given to &ldquo;a citizen engaged in any traditional art uniquely Filipino whose distinctive skills have reached such a high level of technical and artistic excellence and have been passed on to and widely practiced by the present generation in his/her community with the same degree of technical and artistic competence.&rdquo; It is currently administered by the NCCA. Since 1993, five indigenous musicians have been accorded the GAMABA award: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4185\"><strong>Samaon Sulaiman</strong></a>, 1993; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4019\"><strong>Masino Intaray</strong></a>, 1993; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3858\"><strong>Uwang Ahadas</strong></a>, 2000; Frederico Caballero, 2000; and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4154\"><strong>Alonzo Saclag</strong></a></strong>, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 1977, the CCP has conferred an award that honors the country&rsquo;s outstanding performing artists. The award was renamed Gawad CCP Para sa Sining in 1989. Notable artists who have received this award for music include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\"><strong>Cecile Licad</strong></a>, Andrea Veneracion, Levi Celerio, Jose Maceda, Ryan Cayabyab, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\"><strong>Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another award that recognizes the contribution of Filipino artists is the Ani ng Dangal, given for the first time in 2009 by the NCCA. Unlike the other awards that focus on individual achievements through many years of artistic productivity, Ani ng Dangal recognizes achievements received by artists during the year particularly in the area of international competitions. Some of the Filipino musicians and groups given the Ani ng Dangal award are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4287\"><strong>Teresa Barrozo</strong></a>, Jed Madela, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4207\"><strong>UP Singing Ambassadors</strong></a>, University of Santo Tomas Singers, University of the Visayas Chorale, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4103\"><strong>Novo Concertante Manila</strong></a>, Hail Mary the Queen Children&rsquo;s Choir, Imusicapella, and De La Salle University Chorale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The achievements of pop music artists and bands in the field of popular culture are recognized by a number of award-giving bodies. The Katha Music Award is the most coveted among songwriters and popular music performers. It is an accolade not based on an artist&rsquo;s popularity or marketability but on the quality of his or her work. The first Katha Awards were given in 1995. Some of the exceptional artists who have won include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4102\"><strong>Grace Nono</strong></a> who was awarded four years in a row from 1996 to 1999, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a> in 1996, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4180\"><strong>South Border</strong></a> in 1999, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4073\"><strong>Jungee Marcelo</strong></a> in 2000, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Gloc-9</strong></a> in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two other awards are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> Awards and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Awards. The Awit Awards recognize exceptional Filipino recordings and performers. The awards were originally managed by the Awit Awards Executive Committee comprised of representatives from various recording companies in 1969, and were later handled by the Philippine Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (PARAS) from 1970 to 1971. They were discontinued after 1971. The Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) revived the awards in 1988. Recipients of the Awit Awards include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a> who has won 12 times from 1989 to 2013, Smokey Mountain in 1991, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3940\"><strong>The CompanY</strong></a> in 1992 and 2002, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a> in 1994 and 1996, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> in 2006 and 2008, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Sarah Geronimo</strong></a></strong> in 2015 and 2016, and Ebe Dancel in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Aliw Awards recognize excellence in opera, theatre, dance, and live instrumental and vocal performances. Given by the Aliw Awards Foundation, Inc. founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\"><strong>Alice Reyes</strong></a> in 1976, these awards were conferred for the first time in 1977. The Aliw Awards Foundation, Inc. bestows the Entertainer of the Year award, which is the most sought-after honor. In recent years, the Entertainer of the Year was conferred on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4220\"><strong>Regine Velasquez</strong></a> in 2009, Sarah Geronimo in 2010, Charice Pempengco in 2011, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2523\"><strong>Lisa Macuja</strong></a> in 2012, Dulce in 2013, Jed Madela in 2014, Gerphil <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> in 2015, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\"><strong>Lea Salonga</strong></a></strong> in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The NU Rock Awards recognized the work and artistry of rock artists.

This event, featuring the famous bamboo organ and held in the month of February since 1975, has a weeklong concert schedule including works by Filipino composers like Lucio San Pedro, Francisco Feliciano, Lucrecia Kasilag, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\"><strong>Chino Toledo</strong></a>, and Nicolas Sengson. Many Filipino concertists and vocalists, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a>, Andrea Veneracion, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4097\"><strong>Joel Navarro</strong></a>, Eudenice Palaruan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4218\"><strong>Jonathan Velasco</strong></a>, Raul Sunico, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3920\"><strong>Nolyn Cabahug</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4001\"><strong>Otoniel Gonzaga</strong></a>, Wilfredo Pasamba, Rachelle Gerodias, Janet Sabas Aracama, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4219\"><strong>Noel Velasco</strong></a>, and Armando Salarza, have participated.

Its famous <b><i>Concert Under the Tree</i></b> has featured pop artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2732\"><strong>Isay Alvarez</strong></a>, Robert Se&ntilde;a, The CompanY, The Opera, TUX, and the APO Hiking Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP initiated a number of national and international choral music festivals during this period such as the Philippine International Choral Festivals in 1998 and 2003. In 2009, the 1st CCP National Choral Competition took place on 18-22 Aug as part of the institution&rsquo;s 40th anniversary celebration. Not long after, the Andrea O. Veneracion (AOV) International Choral Festival 2013 was held to celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of the Philippine Madrigal Singers that this National Artist nurtured in her lifetime. It was held on 7-10 Aug 2013, exactly a month after she passed away. The second AOV International Choral Festival was held on 22-25 Jul 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another festival that has been mounted regularly at the CCP is the International Guitar Festival and Competition. This began in 2010 and was organized by a group of Filipino guitar aficionados called Guitar Friends, together with the CCP. Related to this is the Philippine Ukelele Festival organized by Ukelele Philippines and Ukelele Underground Philippines. It aimed to popularize ukelele playing, and this festival was first held in Oct 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from these CCP-initiated festivals, a noteworthy one that began in 1991 is the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong> Fiesta. The goal of the festival was to revive the singing of Filipino <b>kundiman</b> among the youth. The first five years of the festival were financed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Hotel Manila</strong></a> Garden in Manila. In 1996, NCCA took over the program. In 1995, the Makati Coliseum and Cultural Affairs Office started another kundiman singing competition in celebration of the &ldquo;Buwan ng Wika&rdquo; (Philippine Language Month) in Makati City. The competition was aptly called <b><i>Kampeon ng Kundiman </i></b>(Champion of the Kundiman), and it has been held annually ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1996, the Bolipata Brothers, who were all music scholars of the Marcos government, established the Pundaquit Festival in their home province of Zambales. The festival aims to provide both long and short-term residencies for visiting artists, and to hold performances, workshops, and exhibits that would help invigorate the local community. This is held in the Bolipata estate called Casa San Miguel, an alternative venue for concerts of classical music outside the capital. Since its foundation, the festival has featured many classical artists from the various music schools in the Philippines, as well as visiting musicians from abroad. They have a mentorship program with aims to develop young artists from Zambales. Respected Filipino artists such as Joey Ayala, Grace Nono, and Cecile Licad have played at the Casa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of popular music, the Puerto Azul Music and Sports Festival, launched in 1993 by Katrina Panlilio, exemplifies the fusion of art and the economics of tourism. Organized primarily to drum up interest in the Puerto Azul Resort in Ternate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>, this has become an annual affair that has attracted big names in the pop music industry. Followers of rock bands and pop groups are drawn to the sporty atmosphere of the resort. A similar gathering is the annual Malasimbo Music and Arts Festival, which is staged in Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro. It was started in 2011 by Hubert d&rsquo;Aboville, a Frenchman who decided to stay for good in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several festivals celebrating the growth of jazz music in the Philippines have been organized such as the annual Manila Jazz Festival, initially staged as part of the annual French Spring Manila in the early 2000s; the Full Moon Jazz Festival in 2003; and the Candid Jazz International Festival, which began in 2004. The CCP also held its 1st International Jazz Festival in August 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Competitions in popular music composition and performance make up most of the events for pop music. The Metro Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\"><strong>Pop Music</strong></a> Festival, later renamed as Metropop Song Festival upon its revival in 1996, was the most productive songwriting competition in the country of the period. Held annually from 1978 to 1985, it experienced a hiatus until its revival in 1996. The festival continued until 2003. The Metropop catapulted the musical careers of new songwriters and singers whose pop songs became instant hits. Among the songwriters are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4192\"><strong>Danny Tan</strong></a>, Trina Belamide, Dodjie Simon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4167\"><strong>Vehnee Saturno</strong></a>, Mike Villegas, Bayang Barrios, Arnold Villegas, and Jonathan Manalo. Singers whose careers took off with the help of a Metropop distinction were Jaya, Rannie Raymundo, Gary Granada, Carol Banawa, Lani <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>lucha, Dessa, Zebedee Zuniega, Cynthia Alexander, and Ella May Saison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another songwriting tilt with an international pool of participants was the Musika Manila which awarded a cash prize of $20,000 for the First Prize winner. Held from 27 Nov to 1 Dec 1996, it attracted 12 contenders from different countries. Winner of the grand prize was the Philippine entry &ldquo;Build a Bridge&rdquo; that was composed by Christine Bendebil and sung by Rommel Gonzaga. The 1998 edition was renamed Asia Song Festival, held at the AFP Theater within Camp Aguinaldo. The Second Prize was awarded to the Philippines&rsquo; Jungee Marcelo&rsquo;s composition, &ldquo;Handle With Care,&rdquo; interpreted by Lani Misalucha. Misalucha was awarded Best Interpreter in the entire competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Launched on 15 Feb 2012 was the Philippine Pop Music Festival (PhilPOP) Songwriting Competition, which aimed to encourage Filipinos to create music that had the prospect of becoming classic hits. The grand prize winners for the first three years were: Karl Villuga with his song &ldquo;Bawat Hakbang&rdquo; (For Every Step), 2012; Thyro Alfaro and Yumi Lacsamana with &ldquo;Dati&rdquo; (Before), 2013; and Jungee Marcelo with &ldquo;Salbabida&rdquo; (Lifesaver), 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of traditional Philippine music, the International Rondalla Festival, initiated by Ramon Santos, was held in different regional centers. These featured string ensembles from different countries, together with rondalla groups from the Philippines. The festivals were staged in Naga, 2004; Dumaguete, 2007; Tagum, 2011; and Manila, 2014. A related festival that highlighted gongs and bamboo instruments was organized also by Ramon Santos in Dipolog City from 16-23 Feb 2013. Titled <b><i>Tunog-Tugan: 1st International Gongs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/771\"><strong>Bamboo Music</strong></a> Festival</i></b>, this came with an academic conference, a practical workshop, and lecture-demonstration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside of Manila, the City of Tagum in Davao del Norte hosts an annual music festival called <b><i>Musikahan sa Tagum</i></b>. Started in 1999, the festival features various competitions in several categories like brass band, parade music, choir competition, and songwriting. Since its inception, the festival has grown and is recognized as an annual major music event in the Philippines, attracting participants from the various regions of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Foreign Training of Artists and Scholars. </b>After the change in government in 1986, scholarship grants given through Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s Young Artist Foundation were cut. However, many of the scholars were able to continue their studies with the help of philanthropists, organizations, or their own families. CCP had its own scholarship fund, and it sent a few young artists abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of these scholars returned to the Philippines after completing their studies and enriched the country&rsquo;s cultural life through their performances or through their commitment to teaching in the various music conservatories in the country. There were also other successful foreign-based Filipino musicians who regularly visited the Philippines to give concerts. These were Oscar Yatco (violinist and conductor), <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4052\"><strong>Carmencita Lozada</strong></a></strong> (violinist), Otoniel Gonzaga (tenor), Aries Caces (pianist), and Cecile Licad (pianist).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of musicology, two Filipino scholars returned in the late 1990s to teach at the University of the Philippines College of Music. Jose Buenconsejo, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and LaVerne dela Pe&ntilde;a, a graduate of the University of Hawaii, added to the slowly growing group of foreign-trained Filipino PhD in music holders, which has included Jose Maceda from the University of California in Los Angeles, Corazon Canave Dioquino from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., Ramon Santos from the State University of New York at Buffalo, Felicidad Prudente from the University of Michigan, Mercedes Dujunco from the University of Washington in Seattle, and Arsenio Nicolas from Cornell University in New York. Kristina Benitez from the University of Michigan would later be an addition to the group after finishing her degree in mid-2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The number of Filipino musicians who went abroad to take further studies in music performance or establish a musical career continues to rise. The long list includes Raul Sunico, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3874\"><strong>Rowena Arrieta</strong></a>, Albert Tiu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>, Rene Dalandan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3975\"><strong>Joseph Esmilla</strong></a>, Aries Caces, Ariel Dechosa, Jonathan Velasco, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Alegria Ferrer</strong></a></strong></strong>, Eudenice Palaruan, Camille Lopez-Molina, Pablo Molina, Jonathan Zaens, Gary del Rosario, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3853\"><strong>Ramon Acoymo</strong></a>, Renato Lucas, Eugene delos Santos, Ronan Ferrer, Charisse Baldoria, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Gerard Salonga</strong></a></strong>, Abelardo Galang II, Robin Estrada, Karen Francisco, Peter Porticos, Michelle Nicolasura, Randy Gilongo, Thea Prosia, Nathan Manimtim, Hiyas Hila, Isidora Miranda, Adolfo Mendoza, Alejandro Consolacion II, Rica Nepomuceno, Beverly Shangkuan, and Ena Aldecoa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Worth noting are two scholars from the St Joseph Parish in Las Pi&ntilde;as, Cealwyn Tagle and Edgar Montiano, who underwent three years of intensive on-the-job training for pipe organ construction and maintenance in Austria. Upon their return in the early 1990s, their first assignment was to construct a pipe organ at the St Joseph&rsquo;s Academy Auditorium, adjacent to the church where the bamboo organ is located. The organ was inaugurated in 1994, and from then on, they constructed new pipe organs and restored existing ones in older churches under the company <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a> Builders Inc. Some of the pipe organs they constructed are to be found at the Cathedral of Cebu, the Immaculate Conception Church Parish in Pasig, and the San Sebastian Cathedral in Lipa. They also restored the pipe organs of the San Agustin Church and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> in Intramuros, allowing the two historical churches to organize music festivals with pipe organ music as the main attraction. The San Agustin International Music Festival started in 1998, while the Manila Cathedral Pipe Organ Festival began in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Publications. </b>Many books on music and about music have been published since 1986. Choral arrangements and scores for voice with piano accompaniment dominate this market of print music. In 1990, the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music (AILM) and the Christian Conference of Asia published the <b><i>Sound the Bamboo</i></b><i>.</i> Other published books containing songs are <b><i>Patatag: Masdan, O Yahweh </i></b>(Patatag: Look, Oh Yahweh), 1990; <b><i>50 Immortal Filipino Duets</i></b>; 1992, <b><i>Kundiman At Iba Pa </i></b>(Kundiman and Others), 1994; <b><i>Mga Awiting Bayan </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a>s), 1994; <b><i>Himig: A Collection of Philippine Folksongs</i></b>, Vols. 1-5, late 1990s to early 2000s; <b><i>Philippine Choral Music</i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Koro Leyte&ntilde;o</i></b>, 2004; <b><i>The AILM Collection: Hymns, Psalms, and Songs for Worship, Volume 1</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>Mga Awiting Bayan Para sa Korong Pilipino </i></b>(Folk Songs for the Filipino Chorus), 2008; <b><i>Serenata: A Treasury of Traditional Kapampangan Folksongs</i></b>, 2009; and <b><i>Aweng ti Kailokuan: The Musical Heritage of the Ilocanos</i></b>, 2011. The Jesuit music ministry Himig Heswita has also contributed several volumes of music for the liturgical services of the Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The flourishing of musical scholarship in the Philippines is evidenced by the growth in the publication of books on Philippine music. Among the earliest publications after 1986 were the accompanying monographs of CCP&rsquo;s <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i></b> in 1989. <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i></b> was a 28-part series of educational videotapes and monographs on the evolution of the seven arts: film, theater, music, architecture, visual arts, dance, and literature. This project was followed by the landmark publication of the 10-volume <b><i>CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</i></b> in 1994, edited by Nicanor Tiongson, with the music volume edited by Ramon Santos and Corazon Dioquino. Envisioned as a reference material on Philippine art and culture, the encyclopedia was the product of a vast collaborative network of scholars, artists, and experts in the different artistic fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from these two major publications, several books in music have been printed after 1986. Elena Rivera Mirano published <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>Subli</strong></a>: One Dance in Four Voices</i></b>, 1989, which won the National Book Award in 1989; and <b><i>Ang Mga Tradisyonal na Musikang Pantinig sa Lumang Bauan, Batangas </i></b>(Traditional Vocal Music in the Old Bauan, Batangas), 1997. <b><i>Gongs and Bamboos: A Panorama of Philippine Musical Instruments</i></b>, a summation of Jose Maceda&rsquo;s decades-long, extensive research on indigenous instruments of the ethnolinguistic groups in the country, was published in 1998. <b><i>Songs and Gifts at the Frontier: Person and Exchange in the Agusan Manobo Possession <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong>, Philippines</i></b> written by Jose Buenconsejo was published by Routledge in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other books on Philippine music include <b><i>Music in History, History in Music</i></b> by Antonio Hila, 2004; <b><i>Tunugan: Four <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\"><strong>Essay</strong></a>s on Filipino Music</i></b> by Ramon Santos, 2005; <b><i>Myth, Mimesis and Magic in the Music of the T&rsquo;boli, Philippines</i></b> by Manolete Mora, 2005; <b><i>The Bamboo Organ of Las Pi&ntilde;as</i></b>, second edition, by Helen Samson-Lauterwald, 2006; <b><i>Kolonyal na Patakaran at ang Nagbabagong Kamalayang Filipino: Musika sa Publikong Paaralan sa Pilipinas 1898-1935</i></b> (Colonial Policies and the Evolving Filipino Consciousness: Music in Public Schools in the Philippines) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4099\"><strong>Raul Navarro</strong></a>, 2007; <b><i>The Life and Works of <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></i></b> edited by Elena Rivera Mirano, 2009; <b><i>Kirial de Baclayon a&ntilde;o 1826: Hispanic Sacred Music in 19th Century Bohol, Philippines</i></b> by Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo-Chua, 2010; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1027\"><strong>Colonial Counterpoint: Music in Early Modern Manila</strong></a></i></b> by David Irving, 2010; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1040\"><strong>Musical Renderings of the Philippine Nation</strong></a></i></b> by Christi-Anne Castro, 2011; <b><i>Laon-Laon </i></b>by Ramon Santos, 2012; <b><i>Dictionary of Filipino Music Terms </i></b>edited by Ramon Santos, 2013; <b><i>Musika at Bagong Lipunan: Pagbuo ng Lipunang Filipino, 1972-1986</i></b> (Music and the New Society: Creating the Filipino Society, 1972-1986) by Raul Navarro, 2014; <b><i>Sibod: Ideology and Expressivity in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/44\"><strong>Binanog</strong></a> Dance, Music, and Folkways of the Panay Bukidnon</i></b> by Ma.

Many of the new serious works came from established composers such as Lucio San Pedro, Ramon Santos, Francisco Feliciano, Lucrecia Kasilag, Angel Pe&ntilde;a, Chino Toledo, Jonas Baes, LaVerne dela Pe&ntilde;a, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3939\"><strong>Jeffrey Ching</strong></a></strong>. The UP College of Music continues to train young composers in the tradition of art music composition. A benchmark of this unparalleled distinction held by UP in the field of composition is that a number of their alumni have pursued advanced studies in composition in Europe and North America such as Ma. Christine Muyco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4074\"><strong>Joy Marfil</strong></a>, Robin Estrada, Nilo Alcala, Dominic Quejada, and Feliz Anne Macahis. For live performances, the main source of musical labor continues to be the musicians trained in the various music colleges and conservatories in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Instrumental and Vocal Compositions. </b>Orchestral music continues to be cultivated and listened to in the country. The repertory of genres termed &ldquo;symphonic&rdquo; manifests a diversity of idioms and styles, whose influences lie in a continuum between neoclassical treatments (i.e., symphony, concerto, symphonic poem, and so on) on one hand and progressive new music writing on the other. The latter employs unrestricted treatment to the orchestral performance medium by including unconventional instruments and incorporating the tone colors and rhythms of indigenous Philippine instrumental music. On the conservative side are Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>,<i> </i>1988, and <b><i>Violin <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> No. 2</i></b><i>, </i>1994; Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto for French Horn and Orchestra</i></b>,<i> </i>1987, and <b><i>Rizal: The Great Malayan Antagonist</i></b>,<i> </i>1988; Angel Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto No. 2 for Double Bass</i></b>, 1991; and <b><i>Philippine Festival Overture</i></b>, 1993; and Jeffrey Ching&rsquo;s <b><i>Symphony No. 4 &lsquo;Souvenir des Ming</i></b>,<b><i>&rsquo;</i></b><i> </i>2006, and <b><i>Symphony No. 5 &lsquo;Kunstkammer</i></b>,<b><i>&rsquo;</i></b> 2006. On the experimental side are Jose Maceda&rsquo;s <b><i>Music for a Chamber Orchestra</i></b>,<i> </i>1997; Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Du-A</i></b>,<i> </i>1986, for large orchestra, <b><i>Time Space</i></b>, 1990, for two orchestras, and <b><i>L&rsquo;BAD</i></b>, 1995, for a large orchestra. Somewhere in between the treatments are some orchestral work outputs by Chino Toledo such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/912\"><strong>Kantus: Tagabawa</strong></a></i></b>, 1999, and <b><i>Dignum et Iustum est </i></b>(Worthy and Just It Is)<i>, </i>2000, for chorus, piano, and orchestra. Another example is Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s <b><i>Misa</i></b><i> <b>2000 </b></i>(Mass 2000)<i>, </i>2000, for chorus and orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike Maceda and Santos whose works are produced and listened to almost exclusively in institutional-commissioned work settings, Toledo and Cayabyab write for paying audiences in the concert world. This space has naturally affected the characteristics of their compositions. Toledo, a teacher of academic composition and conductor of conventional orchestra, connects, for example, the rift between the new and the conventional in concert music. His vision of orchestral music is manifest in his Music Underkonstruction Orchestral Reading Project, which has been supported by the Institute for Orchestral Development in the Philippines since August 2005. This aims to encourage the creation and performance of new works by young Filipino art music composers for a music that is to be valued in the concert music world. Since its inaugural concert, many new compositions for orchestra by young composers have been premiered by the Metro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\"><strong>Manila Chamber Orchestra</strong></a> (MMCO). Toledo&rsquo;s ouvre contrasts with the experimental compositions of the Manila Sound Lab founded in 2008 and led by Jonas Baes, who has also worked almost exclusively in a music world inhabited by institutional or organized commissions. He has collaborated with foreign composers and has presented works of young composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the realm of chamber music, composers have continued fusing elements of Filipino indigenous and other Asian music influences with Western classical traditions. Similar to works for the large orchestra, works in this domain also exhibit a wide range of stylistic influences. In the repertory of the domain are some by Ramon Santos such as <b><i>S&rsquo;Geypo</i></b>, 1993, and <b><i>Dw&rsquo;gey</i></b><i>, </i>2006; Francisco Feliciano&rsquo;s <b><i>Siya-Kuno</i></b>, 1990, and <b><i>Kochi</i></b>, 2002; Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s <b><i>Fanfare and Rondo</i></b>, 1987, and <b><i>Munting Principe </i></b>(Little Prince), 1988; Jose Maceda&rsquo;s <b><i>Strata</i></b>, 1988, and <b><i>Distemperament</i></b>, 1992; Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Dasal </i></b>(Prayer), 1997, and <b><i>Hoy! </i></b>(Hey!),<i> </i>2004; Jeffrey Ching&rsquo;s <b><i>Kunstkabinett Part I</i></b>,<b> </b>2008, and <b><i>Raven Mantra</i></b>, 2013; Jonas Baes&rsquo;s <b><i>Daluy </i></b>(Flow), 2000, and <b><i>Patangis-Buwaya </i></b>(Cry of the Crocodile), 2003; and Christine Muyco&rsquo;s <b><i>PagbaBagtasBagtas </i></b>(Affixations), 2006, and <b><i>Agit-it </i></b>(Squeaking), 2009. In the 1998 centennial celebration of Philippine independence, the CCP commissioned five Filipino composers to create a special musical offering for the nation. The concert featured Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Nagnit Igak G&rsquo;nan Wagnwag Nila (Alingawngaw ng Kagitingan) </i></b>[Echoes of Courage], Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s <b><i>Centennial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te to Filipino Womanhood</i></b>, Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Sandaang Tagpi </i></b>(A Hundred Patchworks), Jeffrey Ching&rsquo;s <b><i>Symphony No. 3 &lsquo;Ritual&rsquo;</i></b>, and Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s <b><i>Alamat ng Lahi </i></b>(Legend of the Race).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the realm of orchestral music performance, the period has experienced an upsurge in new orchestras. Aside from the established <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a> and the historic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a>, the following orchestras were founded: Manila Chamber Orchestra, 1985; Manila Philharmonic Orchestra, 1998; UP String Chamber Orchestra, also known as UP Arco, 1998; UST Symphony Orchestra, reorganized in 1961; San Miguel Foundation Orchestra, founded in 2001 and disbanded in 2007; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a> Philharmonic Orchestra, originally the Cebu Youth Symphony Orchestra founded in 1995; Metro Manila Community Orchestra, 2000; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> Philharmonic Orchestra, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from orchestral and chamber works, there was a substantial increase in the number of compositions utilizing voice, either taken singularly or collectively, with accompaniment or a cappella. Examples in this category are Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Likas-An II </i></b>(Nature-ing II), 1994, and <b><i>Oggayam </i></b>(Kalinga welcome song), 2004; Francisco Feliciano&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\"><strong>Pamulinawen</strong></a> </i></b>(Stonehearted),<i> </i>1992, and <b><i>Enduken </i></b>(Muslim song), 2002; Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/988\"><strong>The Redeemer</strong></a></i></b><i>, </i>1990; Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Alitaptap </i></b>(Firefly),<i> </i>1995,<i> </i>and <b><i>Misa Sama-Sama </i></b>(Mass Together), 2012-14; Christine Muyco&rsquo;s <b><i>Wasak na Lupa </i></b>(Ruined Land),<i> </i>1993, and <b><i>Lupang Tinubuan </i></b>(Land of One&rsquo;s Roots), 1994; Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/196\"><strong>Te Deum</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1990, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\"><strong>Mi Ultimo Adios</strong></a> </i></b>(My Last Farewell),<i> </i>1996,<i> </i>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/951\"><strong>Misa 2000</strong></a></i></b>, 2000<i>;</i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3923\"><strong>Fidel Calalang</strong></a> Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Ama Namin </i></b>(Our Father),<i> </i>1999; Robin Estrada&rsquo;s <b><i>Awit ni Solomon</i></b> (Song of Solomon), 1999, and <b><i>Awit sa Panginoon</i></b> (The Lord&rsquo;s Song), 2001; Eudenice Palaruan&rsquo;s <b><i>Gapas </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a>),<i> </i>2005; Joy Nilo&rsquo;s <b><i>Umawit Kayo sa Panginoon </i></b>(Sing to the Lord), 2008; and Nilo Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Kaisa-isa Niyan </i></b>(The One and Only), 2006. Many of these works have been sung by Filipino choirs who competed in international choral festivals. The impressive tone colors and dynamic rhythms of the compositions that emphasize the uniqueness of Philippine indigenous music contribute to the high level of technical showmanship that makes Filipino choirs stand out in international competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Operas. </b>In the first few years after the 1986 Revolution, opera production was focused on the restaging of western operas but with Filipinized librettos. The CCP tasked Rolando Tinio to translate and adapt Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> in 1989, and Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> and Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>Rigoletto</i></b> in 1992. By the turn of the 21st century, other Western operas were staged in various theaters in Manila, in their original languages. Among them were Mozart&rsquo;s <b><i>Der Schauspieldirektor</i></b>, Cavallo&rsquo;s <b><i>Pagliacci</i></b>, and Tschaikovsky&rsquo;s <b><i>Eugene Onegin</i></b> in 2006; Pergolesi&rsquo;s <b><i>La Serva Padrona</i></b> and Purcell&rsquo;s <b><i>Dido and Aeneas</i></b> in 2007; Strauss&rsquo;s <b><i>Die Fledermaus</i></b>, Humperdinck&rsquo;s <b><i>Hansel and Gretel,</i></b> and Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> in 2008; Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and Puccini&rsquo;s <b><i>Madama Butterfly</i></b> in 2012; and Dvo?&aacute;k&rsquo;s <b><i>Rusalka</i></b> in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The staging of these operas was through the concerted efforts of the CCP, UP College of Music, UST Conservatory of Music, and the Philippine Opera Company under its founder Fides Cuyugan-Asensio. Their goal was to maintain an active opera environment in the country, as well as to create performance opportunities for classically trained Filipino singers, many of whom performed in the various opera productions of the Singapore Lyric Opera in Singapore. Also noteworthy is the collaboration with opera companies from Korea such as the Daejeon Opera Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New operas written by Filipino composers during this period include <b><i>Sikhay </i></b>(Zeal), 1994, composed by Francisco Feliciano, with libretto by Sedfrey Ordo&ntilde;ez and Beth Puyot, and directed by Anton Juan; and <b><i>Lorenzo Ruiz, Escribano </i></b>(Lorenzo Ruiz, Court Clerk), 1994, composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3954\"><strong>Jerry Dadap</strong></a>, with libretto by Ophelia Dimalanta, translated into Filipino by Florentino Hornedo. <b><i>Rizal: Mga Huling Araw </i></b>(Rizal: Final Days), 1995, was composed by Ed Parungao, with libretto by Frank Gomez, and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2923\"><strong>Tony Espejo</strong></a>. Jeffrey Ching composed <b><i>Rendezvous in Venice</i></b>, 1996, with Daniel Huang as his co-librettist. <b><i>Lapu-Lapu the Opera</i></b>, 1997, was composed by Jose Gentica V, with libretto by Henry Tejero. Another theatrical work by Jeffrey Ching was the dramatic cantata <b><i>Rizal</i></b>, 1997, with libretto by Leonor Orosa Goquinco. In 1997, <b><i>Mayo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1124\"><strong>Bisperas</strong></a> ng Liwanag</i> </b>(May, The Eve of Light),<b> </b>a re-adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\"><strong>Nick Joaquin</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/167\"><strong>May Day Eve</strong></a></i></b>,<b> </b>was<b> </b>composed by Reynaldo Paguio, with libretto by Fides Cuyugan-Asensio. Francisco Feliciano composed <b><i>Dangal ng Lahi </i></b>(Honor of the Race) in 2000 with libretto by Lilibeth Nacion Puyot. Inspired by Luna&rsquo;s masterpiece, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></i></b>, the opera of the same title, with music by Ryan Cayabyab and libretto by Fides Cuyugan Asensio, was produced at the CCP with Alex Cortez as director in 2003. That same year, <b><i>The Venerable Lord Takayama Okun</i></b> by<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4072\"><strong>Manuel Maramba</strong></a>, OSB with libretto by Edward Tuazon-Ishita was premiered. <b><i>Why Flowers Bloom in May</i></b> is probably Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s last major work for music theater which she finished in early 2007. The libretto was by Fides Cuyugan-Asensio. The latest additions to this considerable list of Filipino operas are Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>San Andres B.</i></b>, 2013, with libretto by Virgilio Almario, and Jeffrey Ching&rsquo;s chamber opera, <b><i>Before Brabant</i></b>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Ballet Music. </b>An important large-scale composition of the period was <b><i>Daragang Magayon: An Istorya ni Mayon </i></b>(Beautiful Maiden: The Story of Mayon). This was composed by Ramon Santos and premiered in 2013. It tells of the famed beauty, power, and sacrificial love of Daragang Magayon in a production that incorporates poetry, music, dance, and cinematography. It was directed and choreographed by Gerald Mercado, with poetry by Virgilio Almario, and dramaturgy by Abdon M. Balde Jr. For a full-length dance drama, the music of this work warrants interest because it utilizes the rondalla, piano, percussion, chorus, soloists, and narration. Earlier in 1991, Ramon Santos also composed the music for a different <b><i>Daragang Magayon</i></b>, with poetry by Merlinda Bobis. It was staged at the loading dock at the back of the CCP Main Theater with choreography by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2581\"><strong>Hazel Sabas</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"semi\" name=\"semi\"></a>Semiclassical Repertoire</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another family of music genres from the classical music tradition is the semiclassical piece. This is comprised of music written for <b>sarsuwela</b>, Anglo-American musicals, music for ballet and modern dance, brass bands, and rondallas. They have been performed in formal and informal venues including theaters, churches, school auditoriums, open-air amphitheaters, and even streets.

The revitalization also included the rewriting of dialogues, rearrangement of scenes to make the plot more logical, addition of more relatable songs or up-to-date dances, and fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP and the University of the Philippines initiated their own series of sarsuwela productions, leading to the comeback of this theatrical genre.

Among the earliest sarsuwela composed after 1986 is the Ilonggo <b><i>Matam-is Man Gali ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>may </i></b>(No Matter How Sweet the Sugar Is), 1991, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> P. Ardenio. The centennial celebration of Philippine independence in 1998 was an occasion to highlight cultural creations that exhibited nationalistic ideals. A sarsuwela contest was sponsored by the National Centennial Commission, and it resulted in the production of newly created sarsuwelas in the succeeding years after 1998. Among the winning sarsuwela were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></i></b> (The Palace of Valentin), libretto by Mario O&rsquo;Hara and music by Minda Azarcon and Vince de Jesus; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></i></b> (The Cries and Rebellion of Victoria Laktaw and Others), libretto by Bienvenido Lumbera and music by Lucien Letaba; <b><i>Paglayang Minamahal</i></b> (Beloved Freedom), libretto by George de Jesus III and music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\"><strong>Jesse Lucas</strong></a>; and <b><i>Bayan, Isang Paa na Lamang</i></b> (My Country, Just One Step More), libretto by Melba Padilla Magay and music by Lucio San Pedro.

It was directed by Armando Sta. Ana. Two years later, in 2007, a modern zarzuela in English, <b><i>Something to Crow About</i></b>, with libretto by Alejandro Roces, music and lyrics by Ferdie Dimadura, and orchestration by Agripino Diestro, was staged. With additional lyrics by Isagani Cruz, this was presented in New York and California, with direction by Cecile Guidote-Alvarez.

Many Filipino theater companies, composers, and actors benefited from the cultural economy of these productions. The success of Lea Salonga and the huge Filipino cast of the premiere production of Schoenberg and Boublil&rsquo;s <b><i>Miss Saigon</i></b> in London in 1988 demonstrated how the skills of Filipino singers are at par with other talents around the world. It opened many opportunities for casting in other musicals abroad and inspiring more Filipino singers to dream of a theatrical career. While the transnational movement of Filipino talents began in late 19th century, the late 1980s saw a marked acceleration in this movement due to musical globalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other side of this globalization has been the importation of British and American musicals into the country. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\"><strong>Repertory Philippines</strong></a> created and has sustained an audience for Anglo-American music theater in the country since its foundation in 1967.

The Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas, Inc. (PASAMBAP, Inc.), remains to be the leading confederation of brass bands in the country that ensures the continuing development of the bands&rsquo; general disposition and the musical quality of their performances. Several places still hold a strong band tradition where most brass instrumentalists come from. These include Rizal, Malabon, Pandacan, Cavite, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija. In Silang, Cavite, during the town fiesta every February, residents line up on the streets to listen to dozens of brass bands play and march, and the day culminates with the annual brass band competition. This has become the city&rsquo;s tourist attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The repertoire of the bands is mainly from the established literature of western composers such as Franz von Suppe, James Swearingen, Harold Waters, John Moss, Leroy Anderson, Alfred Reed, and John Philip Sousa. Only a few Filipino composers have written music for brass bands after 1986. This group includes Lucio San Pedro with his <b><i>The President March</i></b>, commissioned by Malaca&ntilde;an Palace for President Fidel V. Ramos in 1992, and <b><i>Centennial March</i></b>, commissioned by the National Centennial Commission in 1998; Antonino Buenaventura with his <b><i>Parangal ni Santa Cecilia </i></b>(Tribute to Saint Cecilia); and Chino Toledo with his <b><i>Tanikala </i></b>(Chain), 1990. The compositions of Lucio San Pedro have been among the staple repertoire of brass bands in Rizal, Pandacan, and Cavite, and these include<b><i> Victory on Parade March</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a></i></b> (Brown Race), <b><i>Festival March</i></b>, <b><i>Binatang Bukid March</i></b> (Young Man of the Farm March), <b><i>Jubilate March Heroic</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Maharlika March </i></b>(The Noble Man March).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Rondalla Music. </b>Rondalla music underwent a revival in the Fifth Philippine Republic. Noteworthy in this movement was the inclusion of rondalla as a regular category in the NAMCYA competition since 1996 and the holding of the International Rondalla Festival, which has not only helped elevate appreciation for this traditional musical ensemble but has also generated new works for the medium as well. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3977\"><strong>Celso Espejo</strong></a>, an advocate of rondalla music who founded the Pambansang Samahan ng Rondalla (PASARON) with Benjamin Lucas and Teodorico Cosejo in the 1980s, also organized rondalla festivals and competitions from 1986 to 1995. Unfortunately, the organization is now defunct, but Espejo continues to help educate the young about rondalla music and its historical and culture significance through workshops in the provinces, with the help of his son, Nelson Espejo, and daughter, Elaine Espejo-Cajucom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main repertoire for rondalla groups consists of arrangements of western symphonic compositions. In recent years, however, with the vigorous promotion done by Ramon Santos through the various festivals and competitions for rondalla, a contemporary rondalla repertoire has developed and has become standardized. Among the music used are Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Katubo</i></b>; Ma. Christine Muyco&rsquo;s <b><i>PagpiPiko </i></b>(Playing Hopscotch); Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Isahan sa Pagkakaisa </i></b>(One in Unity); Christi-Anne Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>Gabi ng mga Aswang </i></b>(Night of the Evil Spirits); Nelson Espejo&rsquo;s <b><i>Minsan sa Isang Taon</i></b> (Once A Year) and <b><i>Victory</i></b>; and Dominic Salustiano&rsquo;s<b><i> Bagong Pasadoble No. 6 </i></b>(New <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>Paso Doble</strong></a> No. 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is also during this period that the translocalization of rondalla music happened. Pockets of diasporic Filipino groups in Boston, Singapore, Japan, and Australia organized rondallas as a way of maintaining their connectedness with the homeland. Christi-Anne Castro&rsquo;s Iskwelahang Pilipino Rondalla Group based in Boston is the best known example. It has participated in the Cuerdas nin Kagabsan, the 1st International Rondalla Festival held in Naga City in 2004, together with the other group from Australia, the Rondanihan, and the Fil-Am Veterans Rondalla from San Jose, California. As a Philippine musical tradition transplanted abroad, the translocal rondalla is&mdash;for the Filipino communities living away from the homeland&mdash;a means of reterritorializing in the new environment using the old cultural symbolic form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This translocalization is similar to the time when the <b>kulintang</b> tradition was brought to the United States in the 1970s. The kulintang tradition primarily spread through the work of two cultural bearers&mdash;Danongan Kalanduyan from Maguindanao and Usupay Cadar from Maranao, who both left Mindanao to teach kulintang in American universities in the West Coast. By the 1990s, several kulintang ensembles were established in the United States, owing to the influence of these migrant musicians. Their Filipino-American audiences have obtained a sense of identity through this diasporic music. In 2000, Danongan Kalanduyan was honored by Hillary Clinton through the conferment of the National Heritage Fellow of the United States of America&rsquo;s National Endowment for the Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"popular\" name=\"popular\"></a>Popular Music </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular music or &ldquo;pop music,&rdquo; specifically the commercial or mass-mediated variety, is the predominant musical genre in the Philippines. Its reach is wide because it is the music that is produced and disseminated by the industry. Pop music comes in a variety of forms: ballads, novelty songs, folk songs, rock, jazz fusion, rap, and alternative music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period after 1986 witnessed the strengthening of the pop music scene with the unquestionable dominance and influence of western pop music, particularly from the United States. Rock, hip hop, and rap music became prevalent. The distribution was primarily through television, radio, and film. As the technological revolution of the last years of the 20th century reached Philippine shores, the dissemination of pop music accelerated and intensified through satellite-enabled interactive communications technology, even telepresenced, i.e., in real time. Many of these developments were beneficial to local music industry, but they also posed challenges in the artists and producers&rsquo; intellectual property rights as well as revenues. Government and private institutions have joined forces to address the concerns of Filipino songwriters and musicians regarding the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\"><strong>Ballad</strong></a>s. </b>The establishment of the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mangaawit (OPM) in the late 1980s helped uplift the pop music industry, for it encouraged the creation of new songs. Linked to the music productions were the various competitions for singing and songwriting, and the shows that gave equal opportunities to veteran songwriters, established singers, and new talents to succeed. Many of the songs that became popular during the period debuted in contests such as the Metropop Festival and later on, the PhilPop Music Festival. Some of these songs were &ldquo;Sometimes You Just Know&rdquo; by Danny Tan, Makko Pals, and Edith Gallardo, &ldquo;Shine&rdquo; by Trina Belamide, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You&rdquo; by Dodjie Simon, and &ldquo;Malayo Man, Malapit Din&rdquo; (So Far, Yet So Near) by Bayang Barrios. Competitions abroad also contributed to the popularity of Danny Tan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Easy to Love You,&rdquo; 1991, and &ldquo;You Lift Me Up,&rdquo; 1997; Vehnee Saturno&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love is All We Need,&rdquo; 1991, and &ldquo;Huwag nang Ipagpabukas Pa&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t Procrastinate), 1993; and Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tayo Na&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Go), &ldquo;Paraiso&rdquo; (Paradise), and &ldquo;Kahit Habang Buhay&rdquo; (Even Until Forever).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the composers of pop ballads, a few stand out because of their impressive output and their ability to create one hit song after another. Ryan Cayabyab has probably contributed the most to the list. His classic hits include &ldquo;Tuwing Umuulan at Kapiling Ka&rdquo; (When It&rsquo;s Raining and You&rsquo;re With Me), &ldquo;Minsan ang Minahal ay Ako&rdquo; (Once When I Was the One You Loved) from the musical <b><i>Katy!</i></b>, &ldquo;Better World,&rdquo; &ldquo;Can This Be Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iniibig Kita&rdquo; (I Love You). Another songwriter who consistently produced hits is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>, and his works include &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/870\"><strong>Beautiful Girl</strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/877\"><strong>Christmas in Our Hearts</strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell Me Your Name,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deep in My Heart.&rdquo; The versatile songwriter and performer Gary Valenciano has also many hit songs, several of which emphasized Christian values. Among his songs are: &ldquo;Take Me Out of the Dark,&rdquo; &ldquo;Natutulog ba ang Diyos?&rdquo; (Is God Asleep?), &ldquo;Shout for Joy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Could You Be Messiah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hataw Na&rdquo; (Dance On), &ldquo;Sa Yahweh&rdquo; (Dance for the Lord), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/857\"><strong>Babalik Ka Rin</strong></a>&rdquo; (You&rsquo;ll Return Someday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\"><strong>Novel</strong></a>ty Songs. </b>The novelty songs that were created in the past thirty years emphasized the humorous side of the Filipino, even containing irreverent lines and sexual innuendos. Among the famous novelty songs are &ldquo;Spaghetti&rdquo; by the Sex Bomb Girls, &ldquo;Babae Po Ako&rdquo; (I am a Woman, Please) by Tuesday Vargas, &ldquo;Sasakyan Kita&rdquo; (Will Lay on You) by Gladys and the Boxers with K, &ldquo;Bulaklak&rdquo; (Flower) by the Viva Hotbabes, &ldquo;Papa Cologne&rdquo; by Parokya ni Edgar, &ldquo;Giling giling&rdquo; (Gyrations) by Willie Revillame, &ldquo;Pare, Pa Kiss!&rdquo; (Kiss, Dude) by Guadings, and &ldquo;Otso otso&rdquo; (Move Like Number 8) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> Agbayani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some novelty songs, though, highlight the uniqueness of Philippine natural resources such as Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;Da Coconut Nut&rdquo; and the opening song for the 1994 Miss Universe Pageant held in Manila, &ldquo;Mabuhay!&rdquo; (Long Live), and Banda ni Kleggy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Only in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Folk. </b>Filipino musicians who wrote songs using the folk style continued to express patriotic sentiments using the simple combination of voice and an accompanying instrument, commonly the guitar. After 1986, songs that emphasize the Filipino value <i>pakikipagkapwa</i> (concern for others) came out. Heber Bartolome&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Mga Pinoy&rdquo; (We are Filipinos) highlighted the characteristics of Filipinos. His songs always had social themes and in the late 1980s, carried anti-US sentiments and a critique against militarization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Right after the revolution, Coritha recorded &ldquo;Oras Na&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Time) and revived &ldquo;Ang <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong>ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (My Country, the Philippines). In 1996, Inang Laya launched their album titled &ldquo;Alay sa Laya ng Bayan&rdquo; (Homage to the Country&rsquo;s Freedom) to celebrate the centennial of the Philippine revolution. It included songs like &ldquo;Sulong Gerilyo&rdquo; (Advance, Guerilla), &ldquo;Babaing Walang Kibo&rdquo; (Silent Woman), &ldquo;First Quarter Storm Medley,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tear Gas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boykot/Lakbayan Medley&rdquo; (Boycott/Touring Medley) and &ldquo;Japayuki&rdquo; (Filipina Entertainer in Japan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong> is perhaps the most popular among the folk singers and in 2007, together with his Watawat Band, Aguilar came up with &ldquo;Ipaglalaban Ko&rdquo; (I Will Fight), &ldquo;Estudyante Blues&rdquo; (Student Blues), &ldquo;Sa Kuko ng Aguila&rdquo; (In the Claws of the Eagle), and &ldquo;Kumusta Ka?&rdquo; (How Are You?). In 2013, he released a new single entitled &ldquo;Eleksiyon na Naman&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Election Time Again), a timely critique about the social practice of electoral vote buying. Other singers who mirrored the social realities of contemporary Filipino societies through their songs include Joey Ayala, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3922\"><strong>Noel Cabangon</strong></a>, Chin Chin Gutierrez, Gary Granada, Grace Nono, and Bayang Barrios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Rock. </b>During the late 1980s, rock music in the Philippines experienced an unprecedented growth with the emergence of innumerable bands. Many young and talented musicians tried their luck at performing in rock circuits in order to be signed by a recording label that could bankroll their first single or album. Many new rock bands tested the waters with a live audience that did not require perfect intonation but were looking for originality in the performers. It was these types of bands that developed a loyal following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a>, at one time the most prolific band in the Philippines, started in the 1980s and released its first album, <b><i>Enveloped Ideas</i></b>, in 1987. After the band&rsquo;s success, Pinoy rock of the 1990s and beyond witnessed the birth of others like Side A Band, Eraserheads, South Border, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a>, True Faith, After Image, Color It Red, Parokya ni Edgar, Tropical Depression, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>, Alamid, Sugarfree, Aegis, Bamboo, Wolfgang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4181\"><strong>Sponge Cola</strong></a>, Urbandub, Orange and Lemons, Mojofly, Hale, and Slapshock. It is interesting to note, though, that despite the upsurge in the number of bands in the country, the forerunner of Pinoy rock, Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith, who was in hiatus in the last decades of the 20th century, proved that he still had a huge following. He made a successful comeback at the beginning of the 21st century and even had a reality TV show titled <b><i>The Smiths</i></b> that included three of his daughters, Queenie, Sanya, and Beebop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important factor in Pinoy rock&rsquo;s proliferation was the support given by the radio station NU 107, which played music from both established and unknown bands, and held the annual NU Rock Awards from 1995 until 2010. Many popular rock bands were legitimized by the honors given out such as the song, video, album, and artist of the year awards. A few of the hits that had been given recognition are Alamid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Your Love,&rdquo; Eraserheads&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/905\"><strong>Ang Huling El Bimbo</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Last El Bimbo), Bamboo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1251\"><strong>Noy</strong></a>pi,&rdquo; Kamikazee&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/958\"><strong>Narda</strong></a>,&rdquo; Sandwich&rsquo;s &ldquo;Betamax,&rdquo; Ebe Dencel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Taking Second Chances,&rdquo; Aegis&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\"><strong>Halik</strong></a>&rdquo; (Kiss), and Bamboo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Halik ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>Hudas</strong></a>&rdquo; (Judas&rsquo;s Kiss).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many bands also join the annual Red Horse Beer Muziklaban Rock Challenge competition, which started in 1998 where hundreds of bands congregate to vie for the championship. The winning group is rewarded with instant fame, a contract with recording label, or gigs in prime venues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Jazz. </b>Pinoy jazz of the late 1980s was characterized by the light style more commonly known as pop jazz or smooth jazz. It emulated the music of American jazz artists David Benoit, Dave Grusin, David Arkenstone, Jim Chapelle, and Kenny G. The foremost advocates of smooth jazz in the Philippines during that time were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4031\"><strong>Eddie Katindig</strong></a> and his nephew Boy Katindig. In the 1990s, Lito Molina and the Jazz Friends brought back music popularized by legendary jazz artists like Glenn Miller, Count Bassie, Louie Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Tommy Dorsey Jr. This paved the way for a revival of mainstream jazz. Other Filipino jazz musicians searched for new directions that allowed them to create a distinct brand of jazz music that was not a mere copy of its American counterpart. The pioneer in this endeavor was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3883\"><strong>Bob Aves</strong></a> who incorporated musical ideas from the indigenous groups of the Cordilleras and Mindanao into the genre. Others followed suit, and this resulted in a vibrant jazz milieu up to the present. This was even evident in schools, as seen in the enduring presence of the UP Jazz Band and the emergence of new jazz groups like the UP Latin Jazz Ensemble. Landmark Pinoy jazz compositions of the period include Angel Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Balikbayan</i></b> and Johnny Alegre&rsquo;s <b><i>Stone of Intramuros</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Jazz Society of the Philippines was founded in 2003 by jazz enthusiasts, one of whom was the jazz chronicler <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\"><strong>Richie Quirino</strong></a>. The group aimed to promote jazz music appreciation through events like the annual Manila Jazz Festival, the Candid International Jazz Festival, the Full Moon Jazz Festival, and the CCP International Jazz Festival. These occasions provided opportunities for artists such as Bobby Enriquez, Angel Pe&ntilde;a, The Brass Munkeys, The Affinity, Saxoforo, Jewelmer Jazz Band, MAJAM, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4199\"><strong>Tots Tolentino</strong></a>, Popoy Valmonte, Jun Cadiz, Johnny Alegre, Emi Munji, Toti Fuentes, Mike Guevarra, Isha and Mishka Adams, Cookie Chua, Judith Banal, and Mon David to perform and be commercially successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pinoy Rap. </b>Rap music in the Philippines surged in the 1990s with singers like Andrew E. and Francis Magalona aka Francis M. Andrew E.&rsquo;s popularity grew with songs like &ldquo;Humanap ka Ng Pangit&rdquo; (Look for an Ugly One), &ldquo;Makati Girl,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Huwag Kang Gamol&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t Be An Ass). In the album <b><i>Rap is Francis M</i></b>, Magalona critiqued the ills of Philippine society such as colonial mentality, drug addiction, and corruption in the government. The messages of his songs like &ldquo;Mga Praning&rdquo; (The Paranoids), &ldquo;Halalan&rdquo; (Election), and &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Mga Pinoy&rdquo; (We are Filipinos) were easy to understand and resonated with his audience. Francis M. is best remembered for his signature rap &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/946\"><strong>Mga Kababayan Ko</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Countrymen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An unexpected album on rap music was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4915\"><strong>Willie Nepomuceno</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Snap Revolution</i></b> released in 1991. It contained a collection of clean, relevant, and responsive rap that neutralized the negative raps that were produced during the same period. The album parodied the events that took place during the four-day EDSA uprising. In recent years, more rap artists have emerged, and the list includes Denmark, the rap group Death Threat, Dice &amp; K9 aka Mobbstarr from Cebu, Thavawenyoz from Davao, Zambo Top Dogs from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, Pikaso, Audible, and Krook, and J.O.L.O. Presently, Gloc-9 is the most popular rap artist in the country. His songs are social commentaries, following the trail blazed by Francis M., and these include &ldquo;Sirena&rdquo; (Mermaid), &ldquo;Upuan&rdquo; (Chair), and &ldquo;Walang Natira&rdquo; (Everybody&rsquo;s Gone). He also carries the distinction of being the fastest rapper in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Alternative Music. </b>Any music that contrasts itself from the mainstream style is called &ldquo;alternative.&rdquo; Singer-songwriter Joey Ayala saw the word &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; as the merging of &ldquo;altered&rdquo; and &ldquo;native,&rdquo; which captures in a nutshell the hybridity of a native subject born to a modern culture. For him, it is the &ldquo;blending [of] the old and new, presenting artistic and cultural alternatives, encouraging a tribal attitude in modern man, an attitude of oneness with and respect for the world we live in&rdquo; (Caruncho 1988). Thus, alternative music could be viewed as a type of music that is marked with Filipino elements and gives the <i>bagong lumad</i> (new native) a voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino alternative music is global pop or the fusion of traditional ballad style with the modern rock style of the West. This hybridization speaks of the confluence of the tone color, modes, and rhythms of Mindanao music with Western pop. Aside from Joey Ayala, other Filipino musicians who have ventured into creating an alternative sound include Ryan Cayabyab, Grace Nono, Chin Chin Gutierrez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3850\"><strong>Edru Abraham</strong></a> and his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4033\"><strong>Kontra-Gapi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4129\"><strong>Pinikpikan</strong></a>, Makiling Ensemble, the short-lived Musika Asya, and Tugma. In 1989, Ryan Cayabyab embarked on his brand of Bagong Tunog Experiment in which he combined the native <i>singkil</i> beat and instruments like the kulintang with modern devices like synthesizers. It was primarily to provide a fresh sound to a commercial jingle to captivate the market based on a new corporate strategy of a softdrink company. Cayabyab composed four songs in this experimentation: &ldquo;Bagong Tunog&rdquo; (New Sound) interpreted by Miguel Vera; &ldquo;Bilib Sila sa Pinoy&rdquo; (They Admire the Filipinos) sung by Pablo Clemente; &ldquo;Angat sa Iba&rdquo; (Ahead of Others) performed by The CompanY; and &ldquo;Buhay Bulilit&rdquo; (Small Life) interpreted by Paskevill Bernardo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Grace Nono is also known in the local music scene as one of the movers of this ethnic-inspired global pop. Her songs promote respect for mother nature and an individual&rsquo;s innate freedom, as seen in her albums <b><i>Tao Music</i></b>, <b><i>Opo </i></b>(Yes),<b> <i>Isang Buhay </i></b>(One Life), <b><i>Hulagpos</i></b> (Breaking Free),<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Diwa </i></b>(Spirit)<i>.</i> Actress Chin Chin Gutierrez&rsquo;s involvement in the preservation of indigenous music has been documented in her album <b><i>Uyayi </i></b>(Lullaby), released in 2004. It is a collection of lullabies from various ethnolinguistic groups as originally recorded in the field, followed by an alternative arrangement for each, with Gutierrez singing and accompanied by various combinations of western and indigenous instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Edru Abraham and his Kontra-Gapi adhere to the Asian musical philosophy that performance is participatory, and each person present during a rendition contributes to the experience of creation as in a ritual process. Founded in 1989, the group has since performed for different kinds of audiences, and they have embarked on several European cultural encounters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pinikpikan&rsquo;s music is also classified as global pop or world music. It fuses the distinct sound colors of indigenous instruments from the Philippines and from other parts of the world, with the electronic sounds of modern electric guitar and percussions. Their album <b><i>Atas</i></b> (Duty) received a Katha award in 2000. In 2008, Pinikpikan changed its name to Kalayo. Following the tradition of Pinikpikan and Grace Nono, the Makiling ensemble also propagates a Filipino version of global pop. This ensemble is comprised of alumni of the Philippine High School for the Arts led by Diwa de Leon. The most current addition to this list of alternative music groups is the UP-based Tugma, a group comprised of Asian music and musicology majors who specialize in the performance of traditional Asian, African, and Latin American instrumental and vocal music, coupled with dance. Unlike global pop proponents, though, this group adheres to cultural authenticity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine music since 1986 has been invigorated by the twin processes of localization and globalization. Advances in media and technology and affordability of travel further enabled these developments. But these developments would not have been possible without the intervention of government agencies and the political will of the artists themselves. The atmosphere of liberality resulting from the change in government in 1986 encouraged cultural productions that shifted focus from a direction dominated by elite tastes into one that celebrated the vibrant and multifaceted Filipino culture that combines popular, folk, indigenous, and Western-inspired classical traditions, giving opportunities to a wider selection of artists from all over the Philippines. The muchneeded governmental support for the arts which was realized through the major state policies implemented by agencies such as the CCP and NCCA resulted to more artistic creations and scholarly researches on the arts, placing emphasis on works that express the Filipino spirit. The radical shift in the thrusts of CCP initiated the dawning and eventual proliferation of indigenous cultural performances that stirred dynamic exchanges between artists from the regions and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The growth of the popular music industry in the Fifth Republic may also be attributed to the supportive government regulations that promoted the circulation of Philippine music in radio, television, film, print media, and other modes of mass technological distribution. The current generation of Filipinos continues to take advantage of new technologies through storing recorded music into their electronic devices and bringing these into the privacy of their homes. The transformation of the traditional mode of distribution formerly enjoyed by the recording industry into a cheaper mode of acquisition through the Internet has caused the Philippine recording industry&rsquo;s economic plunge. New regulations are being implemented to cater to this new form of recorded music distribution; the effects of these merit future studies. Nevertheless, these new technologies offer Filipino musicians&rsquo; enormous possibilities in terms of creative works and innovative performance practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The improved process of music creation in this period explains the increase in collaborative works, particularly theater and dance productions. The huge output of modern operas, musicals, ballets, sarsuwelas, and other collaborative productions attests to the vibrant spirit of cooperation amongst artists, mostly influenced by global trends that became easily accessible beginning in the late 1980s. Visiting international theater groups with their modern technological production techniques, as well as the exposure of Filipino artists abroad have helped transform the general attitude and disposition of local artists and musicians, specifically in sustaining the standards of their productions to be at par with international measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This globalization has ensured the high valuation of indigenous music and dances emphasizing their significant role in establishing a modern Filipino identity. The uniqueness of Philippine traditional music from the different ethnolinguistic groups determines the special position of Filipinos in the global arena, and this has been capitalized by the government through cultural tourism. Many international music festivals have been organized in the past 30 years which highlighted the special musical traditions of the various Filipino cultural groups, attracting local and international enthusiasts to appreciate, study and reproduce these performances elsewhere. On the other side of the exchange process, many Filipino musicians have presented distinct Philippine repertoire to international audiences in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music in the Fifth Philippine Republic illustrates the various Filipino groups of artists and musicians&rsquo; aspiration to establish a contemporary cultural identity that represent the modern Filipino. In their myriad ways, Filipino musicians continue to create new works, perform established musical traditions, and publish new researches that express their current stance, influenced by the complexities of the twin processes of localization and globalization.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Section:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><a href=\"#indigenous\">Indigenous Music</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"#rural\">Rural Hispanicized/Christian Music</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"#urban\">Urban Transnational Music</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The variety of Philippine music and musical practices represents a cultural pluralism molded by history, environment, and outside cultural influences. Although Philippine music is generally categorized as Western (i.e., acculturated) and non-Western (i.e., aboriginal or indigenous), it may be specifically defined according to social context, history, geography, performance styles, repertoire, and instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine music may therefore be classified as Cordillera highland, central west highland, Mindanao highland, Aeta, Islamic, rural Christian, and urbanized. The sources and influences on these groups will be discussed under Indigenous Music, Rural Hispanicized/Christian Music, and Urban Transnational Music. The last is further subdivided into art music and popular music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>Indigenous Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While little record exists, if at all, of specific sources and origins of ethnic, pre-Christian Philippine music, sufficient evidence points to its close kinship to the music of Asia-Pacific. Given the history of trade and migrations, influences from China, India, and the Middle East shaped Southeast Asian, including Philippine music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine gong-chimes not only indicate Southeast Asian influence but also hint at Chinese roots. The Cordillera flat gongs called <b>gangsa</b>, <b>gangha</b>, <b>kalsa</b> or <b>pinsak</b> are also found in the southwestern provinces of China where they are known as <b>tuluo</b>, <b>gaobianluo</b>, and <b>shiziluo</b>. The bossed gongs are called <b>mang</b>.<b> </b>The <b>bianmang</b>, a set of 17 hanging gongs of graduated sizes similar to the Manobo hanging <b>kulintang</b>, is found in southern China, together with the <b>mangqing</b><i> </i>or 14 small bossed gongs laid in three parallel rows in the same manner as the single-row kulintang of Muslim communities. Other Philippine instruments with Chinese counterparts include the nose flute, mouth harp, Isneg bamboo or the parallel-stringed tube zither, the polychordal zither, Kalinga <b>tongatong</b><i> </i>or stamping tubes, Tagakaolo <b>udol</b><i> </i>or plank drum, Kalinga <b>balingbing</b><i> </i>or bamboo buzzer, and the Kalinga <b>patang-ug</b><i> </i>or quill-shapedtubes. Philippine instruments similar to other Southeast Asian instruments include the two-stringed boat-shaped lute of Palawan and Mindanao called <b>kudyapi</b>, <b>kuglong</b>, which looks like the Bornean lute <b>sapeh</b> (<b>sape</b> or <b>sambe</b>) or its distant cousin, the Thai zither <b>kachapi chakay</b>, and the bamboo xylophone <b>gabbang</b>, <b>gambang</b>, which looks like the Javanese <b>gambang kayu</b><i> </i>and Thai <b>ranad</b>. The bossed gongs of Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan called kulintang, <b>babandir</b>, <b>agung</b>, <b>gandingan</b>, belong to the family of bossed gongs of Borneo, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although Indian influence on Philippine culture is believed to have been acquired through other cultures, it had a significant impact on local religious beliefs, language, and literature, including the system of writing and, to some extent, music. Evidence of the last is cursory, but points at some interesting musical connections. Terminological derivations include kudyapi from kachapi<b> </b>(Thai zither), gangsa from the Sanskrit <b>kansya </b>(gong or plate of bell metal), <b>huni</b><i> </i>(tune, echo) from <b>dhvani</b>. Other hints are the miniature bells on costumes of the Mindanao highland peoples; details of the <b><i>Ramayana </i></b>in some Mindanao epics; and the soloistic improvisational, organically developed melodic structures of the instrumental music of the highland and Islamic communities of Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Elements of Middle Eastern music are especially evident in Muslim modes of vocal rendition, which are characterized by highly ornamented melodic configurations and high vocal register. The manner of realizing the basic melodic structures allude to the Persian <b>dastgah</b><i> </i>or Arabic <b>maqam</b><i> </i>traditions. Instrumental accompaniment to songs is also semi-improvised. Among the Tausug, the <b>biyula</b><i> </i>is played in the Middle Eastern way, with the tail of the instrument propped against the chest and the scroll pointed downward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other aspects of pre-Christian music include the use of the pentatonic and hexatonic modes, vocal techniques of sliding tones, glottal stops, and high vocal register, integration of music and dance, community participation, unmetered time, and nonfixed tuning instruments. All these are related to the music of Pacific islanders, who are part of the greater Malayo-Polynesian culture area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"rural\" name=\"rural\"></a>Rural Hispanicized/Christian Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk music among rural Christian Filipinos shows varying degrees of syncretic blending of European and Southeast Asian elements. In general, the entire repertoire basically falls under either of two musical categories: imported Western genres adopted into local practice or what can be termed indigenized Spanish music (e.g., music in the Christian liturgy, sung narratives, dance music genres like fandango and danza), and indigenous practices modified to accommodate Western cultural elements or what can be called Hispanicized indigenous music, as seen in rituals, song debate. Both of these are hybrid-acculturated music. Often, it is difficult to state which is more Hispanic and which is more indigenous Filipino. The syncretism is a product of prolonged music intercultural contact and exchange between Spain via Mexico and the inhabitants of the Philippine archipelago. The majority of Filipino folk songs that are in Western harmonic tonality are clear examples of the first category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Western influences in Philippine music include themes and ideas derived from Western Christian literature such as prayers, biblical stories, religious legends, and tales of princes and princesses; the elements of Western theater; and the use of Western instruments and structural elements such as melodies and chords. Asiatic influences include the functional role of music in social and religious occasions such as rituals and celebrations; musical structures based on modal melodies as seen in the <b>tagulaylay</b> and <b>awit</b>, rhythmic flexibility, and a combination of drone and melody; the styles of performance (i.e., improvisation, usage of indigenous vocal techniques, and integration of music and dance, with the audience playing an active role); and the oral transmission of musical practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Specific forms showing syncretic fusion of Eastern and Western elements include religious dramas and events like the <i>sinakulo</i>,<i> </i><i>santacruzan, pangangaluluwa</i>,<i> </i>and <i>panunuluyan</i>; metricalromances called the <b>awit</b><i> </i>and <i>korido</i>; musical-dance forms like the <b>pandanggo</b><i> </i>and <b>balitaw</b>; folk theater forms such as the <i>komedya </i>or<i> moro-moro </i>and<i> linambay</i>; the rituals of the <b>pabasa</b>, <b>sanghiyang</b>, and<i> </i><b>subli</b>;<i> </i>various song genres such as the <b>composo</b> and <b>huluna</b> (lullaby); folk instrumental ensembles such as the <b>rondalla</b>, <b>musikongbumbong</b>, <b>banda boca</b><i> </i>(voiced imitation of band instruments), <b>pangkatkawayan</b>, and a host of other smaller ensembles with improvised groupings of instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"urban\" name=\"urban\"></a>Urban Transnational Music</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine music in urban communities is directly inherited from European influences that passed through Spain in the second half of 19th century, then through Anglo-American music traditions via Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia when the English language gained supremacy in the 20th century. Today, it is better to call urban Filipino music as transnational because the usual unidirectional influencing between the &ldquo;First World&rdquo; of affluent Northern countries and the &ldquo;Third World&rdquo; of the South no longer holds true. Today, urban Filipino music even comes from Singapore and Australia which are famous for productions of Broadway musicals that have travelled to the Philippines in recent years. There are two distinct types of urban transnational music: art music and popular music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Art Music. </b>The classical and art music tradition in the Philippines can be traced to the 16th century missionaries, some of whom had specialized in music training in Spain before they were allowed to travel to the islands via Mexico. With Spanish musician-priests in San Agustin church in mid-18th century Intramuros and composers like Antonio Calahorra and Remigio Calahorra teaching at the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples de la Santa Iglesia Catedral in the second half of the 19th century, the idea of a music conservatory emerged. In the late 19th century, visiting Spanish zarzuela and Italian opera companies kept Filipinos abreast of the musical scene in Europe and the United States. In the meantime, local musicians performed Western art music not only in urban areas but also in provinces where brass bands entertained the folk. In the 20th century, Filipino musicians and composers further honed their skills by studying in Europe and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the beginning of the Spanish colonial regime, the clergy taught Filipinos to sing the plainsong or <b>canto llano</b> to the accompaniment of the organ; to dance and sing; and to play the flute, harp, guitar, and other instruments. In these activities, Filipinos showed great adaptability, especially in Manila, where there were many fine choirs of chanters and musicians who were quite skilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Churches all over the Philippines developed musicians, choral directors, and composers whose works were patterned after liturgical musical style prevalent in the Hispanic world. By the late 19th century, church music compositions were further influenced by the classical operatic style with florid solo parts and dramatic choral sections. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most celebrated church music composers and performers of the 19th century was MarceloAdonay of Pakil, Laguna, whose unparalleled skills earned him the title &ldquo;Palestrina of the Philippines.&rdquo; During this period, secular music composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4177\"><strong>Simplicio Solis</strong></a>, JulioNakpil, JulianFelipe, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> consisted of hymns, waltzes (the <b>tanda de valses</b> being the most popular subtype), gavottes, and patriotic songs based on native airs or folk songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 19th-century Spanish zarzuela<b> </b>was introduced in the country with the staging of F. Barbieri&rsquo;s <b><i>Jugar con Fuego</i></b><i> </i>(Playing with Fire) in 1879. Soon, the form was adapted all over the country. Local writers and dramatists wrote sarsuwela in Tagalog, Pampango, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Bicol, Cebuano, Ilongo, and Waray. The music generally followed the simple song form of the Spanish zarzuela, and the dances were light, usually using the waltz and the pasodoble. Composers also used native airs such as the kundiman, danza, and balitaw, asserting a Filipino identity and expressing subtle nationalistic sentiments, especially in the politically inspired plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advent of the opera in the last half of 19th century also significantly influenced local music and showcased the vocal prowess of local talents. The florid aria &ldquo;AngMaya&ldquo; (The Sparrow) by JoseEstella for<b><i> Filipinas para los Filipinos</i></b> (The Philippines for the Filipinos) required the vocal technique of an opera singer. The first Filipino opera, <b><i>SangdugongPanaguinip</i></b> (<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>) by LadislaoBonus, produced in 1902, contains some difficult vocal passages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tic singing also influenced the native kundiman. The kundiman in early 19th century was a dance-song in simple binary form with parallel major-minor tonality. Its bipartite section was similar to most Filipino folk songs. In the latter part of 19th century, though, the kundiman became simply a song with a poetic text focusing on subtle and metaphorical expressions of love. By the early 20th century, in the hands of NicanorS.Abelardo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>, and FranciscoSantiago, the kundiman became dramatic and in some cases had three sections, which could be attributed to the influence of the romantic operas being performed then by visiting French and Italian companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The establishment of formal music academies and conservatories at the turn of the 20th century brought in fresh repertoires of instrumental music, notably the piano literature of the romantic composers Frederick Chopin, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelsohn, and Franz Liszt. The first Filipino composer to have used folk materials in his music was Diego C. Perez who wrote <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas y sus Cantares</i></b> (Memories of Philippines and Their Songs) in 1886. He was followed by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong>, who used native forms like the <b>dalit</b> and Jose Estella who wrote the first multi-movement symphony titled <b><i>Filipinas</i></b> in 1928, based on folk materials. Bravura became the primary ingredient in the works of the later leading composers such as FranciscoBuencamino, Juan de Sahagun Hernandez, FranciscoSantiago, Rodolfo Cornejo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3952\"><strong>Bernardino Custodio</strong></a>. Some of their nocturnes, waltzes, and concertos were based on Filipino folk melodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early music of Abelardo shows great mastery of the harmonic-chromatic language of the romantic period, challenging the performer beyond the level of technical proficiency. In later years, Abelardo wrote in the expressionist style of post-Wagnerian composers such as Richard Strauss and Arnold Schoenberg and used ambiguous tonal language and disjunct melodic structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporaries of Abelardo and Santiago were influenced by the romantic style, with traces of the impressionist and neoclassic techniques in their works. They used Philippine folk music materials in their tone painting, as well as descriptive and programmatic writing. They preferred tone poems and overtures since they were shorter than symphonies, had greater mass appeal, and could be scored for the more accessible brass band. One composer who wrote complex and stunning symphonic variations in the 1920s was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a>, director of UP Conservatory from 1925 to 1930. Lippay was a student of Franz Schreker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antonio J. Molina&rsquo;s works can be traced to the European zarzuela and opera, the religiousmusic of the Romantic period, and the impressionist and some post-expressionist music. The works of HilarionF.Rubio, who was also an opera and band conductor, display dramatic contrast and programmatic tone painting, influenced as he was by the program overtures of Beethoven and Mendelssohn. His later works for chamber ensemble such as <b><i>Ang Manok at ang Bayawak</i></b><i> </i>(The Rooster and the Iguana) and <b><i>The Strutting Peacock</i></b><i> </i>are also descriptive, and uses the harmonic idiom of the French neoclassicists. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>&rsquo;s works, as exemplified by the well-known <b><i>BytheHillside</i></b>,<i> </i>combine the transparent, coloristic texture of the impressionist school and the orchestral sonority of the late romantic period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the next generation of composers, it was LucioD.SanPedro who was greatly influenced by the instrumental works of Tchaikovsky and Wagner which focused on the organic and variational development of thematic ideas. On the other hand, the dramatic and programmatic character of Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s compositions echoes the operas of Puccini. Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s later works use some 20th-century techniques in descriptive fashion, as in <b><i>Sayaw ng</i></b> <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a></i></b> (Igorot Dance) for piano and <b><i>Tatlong</i></b> <b><i>Tunog Larawan </i></b>(Three Sound Portraits) for orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alfredo S. Buenaventura&rsquo;s descriptive eclectic style, ranging from romantic to neoclassic, stemmed from his association of specific idioms to specific emotions and other extramusical ideas. Jerry A. Dadap shared this concept of music creation, adopting a wider variety of writing styles, from the traditional kundiman vocal style of Abelardo and Santiago to the neoclassic structures, and even avant-garde devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a> and LucreciaR.Kasilag belong to the neoclassic school. Both were trained in the United States in the tradition of Paul Hindemith of the Eastman School of Music. Pajaro&rsquo;s Western abstract works&mdash;symphony, sonata, concerto, oratorio, song cycle, and fugue&mdash;contain bitonally harmonized Filipino themes. While utilizing traditional melodies and chords, Kasilag also departs from the traditional Western neoclassic language not only by combining different tonalities from the same well-tempered chromatic scale, but by fusing scales, modes, and instrumental timbres from both Western and non-Western music. She has also written works using avant-garde elements such as improvisation, electronics, and physical movement. Later neoclassic composers were RosendoSantos, Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4072\"><strong>Manuel Maramba</strong></a>, OSB, and AngelM.Pe&ntilde;a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>&rsquo;s works are directly inspired by his contact with music making among indigenous Philippine and other Asian music traditions, and his study of their structural elements (i.e., drone and melody) and their social and philosophical significance. The community-oriented rituals engendered his ideas of musical performance involving large groups of people, rather than standard ensembles or solo playing. His compositional technique consists of forming mass structures and clouds of sounds, as well as fusing and diffusing different classes of timbres. The technique is directly influenced by the French <b>musique concrete</b> movement and its principal pioneers and exponents Edgar Varese, Pierre Schaeffer, Olivier Messiaen, and Iannis Xenakis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Avant-garde literature of the 1950s and 1960s was introduced through the concerts organized by Maceda, as well as through international conferences and meetings, starting with the UNESCO-sponsored Musics of Asia in 1966. Avant-garde music had an impact on a younger generation of Filipino composers, especially on RamonP.Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>M.deLeon, and FranciscoF.Feliciano. After studying abroad, they developed their individual styles which bore influences from the different New Music idioms prevailing in Europe and the United States. The early music of Santos used the serial technique and later the open-ended forms inspired by the aleatoric music of John Cage. De Leon was also influenced by Cage, although his works draw their significance from extramusical ideas&mdash;usually inspired by metaphysical concepts&mdash;rather than compositional techniques. Thus, De Leon freely used various idioms, even those based on conventional harmony or neoclassic language, in his later works. On the other hand, Feliciano&rsquo;s mature works, developed while he studied with the European masters Isang Yun and Krystof Penderecki, reflected the structural clarity and organic principles of the German tradition. In spite of the new techniques of writing they acquired from abroad, Santos, De Leon, and Feliciano drew their basic musical ideas from Philippine traditional music and culture. Some elements are structural, as may be seen in Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Abot-Tanaw </i></b>(Horizons), De Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Okir</i></b>,<b> </b>Feliciano&rsquo;s<i> <b>Siya-Kuno </b></i>(They Say It&rsquo;s Him); others are literary as in Santos&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ni Pulau </i></b>(Song of Pulau) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1017\"><strong>Tin-ig</strong></a></i></b> (Voices),<b><i> </i></b>De Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Sugatang</i> <i>Perlas </i></b>(Wounded Pearl), Feliciano&rsquo;s <b><i>LaLobaNegra</i> </b>(The Black She-wolf); and others are philosophical as in Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Likas-An </i></b>(Nature-ing) and De Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Bahay Bata</i> </b>(Womb).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music of the following generation of composers&mdash;ChinoToledo, Conrado del Rosario, Verne de la Pe&ntilde;a, Ruben R. Federizon, Arlene Chongson, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>&mdash;was also influenced by modern Western idioms. Toledo&rsquo;s sensitivity to color and texture shows the strong influence of French and electronic music. Although different in temperament, the music of De la Pe&ntilde;a and Federizon are based on traditional Philippine rhythms, modes, and timbres. Del Rosario&rsquo;s style, on the other hand, may be identified with the German New Music idiom, with more sensitivity to color and texture. The later works of American-trained Chongson combine neoclassic forms with non Western-music structures. Baes was influenced by Maceda&rsquo;s large-scale works as well as his traditional music. Thus, he uses simple melodic materials and sounds in building different sound textures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning 1990s, a new batch of composers emerged. Among them are Christine Muyco, Jed Balsamo, Jocelyn Marfil, Feliz Macahis, and Robin Estrada. Indigenous music concepts continue to be an inspiration in their &ldquo;new music&rdquo; that is for the academy. However, these composers have also crossed borders by composing many multimedia works in the realm of popular culture such as music, theater, dance, and film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Popular Music. </b>Philippine popularmusic is principally characterized by its wide circulation as a consequence of its mediation in print and via audio mechanical reproduction. It may be traced to the folk music of the villages, which accompanied dances for public entertainment such as fiestas and secular celebrations. The dances such as minuet, fandango, polka, mazurka, and habanera were mostly European in origin. On the other hand, the folksongs of ordinary people about everyday life include ballads, work songs, lullabies, drinking songs, and humorous songs. Folk, which is normally passed on orally in small-scale face-to-face societies, becomes popular when it is written down and then printed or broadcast in mass media. The process is reversed, i.e., the popular becomes folk, when people from the rural areas learn a foreign song from the radio and then absorb it into their existing oral genres and repertories. The case of <b>salidummay</b> is a good example of this process. Many melodies in this genre were first heard in Christian evangelical church and public school unison songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American regime brought in new institutions of social entertainment and mass culture, namely, the dance halls called cabaret (pronounced <i>kabaret</i>),<i> </i>the <i>bodabil </i>or variety show, the radio, and the cinema. It was also during this time that dance bands and dance orchestras, which served as the standard media of popularmusic, were introduced. Their repertoire consisted of prevailing American popularmusic&mdash;jazz and its dance varieties like the fox-trot, one-step, and swing; Latin American-influenced dances such as the tango, rhumba, cha-cha, and samba; the boogie-woogie and the rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll of the 1940s and the 1950s; the love songs mostly culled from musicals and the radio; and since the late 1980s, American hip-hop music. Filipinos were quick to fuse the near-dance rhythms with folk material, as seen in &ldquo;BahayKubo&ldquo; (Nipa Hut) and &ldquo;SarungBanggi&ldquo; (One Night), substituting Filipino lyrics for the English or composing new songs in the same pattern. It is interesting to note that at the turn of the century, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1000\"><strong>Sarung Banggi</strong></a>&rdquo; was a popular song with a known composer. Today, few remember the composer because it has already entered the folk repertory similar to what happened to the Igorot salidummay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, an instrumental ensemble called <b>cumbanchero</b><i> </i>proliferated as an offshoot of the popularity of the band leader Xavier Cugat, dubbed the &ldquo;Rhumba King&rdquo; in the 1950s. The ensemble consisted of imported and improvised instruments: harmonica, maracas, bongos, conga drum, guitar, guiro, jaw bone, and a one-string bass with remodeled World War II military vehicle gas containers serving as the resonator. This craze was followed by another ensemble called <b>combos</b> by the time rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll was marketed via vinyl records and cassette tapes in the country starting in the 1960s. Combos are particularly identified with electric guitars and bass and the trap drum set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The influence of American popularmusic culture was so strong in the 1960s that radio and TV programs such as the top-rated <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a> </i></b>launched searches for Filipino counterparts of American music idols such as Perry Como, Elvis Presley, Johnny Mathis, and Neil Sedaka. In reaction, the search for a Filipino identity in popularmusic came to a head in the same decade as local composers and songwriters began to produce original works in the vernacular which expressed local themes and ideas. The Filipinization of popularmusic that time counts among its exponents rock and roller Bobby Gonzales, folk singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>, Freddie<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, and HeberBartolome, novelty singer YoyoyVillame, rock artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a> and Joey Smith, and rapper Francis Magalona. These musicians were superseded by groups like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Gloc-9</strong></a> in the 1990s. However, the musical idioms, whether ballad, folk, rock, or rap, remained faithful to their American models such as Elvis Presley, Joan Baez, Peter, Paul and Mary, Fats Domino, Frank Zappa, Vanilla Ice, and M.C. Hammer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, popmusic artists such as JoeyAyala at ang Bagong Lumad, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3850\"><strong>Edru Abraham</strong></a>&rsquo;s Kontra Gapi, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a>, Pen Pen, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4129\"><strong>Pinikpikan</strong></a> began to use materials from non-Western cultures. They called their music neo-ethnic, but actually they were not unique for their idioms were also influenced by the larger global pop called world music or world beat in which musicians from developing countries were appropriated by producers from developed countries such as Peter Gabriel and the Grateful Dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine pop ballads have their roots in the early American cinema and musical stage shows. Early Philippine cinema drew principally on <b>sarsuwela</b> such as <b><i>WalangSugat</i></b><i> </i>(No Wounds) and <b><i>DalagangBukid</i> </b>(Country Maiden), as well as from bodabil. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>Sarsuwela</strong></a> arias in simple harmonic and melodic modes, early popular dance rhythms, and an emerging kundiman-style of writing were the ingredients of the Filipino love songs, most of which were born at the movies. The most popular love songs were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;DahilSaIyo&ldquo; (Because of You), a danza composed for the film<b> <i>BituingMarikit</i></b><i> </i>(Beautiful Star) and Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Halina&rsquo;t Magsaya&rdquo; (Come and Celebrate), a balitaw for the movie <b><i>Lambingan</i></b><i> </i>(Tender Affection). The love ballads of later composers such as ErnaniCuenco, RestieUmali, and GeorgeCanseco trace their aesthetic origins to this musical lineage. On the other hand, middle-of-the-road English and Filipino love songs by WillyCruz, JoseMariChan, and Alice Doria Gamilla echo those of Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, and other early Broadway composers. Contemporary American ballads, modern jazz, and the rock-theater music of the 1960s and 1970s such as those from <b><i>Hair</i></b><i> </i>and<b><i> Jesus Christ Superstar</i></b><i> </i>are the basic sources of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>&rsquo;s works, including his experiments with indigenous music and the everyday jargon of the young masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The plethora of sources and influences, and the relation of Philippine music to other types of music are only two aspects of Philippine music. Through the centuries, Filipino artists have reshaped outside influences to fulfill their aesthetic needs, making the music truly their own.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P.
