Within the confines of the home, the Ibaloy mother sings a <b>tami</b> to lull her child to sleep just as the Ata mother sings an <b>a-di-ya-di</b> for the same purpose. For relaxation, Tagakaolo maidens play the <b>sluray</b> (bamboo zither) while seated on the floor of the house, while the Bontoc youth plays his <b>kalleleng </b>(nose flute) to serenade a loved one at her doorstep or merely to pass the time away in his abode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On more solemn occasions, the home is the venue for a curing ritual such as the <i>gasumbi</i> of the Kalinga where the <i>mandadawak</i> (priest or priestess) dances and chants around the sick person to drive away the evil spirit. Preparations for the ritual, which include the butchering of a pig and the making of a <b>tongatong</b> (bamboo stamping tubes), take place in the yard beside the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An elaborate ceremony among the Subanon called <i>pegayep</i> is performed in the home of the <i>balyan</i> (shaman) to invoke the good spirits. Numerous paraphernalia consisting of a <i>binalay</i> (altar), a <i>bahangsu</i> (a seven-step ladder) containing food offerings, a miniature boat which the seven <i>diwata</i> (spirit deities) are supposed to ride to and from the ritual, a large <i>gadyong</i> (swing) hanging from the rafters on which the balyan dances, a low platform for the musicians who play on the <b>gagung pon</b> and <b>gandingan</b> (bossed gongs), and <b>strike porcelain bowls </b>are prepared. The balyan alternately chants and dances, and shakes dried rattan leaves on whose handle a pair of <b>dumala</b> (bells) is attached. The small hall is dimly lit by kerosene lamps which are extinguished when the balyan goes into a trance. The audience then, consisting of the village folk, sits on the floor, against the walls of the hut, and requests for cure or medicine from the spirits through the balyan. Questions are also answered. During the three-hour ceremony, incense is burned intermittently from a bowl containing <i>dagtu</i> (extracts from a tree), <i>daga</i> (chicken blood), <i>pulinan</i> (charcoal), <i>balasi</i> (shells), <i>sulu</i> (an orange-colored stone), and <i>dlemuga</i> (tree bark).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong></a>s performed among other groups of people take place in open fields, beside a holy tree, or even by the riverbank. In the fields, music accompanies planting and harvesting activities. The Bontoc sing the <b>ayoweng</b> while working in the field, and the Kalinga sing the <b>sungiyaw</b> to help reapers forget the heat of the sun. The Yakan of Basilan prepare the holes for seeds with a <i>tabbak</i> (pointed bamboo stick) whose other end is connected to a <i>daluppal</i> (split bamboo pole). When the pole strikes the ground, it creates varying rhythmic and melodic structures. Once the seeds are planted, the<b> kwintangan kayu</b>,<b> </b>which is<b> </b>made up of graduated wooden beams, is hung from a tree facing the field. It is played continuously as a means of giving life and strength to the palay seeds. Only after the seedlings have sprouted is the kwintangan kayu silenced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Palawan, the village meeting house is used as the venue for the <i>tambilaw</i>, a harvest thanksgiving. Great quantities of food are cooked. The community and relatives from neighboring villages gather together for the sharing of food, merrymaking, and wine drinking, accompanied by the music of <b>basal</b><i> </i>(gongs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music is also part of ceremonies performed for the dead. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> play the <b>bangibang (</b>percussion yoke bar) during a <i>himong</i> ritual, a rite for deaths due to foul play. Many men participate as they dance in a long line, striking the bangibang and producing a rhythmic continuum of alternating light and heavy sounds. This is done in an open space. During wakes, the Alangan sing the <b>ambuwaday</b>.<b> </b>The Bontoc extol the dead person with a <b>fulayao</b>, which relates the life and good deeds of the departed. The <b>didiyaw </b>is a special song sung for a dead child. It is both an expression grief and a prayer for a good life after death. The Kalinga sing the <b>dassar</b> before the burial of a murdered person asking for vengeance. Among the Mandaya, the family of the departed requests for the wake song called <b>diaga</b>.<b> </b>On a death anniversary, the Subanon sing the <b>bahay-bahay</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\"><strong>Epic</strong></a> singing takes place during festivals or funerals or at events where more than the usual number of people are around. Some accounts speak of epic singing during voyages at sea where the cadence of the singing coincides with the motions of the rowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>Hispanic Tradition</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the Spaniards, new venues for music making were added, notably the church, the church courtyard, the town plaza, the streets, and the big halls or the sala of the large homes of <i>ilustrados </i>(educated). Later on, music performances took place in public theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The church was the scene of liturgicalmusic sung and played during the mass and other church services. The friars took pains in teaching <b>canto llano</b> (Gregorian chant) and <b>canto d&rsquo;organo</b> (polyphony). They also taught the playing of instruments&mdash;organ, violin, flute. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> chronicles speak of organ playing during the mass and the proficiency of church singing comparable to that in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Eventually, nonliturgical songs were performed on the various feasts of the church calendar. Many of these are still done today. In May, songs are sung during the <i>flores de Mayo</i> as young girls offer flowers to the Virgin Mary in church. In southern Luzon, the &ldquo;Alay kay Maria&rdquo; (Hymn to Mary) begins with a procession of young men and women around town which ends in the church. Inside the church, hymns are sung in between prayers by the youths who offer flowers to the image of the Virgin Mary. Also in May are the processions along the town streets like the <i>santacruzan</i>, which celebrates the finding of the Holy Cross by Queen Helena, and the <i>kristiyanong turog</i>, <i>pamukaw</i>, and <i>aurora</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Christmas season, carolers walk through the streets and stop to serenade households with Spanish <b>villancicos </b>and vernacular songs. These carols are called <b>pastores </b>in Bicol, <b>daigon</b> in the Visayas, or <b>galikon </b>in Pangasinan. The reenactment through song of the search for a lodging by Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem called <b>panunuluyan</b>, <b>pananapatan</b>, <b>pananawagan</b>, <b>kagharong</b>, or <b>solomon</b> takes place in the streets on Christmas eve. The singers playing the Virgin and Saint Joseph stop at designated houses, seeking shelter, but are rejected a few times. Eventually, the holy couple ends their search at the church, where the nativity scene is revealed on or near the altar at the &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Lenten season calls for the singing of the <b>pasyon</b>,<b> </b>the versified story of Jesus Christ and his death on the cross. Done as part of a <i>panata</i> (vow), the pasyon may be sung on Ash Wednesday, on the Sundays of Lent, and on Holy Week, in homes, makeshift sheds built along streets, or barrio chapels. During Holy Week, processions feature the <i>carro</i> (floats) bearing images of saints and scenes from Christ&rsquo;s passion, followed by brass bands playing slow <b>marchas</b> (marches). During Lent and especially on Holy Week, the passion play called <i>sinakulo</i> or <i>tanggal</i> is staged in town plazas or church patios in the Tagalog, Pampango, Bicol, and Ilonggo regions. In the play, actors&rsquo; lines are <i>cantada</i> (sung) or <i>ablado</i> (spoken), and characters march to lively <b>pasodoble</b> or <b>punebre</b> played by the band. Easter is celebrated with the <i>salubong</i>, the reenactment of the meeting of Christ and his mother on the first Easter Sunday, which is performed in the church courtyard, with a young child dressed as an angel lifting the veil of the grieving Mary, and singing &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; to the accompaniment of the brass band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In November, the eve of All Saints&rsquo; Day and All Souls&rsquo; Day is the occasion for singing the <b>pangangaluluwa </b>songs from house to house. The revelers pretend to be souls of old unmarried men and women in purgatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Feasts of patron saints are preceded by nine-day church novenas that feature songs called <b>gozos</b>.<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong>Procession</strong></a>s feature the town band as well as those from neighboring towns. Celebrations are a mixture of the religious and the profane. Besides the masses and processions, there are dining and dancing with the <i>hermanas mayores</i> (sponsors) splurging on the affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To celebrate town fiestas or family affairs or the visits of important dignitaries, the <i>sala</i> or living room of ilustrados become the scene for elegant balls where music and dancing last until the wee hours of the morning. Writers speak of the presence of pianos or harps in homes. Young ladies were taught to play these instruments, and it was customary for homeowners to ask their daughter to perform for visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Travelogues written in the 19th century attest to the excellence of the military bands that played regularly at gathering places all over the islands. In smaller towns, performances took place in the town plaza. In Manila, the most famous venues for an evening of band music were the Plaza Mayor, the <i>calzada </i>(street), and later, Luneta&mdash;all in or around Intramuros. Performances at the Luneta took place nightly from six to eight. This major form of entertainment continues until today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the town plazas of the past, music was also heard in the <i>komedya </i>performances during fiestas. Travel writers made much mention of the calzada near the Manila Bay, that part of Luneta where military bands performed two evenings in a week. Formerly known as Bagumbayan, Luneta is known today as Rizal Park where the national hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> was executed. The Rizal Park Amphitheater has been the setting for the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> held every Sunday since 1978. This program received the Hall of Fame Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\"><strong>Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA)</strong></a> in 1990 as the longest running performing arts series.

It garnered the CMMA for Best Cultural Program in 1983. This project was under the Intramuros Administration which to date also presents concerts at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>, including a cultural show held on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

Other open-air venues include the Dulaang Raha Sulayman in Fort Santiago, Paco Park, and the Hinulugang Taktak Park in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In modern times, churches in different parts of the country have become alternate venues for performances and special celebrations. The San Agustin Church in Intramuros, the country&rsquo;s oldest church and a UNESCO World Heritage site, mounted the San Agustin Music Festival from 1999 to 2009. The St Joseph Parish Church in Las Pi&ntilde;as City has hosted the International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Organ Festival every February since 1976. This followed the inaugural concert on 5 May 1975 celebrating the return of the bamboo organ to the Las Pi&ntilde;as Church from the Johannes Klais Orgelbau factory in Bonn, Germany, where it went through two years of restoration work. The festival is organized by the Bamboo Organ Foundation Inc., through the combined efforts of parishioners, sponsors, and patrons, including the Diplomatic Corps. The Las Pi&ntilde;as Boys Choir, the organist Armando Salarza, and many local and international musical artists and groups have performed for the festival. Outside Manila, other churches have hosted musical events. In 2016, Kabataang Gitarista performed in front of the main altar of the church of Pila, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><i>Tertulias</i> (soirees) used to take place in the homes of the gentry, the ilustrados, and Spanish government officials in the 1800s. Today, music performances are also often held in private homes to celebrate important milestones, as well as in residences of the Diplomatic Corps who introduce international visiting artists. In the late 19th century, Malaca&ntilde;an Palace and the Casino Espa&ntilde;ol were also venues for occasional chamber music concerts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of the bourgeoisie in the middle of the 19th century gave rise to the cultural practice of attending musical events in public. The music concert, which initially was done hand in hand with, but which later supplanted, the literary-musical event called <b>veladas</b>, began to have regular performances only in the last quarter of 19th century and in the early 20th century. From the mid-19th century, the public primarily patronized musical theater, such as the opera and later on the <i>sarsuwela</i> and stage plays with incidental music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As Western influence became more pronounced, the outdoor makeshift performance venues gradually gave way to a more formal setting. Public theaters were built, with the audience paying entrance fees. Performers now appeared onstage with the audience as spectators. The komedya, sarsuwela,<b> </b>opera, and concerts were presented in these theaters. Writing in 1909, Wenceslao Retana cited the existence of 13 theaters in Manila: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Comico, established in 1790; Teatro Arroceros and Teatro de Tondo, both established in the early 1800s; Teatro Binondo, also known as the Teatro Castellano, the first formal Spanish theater in Manila, which opened in 1846; and Teatro Lirico de Tondo, Teatro del Principe Alfonso, Teatro Circo de Bilibid, Teatro de Variedades, Coliseo Artistico, TeatroFilipino, Teatro Lirico de Quiapo, Teatro Calderon, and TeatroZorrilla, all built after 1850. Other theaters built were Pandacan&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> Theater, Teatro Infantil de Dalumbayan, Teatro Infantil Tagala, Teatro Infantil Malate&ntilde;a, Teatro Tagalo de Aranque, Teatro Tagalo de Tanduay, Teatro Tagalo de Infantil de Barrio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>, and Teatro Infantil de Oroquieta. These theaters had the patronage of the bourgeoisie and ordinary citizens of Manila. During the American colonial period, theaters in the Visayas included the Teatro Oriente in Cebu, Teatro La Carlota in Iloilo, Teatro Talisay north of Bacolod, Teatro Kahirup in Silay, Negros Occidental, and the Bohol Opera House. In Pampanga, Teatro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/654\"><strong>Sabina</strong></a> showcased the drama and sarsuwela of prominent Pampango playwrights like Crissot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While these theaters were built primarily for stage plays, some were used for musical presentations, particularly the Spanish zarzuela. In 1862, a visiting French operetta company performed in TeatrodelPrincipeAlfonso, which likewise showcased a symphonic concert in 1871 under the baton of Ignacio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es. Circo Teatro de Bilibid featured the Assi-Panades Italian Opera <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in 1874. Concerts by visiting artists Remenyi, 1886, and Freidenthal, 1892, as well as local artists Jose Silos, 1900, and JoseEstella, 1901, were held at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3296\"><strong>Teatro Filipino</strong></a> on Echague Street. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di</i> <i>Lammermoor</i></b><i> </i>was staged at Teatro Lirico de Quiapo by the M. Maugard French Opera Company. However, it was at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3303\"><strong>Teatro Zorrilla</strong></a>, established in 1893, where many memorable concerts and sarsuwela were held, including the first Filipino opera, <b><i>SangdugongPanaguinip</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), 1902, by composer LadislaoBonus and librettist PedroPaterno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>American and Contemporary Traditions</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The biggest show house constructed after the Philippine revolution was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand Opera House</strong></a>, described as the &ldquo;National Theater&rdquo; in 1902. It was the site of many important musical events&mdash;Rizal Day programs, grand concerts of foreign and Filipino artists, sarsuwela, and operatic presentations, notably the Philippine premier of Giuseppe Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>Aida</i></b><i> </i>in 1933. Eventually, these shows gave way to the vaudeville and musicals which replaced the sarsuwela and concerts in popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a>, inaugurated in 1931, presented the best foreign and local artists performing in operas, zarzuela, orchestral, choral and solo concerts, musicals, dance, and theater productions. Its opening was a welcome event, as the Manila Grand Opera House, inaugurated in 1902, and the Teatro Circo de Zorrilla, inaugurated in 1893, were both deteriorating. The Metropolitan Theater was severely damaged during World War II and was restored three decades after, opening with an inaugural concert held on 17 Dec 1978. Its two halls were the main Conchita Sunico Hall and the more intimate side hall, Dalubdulaan. The theater closed down in 1996 due to a dispute between the City of Manila and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) regarding the ownership of the building. Its last concert on 18 Jun 2011 featured the local rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\"><strong>Wolfgang</strong></a> in celebration of the 440th year of the City of Manila. In 2015, the National Commission on Culture and the Arts won the bid to restore the theater, though the building still remains unrestored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other concert halls and auditoriums in Metro Manila are attached to the institutions where music degrees are offered.

It was designed by the late National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin and inaugurated in 1969. CCP has three theaters: the Tanghalang Nicanor S. Abelardo, formerly known as the Main Theater; Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\"><strong>Aurelio V.

Occasionally, CCP&rsquo;s ASEAN Park and the front lawn are used for performances of brass bands, choirs, and instrumental ensembles. During its annual Pasinaya Open House Festival, a one-day multi-arts Festival initiated in 2005 and held usually in February, the Center also opens the Bulwagang Amado Hernandez, its conference room; Bulwagang Francisca Reyes Aquino, its rehearsal hall; the Main Theater ramp and lobby; the <i>eskinita</i> (alley) in between the CCP and the Production Design Center; and Pedro Bukaneg Street, fronting the Little Theater entrance.

Soon, more performances of different music genres will take place with the construction of more state-of-the-art theaters and auditoriums in the country. These halls serve as the venue for formal concerts featuring serious as well as popularmusic, which are usually held in the evenings and last for about two to three hours. Audiences in these venues usually pay for tickets to watch musicians perform on a proscenium stage. Performances may be held by professional or nonprofessional musicians all-year round or on special occasions.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

In 1977, the Popular MusicFoundation was organized to promote contemporary compositions and develop Filipino amateur and professional composers and songwriters. In 1982, the Foundation initiated the first music industry awards known as the Cecil Awards.

In 1961, RA 3042 allotted 400,000 pesos annually to MPFP and to cultural groups studying and disseminating Filipino folk arts, music, and dances abroad. The MPFP helped leading composers to produce new works in various forms, including chamber works, operas, <i>sarsuwela</i>, concertos, and symphonic and band works. From 1959 to 1972, the MPFP commissioned a total of 19 compositions. It also gave out 76 student scholarship grants from 1957 to 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The LeagueofFilipinoComposers (LFC), also founded in 1955, presented new works at annual festivals with help from MPFP subsidies.

NCCA, through its Grants Program, has funded many projects which highlight the contributions of culture to national growth and development. It aids in identifying programs and projects that focus on the positive impacts of culture and arts to the life of men and women, most especially the vulnerable and marginalized sectors in the various regions of the country. Since its inception, NCCA has provided venues for the different regions to articulate their local culture and development concerns. Among its recipients are the Pasinaya Performing Arts Market at the CCP; the <b><i>International Las Pi&ntilde;as Bamboo Organ Festiva</i></b>l; the <b><i>Pasasalamat Festival</i></b> of Pagadian; <b><i>Konsiyerto ng Pangalay</i></b>, Tula, <b><i>Salinawit at Musika</i></b>; Teduray Dance and Gong Playing; School of Living Traditions on Maguindanao Kulintang-Playing of Barangay Lower Campo Islam, Labangan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> del Sur; <b><i>Taal Tunugan: Philippine Musical and Vocal Forms in Vernacular</i></b>; and <b><i>Kuwerdas ng Pagkakaisa</i></b> (Strings of Unity)<b> <i>Rondalla Festival</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Contests. </b>The European classical art music idiom, traditionally, has relied heavily on the institution of music competitions to provide a forum for recognizing the most outstanding instrumentalists, vocalists, composers, orchestras, and small ensembles, thereby contributing significantly to the establishment of these artists&rsquo; careers. Classical instrumental ensembles such as brass bands, school bands and choirs, and church and community choirs have also long relied on competitions and festivals to promote their groups and showcase high levels of artistry. In recent decades, various competitions have also arisen in the field of popular music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, formal music contests in the field of art music were first sponsored by private artistic and musical societies and by religious groups. These groups celebrated the feast of St Cecilia, Patroness of Music, with concerts and contests. The Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario held one such contest in 1879, where noted cellist-pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3993\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong></a> won second prize. During the American period, new schools and societies continued the institution of music competitions. With the establishment of the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1908 came the competition for composing its hymn which Nicanor S. Abelardo, then a student at the UP Conservatory of Music, won in 1917. Escuelas Confederadas de Musica was a private school in Quiapo composed of three departments: the Schola Cantorum under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3931\"><strong>Victorino Carrion</strong></a>, the Escuela de Piano under Vicenta Marifosqui, and the Escuela de Violin under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>. These departments held their respective contests, with the Schola Cantorum even sponsoring in 1933 an essay-writing contest on music open to its graduates and students. Private individuals also sponsored music contests. The distinguished composer of sacred music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a>, sponsored a competition for the best wedding march on the occasion of his golden wedding anniversary in 1924. Abelardo won the 100,000-peso grand prize, and his work was played during the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese interregnum, 1941-45, saw a proliferation of music contests custom-made by the Japanese government to promote their own agenda. There was much music-making but the aim was to move away from the supposedly excessive, materialistic, and degenerating influence of American culture. Music contests were thus held with the goal of re-orienting or re-aligning Filipino culture towards becoming a worthy member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Some of these contests were the Pilipino Farmers Song Contest, the March and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> Contest, the Philippine Band Contest, and the Music Concourse, Literary and Song-Writing Competition of the <b><i>Manila Shimbunsha</i></b>, the umbrella newspaper company during this period. Among the prize-winning compositions were &ldquo;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines), which temporarily replaced the National Anthem, music by Felipe Padilla de Leon, lyrics by first prize winner Catalino Dionisio; &ldquo;Awit ng Mga Magsasaka&rdquo; (Song of the Farmers), music by F. P. de Leon, lyrics by Simplicio Talens; and &ldquo;President Laurel March,&rdquo; music by Lucio San Pedro, lyrics by Jacinto de Leon. Other composers who won various awards for their compositions were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\"><strong>Leon Ignacio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4153\"><strong>Hilarion Rubio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4156\"><strong>Lucino Sacramento</strong></a>, and Nemesio Regalado. To encourage excellence in band music, awards were given under the auspices of the Philippine Band Association in 1943. The Muling Pagsikat Band under Rafael Batugal won the top prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Postwar Philippines saw a new phase in the life of the nation&rsquo;s music contests as artists grappled with nation building in their music. Foremost among the music competitions was the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA), established in 1973, which sparked nationwide contests that nurtured the country&rsquo;s young talents in various categories&mdash;piano, voice, choral music, solo, family ensemble, traditional music, and commissioned contest pieces. Created by Proclamation No 1173, NAMCYA designated a National Music Week in November, with the CCP and the Department of Education as its prime collaborating arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2009, the CCP staged the 1st Philippine International Choral Competition, which took place from 18 to 22 Aug. The festival was part of its 40th anniversary celebration, and it brought choirs from different parts of the Philippines to compete in four categories: Children&rsquo;s Choir, Mixed Choir, Sacred Music, and Folk Music. Not long after, the Andrea O. Veneracion International Choral Festival 2013 was launched to celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of the Philippine Madrigal Singers, the choir that Veneracion, a National Artist, nurtured to become the world-class ensemble that it is today. It was held from 7-10 Aug, a month after the passing of Veneracion. A total of five foreign choirs from Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, and 14 Filipino choirs competed in three categories. The second edition of this international choral competition was held from 22-25 Jul 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many other choral competitions have been held, and among those which have lasted through the years include Voices in Harmony, a competition for high school choirs organized by the Children&rsquo;s Museum and Library, Inc. (CMLI) which began in 1999; the annual Musikahan sa Tagum, sponsored by the city government of Tagum and the City of Tagum Tourism Office since 1999, which includes competitions for choirs, band, singing, and rondalla; the MBC Choral Competition, organized by the Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> since 2007; Musica FEUROPA, the only European Union-sponsored choral competition in the Philippines, hosted by the Far Eastern University since 2009; and the annual Government Choral Competition, a Civil Service Commission-sponsored competition for choirs of government agencies which held its first edition in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another festival held regularly at the CCP is the International Guitar Festival and Competition. It began in 2010, organized by Guitar Friends, a group of Filipino guitar aficionados, and the CCP. In its 2011 competition, Filipino guitarist Ramoncito Carpio won the first prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the CCP-initiated festivals, there is the Kundiman Fiesta sponsored by Hotel Nikko Manila Garden in Makati which began in 1991. The goal of the festival was to revive the singing of the Filipino <b>kundiman</b> and propagate this singing tradition among the youth. The first five years were financed by the hotel management and produced the following top kundiman singers: Francisco Batomalaque, 1991; Alexis Sumicat, 1992; Nolito Gregorio, 1993; Joel Saavedra, 1994; and Cherry Batalla, 1995. When the ownership of Hotel Nikko changed in 1996, the annual Kundiman Fiesta faced an uncertain fate. The NCCA eventually took over, and the 1996 edition was held on 4 Dec at the Folk Arts Theater, with Marya Deeda Barreto as the winner. The Makati Coliseum and Cultural Affairs Office started another kundiman singing competition in 1995 to celebrate &ldquo;Buwan ng Wika&rdquo; (Language Month) in Makati City. The competition was aptly called &ldquo;Kampeon ng Kundiman&rdquo; and was later on renamed &ldquo;Kundiman sa Makati.&rdquo; It has been held annually ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A contest of semiclassical tradition was the Yamaha Electone Festival (YEF) held from 1972 to the late 1990s, which showcased the capability of the electronic organ to replicate the sound of an entire orchestra, traditional instrumental ensemble, or popular bands. Aside from original compositions for the Electone, the festival required the participants to display their arrangements and improvisational skills during the competition. The festival&rsquo;s national champion represented the country in the Southeast Asian regional competition, and those who won in the regional contest advanced to the International Electone Concours, which was always held in Japan. Many YEF winners have become prominent contributors to the country&rsquo;s music industry such as Francisco &ldquo;Toti&rdquo; Fuentes, Maritess Salientes, Carolyn Kleiner-Cheng, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4105\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4106\"><strong>Louie Ocampo</strong></a></strong></a>, Rowena Arietta, Maria Corazon &ldquo;Maricor&rdquo; Perez, Norman Agatep, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\"><strong>Jesse Lucas</strong></a>, Marvin Queirdo, Pipo Cifra, Rica Arambulo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3870\"><strong>Noel Arce</strong></a>, Charisse Baldoria, Khavn dela Cruz, Arwin Tan, Dennis Sugarol, and Jude Roldan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contests in the field of popular music have been led by the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (Metropop) established in 1978 under the auspices of the Popular Music Foundation and led by Imee Marcos and Teodoro Valencia. The most prestigious pop music contest of its time, it came at a period when national pride in music was ardently felt, thus inspiring the growth of Original Pilipino Music (OPM).

Composition more specifically signifies the creative activity and the created work or opus in the context of art music in the European tradition, with reference to the notated score and its realization and interpretation by performers. Arnold Schoenberg, a leading Austrian composer of the 20th century, cites the different stages involved in the process of composing: the basic idea or <i>grundgestalt</i>, which comes from an extramusical source such as an emotion, a story, an image; the translation of the grundgestalt into a basic musical material or <i>grundreihe</i>, involving the appropriate scale and mode; the creation of the motif or theme; and the development of the theme into a musical form. In general, this limited concept of composition precludes the idea of improvisation and implies the total authority and absolute control of the composer through the written score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A wider view of composition, however, considers the almost unlimited variety of ways of composing, not only in the modern tradition dominant in 20th-century Western art music but also in the countless musical traditions outside the Western hemisphere. In orally transmitted cultures where the term &ldquo;music&rdquo; or the idea of composer as author and writer does not exist, the compositional process may be manifested in the following ways: the innovation on the musical elements of an actual performance; the extemporized creation of the text on a preexisting tune; the invention of additional episodes or development of plots in epics and other narrative forms; the musical utterances and physical movements in ritualistic trance; the learning, as among the Blackfoot Indians, of a new song through dream; and the transcription and stylization of traditional melodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In some Asian classical traditions, such as the <b>raga</b> and <b>tala </b>of the Hindustani and Carnatic music of India, and the Persian <b>radif </b>and the Arabic <b>maqam</b>, composition occurs as improvisation of existing modal melodies and rhythmic patterns during the performance of the music. In Javanese classical music, basic melodies or themes called <b>balungan </b>are composed according to the six modes of the two-scale systems of <b>pelog </b>and <b>slendro</b>,<b> </b>and using any of the 19 compositional formats or <b>ghending</b>.<b> </b>These melodies are then realized in the semi-improvised playing technique of the gamelan<b> </b>or gong-chime orchestra. In Thai music, melodies are composed, incorporating both traditional themes as well as structural elements from foreign music (e.g., Khmer, Lao, Chinese). These are then realized by means of variant techniques by standard performing ensembles such as <b>piphad</b>, <b>mohori</b>, and <b>khruang sai</b>. In modern China, composition also means the transcription and scoring of collected tunes from tribal music repertoires for various types of instrumental ensembles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The traditional differs greatly from the modern concept of composition. In the traditional, the element of improvisation and extemporization is a major part of the creative process; there is little distinction between composer and performer; innovations and inventions are based on preexisting materials and rules of style; moreover, the spirit world may also be directly involved in the compositional act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In unwritten vocal genres, composition is the creation of the text on preexisting melodic formulae which, together with the stylistic elements in their musical rendition usually determine the genres, as in the <b>oggayam</b><i> </i>or the welcome song of the Kalinga. Other genres are specific to social activities such as the Tagalog <b>huluna </b>(lullaby) and the Bontoc <b>sowe-ey </b>(agricultural song). There are also musical forms that are related to important events such as weddings, peace pacts, and rituals. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\"><strong>Epic</strong></a>s and ballads are rendered only by elders who are regarded to have greater artistic character and philosophical depth than ordinary members of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A piece may sometimes be &ldquo;titled&rdquo; or identified either by its composer or by its thematic content, as in the case of the Ibaloy <b>ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>a poetic musical form sung on various occasions, from small gatherings to big celebrations. E.L. Pungayan classifies ba-diw into five categories: <b>batbat</b> or <b>pinchitan ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for big feasts; <b>kapi</b><i> </i><b>ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for thanksgiving rites and good fortune; <b>pinatjan ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for death wakes; <b>ngilin ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for weddings; and <b>adadkos ba-diw</b><i> </i>for entertainment and storytelling. The ba-diw is sung in leader-chorus style. The <i>man-badiw</i><b> </b>(elderly male), is the leader-composer-poet, and the <i>asbayat </i>(a chorus of women) echoes each line that is half-recited by the man-badiw. A ba-diw composer must be skilled not only in reciting extempore seven-syllable-line poetry on a specific theme but also in developing his own imagery, metaphorical language, and different ways of incorporating Ibaloy values related to the spirit world, material wealth, cultural identity, creativity, and sense of humor. These skills are acquired by listening to and memorizing individual phrases or entire pieces as sung by experts. Selected ba-diw are remembered either through the authors, such as &ldquo;Ba-diw ni Dasolas&rdquo; (Ba-diw of Dasolas) and &ldquo;Ba-diw ni Bab&rsquo;an Berong&rdquo; (Ba-diw of Bab&rsquo;an Berong), with cross-reference to the occasions when they were heard; or through specific categories, as in &ldquo;Ba-diw ni Abiteg&rdquo; (The Poor Man&rsquo;s Bad-iw), with cross-reference, too, to the authors and/or occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process of creating other vocal forms, such as the Maranao <b>bayok</b>,<b> </b>involves not only composing a text extemporaneously but also putting together various vocal style formulae such as <b>ringkaran </b>or vocal ornaments, to support the text. The bayok is a hyperbolic panegyric composition. A good <b>pabubayok </b>(bayok singer) must be able to manipulate the different formulae skillfully, and to sing about any topic employing proverbs, adages, puns, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vocal genres from other cultural groups in the Philippines also possess extemporized text on melodic and stylistic formulae. The genres include the Palawan <b>kulilal</b>, the Subanon <b>sinaleg </b>and <b>palagi</b>, the Ilocano <b>dal-lot</b>, the Tagalog <b>pandangguhan</b>, the Cebuano <b>balitaw</b>, the Tiruray <b>siyasid </b>and <b>seringan</b>, the Aeta <b>awa-idi</b>, and the Bicol <b>composo</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the indigenous instrumental repertoires, the integration of artistic creation and performance is also the fundamental process of music composition, consisting mainly of improvising preexisting structural elements (melodic and rhythmic modes) and musical forms. Since many of the instrumental forms are as open-ended as the occasions and social events that they enhance or the specific activities of which they are an integral part, the limits of the creative act can be indefinite in duration and substance. The improvisation may take the form of ornamentation, repetition, variations, and permutations of the thematic, rhythmic, and tonal (timbre) elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical forms suggest the possible manners of improvisation. The Yakan <b>kuriri</b>,<b> </b>for example, is a continuous series of three- to four-note motifs representing different shades of emotions and feelings. Changes and permutations are made in the rhythmic patterns and note sequences without deviating from a basic pulse, especially in solo instrumental music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Maguindanao <b>kulintangan </b>music, the formal element may be based on a series of phrases as well as rhythmic formulae, like the <b>duyug</b>, <b>sinulug</b>, <b>tidtu</b>, <b>binalig</b>, and/or on existing songs like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>yug&rdquo; and &ldquo;Layas sa Ulan.&rdquo; The phrases are repeated and modified any number of times at the discretion of the kulintang<b> </b>player who cues the other members of the ensemble especially in the opening and closing sequences. In other ensemble music such as the Kalinga <b>gangsa palook</b><i> </i>and Tiruray <b>agung</b>,<b> </b>only one or two members improvise, while the others play constant patterns which provide the drone element. In pre-Christian ensemble music, one gong is usually the drone such as the <b>babandir</b><i> </i>in the Maguindanao and Maranao kulintangan, the <b>patawaganan</b><i> </i>in the <b>tagunggo</b><i> </i>of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>gan, and the <b>bandilan</b><i> </i>of the Manobo hanging kulintang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pre-Western concepts of composition were gradually replaced by changes in the melodies themselves to accommodate novel elements from Western music such as harmony, counterpoint, chordal accompaniment, and dance rhythms. These musical changes are evident in the various vocal music of rural Christian cultures such as the Tagalog <b>awit</b>, <b>kumintang</b>, and <b>pandanggo</b>,<b> </b>and the Visayan <b>composo</b> and <b>balitaw</b>. The next stage of folk song evolution is represented by the actual composition of new melodies for individual texts as seen in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> de 1800&rdquo; (Kundiman of 1800) or the highly stylized reconstruction of traditional musical forms according to Western harmonic idioms. Many of Philippine Westernized folk songs are in either major or minor modes and cast in three-beat patterns as influenced by the <b>valse</b>,<b> </b>pandanggo, and jota<b> </b>rhythms, or in the two-beat patterns of the danza<b> </b>or the habanera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The variable-text concept of composition appears to be the norm not only in folk songs and folk epics but also in literary-musical genres such as the metrical romances called awit<b> </b>and <b>korido</b>,<b> </b>and the <i>komedya</i><b> </b>in which the composed music for standard parts (dances and battle scenes) can be interchanged between different works. It is quite evident that in these forms, the music is incidental to the literary content. The same is true for other dramatic forms. There is a greater collaboration between the dramatist-playwright and the music composer in producing songs which in some instances can stand on their own artistic merit outside the drama itself. It is not uncommon to insert in a particular sarsuwela production songs originally composed for other sarsuwela, especially if these songs were written by the same composer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although popular music writing usually follows the Western compositional concept involving the composer, the written score, and the performer, some works, especially those that belong to the folk ballad category, are composed and performed by the same person, such as the songs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>. The folk ballad type is usually set in simple tunes in strophic form. Because of its semi-narrative, semi-declarative character, its literary-poetic content, more often than not, carries greater artistic value than the music itself. Thus, this type of folk music is widely used as a medium of protest and serious political statements. Some folk ballad composers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4102\"><strong>Grace Nono</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3850\"><strong>Edru Abraham</strong></a> integrate indigenous music in their works. In many of the comic-didactic folk ballads of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a>, the music is less significant in that it is hardly original, as it is usually lifted from the popular dance music repertoire of the American colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of Filipino popular music composers who lack background in music notation employ arrangers. The use of tape recorders and other electronic devices for sound storage and preprogrammed music or minus one have also been put to good use by nonliterate pop music composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent years, the use of Philippine languages in popular music and the production of Filipino-composed tunes have given rise to <b>OPM</b> or original Pilipino music. Composition in Philippine art music, on the other hand, adopts the principles of the European art music tradition. The flowering of the Filipino composer produced classical art music works: masses, operas, symphonies, sonatas, concertos, chamber music, concert overtures and tone poems, song cycles, kundiman, art songs, preludes, and character pieces. Western compositional skills consist of a working knowledge of functional harmony, counterpoint, orchestration, other forms of choral and instrumental writing techniques, as well as stylistic devices relative to vocal and individual instrumental idioms. The principal composers identified with the art music literature which flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\"><strong>Ladislao Bonus</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a>, Nicanor S. Abelardo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, Antonio J. Molina, Juan S. Hernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>, Hilarion F. Rubio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, Lucio D. San Pedro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>, Felipe Padilla de Leon, Lucino T. Sacramento, Alfredo S. Buenaventura, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a>. These composers utilize the forms mainly as a medium for expressing programmatic ideas based on Filipino themes and nationalist ideology as exemplified by the <b><i>Taga-ilog Symphony</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the <b><i>Mayon</i></b> <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>the symphonic poem <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a></i></b> (Brown Race), the <b><i>Daklahi Symphony</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and the opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Touch Me Not). Structural motifs taken from folk songs are common source elements in these works. Purely abstract compositions without allusion to or quotation of Filipino materials are rare in Philippine classical music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New compositional concepts and techniques which evolved in 20th-century Western art music were also selectively adopted and modified by Filipino composers. The proliferation of different stylistic idioms, such as impressionism, expressionism, neoclassicism, and the various streams of thought in the avant-garde movement from the 1950s to the 1970s further enriched the compositional base of Filipino creative artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ambiguous tonal language of expressionist music was absorbed by Nicanor S. Abelardo in the latter part of his creative career, as can be heard in <b><i>Sinfonietta</i></b> and the <b><i>Cinderella Overture</i></b>, while the textural devices of the impressionists were adopted by Antonino Buenaventura and Antonio J. Molina. The neoclassicist idea of putting together old and new materials of music was espoused by Eliseo M. Pajaro, Rosendo Santos, Manuel P. Maramba, OSB, Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a>. Kasilag expanded the neoclassic idiom by fusing non-Western music elements, specifically Asian tones and scales, with standard western melodic and harmonic structures. Other Filipino composers such as Alfredo S. Buenaventura and Jerry A. Dadap are more eclectic in their compositional perspective, relating the different musical idioms to different feelings and emotions. Thus, the application of particular styles of composition is based on programmatic and descriptive, rather than linguistic considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The techniques of composition that developed out of the avant-garde movement also found a place in the works of Filipino composers. Composing with mass sound structures as those initiated by the French <b>musique concrete</b> movement serves as the basic formula for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>&rsquo;s sound murals, as in his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a></i> </b>(Coordination) and<i> <b>Udlot-Udlot</b></i> (Fluctuation). Here, microstructural materials are taken from the sound repertoire of Philippine indigenous instruments such as gongs, mouth harp, bamboo zithers, scrapers, as well as vocal techniques like vocal slides and glottal stops. A similar approach to composition has been adopted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a> whose works, like <b><i>Basbasan </i></b>(Blessing)<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Yayeyunan </i></b>(Melody), are inspired by both Maceda&rsquo;s music and his own researches in Philippine indigenous music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Improvisation, open forms, and graphic notation are elements of composition employed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a> in his early works like <b><i>Time Improvisation</i></b>,<b><i> Five</i> <i>Pieces for Two Pianos</i></b>,<b><i> Radyasyon </i></b>(Radiation), and <b><i>Nabasag ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>Banga</strong></a> </i></b>(The Jar Was Broken); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\"><strong>Chino Toledo</strong></a> in his <b><i>Samut-sari </i></b>(Variety), <b><i>Terminal Lamentation</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Baryasyon</i></b> (Variation);<b><i> </i></b>and Kasilag in her <b><i>Five</i> <i>Portraits </i></b>and<b><i> Ekologie I: On A Day Off</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compositions based on non-Western structural elements such as hocket technique, rhythmic patterns, drones, and heterophony are seen in Ruben R. Federizon&rsquo;s <b><i>Ritmos Tabulare </i></b>(Tabular Rhythm)<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1018\"><strong>Tinig ng Lupa</strong></a> </i></b>(Voice of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>); Verne dela Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Nyuma </i></b>and <b><i>Panaghoy </i></b>(Lamentation); Ramon P. Santos&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/846\"><strong>Abot-tanaw</strong></a></i></b> (Horizons)<b><i> I</i></b>,<b><i> II</i></b>, and<b><i> III</i></b>;<i> </i>Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Trenodya ke Lean at sa Iba Pang Pinapaslang</i></b>,<b><i> Pinaslang at Papaslangin Dahil sa Dahilang Walang Kadahilanan </i></b>(Threnody for Lean and Those Who Have Been Slain, Are Being Slain, and Will Be Slain for Reasons That Have No Reason) and <b><i>Taghoy ng Kalikasan </i></b>(Nature&rsquo;s Lamentation); Francisco F. Feliciano&rsquo;s <b><i>Siya-Kuno </i></b>(As If, also a play on the word &ldquo;chaconne&rdquo;); Arlene Chongson&rsquo;s <b><i>Lunduyan </i></b>(Center);<b><i> </i></b>and Kristina Benitez&rsquo;s works. Sound layers and a rich variety of sound textures that are generated from small nuclear cells are characteristic of the works of Francisco F. Feliciano in his <b><i>Isostasie III</i></b>,<b><i> Die Verkl&auml;erung Christi</i></b>,<b><i> Fragments</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/205\"><strong>Yerma</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>and the opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a> </i></b>(The Black She-wolf); and Conrado del Rosario in his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>s</i></b>. Moreover, Robin Estrada&rsquo;s choral pieces such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> sa Panginoon </i></b>(Song for God) resound chant elements and ritual-based structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The integration of various artistic elements (poetry, music, dance, visual design) has been realized in a number of multimedia works which have been composed in the spirit of artistic holism in traditional art forms. This repertoire continues to grow today, as seen in such works as Ramon P. Santos&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1003\"><strong>Siklo</strong></a> </i></b>(Cycle), <b><i>Daragang Magayon </i></b>(Beautiful Maiden) and <b><i>Awit ni Pulau </i></b>(Song of Pulau); Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Dasalan at Toksohan </i></b>(Praying and Teasing);<b><i> </i></b>and Verne dela Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Urduja </i></b>and <b><i>Agueda</i></b>. Interlocking rhythms usually found in the ensemble music of northern Philippines&rsquo; indigenous groups were employed in the urban soundscape piece of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4092\"><strong>Maria Christine Muyco</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ikotoki for</i></b> <b><i>Jeepney Orchestra</i></b>, a multimedia piece involving instruments made from parts of the jeepney (the Philippine&rsquo;s public vehicle), speech choir, dance, and actual jeepneys and their drivers participating in music making. On the other hand, Mary Katherine Trangco&rsquo;s <b><i>Elira</i> </b>comprises the use of choir, shadow dance, and gong instruments. In this piece, she shows her multitasking ability as performer, that is, conducting while chanting part of her piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are participative and interactive pieces written that invoke deep sociopolitical consciousness among performers and audience such as Jonas Baes&rsquo;s compositions. His <b><i>InAyta</i> </b>involves issues on loss of ancestral land, and <b><i>Lisan</i></b> essays the Iraya-Mangyan&rsquo;s exodus as a result of land displacement, armed conflict, and other encroachments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Collaborations of artists across countries result to fruitful endeavors such as Lily Anne Perez&rsquo;s <b><i>In Search of Kwan and Ocho Ocho (Barrionics),</i> </b>which she accomplished with artists from the Philippines and United States. These pieces involve installations, theatre, dance, video, and computer music. In the same light, Dennis Reyes employs electronic technology in his compositions such as the <b><i>Dance of the Monkey King</i></b> and <b><i>Bolgia,</i> </b>performed in series of Asian Composers League international festivals. Other works of Filipino composers using electro-acoustic and computer technology are uploaded in SoundCloud and other online websites for listening access. Electronic music compositions have been around not only in the academe but among experimental groups as well. Tad Ermitano&rsquo;s <b><i>Deus Ex Machina</i></b> and Tengal Drilon&rsquo;s <b><i>30 Sounds in a Filing Cabinet</i></b><i> </i>are some of the pieces that involve interactive technology and media art. Ermitano has also worked with members of The Children of Cathode Ray, an experimental media group. This group has been performing his works, which in context, become his partners in recreating structures and ideas.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Ramon P.

This interpretation may emerge from a music analysis, which deals with music&rsquo;s formal properties, or from historical and cultural facts, which would provide contextual meanings. Music criticism fundamentally differs from all other types of musicological writings because it emphasizes how a piece of music is perceived, heard, or felt by a listener who then shares his or her musical experience in writing to a reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music criticism may be classified into two kinds, both of which are practiced in the Philippines: (a) the academic or specialized music criticism, found in scholarly journals, periodicals, or books, and (b) the general or what can be called performance review, which is published in newspapers or popular magazines. Normally, criticism of both kinds should position a new work or its performance in relation to existing genre conventions, emphasizing its status with respect to the repertoire of which such work or performance is a part of, and in reference to the composer&rsquo;s other works as well as to other related compositions. It requires attention to musical details such as elements and forms, and utilizes a specialized technical vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Criticism of the first kind is an elucidation of a work or performance, written by the few musicologists and academics in the country. Published in refereed journals and books, it is characterized by an examination of a work or a performance, usually discussing its formalistic content and employing a theoretical framework to validate the scholarly approach of the critic&rsquo;s analysis. It is intended to be read by people who are interested in the uniqueness and artistry of such work or performance as this was or is primarily experienced. Such criticism may bring in as well the work&rsquo;s relation to the historical, sociopolitical, and cultural circumstances that would further enrich the appreciation of the evaluated piece or performance. It requires the critic to have a comprehensive technical training, particularly in music theory and history; a systematic usage of musical vocabulary; a comprehensive and deep knowledge of repertories; a firm grasp of theoretical frameworks; a high regard for scholarship; and an unquestionable esteem for the art of music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second type of criticism is the performance review which is written for the general audience, and therefore, disseminated by the mass media. Normally, it reports the critic&rsquo;s experience of the musical event, usually containing information about the composition and its historical and cultural contexts, with the goal of offering an understanding of the musical performance to the public. The principal task of a critic of this kind is to interpret in lay terms an artist&rsquo;s performance of a work, commenting on its manner of interpretation and impact, especially its relationship to style and repertoire. Ideally, the critic for this type possesses the same qualifications as those writing scholarly reviews, and in addition, the ability to popularize his or her ideas. In the Philippines, some music critics or reviewers for periodicals are trained formally or informally in music; others, sadly, only have a nodding acquaintance with music. Writers with training generally expound with equal ease on all kinds of performed music, from chamber to symphonic to band, from solo instrumental pieces to music theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Academic criticism appears in refereed journals such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1041\"><strong>Musika Jornal</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>,<b><i> Asian Studies</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> Budhi</i></b>, <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b><i><u style=\"text-underline:black thick\">,</u><b> Perspectives in the Arts and Humanities</b></i>, and <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>. Two examples of academic criticism using different approaches on a range of musical subjects are Jose Buenconsejo&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;Dances and Hostility and Friendship: Embodied Histories of Group Relations in the Agusan-Manobo Spirit Possession&rdquo; in <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, 2001, which explores indigenous songs in the context of Manobo rituals as a way to establish face-to-face relationships between people; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ethnomusicology-or-Could my Study of Songs Help Indigenous Philippine Peoples in Disputes over Ancestral Domain?&rdquo; in <b><i>Perfect Beat: The Pacific Journal of Research into Contemporary Music and Popular Culture</i></b>, 2002, which is on the music of the Iraya-Mangyan of Mindoro and details the role of music in empowerment, specifically in relation to disputes over their ancestral domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A fine example of scholarly criticism is Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Tunugan: Four <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\"><strong>Essay</strong></a>s on Filipino Music</i></b>. This contains the essay &ldquo;Nicanor S. Abelardo: Filipino Classicism in the Art of Music,&rdquo; 2005, which scrutinizes Abelardo&rsquo;s kundiman such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\"><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong></a>&rdquo; (Maiden of Pasig), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a>&rdquo; (Kundiman of Tears), and &ldquo;Nasaan Ka Irog&rdquo; (Where Are You, Beloved), as well as Abelardo&rsquo;s instrumental works such as &ldquo;Romanza&rdquo; for violoncello, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> in B-flat Minor</i></b>. The essay provides a detailed assessment of Abelardo&rsquo;s harmonic explorations in his attempt to create instrumental compositions that extended classical forms, and songs that are meaningful fusion of poetry and music in his songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second kind of criticism first appeared in the earliest periodicals devoted to music like the short-lived <b><i>La Lira Filipina</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which ran from 2 May 1877 to 27 Feb 1878. This was followed by the publication of the journal <b><i>Revista del Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario de Manila</i></b>, which printed its first musical review on 10 Aug 1879. The first Filipino music critics at the turn of the 20th century were Epifanio de los Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\"><strong>Fernando Canon</strong></a>, Alfredo Roa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5491\"><strong>Ignacio Manlapaz</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5664\"><strong>Arturo B.

In the 1930s, composer FelipePadilladeLeon wrote a column, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Corner,&rdquo; for the <b><i>Tribune</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>After World War II, he wrote &ldquo;Music and You&rdquo; for <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>. Other composers who wrote about music performances were Antonio Giodina and HilarionF.Rubio. There were other critics of the pre-World War II era such as columnist J. Mauricio Pimentel of <b><i>La Vanguardia</i></b> and the American writer Abraham Van Heyningen Hartendorp of <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b> who was also the publisher of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a>.</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, J. Mauricio Pimentel, who wrote for <b><i>Evening News</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>commented that music critics sprouted &ldquo;like mushrooms, appearing everywhere.&rdquo; In the 1950s, the better-known critics were Rodrigo D. Perez III, Rosita Sandejas de la Concepcion, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5256\"><strong>Morli Dharam</strong></a> or Anthony Morli, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\"><strong>Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</strong></a>, all for <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a>ida Reyes Katigbak, <b><i>Evening News</i></b>;<b><i> </i></b>and Rosalinda Orosa, <b><i>The Manila</i> <i>Chronicle</i></b>,<b><i> Philippine Daily Express</i></b>, and<b><i> The Philippines Star</i></b>.<i> </i>In the 1960s, other writers emerged such as Exequiel Molina of <b><i>Business Day</i></b>,<i> </i>which later became <b><i>Business World;</i></b> and Vilma Santiago-Felipe and Esther Samonte-Madrid, both of <b><i>Daily</i></b> <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></i></b>. In 1972, martial law closed down some dailies and saw the flourishing of new ones. In the 1970s and 1980s, Santiago-Felipe continued to write, but now for <b><i>Manila</i></b> <b><i>Bulletin</i></b>, while Orosa-Goquingco wrote for the <b><i>Philippine Times Journal</i></b>,<b><i> Philippine Star</i></b>,<b> <i>Manila Bulletin</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Daily Express</i></b>,<b><i> Manila Times Journal</i></b>,<b><i> Short Show Magazine</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Evening Post</i></b>. Other writers who have published music reviews from the 1980s to the present are Jaime Daroy for <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>; Celeste Icban Dadap for <b><i>Manila Bulletin; </i></b>Antonio<b><i> </i></b>Hila for <b><i>Manila Chronicle </i></b>when it was still circulating, and at present, for <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>; and Pablo Tariman, who wrote a regular column on culture for <b><i>Manila Chronicle </i></b>and an occasional one for <b><i>Philippine Daily Globe</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and now contributes to <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Examples of performance reviews are Felipe de Leon Jr&rsquo;s reflections on Filipino musical identity in his article &ldquo;What is Philippine Music?&rdquo; in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>3 May 1990; an appraisal of Lorenzo Medel&rsquo;s piano concert in &ldquo;Young Pianist Electrifies Audience,&rdquo; in <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>, 26 Jul 2010; and Pocholo Concepcion&rsquo;s assessment of the 2011 Red Horse Beer Muziklaban Rock Challenge in &ldquo;Tribal Fun Prevails in &lsquo;Muziklaban&rsquo;,&rdquo; in the same newspaper, 1 Feb 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 18 Mar 1983, the Samahan ng Manunuri at Manunulat sa Musika ng Pilipinas (SAMMPI) or Music Critics Guild was founded by a small group of music critics and writers composed of Exequiel Molina, Felipe de Leon Jr, Vilma Santiago-Felipe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C. Hila</strong></a>, Fe B. Mangahas, Felicidad Z. Reyes, and Pablo Tariman.

Criticisms that come out often fall short of professional standards because of the following reasons. First, there is a dearth of space in existing periodicals for responsible and serious criticism because of competition with the more sensational nature of writing in the tabloids. The tabloids prefer a more trivialized type of reporting in order to capture and maintain the general readers&rsquo; attention. Second, there is dearth of professional critics because newspaper companies do not hire them. They consider it too costly to have a specialized music critic in their roster of employees, and they think that it is not important enough. Third, critics of the other arts double up as music critics. Necessarily, they are not knowledgeable enough about music. Fourth, the practice of showering critics with all kinds of perks (i.e., free transportation, tickets, and meals) has become the norm among performers who are hoping that their performances are reviewed in a positive light. As a consequence of all these, reviews generally appear more as simply reports of musical events and typically contain descriptions of the audiences&rsquo; response. They are commonly impressionistic and promotional in nature, serving as a public relations tool for both the artists and the writers. But a ray of hope can be glimpsed in social media bloggers who write candid, often fair evaluations of musical productions including publications, recordings, and performances. These music aficionados attend and leave musical events discreetly and in no time publish their criticism online.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Antonio C.

This transference may take place in the formalized setting of a classroom or under more natural or informal conditions, but either way serving as an avenue for the transmission of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>Indigenous Tradition of Informal Music Education</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among indigenous cultural groups, music is adjunct to everyday living,connected with life cycle events as seen through the ceremonies or rituals that celebrate birth, courtship, and marriage, and that give emphasis to healing, curing, and grieving for the dead.It is used to lull babies to sleep, to relax, or to lighten the burden of household chores.It is as a means of driving away evil spirits or thanking the gods.Planting, harvesting, fishing, and hunting are likewise accompanied by musical activity.In the chanted epics, heroes are extolled, genealogies are traced, moral lessons are imparted.By and large, such music is learned by imitation and immersion.Young children who are surrounded by this music in their daily activities subconsciously absorb the repertoire.This unstructured transmission process takes place continuously in the community, from generation to generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">TheManoboepic singers learn their songs before or during their early teens. Inuk of Tambuyung, the immortal Manobo bard who chanted the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><strong>Tuwaang</strong></a></i></b> epic, descended from a long line of epic singers.His grandfather had two sons, Inagla and Lumunay, both epic singers.Lumunay was Inuk&rsquo;s father. Inuk&rsquo;s son Kagyo is also an accomplished singer.Since formal teaching is not part of the Manobo culture, the children of epic singers are more likely to become epic singers themselves through constant exposure.However, other interested youngsters with the &ldquo;proper voice&rdquo; may learn from a master in a very informal manner.Banlak and Mahunlayon, two Manobo epic singers, learned their songs by staying and listening to Inuk in his house for several nights.They would return home and practice the song away from their teacher.This type of transmission also occurred in the case of Oyana, a Mansaka singer, who learned the <b><i>Manggob </i></b>the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Sulod, Panay-Bukidnon, a<i>binukot </i>(kept maiden) is chosen by the elders of the community.

Young girls learn the<b>lugu maulud</b>, a song cycle in Arabic which tells of the birth and life of Mohammed in poetry and prose, from the community <i>lugu</i> teacher, who also works on vocal quality, competitive performance techniques, and stage presence.<i> </i>The usual length of study for the lugu maulud is<i> </i>six months, after which other<b><i> </i></b>lugu traditions like the<b>sail</b>(ritual song),<b>langanbatabata</b>(royal lullaby), and<b>tarasul</b>(homiletic songs) may be learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A similar transmission system is followed for the<b>paggabang</b>(voice with<i>gabbang</i> xylophone),<b></b><b>tata gabbang</b>(solo gabbang), and<b>tata biyula</b>(solo biyula) traditions.The teacher, most often male, is a professional musician. He teaches instrumental technique and repertoire.The vocal part is taught aurally, while instrumental instruction is essentially visual and kinetic. A disciple-guru relationship exists between male students and the teacher. The teacher provides room and board to them in exchange for household service.Female students, however, have lessons at prearranged times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third type of transmission in Tausug culture involves learning the<b>tata suling<i> </i></b>and<b>tata saunay</b>traditions.Only the males learn the <b>biyula<i> (</i></b>violin),<b><i> </i>suling</b> (flute), and <b>saunay</b> (reedpipe), usually from a relative or a neighbor.This is done sporadically and informally. Among theMaranao, instruction in vocal music is likewise based on the disciple-guru system.The guru is a high-caliber professional singer.He may have as many as three or four apprentices living with him at a time, although two is usually the norm.Text is initially memorized.The various styles of singing these texts are then learned by rote, with the guru singing first, followed by the student.This traditional apprenticeship is termed<i>kasombak</i>. The apprentice, who may be anywhere from 12 to 20 years old, is the<i>morit</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"historical\" name=\"historical\"></a>Historical Notes on Formal Music Education</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the Spanish colonizers in 1521, efforts at Christianization brought about the introduction of<b>canto llano</b>(Gregorianchant) and<b>canto d&rsquo;organo</b> (polyphonic music).The arrival of the Augustinians in 1569, the Franciscans in 1577, the Jesuits in 1581, the Dominicans in 1587, and the Recollects in 1606, resulted in the establishment of schools in convents and churches all over the islands, where young boys were taught the liturgy and its accompanying music.Thus, in 1606, the Franciscan Fr Juan de Santa Marta founded a seminary in Lumban, Laguna where 400 boys from different towns were trained in singing and playing musical instruments.Earlier accounts describe how young children were taught canto llano and canto d&rsquo;organo as well as how to play musical instruments, together with Christian doctrine, reading, and writing.The Franciscan Francisco de San Antonio noted in his <b><i>Chronicas </i></b>that each town had decent instrumental music and a church choir, and everyone knew how to read notes.This observation was echoed again and again in subsequent reports, journals, and travelogues in the decades that followed.Favorite instruments were the flute, violin,piano,harp, andguitar.By the mid-1800s, much mention was made of the excellent bands which performed not only in Manila but in town plazas all over the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A long list of friar musicians who taught in the convent and church schools includes Fr San Pedro Bautista, who was the first to teach Western music to theTagalog; Fr Geronimo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, who taught Gregorian chant, polyphony, and instruments in Camarines; Fr Juan de Santa Marta, who taught in Lumban, Laguna in 1606; Fr Antonio de Moqueda, who taught in Majayjay, Laguna; Fr Marcelo de San Agustin, who taught in Manila in 1565; Fr Juan Bolivar, who taught in Manila and Panay in 1739; Fr Lorenzo Castelo, who taught in Manila, Ilocos, and Panay in 1718; Fr Ignacio de Jesus, who taught in Guadalupe Church in 1737; Fr Jose de la Virgen, who taught in Bicol, from 1717 to 1767; and Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a>, who taught in Las Pi&ntilde;as in 1795.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples de la Santa Iglesia Catedral was established at the behest of the Archbishop of Manila, Juan Angel Rodriguez, who, shortly before his death in 1742, ordered that a boys&rsquo; choir be formed.It became the prototype for the other schools in the islands.The Colegio had a director, vice-director, three music professors, and an academic teacher of primary instruction.Music classes for solfeggio, vocalization, composition,organ, and string instruments were given to the young boys.Many noted Filipino musicians such asAntonioGarcia, Salvador Pi&ntilde;on,FulgencioTolentino, and Manuel Lopez were graduates of the school.The college was in existence until the outbreak of World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A great many chronicles of the 19th century also speak of the presence of pianos in the homes of the landed and educated gentry in most towns and cities.Young ladies were taught to play the piano by hired teachers who came to their homes to give individual instruction.Both male and female students learned how to play the piano in the <i>colegios</i> of the Spanish period. This system of piano teaching continued in private schools to the American period.In some cases, students would go to their teachers&rsquo; homes for their lessons.Today, however, with the existence of many professional music schools, this type of instruction has declined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American colonial government established the public school system all over the islands.As early as August 1898, seven schools were established in Manila and many more followed, so that at the turn of the century, over <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>,000 Filipino children were enrolled in public schools.American soldiers served as the first public school teachers and were later replaced by the Thomasites<s>,</s> American teachers who came aboard theUSS Thomas.In the first decade of the 20th century, young talented Filipinos were sent to the United States as <i>pensionados </i>or scholars.

This learner-oriented reform advocates the Mother-Tongue-Based Lingual Education for grades 1-3 and a specialized senior high school curriculum created with the cooperation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The implementation of the K-12 program began in 2016.

Currently, the school has five specializations: creative writing, dance (folk and ballet), music, theater arts, and visual arts. The PHSA curriculum is currently undergoing synchronization with the K-12 program to further support the development of artistry and creative expression in the specialized fields.

Such copies were originally known as records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Records, technically called phonorecords, began with the invention of the phonograph cylinder in 1877 and the gramophone disc in 1881. The earliest records were sold in 1901 in the United States by Victor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. By 1925, the speed of the record was standardized at 78 RPM (revolutions per minute). In 1948, Columbia introduced the 33 ? RPM vinyl LP (long-playing) record, and in 1949, the 45 RPM single was introduced by RCA-Victor. These analog discs were supplanted by digital compact discs (CDs) in 1981, co-developed by Phillips and Sony. All musical recordings contained in phonorecords, including those synchronized with film and games, are collectively called phonograms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">According to Danny Yson, an American businessman named Isaac Beck opened a store in 1913 in Manila&rsquo;s Isaac Peral Street (later renamed United Nations Avenue), which sold 78 RPM discs from Victor Company and their disc player called the Victrola. In the same year, a retired US Army major named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Anderson took the initiative to record Filipino talents. Anderson, who was appointed representative of the Victor Talking Machine Company, created a makeshift studio on the second floor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a> where he began recording songs from the Philippine <i>sarsuwela</i>, the native adaptation of the Spanish zarzuela or lyric theater. Actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\"><strong>Maria Carpena</strong></a> became the first Philippine recording artist. Accompanied by the Molina Orchestra, her song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/943\"><strong>Ang Maya</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Sparrow), composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>,<b> </b>was released by Victor Records in 1913.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1925, Isaac Beck became a distributor of Columbia Phonograph Company and became William Anderson&rsquo;s competitor. Beck put up his own radio station, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>, after the release by Columbia Records of two Filipino songs, &ldquo;Ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/885\"><strong>Dalagang Pilipina</strong></a>&rdquo; (Filipina Maiden) and &ldquo;Paalam Sa Pagkadalaga&rdquo; (Farewell to Maidenhood), which were recorded by the mezzo-soprano Nati de Arellano in the United States. Ironically, by 1929, Arellano transferred to Victor Records and recorded extensively with them. Most notable of these recordings was &ldquo;Mutya Ng Pasig&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig) by Nicanor S. Abelardo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s, the popularity of <i>bodabil</i> (the Filipino vaudeville) brought to the fore the eclectic talents of Katy de la Cruz, billed equally as &ldquo;Queen of Vaudeville&rdquo; and &ldquo;Queen of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a>.&rdquo; She was the highest paid entertainer in the country during her prime and had popularized her trademark art of scat singing. By the 1930s, she would be most identified with the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\"><strong>Balut</strong></a>&rdquo; (Duck Egg), a tune written by Jerry Brandy which was a bawdy take on the notorious Filipino culinary delicacy. However, her recorded legacy is the bilingual song &ldquo;Magtanim ay Hindi Biro&rdquo; (Planting Rice Is Never Easy), recorded initially for Filipinos in the United States with the English title &ldquo;Planting Rice,&rdquo; which was released by RCA-Victor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Between the years 1927 and 1929, a young Filipino-Basque composer-pianist and conductor named Federico Elizalde, aka Fred Elizalde, did a series of jazz recordings in England for the prestigious Brunswick and Decca record labels. His recordings are considered milestones in the world of jazz, and are still available today under the name Fred Elizalde and his Anglo American Band. Elizalde was closely associated with modernist composers such as Maurice Ravel, Darius Milhaud, and Manuel De Falla. He returned to the Philippines in later years to conduct the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> and attend to his family&rsquo;s media business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, the most popular singer was Lilian Velez, who became a celebrated movie actress for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\"><strong>LVN Pictures</strong></a>. She is best known for her on-screen rendition of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/992\"><strong>Sa Kabukiran</strong></a>&rdquo; (By the Countryside), a theme song composed by her father Manuel P. Velez for a film of the same title. The elder Velez wrote other timeless Philippine songs such as &ldquo;Lawiswis Sa Kawayan&rdquo; (Swishing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a>), &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Kampupot&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m a Jasmine), and &ldquo;La Cari&ntilde;osa&rdquo; (The Affectionate Lady) which was recorded by the Victor Orchestra and released by Victor Records in 1930. The song &ldquo;Sa Kabukiran&rdquo; attained a wide Philippine cinematic following and was reinterpreted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4577\"><strong>Elsa Oria</strong></a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures&rsquo; movie <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Beautiful Star) and by Nora Hermosa in Vista Films&rsquo; movie <b><i>Ang Siloy </i></b>(The Songbird).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs from the Philippine sarsuwela found a new medium in movies and disc. &ldquo;Bituing Marikit,&rdquo; composed by Nicanor S. Abelardo in 1926, became a movie theme and title in 1937 for Sampaguita Pictures. Nicanor S. Abelardo supposedly recorded 16 of his songs for Victor Company, interpreted by various singers such as Nati de Arellano, Pacita de Tavera, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2763\"><strong>Florentino Ballecer</strong></a>. The most significant of these recordings was &ldquo;Amorosa&rdquo; (The Amorous Lady), released by Victor in New York in 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sylvia La Torre, known as the &ldquo;Queen of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>,&rdquo; rose to prominence after World War II when she joined the roster of artists of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong></a>. In 1950, she became a recording artist for the fledgling independent label Bataan Records, with the song &ldquo;Si Petite Mon Amour&rdquo; (My Little Love). Later, she transferred to the larger independent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a>, where she recorded her hit song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1025\"><strong>Waray-Waray</strong></a>&rdquo; (a person from Samar or Leyte), a blues progression with Tagalog lyrics. Villar Records was launched in 1950 by the late Manuel P. Villar, known as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Recording,&rdquo; who had released the first commercial record of the Philippine National Anthem. In the 1960s, Villar Records&rsquo; previous success with &ldquo;Waray-Waray&rdquo; paved the way for another Tagalog vernacular song with a rock and roll progression, &ldquo;Hahabol-Habol&rdquo; (Chasing After) by Bobby Gonzales, a singer who became a star on the live musical stage of Manila&rsquo;s Clover Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1960s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, a Cebuana Spanish mestiza, made a hit record in Melbourne titled &ldquo;Come Closer To Me&rdquo; and recorded three LPs for Australia&rsquo;s Astor Records. Her weekly television show from 1965-72 featured her international hit song &ldquo;A Million Thanks To You,&rdquo; composed by Alice Doria-Gamilla and released by Villar Records. She was dubbed &ldquo;Asia&rsquo;s Queen of Song&rdquo; and sang to open the Beatles&rsquo; 1966 concert at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Later on, she transferred to Vicor Music Corporation<b>, </b>a company founded by<b> </b>record industry entrepreneurs<b> </b>Vic del Rosario<b> </b>and<b> </b>Orly Ilacad. Here, she interpreted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\"><strong>George Canseco</strong></a>&rsquo;s early compositions such as &ldquo;Kapantay Ay Langit&rdquo; (As High as the Sky) issued in the album <b><i>Philippine Love Songs Vol. 1</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1970, a Filipino-American singer-drummer named Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith was discovered during his stint in Tokyo and was invited to join a band named Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki that subsequently released two albums: <b><i>Eve</i></b>, 1971, and their eponymous second album, 1972, under Atlantic Records. Prior to his Japanese experience, Smith, with his previous band The Downbeats, was also part of the opening act of the Beatles&rsquo; 1966 concert at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Returning to Manila upon completing his obligations with Atlantic Records, he reinvented himself as Pepe Smith and, consequently, with his colleagues in the Juan De La Cruz Band, invented Pinoy rock. Released by Vicor Music, their comprehensive discography consisted of &ldquo;Up In Arms,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1468\"><strong>Maskara</strong></a>&rdquo; (Mask), &ldquo;Super Session,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kahit Anong Mangyari&rdquo; (Whatever Happens). Pepe Smith&rsquo;s composition, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/901\"><strong>Ang Himig Natin</strong></a>&rdquo; (Our Hymn), defined the character of Pinoy rock for an entire generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The avalanche of possibilities in Pinoy rock was multifaceted. In 1977, a rock vocalist named Tessie Alfonso, with stage name Sampaguita, collaborated with an Olongapo-based guitarist, Gary Perez, to write songs for a self-titled LP released by Vicor that combined rock and roll with Tagalog street jargon, as in her single, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/873\"><strong>Bonggahan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Revelry). After a long sabbatical, she repeated this formula on her own in 1991 with her single &ldquo;Nosi Ba Lasi&rdquo; (Tagalog word play for &ldquo;Sino Ba Sila?&rdquo;/Who are They?), released on cassette tape by RJ Records. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\"><strong>Ramon Jacinto</strong></a>, a rock and roll guitarist, singer, and businessman who owned RJ Records and the Rajah Broadcasting Network (DZRJ), had also released his own chart-topping song titled &ldquo;Muli&rdquo; (Once More) in the 1980s. A DZRJ favorite, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>,<b> </b>recorded an album in 1978 titled <b><i>Mga Tula At <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>in Ni Florante</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1932\"><strong>Poems</strong></a> and Songs of Florante) for an independent record label called Jem Recording Company<b> </b>that was received favorably by critics and folk-rock enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1976, Jem Recording Company, or simply Jem Records (not to be confused with an American label of the same name), introduced itself to the record-buying public with two prestigious LP album projects&mdash;namely, <b><i>Pinoy Jazz</i></b> by Eddie Munji III and <b><i>Pinoy Jazz II: Roots To Routes</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>. Both featured modern arrangements of Philippine folk songs. Amid a flurry of mixed reviews, the tracks from the two albums were continually rotated on AM and FM radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new Pinoy jazz genre was quickly supported by Vicor Records and its new subsidiary, Blackgold Records. Two groundbreaking albums by the Filipino bossa nova advocate and composer-pianist Bong Pe&ntilde;era found their place in the pop charts: <b><i>A Samba Song</i></b>, 1976, and <b><i>Batucada Sa Calesa</i></b> (Batucada by the Horse-drawn Cart), 1977. It was also in 1977 that the LP <b><i>The Jazz Friends </i></b>was released. It<b> </b>featured Filipino big band performances with saxophonists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a> and Doming Valdez, drummer Tony Velarde, and Manila&rsquo;s finest jazz musicians, accompanied by music created by the &ldquo;Godfather of Pinoy Jazz,&rdquo; Angel Pe&ntilde;a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In an unexpected move, Jem Records issued <b><i>Buhay Musikero</i></b> (Musician&rsquo;s Life), 1976, the first of three Pinoy Rock LPs that propelled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>, the erstwhile singer-composer-bassist of the Juan De La Cruz Band, to the top of the local charts. Hanopol&rsquo;s themes of hardship, delinquency, greed, and desperation, combined with a refined rock aesthetic, were warmly received. This album was followed by two other LPs released by Blackgold Records&mdash;<b><i>Awiting Pilipino</i></b> (Filipino Songs), 1977, and <b><i>Buksan </i></b>(Open), 1978. Completing the cycle of classic Pinoy rock recordings, the abortive 1973 sessions of a Juan De La Cruz splinter group, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> Bayan, were eventually released in 1977 in a self-titled LP by A&amp;W Records, a subsidiary of Villar Records. The singles &ldquo;Jeepney Rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Probinsiyana&rdquo; (Country Girl) resonated with elements of rock and jazz undertones. Almost as an afterthought, an album by an Olongapo-based band named Maria Cafra, led by guitarist Resty Fabunan<b>, </b>was<b> </b>released in 1978 by Jem Records. The subgenre of music, described as <b>kundiman rock</b>, was both tentative and creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early to mid-1970s, Vicor Music Corporation and Villar Records were in competition to capture a burgeoning Filipino pop market. Vicor was first in line to heed the demand as Filipino language adaptations of Western songs were crafted. A song by Barbra Streisand, &ldquo;The Way We Were,&rdquo; was sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4134\"><strong>Rico J. Puno</strong></a><b> </b>in an adaptation titled &ldquo;Alaala sa Luneta&rdquo; (Memories at Luneta), 1973. A song by The Bee Gees, &ldquo;Charade,&rdquo; was adapted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\"><strong>Willy Cruz</strong></a><b> </b>into &ldquo;Tag-Araw&rdquo; (Summer), 1974, sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3863\"><strong>Hajji Alejandro</strong></a>. The standard song &ldquo;There Will Never Be Another You&rdquo; was translated into &ldquo;Ikaw Pa Rin&rdquo; (Still You), 1975, by Tito Mina. Villar Records followed suit in 1974 with the release of the LP <b><i>Unang Kagat</i></b> (First Bite) and the single, &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You are the Miss Universe of My Life), recorded by the pop-rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a>. The popularity of the Miss Universe ditty spawned the movie <b><i>Hotdog: Unang Kagat</i></b> in 1975, starring the band, with some of the biggest names in local cinema&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a> Roa&mdash;in cameo roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initially described as <b>Manila Sound</b>, the genre later called <b>Original Pilipino Music</b> (OPM) underwent a gradual process of reinvention. Sunshine Records, a sub-label of Vicor Music, assembled a studio band named Cinderella featuring Yolly Samson that released three significant albums. The first LP, <b><i>Ang Boyfriend Kong Baduy</i></b> (My Gaudy Boyfriend), 1974, was a collection of novelty songs and a soft style marketed as the <b>Marshmallow Sound</b>. The song spawned a movie of the same title, directed by Jose Gosiengfiao. Their second LP, <b><i>Cinderella 2</i></b>, 1975, featured a song composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3949\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Ernani Cuenco</strong></a></strong></a> titled &ldquo;Bato Sa Buhangin&rdquo; (Pebble in the Sand) that became an enduring Filipino ballad and which also led to a movie of the same title, directed by Pablo Santiago. A third LP, <b><i>T.L. Ako sa Iyo</i></b> (I&rsquo;m Truly in Love with You), 1975, featuring a new singer, Cecile Colayco, returned the group to their novelty roots before it disbanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the 1980s, the architects of OPM were gradually outgrowing the adaptive and novelty genres of the Manila Sound. Most notably, a popular cover group named Circus Band<b> </b>had<b> </b>ceased performing in Manila&rsquo;s nightspots, starting an exodus of its members into the recording industry. The first to go was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a><b> </b>who recorded for Blackgold Records, a subsidiary of Vicor Music, the single &ldquo;Ngayon At Kailanman&rdquo; (Now and Forever), 1977, a song by George Canseco<b> </b>loosely based on the Diana Ross song &ldquo;All Of My Life.&rdquo; The Circus Band keyboardist, Boy Katindig, also released a well-received instrumental jazz album titled <b><i>Midnight Lady</i></b> for A&amp;W Records International, a subsidiary of Villar Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By then, the media czar of the Marcos regime, Teodoro Valencia, had authored a memorandum instructing all radio stations to air three Filipino recordings each hour. He also co-organized the Metropolitan Popular Music Festival in 1978 to stimulate originality in the songwriting field. Winning the grand prize for the premier event was Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kay Ganda Ng Ating Musika&rdquo; (How Beautiful is Our Music), interpreted by Hajji Alejandro<b> </b>of the Circus Band. Interestingly, one finalist of that contest who did not win was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a>, whose composition &ldquo;Anak&rdquo; (Child), became the most famous Filipino song in the world. In the following year, another Circus Band alumnus, Ray-An Fuentes, won first place with the song &ldquo;Umagang Kay Ganda&rdquo; (Beautiful Morning).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Golden Age of OPM had begun, ushering in a fresh crop of artists who would define the character of the genre. Leading the throng were the Apo (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a>) Hiking Society, which began with a comedic spin in their first two LPs, <b><i>In Concert #$% *!?</i></b>, 1974, and <b><i>Collector&rsquo;s Item</i></b>, 1975, but later came up with a more mature repertoire of classic pop singles released by Jem Records, including &ldquo;Mahirap Magmahal ng Syota ng Iba&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Difficult to Love Someone Else&rsquo;s Girlfriend), 1976, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/984\"><strong>Pumapatak ang Ulan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Rain Is Falling), 1978, and &ldquo;Lumang Tugtugin&rdquo; (Old Tune), 1978. In 1985, when the group was already simply known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4022\"><strong>Danny Javier</strong></a>, one of its members,<b> </b>wrote a song titled &ldquo;Di na Natuto&rdquo; (You Never Learn) for Blackgold Records for a gifted young singer named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>. Valenciano&rsquo;s creativity as a composer and instrumentalist led to a series of LPs and singles for Universal Records, which culminated in the technically innovative album <b><i>Moving Thoughts</i></b>, 1988, that featured his original songs like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1278\"><strong>Sana Maulit Muli</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Hope It Happens Again) and &ldquo;Di Bale na Lang&rdquo; (Never Mind). &ldquo;Sana Maulit Muli&rdquo; inspired a movie of the same title, directed by Mike Relon Makiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The convergence of musical recordings and film was best exemplified by the singer and actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>, dubbed &ldquo;The Megastar,&rdquo; whose 40 albums, 53 movies, and 10 television shows were unprecedented. Encouraged by her executive producer Vic Del Rosario and aided by songwriters like George Canseco, Willy Cruz,<b> </b>and<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\"><strong>Rey Valera</strong></a>, Sharon Cuneta movies like <b><i>Dear Heart</i></b>, 1981, <b><i>P.S. I Love You</i></b>, 1981, <b><i>Bukas Luluhod Ang Mga Tala</i></b> (Tomorrow, the Stars Will Fall on their Knees), 1984, <b><i>Bituing Walang Ningning</i></b> (Star Without Sparkle), 1985, <b><i>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</i></b> (May It Never End), 1986, and <b><i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i></b> (Whoever You May Be), 1991, became indistinguishable from her soundtrack hits. Other musical artists took to the fashion, with stars like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\"><strong>Kuh Ledesma</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a> being given their own television shows and movies. Songs like &ldquo;Dito Ba&rdquo; (Is It Here?), 1980, by Kuh Ledesma, composed by George Canseco; &ldquo;Ikaw ang Lahat sa Akin&rdquo; (You are Everything To Me), 1985, by Martin Nievera, composed by Cecile Azarcon-Picazo; and &ldquo;Ikaw Lamang&rdquo; (Only You), by Zsa Zsa Padilla, composed by Dodjie Simon, became household hits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982, the greatest Filipino jazz pianist of his time, Bobby Enriquez, emerged in the American limelight. He performed and recorded with some of the most established masters of the idiom, including the legendary trumpetist Dizzy Gillespie who fondly called him the &ldquo;wild man from Mindanao.&rdquo; The monicker stuck because it captured Bobby Enriquez&rsquo;s unpredictable yet engrossing piano style. Crescendo Records<b>, </b>his record label in the United States, was distributed in the Philippines<b> </b>by<b> </b>Villar Records, and through the latter, his LPs <b><i>The Wild Man</i></b> and <b><i>The Wild Man Meets The Madman</i> </b>became very popular jazz records in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, a new wave band called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a><b> </b>released their first eponymous album and single, &ldquo;Enveloped Ideas,&rdquo; under OctoArts International<b>, </b>which<b> </b>created much enthusiasm in the Pinoy rock community. Many felt that the group could fill the void left by the Juan de la Cruz band. The Dawn&rsquo;s second album in 1988, <b><i>I Stand With You</i></b>, with the single, &ldquo;Love Will Set Us Free,&rdquo; propelled the band to the top of the charts. Unfortunately, the untimely demise that year of its guitarist, Teddy Diaz, momentarily brought its rise to a standstill. After that, the band continued to release albums and remains active until today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Executive Order No. 255<i> </i>issued by Pres Corazon Aquino in 1987 stipulated that all local radio stations must air four or more OPM songs per hour. The karaoke sing-along device was also in vogue during this time, and helped propagate the OPM repertoire of songs far and wide. But the Golden Age of OPM reached a plateau towards the 1990s. The Philippine recording industry was in need of new blood. It was then that Francis Magalona, an actor and break-dancer in the 1980s ventured into the flourishing American genre called <b>rap</b>. Incorporating technique and social relevance, he emerged with records titled <b><i>Yo!</i></b>, 1990, which became the first commercially released Filipino rap album, and <b><i>Rap is Francis M</i></b>, 1992, both under PolyEast Records. His efforts at bringing nationalistic Filipino sensibilities to his field of artistic endeavor earned him a posthumous Presidential Medal of Merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a parallel development, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a><b>, </b>a<b> </b>band formed in 1991 by students from the University of the Philippines (UP), was rejected at every turn until BMG Records Pilipinas<b> </b>signed the group up for a three-year contract. Their debut record in 1993 called <b><i>Ultraelectromagneticpop</i></b> had sold 300,000 copies by the end of the year. The second album in 1994, <b><i>Circus</i></b>, sold 200,000 copies, and the third album in 1995, <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, was certified Gold prior to release and went on to sell 400,000 copies. All seven albums and four compilation albums of the Eraserheads sold out. The group&rsquo;s success is credited today for having opened the floodgates for <b>alternative music</b> in the Philippines. The character and flavor of alternative music encouraged independent recordings to prosper. The record companies, eager to emulate the success of the Eraserheads, signed dozens of nonmainstream acts like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a>, Urbandub, Razorback, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4181\"><strong>Sponge Cola</strong></a>.<b> </b>Independent commercial and institutional record labels also brought unexpected additions to a growing OPM tradition. Some of these independent labels such as Terno Recordings have created a large niche of their own in the music industry, featuring bands such as Up Dharma Down that released an album called <b><i>Fragmented</i> </b>in 2006 that merited a a full-page mention in <b><i>Time Magazine</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>,<b> </b>a native of Davao City, with his group Ang Bagong Lumad, independently released <b><i>Panganay Ng Umaga</i></b> (Eldest of the Morning) in 1981, a folk album utilizing native Filipino instruments such as the <b>hegalong </b>(two-stringed lute), <b>kubing</b> (mouth harp) and <b>kulintang</b><i> </i>(gongs of graduated sizes), released commercially by WEA Records in 1991. Ayala, with his sister, singer-songwriter Cynthia Alexander, independently recorded and released an album for the Asian puppet theater <b><i>Sita at Rama</i></b> (Sita and Rama), written by Amelia Lapena-Bonifacio. In New York, two albums of original works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> were released by the Tzadik record label: <b><i>Gongs and Bamboos</i></b>, 2001, and <b><i>Drone and Melody</i>, </b>2007. In 2012, <b><i>Humanfolk</i></b>, a<b> </b>collaboration between jazz<b> </b>guitarist-composer Johnny Alegre and the New York-based kulintang<i> </i>advocate and percussionist Susie Ibarra<b>, </b>augmented by<b> </b>the talents of Cynthia Alexander and the electronica exponent Malek Lopez, was recorded. Their album, which combined gongs, bamboo, and conventional instrumentation with computer programing, was released by MCA Music Philippines<b> </b>in 2011.<b> </b>Similarly, two albums that have received critical acclaim among peers are the experimental albums <b><i>Translating the Gongs</i></b>, 2006, and <b><i>Out Of Tradition</i></b>, 2014, which were independently recorded and released by guitarist-composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3883\"><strong>Bob Aves</strong></a> through his own record label, Tao Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UP College of Music produced the records <b><i>Ang Musika ng mga Kalinga</i></b> (Kalinga Music), <b><i>Ang Mga Kulintang sa Mindanao at Sulu</i></b> (The Kulintang of Mindanao and Sulu) and <b><i>Kulintang and Kudyapiq</i></b>. The Asian Institute of Liturgy and Music came out with <b><i>Buksan Mo ang Aming Labi</i></b> (Open Our Lips), <b><i>O, Se&ntilde;or Tagbalay</i></b> (Oh, Lord of the House), and <b><i>Mula sa Labi ng Mga Musmos</i></b> (From the Mouths of Children).

The Sociedad de Artes y Oficios was founded in 1869 to propagate the arts, including vocal and instrumental music. The Liceo Cientifico Artistico Literario was founded in 1877 and sponsored occasional literary and musical contests and concerts to serve music lovers and propagate literature and the fine arts. Only political ferment prevented its founders from putting up a conservatory. However, it did publish a journal, the <b><i>Revista del Liceo Cientifico Artistico y Literario de Manila</i></b> (Review of the Scientific, Artistic, and Literary Lyceum of Manila). The Sociedad Artistico Literaria de Iloilo was organized in 1893 to hold concerts and theatrical presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 16 Apr 1885, several musicians met at the Sampaloc residence of Pedro Gruet, upon the behest of Manuel Garrido and Carlos Saco del Valle, to set up Union Artistico <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>.

JMOP aimed to provide an environment conducive to the cultivation of musical taste and stimulation of musical activity. Also in the 1960s, Vicente Sales founded the PasaknunganPhilippines to train young violinists and build a reservoir of artistic talent. The organization originally catered to the children of Government Social Insurance System (GSIS) personnel. In 1970, however, it started accepting children of non-GSIS personnel, mainly from low-income families. Its membership once swelled to around 400. Today, it limits its trainees to 140, from ages six to 19. On Sundays, the children were taught solfeggio in the morning, and violin ensemble and orchestra performance in the afternoon. Since 1981, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4115\"><strong>Pasaknungan Philippines</strong></a> has been funded by the Philippine National Oil Corporation and the CCP, and many of its musicians have gone on to become professional string players in the country&rsquo;s major symphony orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The government created the National MusicCompetitionforYoungArtists (NAMCYA) in 1973 to help discover talent in choral singing, piano, chamber music, family ensemble, and indigenous music.

The ManilaSymphonySociety (MSS) was founded in 1931, five years after the MSO was organized by AlexanderLippay. The MSO was first supported by the AsociacionMusicaldeFilipinas. Then the MSS took over planning and projects, bringing MSO performances not only to the theaters but also to the communities and schools in far-flung provinces and schools. MSS paid for the salaries of MSO musicians and musical directors, bought instruments and scores, and invested in promotions. In 1978, the Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a> (MET), was reopened and it became the base of the MSO until 1989. Due to financial difficulties, the MSO cancelled its 1988-1989 concert season, and staged its last concert at the Metropolitan Theater in 1989. The orchestra hibernated for a decade, until it was revived by violinist and orchestral conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\"><strong>Basilio Manalo</strong></a> in 2001. It became known as MSO II, and the directorship was later passed on to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4085\"><strong>Arturo Molina</strong></a>. A major force in its revitalization was the Philippine Research for Developing Instrumental Soloists (PREDIS), founded in 1984 by Manalo, with the aid of Sr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4130\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4131\"><strong>Mary Placid</strong></a></strong></a> of St Scholastica&rsquo;s College, which eventually housed the MSO II from 2001 to 2014. PREDIS aims to develop young instrumentalists who will later supply the needs of the MSO and other orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1960, RedentorRomero founded the NPO. That same year, Romero established the National Philharmonic Society (NPS) to support the cultural programs of the NPO. When the orchestra folded in 1984, the NPS continued to present regular seasons of performances featuring foreign as well as Filipino artists. It has sponsored outreach programs to the provinces and produced recordings of Philippine classics with the London, Royal, and Moscow Philharmonic Orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PPO is the only orchestra completely subsidized by the state, specifically, the CCP. It has conducted regular seasons at the CCP Tanghalang Nicanor S. Abelardo (formerly Main Theater) under the directorship of Oscar C. Yatco and other conductors. In 1985, the Philippine Philharmonic Society Inc. (PPSI) was formed to extend additional help to PPO members. It launched the Orchestra <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1158\"><strong>Endo</strong></a>wment Fund in 1987 to handle PPO funds raised through donations and other projects and augments CCP&rsquo;s allocation to the PPO. The PPSI was later renamed Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra Society, Inc. (PPOSI) in 1996, with the prime objective to promote, enhance and develop the premiere orchestra of the country, whose level of excellence can be comparable with its foreign counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike the PPO, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\"><strong>Manila Chamber Orchestra</strong></a> (MCO) was fully subsidized in the past by the privately-owned PCI Bank through the MCO Foundation, which later went public in 1990 and included corporate institutions such as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., Philips, Meralco, and IBM. Its annual concert season featured Filipino as well as foreign artists. It was being conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"><strong>Sergio Esmilla</strong></a> Sr until the orchestra&rsquo;s untimely dissolution in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1991, pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4157\"><strong>Ingrid Sala-Santamaria</strong></a> returned to Cebu and, in her capacity as the chair of the Salvador and Pilar Sala Foundation, started a Ten-Year Development Program for the young music talents of the city, with the intention of forming a youth orchestra of a national caliber. It resulted in the founding of the Cebu Youth Symphony Orchestra in 1995, which later became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a> Philharmonic Philippines in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Orchestral organizations founded in the 21st century include the Manila Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 2003 and conducted by Rodel Colmenar, which is the only Filipino orchestra owned and managed by the musicians themselves; San Miguel Foundation Orchestra, founded in 2001 but disbanded in 2007; Metro Manila Community Orchestra, 2000, conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\"><strong>Chino Toledo</strong></a>; FILharmoniKA, 2005, originally named Global Studio Orchestra or GC4, conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4159\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Gerard Salonga</strong></a></strong></a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> Philharmonic Orchestra, 2012, also conducted by Gerard Salonga; and the Orchestra of the Filipino Youth, 2013, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3946\"><strong>Jovianney Emmanuel Cruz</strong></a> as its artistic director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Friends of the CCP was founded in 1979 to attract a bigger audience for CCP events. Chito Madrigal was elected president and Lula Dawson vice-president. A heterogeneous group, Friends is composed of people of different nationalities and occupations. It disseminates information on art exhibits, performances, and other cultural events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music reviewing and criticism was pursued vigorously in the 1980s with the formation of the Music Critics Guild or Samahan ng Mga Manunuri at Manunulat sa Musika ng Pilipinas (SAMMPI) organized in 1983 by a group of music writers and reviewers led by Exequiel Molina. Officers and members were inducted by then-CCP president Lucrecia R. Kasilag. Founding members were Felipe de Leon Jr, Vilma Santiago-Felipe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C. Hila</strong></a>, Fe Mangahas, Pablo Tariman, Ana Leah Sarabia de Leon, and Felicidad Z. Reyes. The guild&rsquo;s goals were to promote music criticism, appreciation of foreign, Philippine, pop, and serious or classical music, and train prospective music writers and critics. On the other hand, the interests of local composers, lyric writers, music publishers, and music copyright owners have been pursued by the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, Inc. (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3987\"><strong>FILSCAP</strong></a>), which was established in 1965 to administer the performing and reproduction rights of its local members based on copyright legislation, and also provide representation for foreign composers, lyricists, and music publishers if agreed upon by similarly constituted societies to which they belong. Members of the FILSCAP included Felipe Padilla de Leon, Lucrecia R. Kasilag, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\"><strong>Santiago Suarez</strong></a>, Antonio Lustre, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\"><strong>Ariston Avelino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a> Jr, ConstanciodeGuzman, AntonioMaiquez, Delfin Manlapaz, and RestitutoUmali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A group called KATHA was founded in 1987 to promote the awareness and protection of the rights and privileges of local composers of popular music, as well as to promote camaraderie and a sense of community among its members. It has since held workshops for promising music writers which were conducted by the organization&rsquo;s founding members, among them Odette Quesada, RyanCayabyab, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\"><strong>Jim Paredes</strong></a>, VehneeSaturno, DannyTan, and HeberBartolome. Another group of composers, the Asian Composers League-Philippines (ACL-Philippines), whose membership is by invitation only, was founded in 2005, with the aim of supporting and fostering the development of contemporary music works of Filipino composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Right after the EDSA Revolt of 1986, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\"><strong>Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP)</strong></a>, the Alliance of Artists for the Creation of the Ministry of Culture (AACMC), and the Samahan sa Kultura at Sining (SAKSI) were formed to lobby for the creation of a ministry of culture to administer cultural affairs. In response, the Aquino government created the Presidential Commission for Culture and the Arts (PCCA) under Executive Order (EO) 118, dated 30 Jan 1987. This eventually became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a>, by virtue of Republic Act (RA) 7356, passed on 8 Apr 1992. The NCCA was placed directly under the Office of the President solely for budgetary concerns. Its main task was to reconstruct the Filipino national identity by formulating cultural policies and coordinating the activities that promoted the culture of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Federation for Choral Music (PFCM), organized in 1996, was geared towards the promotion and appreciation of choral music. Part of its aim was to make choral music a potent force in the development of national culture. However, this organization did not last long. The Philippine Choral Directors Association (PCDA), with almost similar aims as the earlier PFCM, founded in 2008, continued the thrust of gathering choral conductors all over the Philippines. Since its foundation, the PCDA has been actively propagating Philippine choral arts through its annual conventions. In 2014, it hosted the meeting of its international counterpart, the International Federation for Choral Music (IFCM) in Ilocos Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Opera Company (POC), founded in 1999, is the only opera company in the country that regularly presents staged drama with music. It has produced operas, sarsuwela, and musicals for the contemporary theater audience. The POC has constructed its own Opera Haus, hailed as the permanent home for classical singers of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Musicological Society of the Philippines (MSP) was founded in 2002 by Jose Buenconsejo and Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo-Chua, with the aim of advancing music scholarship in the country. Its incumbent president is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a>, who has held the position since 2004. The MSP has also hosted various musicological conferences and international music festivals. Moreover, members of the MSP have presented and published papers in related academic societies of the Philippines, notably the Philippine Studies Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of popularmusic, several organizations have been formed to promote the welfare of performers and composers. Foremost among these organizations is the PhilippineAssociationoftheRecordIndustry (PARI), successor of the Recording Industry Association of the Philippines (RIAP) which was established in the mid-1960s. Since its inception in 1976, PARI has been active in the supervision of the conduct of the local recording business and the improvement of local record production. Its key responsibility, however, has been to protect legitimate record producers from unscrupulous duplicators or pirates. PARI has duly recognized 32 recording companies as members. Its past presidents include Antonio Lustre (elected 1976) and James Dy (elected 1978). In 1981, Danilo P. Olivares was elected as PARI&rsquo;s professional or lifetime president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, singer CelesteLegaspi spearheaded the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM), a pioneering association that seriously pursues the proliferation and propagation of Filipino popular music, as well as the improvement, upliftment, and enhancement of the working conditions of both the performers and those directly involved in the singing field (e.g., talent managers, instrumentalists, production assistants, technical and lighting directors, press members). OPM has produced numerous concerts at major entertainment venues. It has also conducted talent development workshops and has granted scholarship awards to deserving new talents. OPM is currently headed by singer and comedienne MitchValdez. She was preceded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a> who served from 1986 to 1988, and composer JimParedes who was elected in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Society of the Philippines was launched on 16 Mar 2003, aimed as a venture for jazz loving enthusiasts to get together to enjoy, advance and promote jazz music in the Philippines.

Music patronage may come as state, church, private, corporate, or institutional support for composers and musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Spaniards colonized the Philippine Islands in 1565 and under the system of the Patronato Real, Hispanic cultures were assimilated by the natives in a long process that lasted from the late 16th century to the end of the 19th century. The Catholic Church was the principal patron of music during this time, and it was also the best archivist of works and other colonial cultural productions of the period. European music, used principally as a tool for conversion to Christian beliefs and the promotion of the Spanish crown, dominated the people&rsquo;s choice for musical productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the opening of the Philippine ports in 1834 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, new forms of cultural activities emerged in urban areas that were no longer entirely dominated by the Spanish church and state. A number of organizations made up of prominent citizens and <i>ilustrados</i> (educated) bonded to form what could be called an incipient &ldquo;civil society&rdquo; in the cities. Naturally, owing to their Spanish education, they had a very strong bias towards Western music and art. These organizations were Sociedad de Anonima, established in 1862, Sociedad de Artes y Oficios, 1869, Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario, 1877, Union Artistico <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>, 1885, Sociedad Musical Filipina de Santa Cecilia, 1888, Circulo Musical, 1893, and Sociedad Artistico-Literaria de Iloilo. These associations generally had for their aims one or more of the following: (1) to promote and cultivate all kinds of arts, (2) to maintain and protect the interests of the lovers of music, fine arts, and literature, and cultivate aesthetic taste, (3) to protect the common interests of Filipino musicians, (4) to encourage musical education, especially the study of vocal and stringed instruments, and (5) to render literary and musical entertainments, theatrical presentations, and literary and musical contests. These societies sponsored art competitions, produced musical-literary concerts or <i>veladas,</i> and held private <i>tertulias</i> (soirees), which provided a space for music performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But even as private organizations sponsored the arts, the Spanish colonial state and church continued to support musical organizations. In the 19th century, the Spanish Regimental Bands gave weekly concerts at Binondo Plaza and later, at the Luneta. Orchestras were maintained by church authorities in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> and the San Agustin church in Intramuros. A number of Filipino musicians were trained in these prestigious state- and church-endowed organizations. It was this group of elite musicians who then passed on their musical skills and knowledge to less-privileged Filipinos who played in bands for fiestas, religious processions, and <i>komedya</i> in the provinces. These cultural events were organized by the Comite de Festejos and supported by <i>hermanos y hermanas </i>mobilized by local priests and mayors during annual fiestas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American occupation of the Philippines (1898-1940) established a far-reaching public system of education. The secular culture which began to assert itself in the late 19th century intensified in the American period. The American Insular Government sponsored musical groups, most prominent of which was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a>. At this time, the private sector organized and maintained musical societies, sometimes also called music academies because they were offering music lessons. These societies were Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a>tic Club, 1898, Music Academy or El Porvenir, 1900, Centro Artistico, 1901, Centro de Bellas Artes, 1902, Centro de Artistas, 1904, The Philippine Musical Association, 1907, Centro Artistico Literario, 1909, Talia Sociedad Dramatica de Aficionados, 1911, UP Conservatory of Music, 1916, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion Musical de Filipinas</strong></a>, 1919, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4067\"><strong>Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\"><strong>Chamber Music</strong></a> Society</strong></a>, 1921, Circulo Escenico, 1923, Amihan Musical Society, 1927, Choral Art Association, 1930, Iloilo Musical Association, 1930, Manila Music Guild, 1933, National Federation of Music, 1933, Manila Music Lovers&rsquo; Society, 1935, Philippine Society for Chamber Music, 1936, Philippine Cultural Concerts Society, 1935, and Philippine Society of Oriental Culture, 1940. Some members of the Asociacion Musical de Filipinas, specifically the Legardas, became the nucleus of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4070\"><strong>Manila Symphony Society</strong></a> which supported <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> beginning 1926.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in 1941-5, Filipino musicians had to assert their &ldquo;Asian-ness&rdquo; in line with the official ideology of the &ldquo;Greater East-Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.&rdquo; Some of the musical societies during this period were Camia Musical Society, 1943, Free Philippines Cultural Society, The New Philippine Symphony Society, 1942, and the New Philippine Musical Federation, 1943. In 1943, the latter presented a group of Japanese musicians which performed the &ldquo;Grand March of the Free Philippines.&rdquo; Because the Manila Symphony Orchestra did not agree to play for the puppet Philippine government, the Japanese colonizers, with impresario Alfredo Lozano, founded the New Philippine Symphony Orchestra (NPSO). The NPSO presented an all-Filipino music concert at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a> on 29 Nov 1942, with Felipe Padilla de Leon as conductor. De Leon also composed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines) and &ldquo;Dai Atiw ng Kalibapi&rdquo; (Official March of the KALIBAPI) for the Japanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The postwar period was again a time for a rethinking of Filipino values. Foremost among the foundations that emphasized an upliftment of the Filipino musical talent was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a> (MPFP), established through opera singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>&rsquo;s initiative and created through Republic Act No. 1370 that was signed into law on 12 May 1955 by then-President Ramon Magsaysay. In effect, MPFP was the first government-funded organization that promoted the creation and performance of opera, <b>sarsuwela</b>, and symphonic music, and the creation through commissioning of major musical works. While the MPFP sponsored performances of western operas like <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, it did encourage the creation and performance of Filipino music. The MPFP mounted the premiere production and performance of Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Touch Me Not</i></b>), 1957, and, later on, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Subversion), 1970. It commissioned a sarsuwela from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a>, symphonies from Antonino Buenventura and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4153\"><strong>Hilarion Rubio</strong></a>, a violin concerto from Eliseo Pajaro, a concert overture from Vicente Marqueses, and an overture for band from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3914\"><strong>Alfredo Buenaventura</strong></a>. It also funded the activities of the Filipino Youth Orchestra, the Quezon City Philharmonic, and the UP Madrigal Singers. Among the more far-reaching projects the organization started was the radio program <b><i>Musika ng Lahi</i></b> (Music of the Race) that featured music of Filipino composers. The MPFP, together with Eugenia Puyat and her industrialist friends, also supported the productions of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> Foundation of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other societies active during this period were the following: Islanders Choral Society, 1948, The Philippine Artists Union, The National Music Council of the Philippines, 1953, Pambansang Samahan ng mga Banda sa Pilipinas, 1943, and The Manila Opera <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, 1953. By the 1970s, the Marcos regime, through the initiative of the then First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos, the &ldquo;Patroness of the Arts,&rdquo; provided the needed support for some artists and musicians. After the opening of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) in 1969, the following were established as national companies under the CCP, with the necessary and much-needed state support: Philippine High School for the Arts, 1977, CCP Philharmonic Orchestra, 1973 (renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a> in 1982), CCP Dance Company, 1970 (renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> in 1981), UP Madrigal Singers, 1963 (later known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a>), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Dance Company, 1957, and Opera Company of the Philippines, 1983. The Young Artists Foundation of the Philippines was the arm of the Marcos regime that sent many talented young artists abroad to hone their craft under the best teachers and schools. Many of these musicians are now based abroad. Some of the more renowned scholar-musicians that received state support under YAFP were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3874\"><strong>Rowena Arrieta</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3908\"><strong>Jaime Bolipata</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3909\"><strong>Ramon Bolipata</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3946\"><strong>Jovianney Emmanuel Cruz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3975\"><strong>Joseph Esmilla</strong></a>, and Cecil Licad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 1986, the CCP, under Ma. Teresa E. Roxas and Nicanor Tiongson, implemented a five-point thrust that reoriented the institution&rsquo;s previous elitist and colonial outlook into one that was decidedly Filipino, democratic, and decentralized, and was supportive of artistic excellence and the promotion of Filipino artists abroad. Instead of just a venue, CCP from 1986 onto the 1990s became a national coordinating center for arts activities throughout the country, thus providing more grants and support to many Filipino artists and arts groups outside of CCP. With CCP&rsquo;s encouragement, local arts councils were institutionalized and there were vibrant arts and cultural exchanges between Manila and the provinces. CCP&rsquo;s Filipino Artists Series regularly featured notable Filipino musical artists performing classical, popular, and alternative music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, Executive Order (EO) No 118 created the Presidential Commission on Culture and the Arts under President Cory Aquino. The EO was enacted into law in 1992 and, under Republic Act No 7356, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a> was established. In 1999, through EO No 80, the CCP, Commission on Filipino Language, National Museum, National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Institute (now Commission), National Library, and Records Management and Archives Office, together with representatives from government bodies and cultural workers from the private sector, came together to compose the NCCA, the government entity that creates and coordinates national arts policy. The NCCA, through the subcommittees on the arts, cultural heritage, and cultural communities, and with funds from the National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1158\"><strong>Endo</strong></a>wment for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) funded performances, competitions, researches, publications, and maintenance of cultural capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Private corporations also did their share for music patronage. When the Manila Symphony Orchestra, based at the Metropolitan Theatre in Liwasang Bonifacio beginning late 1970s, disbanded in 1989, the string section was absorbed by PCI Bank, which supported what became a fine string orchestra of the period&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\"><strong>Manila Chamber Orchestra</strong></a> under conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"><strong>Sergio Esmilla</strong></a> Jr. This orchestra had concert seasons in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> Hall until 1992. Between 2001 and 2007, San Miguel Corporation established and managed the San Miguel Foundation for the Performing Arts. Its cultural groups, the San Miguel Master Chorale and San Miguel Philharmonic Orchestra, were among the best performing groups of the time. During its short but productive existence, the SMFPA released several albums, gave member-musicians a much-needed financial boost, and hired one of the country&rsquo;s renowned musicians, Cipriano &ldquo;Ryan&rdquo; Cayabyab, as resident musical director as well as composer and arranger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, outside of formal institutional patronage, different forms of grassroots communities self-support the production of various types of music that are expressive of subcultural identities and are catalysts for group bonding and affinity. These communities feed on nonmainstream music such as indie, alternative, underground, rock, sound art, jazz, hip-hop, that are heard in clubs like Conspiracy, a songwriters&rsquo; hub; My Bro&rsquo;s Mustache in Timog and Balete in Kamias for acoustic guitar; Saguijo, Route 196, and 70s Bistro for rock; and Monk&rsquo;s Inn for jazz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this regard, choirs in local churches all over the Philippines share a similar position. Churches do not employ them and thus choirs can be considered private, voluntary associations. However, they are given a space in the church premises to rehearse their songs, and this is already a form of support. In exchange, choirs sing for the churches&rsquo; services. Lastly, nongovernment foundations are also a source of support for music. Some are attached to <b>music schools</b> like the PREDIS Chamber Orchestra program of St Scholastica&rsquo;s College, which trains young children in string music; the Piano Teachers Guild of the Philippines made up of piano teachers from UP and UST who have organized piano recitals and competitions; and the Music Research Foundation (MUSARFOUND) of the UP College of Music, which provides tuition scholarship and funds for music research and creative works. Another foundation of note is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a> Sr Music Foundation, Inc, which has been supporting talented musicians. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\"><strong>Cecile Licad</strong></a>, being a renowned member of the Buencamino clan, holds regular concerts in the Philippines to partially fund the scholars.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Raul C.

As a scholarly discipline in the university, musicology did not exist in the Philippines before 1950, although inquiries into the subject of Philippine music had begun much earlier, as seen in the works of intellectuals like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\"><strong>Fernando Canon</strong></a>, Epifanio de los Santos, Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as, Norberto Romualdez, and Alfredo Roa. There is much material prior to 1950 which may not be technically &ldquo;musicological&rdquo; or &ldquo;ethnomusicological&rdquo; but is of great value to the music scholar and historian. The material includes accounts in journals, magazines, newspapers, monographs, books, and related studies written mostly by anthropologists, linguists, folklorists, and cultural historians. Information can also be gleaned from the writings of early explorers, travelers, missionaries, and civil servants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"spanish\" name=\"spanish\"></a>The Spanish Colonial Period (1500-1900)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The principal sources of information on music of this period are the historical chronicles and travelogues by Spanish friars or government officials. Although dealing primarily with military conquest, government, administration, or Christian conversion, the vast assortment of documents, including letters, maps, statistics, narrations, and descriptions, occasionally mention music.

The remark was echoed by many other writers such as Franciscan Juan de Medina, who wrote in 1630 that there were very good singers in Manila, and Fray Francisco de Santa Ines, who wrote in 1676 that there were types of music in the Philippines that could rival those of the cathedrals in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around 1750, Fray Juan J.

After 1750, much more published material&mdash;compilations of historical documents by religious, military, and civil servants, and a growing number of travelogues&mdash;described local musical practices. Captain Thomas Forrest&rsquo;s <b><i>A Voyage to New Guinea and the Moluccas</i></b>, 1779, mentioned gongs with knobs from Java called <b>kallintang</b>, as well as gongs without knobs from China. He included the text, with translation, of a leader-chorus type of rowing song called &ldquo;Maguindanao Mangaio.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fr Joaquin Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga&rsquo;s <b><i>Mis Viajes por este Pais en 1800 </i></b>(My Voyages in this Country in 1800), 1893, contained descriptions of songs, dances, and literary works of Lipa, Batangas, and church choirs in Manila singing &ldquo;Kyrie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Credo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo; He also described Filipinos as fast learners in any art form. Furthermore, Fr Martinez described the <b>kundiman</b> as a song-dance genre&mdash;it only became a &ldquo;mere&rdquo; song about love in the late 19th-early 20th century. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> as a song-dance genre was confirmed in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3633\"><strong>Jose Honorato Lozano</strong></a>&rsquo;s drawing, supplemented by prose description and transcription, which appeared in Gervasio Gironella&rsquo;s illuminated manuscript titled <b><i>Album: Vistas de las Yslas Filipinas y Trages de sus Abitantes </i></b>(Album: Views of the Philippine Islands and the Clothing of their Inhabitants), 1847.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his account of a <b><i>Voyage to Peking and Manila Between the Years 1784-1801</i></b>,<i> </i>M. de Guignes described balls in Manila where fandango, bolero, and minuet were danced.

Stewart, 1831; Abbey Jane Morrell, 1829-1833; Sir Edward Belcher, 1848; Frank S. Marryat, 1848; George Windsor Earl, 1853; Paul Proust de la Gironiere, 1854; Karl Scherzer, 1857-9; Henry T. Ellis, 1859; John Bowring, 1859; and Feodor Jagor, 1873. The descriptions of music showed how quickly Filipinos assimilated Spanish customs and practices. The educated urban upper class sang Andalucian songs and danced Spanish dances. Ellis wrote that the harp was &ldquo;the instrument of the country.&rdquo; Jagor described instruments such as the bamboo zither, <b>baringbau</b>,<b> </b>and bamboo mouth harp as similar to those of the Mintras of the Malay peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many other travelogues were published in Spanish. Some were in French. M.G.L. De Rienzi and Gabriel Lafond, in 1836 and 1844, respectively, both wrote of the Filipino&rsquo;s love for music and their assimilation of European musical forms. Francisco Michelina y Rojas in 1843 described the elegant balls held in Manila homes. Jean Baptiste Mallat in 1846 described the <b>corrido</b>,<b> comintang de la conquista</b>,<b> sinanpablo</b>,<b> batangue&ntilde;o</b>,<b> </b>and <b>cavitegan</b>.<b> </b>He mentioned the <b>viguela </b>(guitar with many strings) as a favorite instrument, the bandolon, and a large <b>bajo de viguela</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jean de Man in 1875 described Manila theaters and mentioned the visit of an Italian opera troupe. Joseph Earle Stevens in 1909 described in more detail musical life in Manila and nearby environs in 1893-6. Francisco Ca&ntilde;amaque in 1877 echoed the much repeated observation of the Filipinos&rsquo; talent for assimilation. Other travellers who went further north or south briefly described indigenous music there. Manuel Scheidnagel in 1878 had terse descriptions of the <b>gansa </b>(flat gong), <b>sulibao </b>(cone-shaped drum), and <b>paggong </b>(three-holed flute) of northern Luzon. Joseph Montano in 1886, who travelled in 1879, described a quartet of ophicleide, guitar, and two flutes in connection with rice planting in Abucay, and the agun,<b> </b>kulintang,<b> </b>and various dances in the south. Juan Alvarez Guerra&rsquo;s <b><i>De Manila a Tayabas </i></b>(From Manila to Tayabas), 1878, and Manuel Sastron&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipinas</i></b>,<b><i> Peque&ntilde;os Estudios de Batangas </i></b>(Philippines, Short Studies on Batangas), 1895, described the <b>kumintang</b>.<b> </b>However, Pedro Paterno went into more detail in <b><i>El Individuo Tagalo y Su Arte </i></b>(The Tagalog and his Art), 1893. He defined the kumintang, which originated from Balayan, Batangas, as an old type of melody with rhythms appropriate for Tagalog poetry, compared the kumintang of old with the &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; and included the text of a kumintang. Paterno called the kundiman<b> </b>the Filipino love song and also included a sample text, and described the balitaw as a national dance. The descriptive essay also mentioned the harp as well as older instruments such as the bamboo nose flutes and bamboo zithers. Paterno published a music transcription of these genres, along with an original composition by his sister Dolores, in a collection titled <b><i>Musica de la Antigua Civilicacion Filipina</i></b> published in Madrid, 1887.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last quarter of the 1800s saw accounts of customs and traditions more specialized than the earlier travelogues. Alexander Schadenberg travelled in southern Mindanao and northern Luzon. In <b><i>Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie</i></b><i> </i>(Yearbook for Ethnology), 1885-7, he described <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Tinguian, and Guianen musical instruments and their uses, citing the Bagobo agun (gong), <b>plandong </b>(flute), <b>zuglum </b>(two-stringed boat lute), and <b>togo </b>(bamboo zithers). He also described the Tinguian nose flute, <b>boleton </b>(bamboo zither), <b>dedeco</b> (bamboo panpipes), and <b>buncacan </b>(bamboo buzzer). In his 1887<i> <b>Zeitschrift</b></i>, he described the instruments of the Guianen (Kalinga)&mdash;panpipes, bamboo zither, bamboo buzzer, nose flute, and bronze mouth harp&mdash;likening them to the Tinguian&rsquo;s. His ethnographic collections were presented to the Rijks Ethnographisch Museum in Leyden, the Staatliches Museum f&uuml;r V&ouml;lkerkunde, Vienna, and the Dresden Staatliches Museum f&uuml;r Tierkunde und V&ouml;lkerkunde.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Similar studies included those by Francisco Villa, 1882; Jose Maria Ruiz, 1887; Buenaventura Campa, 1894; Enrique Polo de Lara, 1897; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4633\"><strong>Ramon Reyes</strong></a> Lala, 1898.

He continued his research in the 1960s and 1970s, with modest financial support from the University Social Science Research Center, National Science Research Council, and the Council for Living Traditions. From 1985 to 1989, the Ford Foundation supported continuing research, including field work and laboratory work. The UP now has the largest and most representative scientific collection of Philippine music and the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia.

The 20-page annotations contained ethnological descriptions of the Hanunuo, including occasions for use of music, detailed descriptions of the instruments, different types of vocal forms, as well as music analysis of each band in the recording, with some music transcriptions. A subsequent issue by Ethnic Folkways Library in 1957 titled Music of the World&rsquo;s Peoples culled samples from the Music of the Hanunuo with notes by Henry Cowell. The two-record album <b><i>Music of the Maguindanao</i></b> was issued in 1961 by Folkways Ethnic Library with annotations and recordings by Jose Maceda. The first record contained instrumental music. Rhythmic modes of the gong ensemble were discussed and amply illustrated with recordings of both the ensemble and individual instruments.

Part of this series is four monographs and videos on history of Philippine music and on the indigenous, Spanish, and American colonial and contemporary traditions in Philippine music. The CCP also pioneered in producing three popular sarsuwela<b> </b>in cassette tape format with one tape featuring a sarsuwela with voice and orchestra, and the other an orchestra minus-one for groups interested in putting up the sarsuwela.

UP College of Music continued to lead in research outputs. In 1998, Jos&eacute; Maceda with assistant Marialita Yraola, published the landmark book that summarized their organological survey of indigenous musical instruments begun four decades ago: <b><i>Gongs &amp; Bamboo: A Panorama of Philippine Music Instruments</i></b>. This came out a year after the UP Center for Ethnomusicology of the UP College of Music became separate from the Department of Music Research (presently called the Department of Musicology), to become an archive and research center. After Maceda&rsquo;s death in 2004, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a> became director of the UP Center for Ethnomusicology. In 2005, Santos published a collection of his essays in a book <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1046\"><strong>Tunugan: Four Essays on Filipino Music</strong></a></i></b>, which dealt with the modernism of Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s music, the orality of <b>bad&rsquo;w</b> and Maranao vocal music, and the history of the UP Conservatory of Music. The work is exemplary for its analytical and music critical approach. This was followed by another book on the transmission of music tradition, <b><i>Laon-Laon: Perspectives in Transmission and Pedagogy of Musical Traditions in Post-Colonial Southeast Asia</i></b>, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Helen F. Samson wrote a dissertation in Cologne Germany and published this as <b><i>Die Zeitgen&ouml;ssische Kunstmusik Der Philippinen Im Spannungsfeld Zwischen Nationalem Erbe Und Europ&auml;ischem Einflus</i></b>, 1989. Samson also wrote the <b><i>Contemporary Filipino Composers</i></b>, 1976, and <b><i>The Bamboo Organ of Las Pi&ntilde;as</i></b>, originally published in 1977, but revised and updated in 2006. Elena Rivera Mirano, working on her 1991 PhD dissertation in Philippine studies, published a structural analysis of <b><i>Ang Mga Tradisyonal na Musikang Pantinig sa Lumang Bauan, Batangas</i></b> (The Vocal Music Traditions of Old Bauan, Batangas),<b> </b>1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">General survey-type essays on Philippine music continued to be written during the period. Jose Maceda updated his article on Philippine music in the second edition of the <b><i>The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i></b>, 2001. In this reference material, a new entry on the Spanish colonial music of Manila by historian William Summers appeared. Jose Maceda, Corazon Dioquino, and Ramon Santos later contributed essays in <b><i>The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music</i></b>, 1998. Dioquino also edited an anthology of articles published by the National Research Council of the Philippines, <b><i>Compendium of the Humanities of the Philippines: Musical Arts</i></b>. Meanwhile, the UP Center for Ethnomusicology revived Jose Maceda&rsquo;s <b><i>Musika Jornal</i></b> which contained essays on different topics since 2008. The Center, with editor Ramon Santos, also came up with a <b><i>Dictionary of Filipino Music Terms</i></b>, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The masteral research programs in musicology and music education of the UP College of Music produced theses, some of which for the masteral degree in music, concentrating in music education: Edna Aurora C. Culig, &ldquo;The Philippine Bandurria: A Study on its Educational and Artistic Possibilities&rdquo;; Evelyn P. Flores, &ldquo;Maranao Songs as Teaching Materials in Music&rdquo;; and Jocelyn T.

The Musicological Society of the Philippines came at a time when graduates of the UP College of Music who earned doctoral degrees in music, mostly in the United States, came home to teach in the country. Jose Buenconsejo inaugurated a type of music research that was wholly contextual, interpreting the meaning of the Agusan Manobo ritual song <b>tud-om</b> against the background of mythology and political economy in <b><i>Songs and Gifts At the Frontier: Person and Exchange in the Agusan Manobo Possession Ritual, Philippines</i></b>, 2002. LaVerne De la Pe&ntilde;a, previously active in composition, wrote an ethnomusicological work &ldquo;Traversing Boundaries: A Situated Music Approach to the Study of Day-Eng Performance Among the Kankana-Ey of Northern Philippines,&rdquo; 2000. Mary Arlene Pe Chongson, who, like de la Pe&ntilde;a was in composition before crossing to ethnomusicology, wrote &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></a> and Holy Week: A Study of Music, Acculturation, and Local Catholicism in the Philippines&rdquo; for the University of Texas at Austin, 2000. A student of Jose Maceda, Racquel Berdon-Georsua, finished her doctorate in Australian on ritual music titled &ldquo;Where Heaven and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a> Meet: The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/47\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/125\"><strong>Buklog</strong></a></strong></a> of the Subanen in Zamboanga Peninsula, Western Mindanao, the Philippines&rdquo; (University of Melbourne), 2004, and thereafter taught at Cebu Normal University. Then a year after, Kristina Benitez finished her dissertation on &ldquo;The Maguindanaon Kulintang: Musical Innovation, Transformation and the Concept of Binalig,&rdquo; 2005, and returned home to teach at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU). Benitez later established a PhD in ethnomusicology program at PWU<i>.</i> Another graduate of the musicology program from UP College of Music was Pamela Grace Costes who finished her PhD with a work on translocal Philippine music, &ldquo;Tunog Pil-Am: Creating and Reinventing the Sound of the Filipino Natives of America,&rdquo; University of Washington at Seattle, 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other alumni of the UP College of Music also finished their doctoral degrees in the previous decade. They researched on aspects of Philippine music that deal with music repertory and style analysis. In 1992, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a> wrote a PhD dissertation for the faculty of the School of Education, Health, Nursing and Arts Professions in New York University titled &ldquo;Selected Philippine Piano Concerti: A Performance Guide.&rdquo; For his doctor of musical arts (DMA) degree in choral conducting, Joel M. Navarro wrote &ldquo;A Style Study of Selected Choral Works of Ramon Pagayon Santos,&rdquo; 2006. Then in 2010, Abelardo Galang wrote &ldquo;The Development of Philippine Piano Literature&rdquo; for the Technical University in Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside of the UP College of Music, many contributed to music research as well. Arsenio Nicolas Jr wrote &ldquo;Musical Exchange in Early Southeast Asia: The Philippines and Indonesia, Ca. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> to 1600 Ce&rdquo; for his PhD degree at Cornell University, 2007. A number of articles published in international journals came out of this work. Nicolas finished a master&rsquo;s degree at the UP Asian Center, which was also where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4102\"><strong>Grace Nono</strong></a> studied. She turned her master&rsquo;s thesis into a book on the orality of Philippine traditional song titled <b><i>The Shared Voice: Chanted and Spoken Narratives From the Philippines</i></b>, 2008. Grace Nono continued her interest in orality and extended this into the realm of indigenous spirituality in <b><i>Song of the Babaylan: Living Voices, Medicines, Spiritualities of Philippine Ritualist- Oralist-Healers</i></b>, 2013. In 2014, she finished her PhD at New York University with a dissertation titled &ldquo;Babaylan Sing Back: Philippine Shamans on Voice, Gender, and Transnationalism.&rdquo; Another UP alumna who did music research was Fredeliza Z. Campos of the UP Archeological Studies Program who wrote &ldquo;A Study of the Musical Instruments of Ifugao in the Cordillera Region, Northern Philippines&rdquo; for her master in philosophy degree at the University of Hong Kong, 2012. And from the theater program at the UP College of Arts and Letters, meL&ecirc; Yamomo wrote &ldquo;Sounding Modernities: Music and Theatre in Manila and the Asia Pacific, 1869-1948&rdquo; for the Ludwig Maximilians Universit&auml;t-M&uuml;nchen in Munich, Germany, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As there was not yet a doctoral program in music at the UP College of Music in the early 2000s, a number of its faculty went to the tri-college Philippine Studies program in UP and earned their degrees in Philippine studies, albeit still writing on Philippine music. The first to finish from the UP College of Music was Raul C. Navarro who crafted a dissertation in Filipino, <b><i>Kolonyal Na Patakaran At Ang Nagbabagong Kamalayang Filipino: Musika Sa Publikong Paaralan Sa Pilipinas, 1898-1935 </i></b>(Colonial Policy and the Changing Mindset of the Filipino: Music in Philippine Public Schools, 1898-1935), 2007. He followed this up with another book in Filipino, <b><i>Musika At Bagong Lipunan: Pagbuo Ng Lipunang Filipino, 1972-1986 </i></b>(Music and the New Society: The Creation of the Filipino Society, 1972-1986), 2014. After Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a> in the PhD Philippine Studies, College of Social Science and Philosophy, wrote &ldquo;Modes of Appropriation in Philippine Indigenous Music: The Politics of the Production of Cultural Difference,&rdquo; 2004. He was followed by Christine Muyco who wrote a dissertation &ldquo;Sibod in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/44\"><strong>Binanog</strong></a>: Understanding of the Binanog Tradition of the Panay Bukidnon (Philippines),&rdquo; 2008. Lastly, for the Philippine Studies in UP Asian Center, Michiyo Yoneno-Reyes finished her PhD with &ldquo;Unsettling &lsquo;Salidummay&rsquo;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nA Historico-ethnography of a Music Category,&rdquo; 2010. Music scholars of this decade actively disseminated their papers in conferences organized by local academic societies such as the Philippine National Historical Society, Bagong Kasaysayan, UGAT (Anthropological Association of the Philippines), and the Arts Studies Association and by international societies like International Conference of Philippine Studies, International Conference in Philippine Linguistics, International Council for Traditional Music, and the Performing Arts of Southeast Asia Study Group. Consequently, these papers resulted in conference proceedings and publications in local and international journals like <b><i>Musika Jornal</i></b>, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, <b><i>Journal of Asian Studies</i></b>, <b><i>Daluyan</i></b>, <b><i>Budhi</i></b>, <b><i>Saliksik</i></b> (of Bagong Kasaysayan), <b><i>Plaridel</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Journal for the Arts, Culture, and the Humanities</i></b> (UST), <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, and <b><i>Kritika</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2011, the UP College of Music organized an international conference on the theme &ldquo;The Impact of Music in Shaping Southeast Asian Societies&rdquo; where topics on music in Philippine popular cultures were represented. These were Laverne de la Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verse versus Verse: the Articulation of Changing Filipino Sensibilities in the Performance of the Repartee of Day-eng, Awit, and Pinoy Rap,&rdquo; Michiyo Yoneno-Reyes&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Movie Songs and the Salidummay in the Northern Luzon Highlands,&rdquo; meL&ecirc; Yamomo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Global Currents, Musical Streams: the Musical Trade Route between Europe and Manila in Early Globalization,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

The majority of these were Americans like Stephen Grauberger who wrote a master&rsquo;s thesis on &ldquo;Diatonic Harp of the Philippines: An Historical Overview and an Organological Comparison of the Cebuano-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a>n Harp&rdquo; for the University of Hawaii Manoa, 1994. This was followed by David Joseph Kendall&rsquo;s PhD dissertation on &ldquo;Spanish Colonial Liturgical Music in the Philippines: Inventing a Tradition,&rdquo; 2010, and Neal D. Matherne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Naming the Artist, Composing the Philippines: Listening for the Nation in the National Artist Award,&rdquo; 2014. Both were from the University of California Riverside. Filipino-Americans at UCLA such as Christi-Anne Castro and Mary Talusan wrote about Philippine music, the former writing a cultural history dissertation that became the book <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1040\"><strong>Musical Renderings of the Philippine Nation</strong></a></i></b>, 2011, while the latter dealt with &ldquo;Cultural Localization and Transnational Flows: Music in the Magindanaon Communities of the Philippines,&rdquo; 2005. Almost a decade later, another Filipino-American named Marilyne Antonette Adiova researched on the &ldquo;Music, Dance, and Negotiations of Identity in the Religious Festivals of Bicol, Philippines,&rdquo; 2014, for her PhD dissertation at the University of Michigan. And in 2015, another Fil-Am, Bernard Ellorin completed his dissertation on the &ldquo;Trans-cultural commodities: the Sama-Bajau Pan Musical Industries and Identities on the Peripheries of Maritime Southeast Asia,&rdquo; University of Hawaii, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Non-American researchers include Japanese Yoshitaka Terada who worked on Maranaon kulintang; Australian Manolote Mora who did years of fieldwork in Mindanao and who came up with an outstanding book <b><i>Myth, Mimesis and Magic in the Music of the T&rsquo;Boli, Philippines</i></b>, 2008; David RM Irving who engaged intensively with written records to produce <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1027\"><strong>Colonial Counterpoint: Music in Early Modern Manila</strong></a></i></b>, 2010; and South African Lee William Watkins who interviewed Filipino musicians and wrote &ldquo;Minstrelsy in the Margin Re-Covering the Memories and Lives of Filipino Musicians in Hong Kong&rdquo; for the University of Hong Kong. This work on Filipino popular culture is similar to Malaysian Stephanie Sooklynn Ng&rsquo;s dissertation &ldquo;Filipino Bands Performing in Hotels, Clubs and Restaurants in Asia: Purveyors of Transnational Culture in a Global Arena,&rdquo; submitted to the University of Michigan in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade 2000 was indeed very productive. New topics in Philippine musicology and new theoretical approaches such as ethnographic/cultural history, analysis and music criticism, and popular music culture came to the fore. Top among these researches was the subfield of historical musicology, which is characterized by archival research methods that interpret social meanings in music manuscripts and prints. Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo Chua transformed her UP master&rsquo;s thesis in musicology into a book that decoded early 19th century archaic liturgical music notation, <b><i>Kirial De Baclayon, A&ntilde;o 1826: Hispanic Sacred Music in 19th Century Bohol, Philippines</i></b>, 2010. She was inspired by the works of music historian William Summers, who published findings in the local journal <b><i>Budhi: A Journal of Ideas and Culture</i></b><i> </i>titled &ldquo;Listening for Historic Manila: Music and Rejoicing in an International City&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rediscovering the Hidden Muses of Bohol: Filipino Music Maestri From Corella Church, Bohol.&rdquo; Within this circle of historical musicologists, David Irving also contributed new knowledge about music in Manila from the 17th to 18th centuries, such as his essay on the &ldquo;Historical and Literary Vestiges of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/799\"><strong>Villancico</strong></a> in the Early Modern Philippines&rdquo; that appeared in the book <b><i>Devotional Music in the Iberian World, 1450-1800</i></b>, 2007. Irving also wrote &ldquo;Keyboard Instruments and Instrumentalists in Manila&rdquo; in <b><i>Anuario Musical</i></b> <b><i>60</i></b>, 2005, and &ldquo;Musical Politics of Empire: The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a> in Eighteen-Century Manila&rdquo; in <b><i>Early Music</i></b>, 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Interest in historical musicology also influenced local scholars, notably Elena Rivera Mirano, who wrote <b><i>The Life and Works of Marcelo Adonay</i></b>, 2009. On a separate stream, Antonio C Hila who was primarily trained as a historian, published his essays in<b><i> Music in History, History in Music</i></b>, 2004. This book encompassed the broad field of history and criticism. From the UP College of Arts and Letters, Juliet Bien wrote a master&rsquo;s thesis titled &ldquo;The Invencion of Calabanga, Camrines Sur: The Dynamics of Family, Land, and Power,&rdquo; 2009 and, for the same degree, Patricia Lopez wrote &ldquo;Expressions of Devotion: The Flores de Mayo in Poblacion, Oslob,&rdquo; 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Independent initiatives in Philippine music research were also a new feature of this period. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\"><strong>Richie Quirino</strong></a> compiled sources to write anecdotal books on the history of jazz in the Philippines. Robert L. Yoder wrote the history of the famed early 20th century Philippine Constabulary,<b> <i>In Performance: Walter Howard Loving and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a></i></b>, 2013. In addition, the period also saw the flowering of biographies, many of which were hagiographies being self-published or commissioned like <b><i>de la Torre</i></b>, 1985; <b><i>Lucresia Kasilag</i></b>, 2000; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea Veneracion</strong></a></i></b>, 2001; <b><i>Antonino Buenaventura</i></b>, 2004; <b><i>Angel Pe&ntilde;a</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a></i></b>, 2008; and <b><i>Salido</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Juan de Sahagun Hernandez</i></b>, 2010. While a critical researcher would naturally be aware of the partiality of these works, these biographies are, nonetheless, important source materials for doing a more systematic research on acculturated Philippine music traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the upsurge in research about Philippine music history, the field of ethnomusicology was not neglected because there were indeed works that were ethnomusicological, yet still in keeping with the 1990s pre-occupation with reflexivity and intersubjectivity. Ricardo D. Trimillos wrote &ldquo;Agency and Voice: The Philippines at the 1998 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.&rdquo; This appeared in the book <b><i>Music and Cultural Rights</i></b>, 2009. He also touched upon politics in the article &ldquo;Histories, Resistances, and Reconciliations in a Decolonizable Space: The Philippine Delegation to the 1998 Smithsonian Folklife Festival,&rdquo; which was published in <b><i>The Journal of American Folklore</i></b>, 2008. French anthropological linguist Nicole Revel re-issued her 1980 recordings in a CD with informative notes titled <b><i>Philippines Musique Des Hautes-Terres Palawan</i></b>, 1992, which had music descriptions by Jose Maceda. Revel also continued her work on epics and produced an analysis of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5502\"><strong>Masinu</strong></a>&rsquo;s epic <b><i>The Quest for a Wife: A Palawan Epic</i></b>, 2000, and, with Harry Nimmo and Alain Martenot, wrote the <b><i>Silungan Baltapa: Le Voyage Au Ciel D&rsquo;Un H&eacute;ros Sama</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Voyage to Heaven of a Sama Hero</i></b>), 2005. Her project <b><i>Literature of Voice: Epics in the Philippines</i></b>, 2005, is particularly important because it is a fruit of an honest collaboration with indigenous artists, in particular with the Saway family of Bukidnon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from Trimillos and Revel, other foreign scholars published Philippine music research. Like Revel&rsquo;s aforementioned book, these were in collaboration with local scholars such as Matthew C. M. Santamaria whose essay was included in Alain Martenot, Birgit Abels, Hanafi Hussin&rsquo;s <b><i>Oceans of Sound: Sama Dilaut Performing Arts, Dedicated to Alain Martenot (1946-2010)</i></b>, 2012. Another scholar was Glenn Stallsmith of Summer Institute of Linguistics who worked in the Cordillera in Luzon, whose essay was included in Brigit Abels&rsquo; monography titled <b><i>Austronesian Soundscapes: Performing Arts in Oceania and Southeast Asia</i></b>, 2011. Michiyo Yoneno-Reyes continued to deal with popular culture and wrote the essay &ldquo;Under Attack: Mass Media Technology and Indigenous Musical Practices in the Philippines,&rdquo; which appeared in <b><i>Global Goes Local: Popular Culture in Asia,</i></b> edited by Timothy J. Craig, and Richard King, 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period covering music research from 1992 to the present would not be complete without mentioning Craig A. Lockard&rsquo;s essay on Philippine protest songs, which was a chapter in his book <b><i>Dance of Life: Popular Music and Politics in Southeast Asia</i></b>, 1998, and Teresita G. Maceda&rsquo;s book <b><i>Mga Tinig Mula Sa Ibaba: Kasaysayan Ng Partido Komunista Ng Pilipinas At Sosialistang Partido Ng Pilipinas Sa Awit, 1930-1955 </i></b>(Voices from the Grassroots: The History of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party of the Philippines in Song, 1930-1955),<b><i> </i></b>1996, which was about underground political songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not too many books have been published on popular contemporary forms, so Richie Quirino&rsquo;s three-volume work on Filipino jazz traditions is truly pioneering and seminal. These include <b><i>Pinoy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Tradition</i></b>s, 2004, covering the history of jazz in the Philippines from 1898 to the 1960s; <b><i>Mabuhay Jazz: Jazz in Postwar Philippines</i></b>, 2008, recounting jazz history from the 1950s to the 1970s; and <b><i>Contemporary Jazz in the Philippines: 1970 to the Year 2010</i></b>, 2011, focusing on jazz during martial law up to the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musicological and ethnomusicological scholarship in the Philippines has a long history. Still, many fields of study remain to be explored. Studies have just begun to tap into the vast wealth of the Filipino musical heritage. There is a need for more extensive collection and preservation of music, especially in the contexts of change and acculturation that are inevitable. Informed by recent perspectives in postcolonial studies and performance theory, documentations of Philippine music should not be limited to understanding why traditions endure or are &ldquo;re-invented,&rdquo; but also how they respond specifically to modernities that result in cultural hybridities. It is also equally urgent to organize collected material so that it is available for further study. More text translations and music transcriptions are needed so that collected material can be properly evaluated. But, in addition to such organizing and collecting, these materials need to be understood as responses to particular historical moments. Only then can the fundamental structures of music in the Philippines, and the relationships between music and society be properly described.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Corazon C.

They are paid fees for services rendered in a given musical setting, whether it be in the movie industry to play the film score of the composer or arranger; in a television or radio broadcast, either pre-recorded or live; in theater, whether it be opera, musical revue, stage play, or Broadway hit; in chamber or orchestral performances; or in recording studio sessions working for record companies or commercial advertisement agencies. A session musician specializes in one or more styles of playing, depending on his or her skills and training. The more styles a musician can do, the more gigs the musician can play in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest Filipino session musicians were those who played in secular public concerts organized by the Union Artistico <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>, an umbrella organization of orchestral instrumentalists founded by Manuel Garrido and Carlos Saco del Valle on 16 Apr 1885 in the house of Pedro Gruet in Sampaloc. It would seem that even at that time, Filipino session musicians were hired not only in the Philippines but as far as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a>. As early as 1878-9, Jean Remusat visited Manila to recruit Filipino musicians to join the Shanghai Public Band, the predecessor of the 1881 Shanghai Municipal Orchestra. Another group of 19 musicians were recruited in 1881 by Spanish Melchior Vela to work in the same city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American colonial period, session musicians were kept busy in <i>bodabil</i> shows of the 1920s and 1930s. Their names, however, were forgotten because attention was on the stars of the shows such as the Cebuano-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\"><strong>Lou Borromeo</strong></a>, Hispanic Enrique Davila and wife Consuelo, and Filipino-Americans &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo; Reantaso and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\"><strong>Santiago Suarez</strong></a> who both toured America. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> can only surmise that these session musicians were only employed to make the entertainment scene more dynamic and diverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila in the 1920s continued to be linked to other capitals of the world, particularly to Shanghai, China, the &ldquo;Paris of the East,&rdquo; whose nightlife was vibrant until the 1940s. This bustling community, like many other cities, demanded live entertainment such as that provided by dance bands, but the locals had no background and exposure to Western music. To fill the need Filipinos who had been trained in Western music were hired. Among these imports were Ramon Baclay, Mike Vilela, Ponching Garcia, and Vic Tulio, who were identified as Filipino session musicians by the British national Nick Demuth, a pianist-arranger in Shanghai before 1949. In the early 1930s, the Dila Brothers, notably Apolo and Toots who both played the trumpet, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> and Fany who played the tenor sax and alto sax, respectively, and the youngest in the brood, drummer Romy, also worked as session musicians in Shanghai. This family of talented musicians, who were proficient sight readers and were always in demand for studio recordings, live radio broadcasts, and film scores, called themselves the Shanghai Swing Masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Session musicians were often employed by composer-arrangers who had the knack of picking the right musician for the designated job. One such luminary was Federico Elizalde, a Spanish-American mestizo, who was considered a Philippine jazz icon despite not having a drop of native blood in him. Unknown to Filipinos of the pre-World War II era, the brothers Federico and Manolo were already into making music in the United States where they had been sent for schooling. Federico was a guiding light in the development of jazz from the 1930s up to the early 1970s. He organized a string orchestra featuring solo clarinetist Nemesio Regalado and had a regular weekly radio program at DZPI called <b><i>Family Hour</i></b>. Federico employed a handful of session musicians from the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me such as guitarist-bassist Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a, trumpeters Apolo and Toots Dila, Vestre Roxas, and pianist and elder brother of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\"><strong>Nick Joaquin</strong></a>, Ping Joaquin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the 1930s, the Swing Era or Big Band Era was big business. This new type of jazz that swept America and the rest of the world was highly commercialized and danceable and enjoyed tremendous popularity in the Philippines. The band leaders-arrangers who made a name for themselves and employed numerous session musicians were the following: Pete Aristorenas, a superb saxophone player and bandleader who for many years played overseas; Iggy de Guzman, whose orchestra performed at the EM club in Clark Field Air Base in Pampanga; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong></a>, who became the staff arranger of Federico Elizalde&rsquo;s weekly Radio program; Tirso Cruz Sr, whose Mabuhay Orchestra performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>&rsquo;s Fiesta Pavilion; Serafin Payawal, whose orchestra performed at the Sky Room of the Jai-Alai; Tino Gatchalian, whose big band played at a classy cabaret called the International Ballroom located at Grace Park in Caloocan; and Maximo Isla, who headed the house band of the Sta. Ana Cabaret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the Manila Hotel, Tirso Cruz Sr, like Duke Ellington, handpicked the best instrumentalists based on their respective styles to suit the tailor-cut repertoire. After 1945, at the Manila Hotel&rsquo;s Fiesta Pavilion and later at the Winter Garden, the familiar names that surrounded Cruz were the Dila brothers on trumpets; Simeon de Luna on the clarinet; Avelino Cortez on first alto sax; Tomeng Gonzaga on second alto sax; Romy Pascasio on second tenor sax; Epitanio Ilustre on baritone sax; Fred Azteca on lead trumpet; Charlie Reyes on second trumpet; Elpidio Ebron on trombone; Ben Conti on piano; Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a on guitar and as an arranger; Cristino &ldquo;Tinoy&rdquo; Umali Sr on bass; Cesar Cruz on drums; and Rebecca Gonzales on vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bassist Johnny Gosalvez worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\"><strong>Ariston Avelino</strong></a>, an arranger, for Bataan Records label. It was during these years that the commercial record industry started. Bataan Records, under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\"><strong>Cecil Lloyd</strong></a>, the so-called &ldquo;mystery singer,&rdquo; was established due to a growing demand for homegrown talents who were already popular among the masses. The live club performance circuit as well as the live radio broadcasts widened the scope and audiences of these seasoned artists, which were good enough reasons for them to be recorded. Some of the artists under the Bataan Records stable were Cecil Lloyd who was of African-American descent; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a> Katy de la Cruz; Esen &ldquo;Priscilla the Kolynos Girl&rdquo; Aristorenas; Baby Jane; Viring; Serafin Garcia; Ray Alinsod and his orchestra; Carlos <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r and his Rhumbandidos; Tirso Cruz Sr and his Riviera Orchestra; and Ariston Avelino and his band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The time was indeed ripe to record these entertainers and make their music available on vinyl discs for mass distribution even to the farthest provinces. Bataan Records&rsquo; main office was located along Raon Street in Quiapo, Manila. Raon Street was the hub of the commercial music industry scene where music retail stores mushroomed and musical instruments of various brands, scores of music and records, were selling like hotcakes. Much of Bataan Records&rsquo; stock was available on consignment in other Manila outlets such as L.R. Villar along Escolta, Cajapin Radio Service and Supply along Carriedo, and the Manila Supply <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, also situated in Raon. Provincial dealers reached as far as Quezon and Pampanga and in the Visayas, Iloilo, Bacolod, and Cebu. Other record labels followed such as MBC (Manila Broadcasting Corporation) Records of Federico Elizalde, which released in 1951 the Christmas Medley arranged by Restie Umali and sung by Esen &ldquo;Priscilla&rdquo; Aristorenas, with Elizalde conducting the Manila Little Symphony. The Presto Label, which released <b><i>Prelude to a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a></i></b>, featuring the Pete Aristorenas Orchestra, was also very much in demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1951, the Philippine Musicians&rsquo; Guild was organized and subsequently registered with the Department of Labor. The guild sought to protect the musicians who played music for a living. Its objectives were to (1) negotiate for minimum rates through collective bargaining; (2) protect against unjust dismissal or dismissal without notice; (3) provide Social Security coverage for musicians; and (4) work against the use of the minus one and recorded music that would displace musicians and other performers. The original organizers of the Guild were Hilarion Raymundo, Ping Joaquin, Don Chico, Ray Alinsod, Graciano Pujante, Peping Contreras, Chino Santos, Fred Robles, Johnny Gosalvez, and Resti Umali. This was the only union certified by the Supreme Court as the sole bargaining representative of musicians in the recording industry and, historically, it was the successor of the 19th century Union Artistico Musical. The Guild&rsquo;s office was at the corner of Rizal Avenue and Raon Streets in Sta. Cruz, Manila, an area referred to as a <i>palengke</i> (market) for musicians. One usually saw musicians hanging around the palengke all day long. Bandleaders and promoters came to this place to recruit musicians for recordings or <i>puwesto</i> (regular club gig). Fred Robles, who was a member of the International Association of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Educators (IAJE), or bassist Johnny Gozalves contacted musicians for various employment opportunities. It was here where bandleaders and sidemen haggled for the correct fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s and 1970s, bassist Johnny Gosalvez, like other session musicians, played in backup orchestras for TV and radio programs like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage), a program that sought out amateur singers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\"><strong>Diomedes Maturan</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> and turned them into stars or backups for stage presentations featuring foreign artists like Nat &lsquo;King&rsquo; Cole, Johnny Mathis, Paul Anka, Patti Page, and Matt Monro, and acts like Holiday on Ice and the German Circus at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1967, Cinema Audio, a studio complex owned and managed by the bandleader of the Electromaniacs, matinee idol, and electronics engineer Jose Mari Gonzales, pioneered in analog multitrack recording. Vicor Records and sister company Blackgold, originally co-owned by cousins Vic del Rosario and Orly Ilacad, and OctoArts Records, were the main customers that booked studio time on a per hour basis. The cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of session musicians plied their trade working into the wee hours to beat production schedule deadlines. The roster of musicians included guitarist-arranger Menchu Apostol, veteran bassist Roger Herrera, drummer Jun Regalado, pianist-arrangers Homer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> and Egay Gonzales, and trumpeters Fred and Omeng Concepcion. The studio was fully booked because of its high studio maintenance procedures and the owner&rsquo;s skillful management. In the late 1980s, Gonzales ventured into politics and after two failed bids incurred substantial financial losses. This led him to sell Cinema Audio to his <i>compadre</i>, the screen legend <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Jr who was at the helm of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4444\"><strong>FPJ Productions</strong></a>. In the 1990s, with analog technology slowly being replaced by digital state-of-the-art technology, Cinema Audio eventually closed shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1977, a landmark album titled <b><i>Pinoyjazz I</i></b> produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\"><strong>Jim Paredes</strong></a> of Jem Recording featured the arrangements of guitarist Eddie &ldquo;Lakay&rdquo; Munji III. Munji craftily employed jazz fusion techniques on popular folk songs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Nipa Hut), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1000\"><strong>Sarung Banggi</strong></a>&rdquo; (One Night), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/886\"><strong>Dandansoy</strong></a>&rdquo; (Unfaithful). Munji rounded up veteran session musicians such as Fred Robles, Dominic Salustiano, Boy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\"><strong>Palacio</strong></a>, and Joe Ladioray on various keyboards, Roger Herrera on bass, and Jun Regalado on drums. The sax section consisted of journalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a>, Ernie Mendoza, Eddie Sangcap, Rudy Sucgang, Domeng Valdes, and Picoy Villapando. The brass section featured brothers Fred and Omeng Concepcion, Romy Francisco, Nestor Gonzaga, Larry Matias, Romy San Jose, and Doc Johnny Lingasin. The album enjoyed considerable airtime over DZRJ, the most popular radio station of the time, owned and managed by Ramon &ldquo;RJ&rdquo; Jacinto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For obvious reasons, the musicians&rsquo; inner circle kept to themselves the secret for well paying gigs. Just the same, paid rehearsals, studio recording sessions for the movie and advertising industry, record companies that were dishing out hit after hit, live performances at weddings, corporate events, inter-island hopping appearances for town fiestas, and provincial sorties for politicians who need to entertain their constituents, as well as the more lucrative dollar-earning short- and long-term overseas gigs, were more than enough to keep these deserving talented and hardworking musicians gainfully employed. Looking beyond musicians simply having regular gigs, The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3878\"><strong>Asosasyon ng Musikong Pilipino</strong></a> (Association of Filipino Musicians) or AMP was organized during the presidency of Fidel V. Ramos in the mid 1990s. Spearheaded by First Lady Amelita &ldquo;Ming&rdquo; Ramos and led by violinist John Lesaca, its main concern was to provide instrumentalists the choice to have life insurance, pension and retirement benefits, and hospital insurance coverage. A general draft contract for engagements was drawn up for musicians&rsquo; reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 2000, the AMP Big Band was organized and headed by baritone sax player and musical director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4227\"><strong>Mel Villena</strong></a>. It was inspired by the memory of the Manila Studio Jazz Band (MSJB), which existed from 1979 to 1981. The MSJB, managed by baritone sax player and musical director Domeng Valdez, conceived the idea of maintaining the big band tradition with Sunday get-together jam sessions held at Ed Sulit&rsquo;s Pyramid Studios. Almost three decades later, veteran players from the MSJB who were involved in a show called <b><i>Flow</i></b> for the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), felt there was a need to continue and revive the big band tradition. To this day, the AMP Big Band continues to push forward with performances both local and international.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pianist-arranger-conductor and a Berklee College of Music summa cum laude graduate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4159\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Gerard Salonga</strong></a></strong></a>, younger brother of Broadway star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\"><strong>Lea Salonga</strong></a></strong></a>, headed the Global Studio Orchestra assembled in 2005 as an in-house recording studio ensemble post-production facility. Later renamed FILharmoniKA, it landed lucrative contracts with local pop music stalwarts <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4220\"><strong>Regine Velasquez</strong></a>, and Mon David. With this stable of the country&rsquo;s top talents, production went full blast with film scoring for the movie industry and albums like Lea Salonga&rsquo;s <b><i>Inspired</i></b> that became a platinum hit. It also bagged the contract to provide music for the animated digital movie <b><i>Tugger</i></b> featuring the late Hollywood comedian Jim Belushi, and the Pinoy thriller <b><i>Ang Pamana</i></b> (Heritage). These accomplishments signaled to the world market that Filipinos could compete with their foreign counterparts.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Richie C.

The process includes the preproduction phase, in which the producers and their assistants decide on the concept, programming, and performance of the piece/pieces of music; the production phase, which includes the creation of the musical arrangements, the rehearsals, the actual performance and recording, and the editing and mixing; and the postproduction phase, which concentrates on the duplication of copies, and the promotion and marketing of the finished products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The making of a record begins with the search for material. The producer can personally ask composers for new works or do research on unrecorded music in the music library, usually housed within the premises of the recording company. Popular music composers include JessSaclo, DannySubido, ErnaniCuenco, GeorgeCanseco, Vic Villafuerte, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>, Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith, Freddie<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, HeberBartolome, RyanCayabyab, WillyCruz, JimParedes, DannyJavier, Gines Tan, DannyTan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> de Leon, GaryGranada, JoseMariChan, ErniedelaPe&ntilde;a, Nonong Pedero, Cecile Azarcon-Palma, Odette Quesada, Nonoy Gallardo, Paul Galang, Charo Unite, Tats Faustino, SnaffuRigor, Nonoy Tan, VehneeSaturno, ReyValera, LouieOcampo, Jimmy Antiporda, and GaryValenciano. In this search for material, the producer is assisted by the audition and research (A &amp; R) person, who takes care of looking for talents and studios to be rented, establishing contacts with the arranger and sound engineers, and attending to the copyright demands of the selected songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A preproduction meeting is set so that the singer, the producer, the A &amp; R person, and preferably the arranger, can hear and study prospective materials. For a more objective evaluation of their works, the composer of these materials is usually excluded from the discussion. The group brainstorms and decides on the concept of the record, including the final selections, the type of arrangement needed, and the target audience (i.e., rural or urban). The producer gives all the guidelines to the singer, who will then study the lyrics and melody for a week or so before recording sessions formally start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The production phase is usually the domain of an audio recording engineer. He is responsible for recording, manipulating, mixing, and mechanically reproducing sound. He works closely with songwriters, music arrangers, and especially session musicians, vocalists and instrumentalists who render parts of musical arrangements in sound studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">First to be recorded or dubbed is the minus one or the instrumental accompaniment. The arranger creates this according to the guidelines laid out by the producer as to the desired beat, key, and instrumentation. Some of the music industry&rsquo;s arrangers are Domingo Amarillo, Emi and Eddie Munji, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4505\"><strong>Jun Latonio</strong></a>, Emil Mijares, LorrieIlustre, Danny Favis, Amado Trivi&ntilde;o, Butch Miraflor, AngelM.Pe&ntilde;a, Rey Magtoto, and Dante Trinidad, most of whom have harnessed their talents in arranging song-entries to the Metropop contest. Others have branched into musical direction for TV shows or concerts: Dominic Salustiano was the resident arranger and musical director of RPN 9&rsquo;s <b><i>Bagong Kampeon</i></b> (New Champion), a popular amateur singing contest on TV; Mon Faustino regularly did the arrangements for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>&rsquo;s concerts; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4227\"><strong>Mel Villena</strong></a> was the regular musical director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>&rsquo;s concerts here and abroad; Homer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> was the regular musical director of musical variety shows like <b><i>Vilma!</i></b> and <b><i>Eat Bulaga</i></b>; and Egay Gonzales did several musical directing stints in local concerts of pop singing idols and was also the musical director of the Sunday noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1503\"><strong>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</strong></a></i></b>. Some arrangers devoted most of their time to individual singers, like Alvin Nu&ntilde;ez who regularly did the arrangements of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>&rsquo;s songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The singer is asked to attend this first recording session to make sure he or she is comfortable with the key of the accompaniment. Once the arrangement is approved, the arranger rehearses the session musicians who have been recruited by the A &amp; R person. When the musicians are ready, the recording is done. Before the singer&rsquo;s voice is recorded, though, he or she may listen to the songs as sung by the composer with the minus one and from there create his or her own interpretation of the song. The singer undergoes lengthy rehearsals with the producer or composer for emotional motivation and musical approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the lead vocals have been recorded, another session is set for the backup vocals, as required by the arranger. The lead performer need not be present at this point because the support vocalists can already go by his or her voice track in the minus one. Session musicians used to be recruited from Aroma Cafe in the post-World War II decades. Later, individual musicians were contacted directly or drawn from established orchestras. Some of the session musicians who recorded for the industry were Polding Silos, Jun Regalado, Roger Herrera, Narding Casta&ntilde;eda, Ponching Belsonda, and Rudy Lozano, as well as musicians from the PhilippinePhilharmonicOrchestra and ManilaSymphonyOrchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The editing-mixing stage is considered the most crucial. Here, the various recorded tracks are manipulated to create an aural picture of the entire performance. The trained ears of mixers intimately attend to the details, as they study each track to decide which instrument must be heard only on the left or right speaker, or which song should be added if there are still vacant tracks available. As with the vocals, it is here where the singer or singers&rsquo; mistakes and deficiencies can be electronically corrected and improved through proper adjustments on the reverb, echo, or sustain functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the technology that the music recording industry in the United States developed from the 1960s to the present have been imported and used through the last three decades by major Filipino-owned recording companies. Some notable technological innovations of the last decade include the multitrack systems of recording sounds, and the use of synthesizers. The commercial viability of sound recordings also brought musical entrepreneurship into vogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the introduction of the synthesizer in the 1980s, recording sessions have become much more explorative than ever. Not only is this computer-aided equipment capable of reproducing sound, but it can also push the limits of one&rsquo;s audial fantasy by virtually inventing new sounds. Recordings channeled through synthesizers achieve the desired balance of sounds through the preprogrammed tracking assignments. An obvious drawback of a total dependence on synthesizers, however, is that it can dehumanize the recording session or render it mechanical and predictable. It can replace the human fingers on the piano or guitar, and can mask or eliminate a singer&rsquo;s faltering notes, giving a wrong impression of the singer&rsquo;s abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Towards the mid-1980s, keyboard devices and synthesizers became very affordable in the Philippines. By stacking the audio output from these varied instruments, keyboardists and musical arrangers attempted to approximate the rich textures and densities of a real orchestra simply by linking and overlapping sound modules together. This was made possible by a technology, then emerging, called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). The process to manipulate multiple sounds in the studio from a common point (most often, a keyboard &ldquo;controller&rdquo;) caused MIDI&rsquo;s popularity to soar. Musical elements like tempo, vibrato, dynamics, tuning, and quantization became standard parameters of modern audio design, manipulated by knobs, sliders, levers, and buttons that memorized entire performances. MIDI also brought music sequencers into the recording mainstream that assimilated streams of hardware devices and application products to record, edit, and play back pop music as it has not been previously realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The disadvantage was that sequencers effectively disenfranchised numerous studio session musicians from studio work, including violinists, violists, cellists, and brass ensemble players. There was an exodus of traditional musicians to jobs in other environments such as cruise ships and overseas hotels. Sequencers also became virtual recording studios by themselves, despite elements missing that could not be replicated such as vocals, guitars, and saxophone solos. Despite their detrimental impact, sequencers became hugely popular in the Philippines, dominating the character of pop music in the 1980s. Among the most illustrious of Manila&rsquo;s sequencer-based arrangers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\"><strong>Willy Cruz</strong></a>, Dante Trinidad, Homer Flores, Gerry Paraiso, and Sunny Ilacad. The technology allowed producers to book recording studios with practically half of the arrangements already pre-recorded, hence at only half the regular expense. Soon, the commercial appeal of sequencer methods in the Philippine recording industry pushed record producers, arrangers, and even aspiring recording artists to follow suit. Anyone, even those with little or no skill to read or write musical notation, became quickly empowered songwriters and MIDI orchestrators on sequencer booms. Soon the technology became pervasive that DIY (Do It Yourself) home recording studios spread far and wide in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1990s, numerous recording studios began utilizing Pro Tools, a hardware-software combination in the Apple Mac computer that simulated traditional analog recording processes in a digital environment. Subsequently, a slew of Windows-based DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) platforms also became prevalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Much progress has been achieved in studio recording: from the restrictive mono, to the 2, 4, 8, 16, and even 24-track capacity, which allows the recording of as many instruments or voices. Multitrack recorders in the United States can go up to 72 tracks. The multitrack or multihead recording gives the arranger free rein in putting emphasis or in downplaying a particular sound from among the tracks in use. The piano, for example, can be highlighted, while the guitars, drums, and other instruments can be muffled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1970s, digital recording started to replace analogue recording. Analogue recording has to cope with a whole range of levels and frequencies. Digital recording improves on the analogue by describing sound using binary numbers, such that the tape recorder need only to distinguish between two conditions&mdash;the presence or the absence of a pulse. In the 1980s, digital recording technology was already being applied to multitrack studio recorders. The final combination of sounds is cut into the master disc from which commercial pressing will be made. The disc, a thin aluminum plate coated with plastic lacquer, has a surface that is cut by a helium-cooled stylus driven by a spiral form from a special tape machine. The disc-cutting lathe is a high-precision machine tool, and is fully automated. It controls the movement of the lathe so that grooves containing loud passages in the music are cut wider than those on soft passages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In duplication, stampers are fitted to the pattern of hydraulic power which automatically puts labels on both sides and presses the plastic into the shape of the record at a pressure of 1,000 kilograms per square meters and at a temperature of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> degrees centigrade. After the record is formed, it is mechanically removed from the press, trimmed, slipped into an inner sleeve which is then slipped into an outer sleeve. The process takes 25 seconds for a long-playing (LP) record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A parallel operation is the high-speed duplication of music cassettes and cartridges. A master tape in the loop form replays continuously, feeding the program to the banks of slave recorders each loaded with &ldquo;pancakes&rdquo; (coils) of tapes 2,450 meters long. Both A and B titles are recorded on any one pass. Completely recorded pancakes are loaded into a machine which cuts the tapes, loads them into cassettes, and applies the label. The process takes 4.5 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the advent of PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) digital recording and the development of compact disc (CD) format by Philips and Sony, the compact disc has become the fastest growing medium for the dissemination of prerecorded music. From the late 1980s to the present, sales of CDs now account for at least 10 percent of total sales of all prerecorded music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the music is recorded, visual artists, photographers, and printers collaborate to give the music a &ldquo;face,&rdquo; through appropriate and appealing graphic design on the album jacket or compact disc and cassette case. Since singers are an important selling point, their portrait usually graces the jacket or case. That portrait, however, as well as other elements of design such as color, letter types, and lines should be handled such that they reflect the kind of music the record contains. Soft, even romantic, images are usually associated with ballads, while experimental and innovative visuals are deemed perfect for heavy metal rock and new wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For promotion purposes, the first several hundred copies of the packaged record are distributed to most radio and TV stations and to some entertainment writers and reviewers. To boost record sales, the promotion strategy usually requires the artist to plug his or her album on radio stations in the country, which now number over 300, stage free mini-concerts in shopping malls, run provincial tours, and have scheduled appearances on TV variety shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1970s, the production of a single cost between 1,500 to 2,500 pesos while an LP was from 20,000 to 30,000 pesos. A decade later, it went up to 10,000 to 15,000, and 80,000 pesos to 150,000 pesos, respectively. To date, the cost runs between 250,000 to 300,000 pesos for a respectable LP record of 10 songs. This amount excludes advertising and promotion costs, which could sometimes cost as much as production. That is why most recording companies do not release singles anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The origin of commercial audio recordings in the Philippines could be traced back to the early 20th century. The first ever recording of Filipino music was done in 1906 in Louisiana, USA by musicologist Frances Densmore. Used in the recording were the indigenous instruments that were on display in the United States at that time. The said record and instruments were later donated to the Smithsonian Institute Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Decades earlier, French inventors &Eacute;douard-L&eacute;on Scott de Martinville described ways to inscribe sounds with a phonautograph pen in 1857, and &Eacute;mile-Hortensius-Charles Cros, in 1877, discovered a process called photoengraving that etched the inscription into a groove. A playback device called the phonograph<b> </b>was patented a year later by the American entrepreneur Thomas Edison. This machine had a stylus that ran through the groove, sending the inscription through a diaphragm and back into the air as sound. Records were originally sold as prerecorded wax cylinders, containing songs, instrumental music, or spoken word. The early phonograph cylinders were difficult to mass-produce until the arrival of the gramophone. Invented by the German-born American Emile Berliner in 1887, it utilized flat horizontal disks as the recording medium. Berliner supposedly worked with the businessman Elridge Johnson in founding the Victor Talking Machine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, but the disruptive association concluded in Berliner&rsquo;s defection to start his own Deutsche Grammophon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon the official conclusion of the Philippine-American War in 1902, the Victor Talking Machine Company began selling phonographs in the fledgling American colony. Victor Records conducted the first series of recording sessions in the country, hoping to enhance and eventually cash in on the country&rsquo;s rich musical tradition. The Erlanger &amp; Galinger group scouted for local composers, singers, and musicians and within the year launched and popularized many of its discoveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometime before 1913, Major Anderson set up an audio production facility for Victor Records on the second floor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, most likely utilizing a mechanical recording process described as &ldquo;direct-to-disc.&rdquo; Performers gathered around a large acoustic horn while vibrations from its diaphragm guided a cutting lathe, etching the sound as a modulated groove onto the surface of a wax master disk. This master disk was sent to a processing plant in the United States where it was electroplated to create a negative metal stamper used to mold durable replicas of the recording. The discography of American historical recordings in the University of California Santa Barbara lists seven musical compositions by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> which were recorded from Jun 1912 to Oct 1914. These include &ldquo;La Tagala&rdquo; (The Tagalog Lady), &ldquo;Mi Valse So&ntilde;ado&rdquo; (My Dream Waltz), &ldquo;Piling,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Manila Carnival Rag.&rdquo; These were works performed by brass bands, whose members were some of the first studio session musicians in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the earliest Victor talents was <i>sarsuwela</i> star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\"><strong>Maria Carpena</strong></a>, who did solos and duets with famous tenor VictorinoCarrion. Her best pieces were &ldquo;Ang Mga Ibon&rdquo; (The Birds) and &ldquo;AngMaya&rdquo; (The Sparrow), both Tagalog waltzes by composer JoseEstella, and &ldquo;Ang Geisha&rdquo; (The Geisha) from the sarsuwela <b><i>La Venta de Filipinas al Japon</i></b> (The Sale of the Philippines to Japan). Other recording artists were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3276\"><strong>Patrocinio Tagaroma</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2823\"><strong>Jose Carvajal</strong></a>, who did songs from Spanish zarzuelas; and Socorro Basilio, Isabel Quintana, Sor F. Geronimo, Hilaria Alvarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> de la Rama, and Amado Infante, who performed songs from the sarsuwela. The Molina Orchestra was the most sought-after session musicians at that time. There are extant ledgers from the RCA-Victor in America of seminal electrical recordings in later years by pioneer Philippine recording artists such as vocalists Natividad &ldquo;Tinay&rdquo; Arellano, Katy de la Cruz, who was the acknowledged &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Queen&rdquo; of her time, Pacita de Tavera, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2763\"><strong>Florentino Ballecer</strong></a>; songwriter-composers like Nicanor S. Abelardo; and spoken word performers such as Joaquin Gabino and Mercedes Nonato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subsequent invention of the microphone, a transducer or sensor that converted sound vibrations into electrical impulses, was a breakthrough that jumpstarted electrical recording, which, together with the sound amplifier, made mechanical recording methods obsolete in 1925. By 1933, acoustic recording was completely disused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later on, sound recording activities became indispensable to the emerging Philippine motion picture industry. The era&rsquo;s most commercially viable talkies (i.e., sound pictures) debuted in local entertainment upon the arrival of <b><i>Syncopation</i></b>, 1929, an American musical film that utilized RCA&rsquo;s photophone sound-on-film process, which premiered in 1930 at the Radio Theater located in Plaza Santa Cruz, Manila. Soon after, the film <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b> (The Vampire), produced by George Musser and sound engineered by the audiographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4686\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4687\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Smith</strong></a></strong></a> at the Manila Talkatone Studio in Pandacan, was unveiled as the first talking film in the Philippines. It was simultaneously screened in Jan 1933 in the Tivoli Theater in Plaza Santa Cruz and the Lyric Theater in Manila&rsquo;s fashionable Escolta Street. Competition must have been fierce, as only two months after, in early Mar 1933, the movie by the pioneering director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\"><strong>Jose Nepomuceno</strong></a>, <b><i>Punyal na Guinto</i></b> (Golden Dagger), was screened at the Lyric Theater as the country&rsquo;s first complete sound film, integrating dialogue and background music. The advent of movie talkies proved to be a new goldmine for music enthusiasts. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>, jazz, ballad, and <i>bodabil </i>ditties virtually became the soundtrack of the Filipino way of life. These years of frenzied creation saw the growing competition between the pioneer Victor Records and the emerging Columbia and Odeon Companies, as radio stations <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>, KZRM, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4867\"><strong>KZEG</strong></a> tried to outdo each other in hiring Filipino artists and technicians. Remarkable was the volume of musical compositions registered for copyright at the National Library, particularly in 1929.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Local vocalists and instrumentalists who mostly came from the bodabil stage cut records which gave them a name both here and abroad. Among those whose records earned praise in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and South America were Natividad Arellano, JovitaFuentes, MercedesMatias, Vicente Ocampo, Dionisia Castro, Honorata&ldquo;Atang&rdquo;delaRama who was hailed as the &ldquo;Queen of Kundiman and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>Sarsuwela</strong></a>,&rdquo; and KatydelaCruz. Because of the popularity of declaimed poetry, the poems of JoseCorazondeJesus and FlorentinoCollantes as well as the <i>balagtasan</i> between these two giants were also recorded. BernabeSolis became the first Filipino record producer in 1926. His debut project, a Tagalog repertoire by Arellano, had to be recorded in the United States, for lack of proper equipment in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the importation of advanced equipment after World War II, enterprising singer and band leader CecilLloyd and his friends set up the first Filipino-owned recording company in April 1948. The Philippine Recording System, under the labels Bataan and Molave, offered the public a version of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Nipa Hut) and other popular folk songs arranged to rhumba rhythm. These innovations were, however, considered distasteful by the conservative audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many names of the movie sound department personnel during this era would have been lost if not for the rosters of the annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</strong></a> awards that began in 1952.

Struggling against the overwhelming trend of American pop songs in radio, film, and recording was VillarRecords, which specialized in the recording and dissemination of Filipino song forms. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a>, an independent Philippine record label specializing in folk music and popular songs using traditional forms, was launched by Manuel P. Villar in 1950. Lauded in later years as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Recording,&rdquo; Villar produced songs by contemporary <i>kundiman</i> masters such as Constancio de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\"><strong>Levi Celerio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>, committing their works to posterity. He became the founding president of the Record Industry Association of the Philippines (RIAP), the precursor of the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). Villar Records itself belonged to a larger conglomerate that included an extensive radio network and recording facility whose sound engineer, Cesar Armario, was responsible for countless recordings of classic Philippine songs. The pioneering efforts of Villar Records became mainstream after the 1970s, when Pinoypop music grew in leaps and bounds, specially because of the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (Metropop) and the government order requiring that original Pilipino music (OPM) be played by all radio stations at regular intervals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other recording companies which produced OPM music in the last two decades are Wea (now Universal) Records, Vicor Music Corporation, Octo Arts International, Dyna-ENU Records, BMG-Pilipinas, Viva Records, Alpha Records, Ivory Records, Platinum Records, Grandeur Records, Praise Records, Jem Records, A&amp;W Records, GOI Records, Valley Records, Concorde Productions, Audio Music Corporation, Backbeat Music, Exotica Records, Golden Music Arts, Hitwave Marketing, Love Records and Tapes, JR Records and Tapes, Philharmonic Records, Richtone Corporation, Sound Publishing, Striker Records and Tapes, Telesis Recording and Entertainment Corp., VNM Productions, and A&amp;B Recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were recording studios in the country such as Greenhills Sound Production, Audio Captain Productions, Cinema Audio, JR Recording Studio, Studio Twenty-Two, Abbey Road Recording Studio, PM Recording Studio, and Richtone Studios. The vast Sampaguita Pictures compound in San Juan, Rizal operated a recording studio that serviced not only their internal sound stage requirements but also record companies that desired the live sound of their spacious recording room. The expertise of audio engineers such as Jess Payumo, Jun Orenza, Dante San Pedro, and Monching Payumo were sought by record company clients for their award winning circa-1970s mixes as disparate as &ldquo;Himig Natin&rdquo; (Our Music) by the Juan De La Cruz Band and the jazz orchestra album of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a> &amp; The Jazz Friends. When Sampaguita Pictures closed their doors in the 1980s, their engineers migrated to a nearby facility in San Juan City that was just as expansive and had good acoustics&mdash;the Green Hill Recording Studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Responding to a soaring demand for professionally recorded musical films during the mid- to late 1960s boom, the actor Jose Mari Gonzales opened his own Cinema-Audio Recording Studios that largely defined the sound of classic OPM at the turn of the decade. The sound engineering team headed by Dindo Aldecoa, along with Ric Santos and Boy Roxas, was responsible for the rise of such recording stars as Sharon Cuneta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\"><strong>Kuh Ledesma</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie Aguilar</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tasha Recording Studio located in Libis, Quezon City, was built in the early-1980s by an expatriate American singer, Morris Albert, who employed the sound engineer, Edwin Luna. Together, they created a unique OPM sound characterized by automated reverberation effects and panoramic sound imaging that helped create the hits of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a>, and Gary Valenciano. The comedian and politician Tito Sotto purchased the studio later in 1986, and commercial bookings continued until a tragic fire accident gutted the edifice. The setback was devastating to the OPM scene, if not symbolic of the changing times ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For music produced from synthesizers, the final production needed the technical proficiency that can only be possible through mastering the final product in a recording studios. When expertise was required, boutique studios went into vogue such as the specialized Sweet Spot Solutions studio in Pasig City owned by the electronica music mavens Malek Lopez and the Hongkong British expatriate Noel de Brackinghe; the more elaborate Tower Of Doom studio in Quezon City servicing the heavy metal genre, operated by rock producer Eric Perlas; the Acoustic Underground in Quezon City, operated by Aji Manalo; and Sound Weavers, the recording studio in Makati City geared for the blues music community, operated by Gerry Diwa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were elaborately priced all-digital commercial enclaves typified by the award-winning Hit Productions in Makati City, owned by the songwriter expatriate Salito Malca and staffed by musician-engineers such as the siblings Angelo Villegas and Mike Villegas. But there were studios, too, that have become &ldquo;indie remedies,&rdquo; that is, those that bridged gear-deficient home recording studios and pricey enclaves but were popularly priced. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> such Pro Tools studio was Sound Creation Studio, a facility with an elaborate acoustical room infrastructure run by the Filipino sound engineer Hazel Pascua and its owner, the expatriate Japanese musician-engineer Shinji Tanaka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Youth bands playing real guitars and drums had a huge impact in pushing music recording into the digital age. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a> and their producer Robin Rivera infused creativity into the multi-track magnetic tape environment of Jun Regalado&rsquo;s JR Studio in Makati to shape their multi-platinum albums, <b><i>Circus</i></b>, 1994, and <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, 1995, with the sound engineer, Lito Palco. Across the metropolis, in Pasig City, the studio named TRACKAcoustics/Studios, owned by the acoustic designer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4922\"><strong>Mike Pedero</strong></a>, and engineered by Angee Rozul had been making headway recording the world-folk album, <b><i>Rippingyarns</i></b>, 2000, by singer-songwriter Cynthia Alexander. Recording engineers and mixers are a prolific lot in the industry and have earned recognition from their peers. Some of those who have devoted many years to perfecting musical technology are Egay Guerrero, Lito Balagtas, Willy Munji, Dindo Aldecoa, Jess and Monching Payumo, Dante San Pedro, Jun Orense, Edwin Borja, Boy Roxas, Edwin Luna, Bobby <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a>ava, Jaime Godinez, Joseph Roxas, and Voltaire Olpiano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The long process of birthing a new record and the technological developments in sound recording all happen away from the spotlight, but these have certainly helped these performers&rsquo; rise in popularity: in the 1950s, SylviaLaTorre, Bobby Gonzales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a>, RicManriqueJr, the MabuhaySingers, and later DiomedesMaturan; in the 1960s, PilitaCorrales, Carmen Soriano, Carmen Pate&ntilde;a, Mercy Molina, and later, Helen Gamboa, Jeanne Young, Wing Duo, Reycard Duet, Tiongco Brothers, Pauline Sevilla, Eddie Peregrina, NoraAunor, Tirso Cruz III, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>, and Edgar Mortiz; in the 1970s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Juan de la Cruz Band</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a>, Lerma de la Cruz, Mike Hanopol, and later, the New Minstrels, Something Special, Circus Band, ApoHikingSociety, CelesteLegaspi, Leah Navarro, Tillie Moreno, Aloha (now Ali Sotto), Coritha, Jacqui Magno, Lirio Vital, Susana Pichay, Cynthia Garcia, Maricris Bermont, Ray-an Fuentes, BasilValdez, RicoJ.Puno, HajjiAlejandro, Anthony Castelo, Rex Dimavivas, The Boyfriends, VST &amp; Co., and Freddie Aguilar; in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Papin, Eva Eugenio, Claire de la Fuente, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4005\"><strong>Hagibis</strong></a>, Ric Segreto, and through the 1990s, FreddieAguilar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>, YoyoyVillame, Dulce, LouieReyes, Eugene Villaluz, KuhLedesma, CelesteLegaspi, SharonCuneta, LeaSalonga, JoeyAlbert, Ivy Violan, Vernie Varga, Zsa Zsa Padilla, PopsFernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4220\"><strong>Regine Velasquez</strong></a>, Jamie Rivera, Odette Quesada, NonoyZu&ntilde;iga, Marco Sison, GaryValenciano, MartinNievera, Randy Santiago, and Francis Magalona.

Around 10 percent of the Philippine population plays indigenous music during religious rituals and feasts, and in secular activities, while the remaining percent performs using instruments that are mostly Western in origin. Among the indigenous musical instruments used are bamboo instruments such as buzzers, clappers, scrapers, paired-string zithers, slit drums, mouth harps, flutes, reed pipes, and polychordal zithers; bronze instruments like flat gongs and suspended gongs; and two-string lutes called <b>kutyapi</b> (boat lute)<i>.</i> On the other hand, Western musical instruments, which the Philippines adopted through more than three hundred years of Spanish occupation (from 1565 to 1898), include string, wind, percussion, and keyboard instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Performers who work with musical instruments must be complemented by skilled instrument makers to assure their artistic survival and growth. This article focuses on makers of Western instruments in the Philippines, particularly stringed instrument makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The migration of craftsmen, including makers of musical instruments, from Mexico to the Philippines happened during the transpacific galleon trade in the 16th century. These Mexican luthiers spread across the Philippines and became responsible for the arrival of many types of stringed instruments in the islands. Unfortunately, records did not mention specific names of early luthiers who built stringed instruments in the country until the late 19th century. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pedro Buencamino was the earliest stringed instrument maker<b> </b>and repairer on record. He was born on 1 Aug 1866 in Abukay, Bataan. Buencamino never finished his schooling and became a circus performer at thirteen years old. He toured around the country as part of the circus, from which he learned to play the guitar. After ten years of performing in the circus, Buencamino decided to retire and settled in Manila, then later on began repairing guitars in his house at Isaac Peral Street. It is believed that he acquired his skill from his frequent visits to repair shops in Ongpin Street, Manila. During the revolution in 1896, he and his wife Petra Martin evacuated to San Fernando, Pampanga where they established a music store cum barber shop. After three years, the couple decided to go back to Manila. Later on, Buencamino was awarded a medal in 1904 when he exhibited his stringed instruments at the Philippine Exposition. He established the music store El Sol Mayor in 1916. This store, located in Rizal Avenue, Santa Cruz, Manila, he maintained until his death in 1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from guitars, Buencamino also manufactured violins, violoncellos, and basses. Moreover, Buencamino, together with another luthier named Andres, operated another guitar factory in San Miguel District in Manila. To commemorate the existence of the factory in that neighborhood, the district&rsquo;s bridge was named Puente Guitarrero or Guitarist&rsquo;s Bridge. Buencamino used local woods for his guitars like narra, <i>laniti, </i>and <i>langka </i>for the backs and sides; <i>palochina </i>or white pine for the top; and <i>kamagong </i>for the fingerboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Buencamino&rsquo;s former workers, namely Fausto Martin and Alejandro de la Rosa, continued the tradition of stringed instrument making in the country. Martin became an expert violin and cello repairman. He was known because of the recommendation of famous musicians during the time such as Ramon Corpus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>, Alejandro Arellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4215\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4216\"><strong>Ernesto Vallejo</strong></a></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>, who lauded his ability to improve the appearance as well as the tonality of the instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, de la Rosa opened a violin repair shop in Tondo, Manila. His specialization in enhancing and refining the tonal features of the violin earned him the title &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; or &ldquo;King of Filipino Repairmen.&rdquo; Alejandro de la Rosa was made famous by foreign violin virtuosi who visited the country, as these violinists like Cecilia Hanson and Piastro were impressed with his work when they asked him to restore their Stradivarius violins. Because of his exceptional ability, these foreigners recommended him to others after going back to their countries. As a result, de la Rosa was highly regarded not only in the Philippines but also in other countries&mdash;he even got offers from repair shops in the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and Russia to supervise their manufacturing and repairing of violins, but he decided to stay in the country. Besides violin repairing and manufacturing, de la Rosa was also a famous guitar maker. He started making toy guitars from coconut shells before the age of ten, and before he was twenty, the guitars he made became very popular in the cities and provinces of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Innovation and experimentation were also seen in the early part of the history of Filipino stringed instrument makers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of those who dared was Casto Maria de Nieva. He was born 1 Jul 1873 in Boac, Marinduque. In 1882, de Nieva went to Manila and studied at the Ateneo de Manila then finished his bachelor of arts degree at the University of Santo Tomas in 1894. He was known for being innovative as he made his own repairing and manufacturing tools. He also experimented on the use of a wood in 1925, as he made a special violin using one wood, the laniti, for the top, back and sides, neck, and scroll. It had been said that to produce a good sound, the violin&rsquo;s body should not be made of a single kind of wood. But, de Nieva&rsquo;s experiment proved to be successful, as observed by the former National Library Director Epifanio de los Santos. He also built cellos or violoncellos, based on the paper labels of his instruments which said &ldquo;Casto Nieva, Constructor de Violines y Violoncellos, Manila, Islas Filipinas.&rdquo;<i> </i>He died on 21 May 1935, leaving behind violins which were products of his creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another expert violin repairman was Domingo Pesigan, born in Calamba, Laguna on 24 Jul 1906 and recognized during the early part of the 20th century. He became a worker of well-known violinmaker Alejandro de la Rosa, but later, after honing his skills, he established his own music shop in Manila. He also explored the use of Philippine woods like <i>laniti</i>, <i>pino</i>, and kamagong<i>.</i> Among his customers and patrons who kept his shop busy and thriving were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\"><strong>Ramon Tapales</strong></a>, Servilla Castillejos, Pablo Palomo, Manuel Bautista, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\"><strong>Basilio Manalo</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1911, a shop named Compositor de Instrumentos de Cuerda was established by Eusebio Cabilu&ntilde;a. Cabilu&ntilde;a was a famous repairman of wind and percussion instruments as well as a maker of guitars, banjos, ukuleles, and rondalla. Cabilu&ntilde;a supplied instruments to Cebu&rsquo;s rondalla group La Juventud Filipina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most significant guitar makers in the Philippines during the second half of the 1900s was Michael Romero. A native of Baliangao, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>mis Occidental, Romero used to be a customs officer in Manila during the 1960s. He started to become curious about why imported classical guitars passing through their office were always being declared of high value. He started researching on the materials and process used for making classical guitar. He bought books and tools on making quality classical guitars. In 1969, Romero started building quality guitars in his house in Magallanes Village, Makati City. On 19 Apr 1970, he decided to commercially open a guitar store and shop in Mercedes St, Pinagkaisahan, Makati City. He named his shop Guitarmasters. He recruited guitar makers from the Visayas to become his workers. The number one luthier in the shop was Flavio Bilbao from the province of Bohol. In addition, Romero also hired guitar luthiers from Cebu province such as Demetrio Aying, Nardo Ompad, and Alex Ompad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guitarmasters was considered one of the first to make high quality guitars in Metro Manila. The shop used imported quality woods like spruce and rosewood to be able to build good-sounding guitars. It also experimented in using local woods such as langka for the top and <i>ipil</i> for the back and sides. During the 1970s, the shop also became the favorite hangout place of classical guitarists J&oacute;se Valdez, Raul Manikan, and Mario Rodriguez. Aside from making and selling guitars, the shop also offered guitar lessons to aspiring students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another achievement of Guitarmasters was that it provided quality instruments to concert guitarists during this time when guitar concertizing in the country was only beginning. The elite classical guitarists helped in promoting Guitarmasters by using its guitars during concerts and recommending them to their students, friends, and guitar aficionados. Romero also made a ten-string guitar exclusively for Jose Valdez in 1973. On 14 Dec of the same year, Valdez held a concert at the Philamlife Auditorium using the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Model, a specially made guitar by Guitarmasters inspired by then-First Lady Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s efforts to revive music in the country. Guitarmasters flourished from 1970 to 1983. Because of unfortunate events in the family of the owner, Guitarmasters experienced financial instability and closed down in the latter part of the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tradition of stringed instrument making in the country developed with the help and contributions of the luthiers in the latter part of the 20th century. Some of these are guitar makers Dominguez Javier, Mario Rodriguez, Raul Manikan; and bowed instrument makers Amador Tamayo (violin/viola/cello), Angel Gabute (violin/double bass), and Efren Tapao, Dante Gabute, Romeo Gabute, and Bening Abarrientos (double bass). Most of them are still producing quality instruments until today, supplying instruments to concert artists and music students from different schools in Manila and in the provinces, including international classical performers. Aside from these individual makers, big shops with lots of instrument makers are still flourishing in the country today like in Raon, Quiapo, and Santa Mesa in Manila, in Guagua, Pampanga, and in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most significant guitar maker in the 21st century is Cebu native Armando Derecho aka Tabo. He is considered one of the best Filipino classical guitar makers who just officially started to market his guitar recently. In 1982, Derecho enrolled in University of the Philippines College of Music as a guitar major. He is one of the original members of the UP Guitar Ensemble that toured in Australia during the 1980s. Derecho also became a guitarist of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4204\"><strong>UP Concert Chorus</strong></a> and the UP Filipiniana Dance Troupe in the late 80s to the early 90s. After hearing good quality classical guitars in UP, specifically his professor&rsquo;s imported guitar, Derecho asked himself why Cebuanos could not make that kind of guitar. Derecho challenged himself and started learning how to build guitars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Derecho had formal studies on guitar making with Mario Rodriguez, a guitar maker and a teacher at the UST Conservatory of Music. He went to Rodriguez&rsquo;s house in Cainta almost every day for more than two years to observe and try building guitars under the supervision of his teacher. In the late 1990s, Rodriguez left the country for the United States, and this was the time when Derecho tried making his own guitars. Rodriguez gave him a second hand mold and some guitar making books to start his guitar making hobby. During that time, he was a full-time performer in hotels and restaurants in Metro Manila. Derecho constructed his guitars in his boarding house during his free time before going to his gigs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Derecho, together with his wife, decided to move to Marikina City in 1999. In April of the same year, he rented a lot behind his backyard and turned it into a guitar shop which he later transferred beside his house. Nardo Ompad, a former worker in Guitarmasters, met Derecho and applied to be his assistant. To this date, Ompad still works at Derecho&rsquo;s shop in Marikina. Derecho guitars use high quality imported materials such as spruce, cedar, rosewood, and pine. Since 1999, Derecho has built more than <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> guitars. Derecho guitars became very significant during the early 2000s because they gave classical guitar players access to locally made quality guitars. These guitars are as good as the imported ones but come with a lower tag price. He is presently one of the Filipino guitar makers, if not the only one, in the country who can make classical guitars that can match the quality of imported concert model guitars.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written byNathan Neil V.
