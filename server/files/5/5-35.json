The second type, especially the <b>folk kundiman</b>, lent itself to the development of the song as personal and artistic self-expression since it has been used traditionally to ventilate emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The expressive folk kundiman was exemplified by the turn-of-the-century &ldquo;May Dusa Pa Yata&rdquo; (Misery Still Pervades), cited byAntonioJ.Molina as a young man&rsquo;s vehicle for expressing his affections for a young maiden in the context of a<b>pantapat </b>or harana (serenade).The lyrics consisted of two four-line stanzas, each line with 12 syllables ending in assonance. The music, in triple meter and in a major tonality, consisting of two 16-bar periods corresponding to the stanzas, was in binary form. A note that was longer in duration than others within a phrase unit or agogic accent, or a note followed by a rest or silence, occured with each 6th and 12th syllable of a line.This melodic trait reflected a characteristic of Philippine dodecasyllabic lines as found in Balagtas&rsquo;s<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>atLaura</i></b>(Florante and Laura), wherein a caesura invariably occured after the 6th syllable.Similarly constructed were the lyrics of the folk songs &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> de 1800&rdquo; (Love Song of 1800) and &ldquo;Kundiman de 1870: Paalam sa Pagkadalaga&rdquo; (Love Song of 1870: Farewell to Maidenhood).Like most folksongs, the authorship is unknown and different verses may be set for these songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kundiman as a composed vocal genre expressing intense love for a beloved as well as patriotic fervor emerged in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\"><strong>Leon Ignacio</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Aking Bulaklak&rdquo; (My Flower), Jose Silos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mutya ng Silangan&rdquo; (Muse of the East), Paulino Cadsawan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kundiman ni Rizal&rdquo; (Rizal&rsquo;s Kundiman), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Simoy na Dalisay&rdquo; (Pure Breeze), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kundiman,&rdquo; among others. In most of these works, the melodic and textual conventions of the folk kundiman were retained but accompaniment on the piano was specified. Moreover, the simple binary structure of two 16-bar periods (AB) was expanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reaching artistic heights in the creative genius ofNicanorS.Abelardoand FranciscoSantiago, the kundiman became a veritable art song written in the chromatic harmonic language of European romanticists.Melody, text, and harmony were intertwined to musically conveythe meaning of theTagalog text in Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;NasaanKaIrog?&rdquo;(Where Are You, My Love?),&ldquo;MutyangPasig&rdquo;(Muse of Pasig),&ldquo;Kundimanng<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a>&rdquo;(Love Song of Tears), &ldquo;Magbalik Ka Hirang&rdquo; (Come Back My Love), &ldquo;Himutok&rdquo; (Outcry), and &ldquo;Pahimakas&rdquo; (Last Farewell); and in Santiago&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kundiman&rdquo; (Love Song), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\"><strong>Pakiusap</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo;(Plea) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1767\"><strong>Madaling-Araw</strong></a>&rdquo; (Dawn). The American musicologist Conway Walker referred to the art song kundiman as &ldquo;graphic miniature music-dramas, small, yet susceptible of expression at will, flexible as no other medium of emotional expression devised by man &hellip; with the directness and exactness of an etching, and all-inclusive in its possibilities of emotional portraiture.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After Abelardo and Santiago, Philippine art song literature continued to grow.Composers who wrote in the vernacular and who were influenced by the art song kundimanincludeFelipePadilla deLeon with his<b> </b>&ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Pilipino&rdquo; (I Am a Filipino), &ldquo;Ganyan ang Pagsinta&rdquo; (That Is Love), and &ldquo;Dasal ng Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Prayer of Love); Antonio J. Molina with his &ldquo;Amihan&rdquo; (Cool Northeast Wind) and &ldquo;Kundiman-Kundangan&rdquo; (Love Song&ndash;If Not For); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> with his &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Nangangarap&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m Dreaming); Lucio D. San Pedro with his &ldquo;Diwata ng Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Goddess of Love), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/994\"><strong>Sa Ugoy ng Duyan</strong></a>&rdquo; (In the Cradle&rsquo;s Rocking), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/993\"><strong>Sa Mahal Kong Bayan</strong></a>&rdquo; (In My Beloved Country), and &ldquo;Sa Simula Ako&rsquo;y Isang Labong&rdquo; (In the Beginning I Was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Shoot);RosendoSantos with his &ldquo;Kundiman ng Puso&rdquo; (Love Song of the Heart);AngelM.Pe&ntilde;a with his &ldquo;Iyo Kailan Pa Man&rdquo; (Yours Forever); LucinoT.Sacramento with his &ldquo;Gamugamu&rdquo; (Moth);ErnaniCuenco with his &ldquo;Kundiman &rsquo;86&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/892\"><strong>Gaano Ko Ikaw Kamahal</strong></a>?&rdquo; (How Much Do I Love You?); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3942\"><strong>Rodolfo S. Cornejo</strong></a> with his &ldquo;Kalualhatian&rdquo; (Glory) and &ldquo;Silahis ng Pag-asa&rdquo; (Ray of Hope); and Augusto Espino with his &ldquo;Kundiman ng Langit&rdquo; (Love Song of Heaven). It is to be noted that 54 art songs, including many of the above, were collected in <b><i>An Album of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\"><strong>Art Song</strong></a>s</i></b> published by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a>. In 1996, Antonina E. Siapuatco published the collection <b><i>The Art Songs of Lucio San Pedro</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Providing the impetus for more contributions to the repertory were theLeagueof Filipino Composers(LFC) and theNationalMusic CompetitionsforYoungArtists (NAMCYA), which conducted competitions in art song composition and commissioned solo vocal contest pieces, respectively.The LFC&rsquo;s first-prize winner for 1979 was Toti Alvarez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ito ang Iyong Bayan&rdquo; (This Is Your Country), and in 1990, Von de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gutiay Pa Ako&rdquo; (I Was Still Young). The NAMCYA pieces include Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1415\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong></a>, Isang Pangarap&rdquo; (My Country, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Dream), Jerry A.

In the urban setting, the term ballad is loosely applied to any popular song with romantic elements, and a singer who performs mainly a repertoire of love songs in nightclubs and music lounges is called balladeer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine traditional ballads differ in musical style from one group to another. Those in the ethnic musical style are found among groups that have not been completely Westernized. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\"><strong>Ballad</strong></a>s from indigenous groups include the Bukidnon <b>idangdang</b>, the Mansaka <b>saliada</b>, and the Tausug <b>liyangkit parang sabil</b>. Those in the lowland Spanish-influenced style are the Cuyunon and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a> <b>composo</b>, and the Pampango &ldquo;Ing Bangkeru&rdquo; (The Boatman). Some ballads have instrumental accompaniment, like the composo, which is usually heard with a guitar, and the liyangkit parang sabil with the <b>gabbang</b> (bamboo xylophone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The indigenous narrative liyangkit parang sabil is sung by a professional singer.

In the Visayas, the composo is sung to stock melodies generally in triple or quadruple, such as the Hiligaynon composo &ldquo;Montor,&rdquo; which is in triple meter with an AABC form. While the Cuyunon composo may be rendered solo during fiesta celebrations, it is often performed in chorus with the <i>sayaw</i> (dance) by a group of teenagers accompanied by a string ensemble called <b>de kwerdas</b>. A Cuyunon composo titled &ldquo;Composo de Capiz&rdquo; is strophic with four musical phrases of ABCD in quadruple meter. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\"><strong>Magellan</strong></a>,&rdquo; a contemporary ballad by pop artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a>, inserts stock formulaic verses, particularly the children&rsquo;s verse &ldquo;Mother, mother, I am sick.&rdquo;<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

It is considered one of the most enduring dance forms, having been adopted locally in the Philippines as music in traditional music theater like the <b>sarsuwela</b> or in modern musicals, and as independent instrumental compositions by many composers of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music usually consists of two sections played continuously. Dancers may change partners between repetitions. In the country, the balse gained popularity toward the mid-19th century. A British writer observing the country in the 1840s praised the native women&rsquo;s skills in waltzing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The balse was used by many composers since then, among them JoseEstella and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4093\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong></a>, who composed sectional waltzes called <b>tanda de valses</b>.

As many as the number of different linguistic groups in the Philippines is the diversity of music instruments that the Filipinos have made out of the plant, and these instruments differ in terms of timbre (tone quality), name, manner by which sounds are generated from them, and significance in the lives of Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indigenous Philippine bamboo instruments existed long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> music was heard during rituals, feasts, courtship scenes, work, and recreation. Bamboo music instruments can be classified into aerophones, idiophones, and chordophones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Instruments that produce sounds when blown are called aerophones. Bamboo aerophones include various types of flutes, panpipes, and reed pipes, the most numerous found throughout the country being the <b>paldong</b> or <b>palendag </b>(vertical end-blown flute). The <b>tongali</b><i> </i>(nose flute) is widespread in northern Philippines, but few are found in southern Philippines. It is played mostly by men and is used for serenading and courting, for quiet moments of relaxation, or for funerals. Flutes of Northern Luzon are tuned in pentatonic scales with or without semitones. The <b>saggeypo</b>, a type of stopped pipes, are aerophones found in the northern Kalinga<i>. </i>Used for entertainment by youth and adults, the saggeypo is also played while walking along mountain trails and may be played individually or as an ensemble. Meanwhile, the <b>diwdiw-as</b> (set of panpipes) found in Northern Philippines consists of open pipes that are tied together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Idiophones produce sound when struck with an implement or with the hand. The source of vibration is the instrument itself. Bamboo idiophones in the Philippines are the xylophone, quill-shaped tubes, stamping tubes, scrapers, buzzers, clappers, and mouth harps. Bamboo tubes can be struck against each other, struck by sticks or mallets, stamped against hard objects, or shaken. The half-cut bamboo tongues in mouth harps (also called jew&rsquo;s harps) are plucked. The mouth harp is found all over the Philippines and called by various names such as <b>kulibao</b>,<i> </i><b>ulibao</b>,<i> </i><b>aribao</b>,<i> </i>and<i> </i><b>kubing</b>. The<b>bunkaka </b>(buzzers), <b>tongatong</b> (stamping tubes), and <b>patang-ug<i> </i></b>(quill-shaped tubes) are prevalent among the Cordillera highlanders who use them for rites, celebrations, and entertainment. The <b>patatag</b>, a set of xylophone blades or staves, is used by the Kalinga children to learn the rhythmic patterns of the <b>gangsa</b> (gongs). The bamboo xylophone found in southern Philippines is called <b>gabbang</b><i> </i>and <b>kwintangan</b>. The bamboo tubes with notches etched on the tube, which can only be found in southern Philippines, are called <b>tagutok</b> and <b>kagul</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chordophones are instruments that generate sound through the vibration of strings, either by plucking, striking, or bowing. A zither is an instrument with strings that run parallel to the length of its body. The body serves as asound box or resonator. The zither has noneck, and the number of its strings varies. Zithers are found in northern Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan. A common type is a bamboo tube whose strips are detached from its body but remain attached at both ends, with small bridges being inserted between the strips and the body. They are of two types: polychordal zithers with several strings that run around the tube and parallel-stringed zithers that usually have two strings on one side of the tube. Polychordal zithers are found in the Cordilleras, Mindanao, and Palawan, and are commonly called <b>kudlung</b><i> </i>or<i> </i><b>kolitong</b>. These are used for expressing human sentiments, for self-entertainment, for courtship, and for festive occasions as dance accompaniment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The parallel-stringed tube zither has two to four strings that are plucked with the fingers or struck with small bamboo sticks. Boys and men play them for entertainment, with rhythms patterned after those played on the gongs. The bamboo half-tube zither among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> is called <b>ayudding</b>, and the paired string zither with slight variations found in northern and southern Philippines are called <b>pas&shy;ing</b>,<i> </i><b>banban</b>,<i> </i><b>tambi</b>, <b>kudlong</b>,<i> </i>or<i> </i><b>takumbo</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from its use in indigenous cultures, bamboo is also used to play Western music, as in the bamboo organ in Las Pi&ntilde;as, the <b>musikong bumbong</b><i> </i>(bamboo wind instruments), the angklung (Indonesian bamboo ensemble), and other diatonically tuned instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bamboo organ atSaint Joseph Parish Church in Las Pi&ntilde;as is considered a National Cultural Treasure. The instrument is the oldest bamboo pipe organ in the world. Fray <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a> de la Virgen del Carmen (1762-1834), a Spanish missionary, started to build the bamboo organ in 1816 with the help of the people of Las Pi&ntilde;as. Cera allegedly buried the bamboos that he used as organ pipes under the sand by the seashore for a year in order to wash out traces of sugar and starch in the wood and thus create tough, mature pipes. The organ was first heard in 1821 but without the horizontal trumpets. Cera completed the work in 1824 after deciding to use metal for the horizontal trumpets whose character of sound he could not get with bamboo resonators. For the general structure, native Philippine wood species, such as narra,<i> </i>molave, and kamagong, were used<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bamboo organ measures 5.17 m tall, 4.11 m wide, and 1.45 m deep. Hans Gerd Klais, who restored the organ in the mid-1970s, noted that the instrument contains a total of 1,031 pipes, of which 902 are of bamboo and 129 pipes are of metal. The pitch of each pipe is determined by its length. The organ has two unpitched accessory stops: the <b>pajaritos</b> and the <b>tanbor</b>, which produce the coloristic sounds of birds and the rumble of kettledrums, respectively. The Las Pi&ntilde;as Bamboo Organ is based on a typical Spanish baroque model, following the organ construction style of the era in which Cera lived. In 1978, the Bamboo Organ Foundation, a nonstock and nonprofit organization, was founded for the purpose of preserving the instrument. Since the bamboo organ&rsquo;s return to the Philippines after its restoration in Germany in 1973-75, annual concerts have been held at the Parish of Saint Joseph. The Diego Cera Organ Builders Inc, the first Filipino pipe organ building company, is specifically responsible for the maintenance and preservation of the bamboo organ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musikong bumbong is an ensemble of bamboo instruments that are reproductions of European band instruments. It flourished in the villages during the Philippine revolutionary period in the last quarter of the 19th century. The sound of each instrument, like the trumpet, trombone, horn, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, and sousaphone, is different from its original model because the instruments rely on the voice of the performers to produce the sounds. An instrument is open at both ends and has a hole on the side covered with a membrane, which produces a buzzing sound when the player hums rather than blowsintothe mouthpiece. Because it is not the instrument that produces the sound per se but the voice of the player, the band of such instruments is called <b>banda de voca</b>, which is literally &ldquo;band of the mouth.&rdquo; The air pressure produced by the hum makes the membrane vibrate and the resulting sound varies in pitch and loudness with the player&rsquo;s humming. The shape of the instrument helps amplify and project the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musikong bumbong proliferated in the villages, some<i> </i>organized by the Katipunero<i> </i>(Filipino revolutionaries) who fought against Spain in 1896-98. These Katipunero used their musical talents to entertain their comrades, enlivening their unit&rsquo;s activities by playing patriotic songs. Gathering as musicians and playing music also served to mask their secret meetings, according to accounts of their descendants who are at present members of musikong bumbong.<i> </i>Organized along the lines of the marching band, these all-bamboo ensembles were attempts by 19th-century Filipino nationalists and revolutionaries to create a uniquely Filipino sound. Through the years, the instrumentation of the musikong bumbong has evolved from the banda de voca to the inclusion of sound-producing bamboo instruments like the bamboo flute, <b>bumbong</b> (bamboo tube which at first looked like a sousaphone, but whose shape later on returned to straight bamboo tubes), clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, and <b>trompas</b> (French horn that sounded like the bumbong)<i>. </i>This was the case with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4061\"><strong>Malabon Musikong Bumbong</strong></a>. For the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4104\"><strong>Obando Musikong Bumbong</strong></a> or Banda Santa Clara Musikong Bumbong,<i> </i>instrumentation has not changed much since<i> </i>its establishment. The group simply added sound-producing instruments like the harmonica, <b>bamban</b> (alto saxophone), cymbals, snare, and bass drums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A possible offshoot of the musikong bumbong are the various bamboo ensembles that were organized during the late 1950s, which employed bamboo instruments tuned diatonically like the bumbong, <b>talungating</b> (bamboo marimba), <b>tulali</b> (bamboo flute), <b>tipangklung</b> (bamboo piano), and angklung<i>. </i>An idiophone, the angklung<i> </i>is an indigenous bamboo instrument popular in Java, Indonesia. It was copied in the Philippines also in the late 1950s when replicas were made by bamboo instrument maker Victor Toledo, who included it, among other bamboo instruments that he made, in the ensemble he founded called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4112\"><strong>Pangkat Kawayan</strong></a> or the &ldquo;singing bamboos&rdquo; of the Philippines. Other manufacturers followed suit. Also called<i> </i><b>alugtug</b> or <b>tugtug na paalog</b> (played by shaking), angklung is played in groups, with each person playing an instrument traditionally in an interlocking or staccato manner. The angklung and the other diatonically tuned instruments, like the marimba, bumbong, talungating, tulali, tipangklung, angklung, mini tipangklung,<b> lira gabbang</b>, panpipes, chordal angklung, <b>kalagong</b>, <b>kalatok</b>, and <b>kalavien</b>, have been used in a variety of combinations by various bamboo ensembles all over the Philippines and in other countries as well, with repertoire varying from folk song, spiritual, modern to classical music for diverse occasions. Other manufacturers of bamboo instruments are Gilbert M. Ramos of Obando Musikong Bumbong<i> </i>(now called Musikawayan) and Siegfredo B. Calabig of PUP Banda Kawayan (now called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3891\"><strong>Banda Kawayan Pilipinas</strong></a>). The angklung is used in schools, universities, and the communities because the material is abundant and cheap. It is easily played by all ages and can be performed in any setting because of its interesting and beautiful sound. It may also be included in bamboo ensembles and other ensembles, like the <b>rondalla</b> (stringed instrument ensemble), and the orchestra. All these are factors for angklung&rsquo;s wide acceptance and popularity in the Philippines.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Pacita Narzo</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources: </strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Almario 2002; Almario and Almario 2007; Anastacio 2014; Bambooman [pseud] 2014; British Broadcasting Corporation 2014; Castro 2011; Center for Southeast Asian Studies 2014; Corpuz 2007; Dioquino 2014a, 2014b; Duldulao 1987; Filipino Biz 2013; Guillermo 2012; Henares 2013; Hila 2014; Klais 1977; Lakbay Pilipinas 2008, 2014; Lauterwald 2006; Lopez 2006; Maceda 1998; Ma&ntilde;alac 2014; <b><i>Manila Bulletin</i></b> 1998; Mercurio 2014; Miller 1912; New Tang Dynasty TV 2013; Puerto 2006; Pulumbarit 2013; Quirino 1995; Ramirez 1999; Ramos 2014; Reyes-Urtula and Arandez 1992; Rivera Mirano 1992, 1994; Roces 1977; Roxas-Wi 2006; Santiago 2014; Siojo 2014; TxTMania 2013; Watawat 2013.</p>\r\n"

This differentiates it from orchestral music where several players are assigned to one part. Generally, the number of parts is between three to eight, thus there are trios, quartets, sextets, septets, and octets. The instrumentation of these ensembles varies. Sometimes the ensemble is made up of one category of instruments, such as a string quartet (four strings) or a wind quintet (five winds). The instrumentation may be mixed, the most common combination being a piano trio (piano, violin, and cello). Chamber music places emphasis on the ensemble and not on the individual players, thus differing it from sonatas for one instrument and piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, early chamber compositions were represented in the works of the first generation of composers who received training abroad. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, the first University of the Philippines (UP) fellow sent to the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, presented his <b><i>String Quartet in G </i></b>as his graduation thesis for his master of music degree in 1924. Previous to this, his <b><i>Remembrance </i></b>for violin, cello, and piano, written in 1922, won third prize at an international contest sponsored by the <b><i>Chicago Daily News</i></b> in 1923. During studies at the same conservatory in Chicago, Nicanor S. Abelardo wrote his most enduring chamber music: <b><i>The Flower and the Bird </i></b>for flute, violin, and piano, <b><i>A Summer Idyll </i></b>for violin, clarinet, and piano, and <b><i>Panoramas </i></b>for violin, viola, celesta, and piano, all in 1931, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\"><strong>Sonata</strong></a> for String Quartet</i></b>, 1932.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antonio J. Molina, a noted cellist during his student years at the UP Conservatory of Music, counted among his chamber works string quartets like the <b><i>Pandangguhan </i></b>and <b><i>String Quartet</i></b>, both 1925; piano trios like <b><i>Trio in F </i></b>and<b><i> Luna no</i></b>.<b><i> 1</i></b>,<i> </i>both 1931; and a string quintet called <b><i>Quintetto en Do Mayor</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1929. The early chamber works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> (namely, <b><i>Love&rsquo;s Embrace</i></b>,<i> </i>1928;<i> <b>Children&rsquo;s Quartet</b></i>, 1935; and<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> Love Song </b></i>and <b><i>Piano Quintet</i></b>,<b> </b>both 1938) and Felipe Padilla de Leon (namely, <b><i>Night Dreams</i></b>, 1939) were in a style very similar to that of their teachers. Often these chamber works used folk song material or bore programmatic titles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The founding of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC) in 1955 further nurtured the growth of chamber music literature. The LFC organized annual festivals of Philippine music featuring the new works of its members. Commissions subsidized by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a> and, after 1969, by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) encouraged the writing of chamber works because, with the exception of the works cited previously, the chamber music repertoire of Filipino composers up until that time was sparse. In addition, from 1976, the LFC, in coordination with the CCP, sponsored nationwide annual competitions for young composers. These incentives brought forth a number of chamber works that showed influences of the prevailing American and European styles of the first half of the 20th century&mdash;namely, impressionism, expressionism, neoclassicism, atonality, and some aspects of the avant-garde.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Conventional instrumentation was used by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M.

Aside from the incentives provided by commissions and competitions, more chamber works are now being written, perhaps because public performance is more probable when only a small number of musicians are involved.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

In other ritual contexts, chants are the spirits&rsquo; voices themselves and are taken as a physical sign of the spirits providing guidance and assistance. These rites are often characterized by the medium going into a state of trance or &ldquo;possession&rdquo; as seen in the Kalinga <i>anito</i>, the Bataan Aeta <i>kagum</i>, the Tagalog <i>sanghiyang</i>, and Manobo <i>yana-an</i>. In many indigenous communities, elaborate versions of possession ceremonies entail animal sacrifices whose meat is eaten by both spirits and humans as an act of communion at the end of the rituals. Chants, however, may also be used in non-spiritual community gatherings, such as in the Maranao <i>bayok</i> or the Kalinga <i>ading</i>, <i>dango</i>, and <i>oggayam</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chant as a specie of verbal art is closely related to the performance of the epic, which is a long narrative about culture heroes. This narrative embodies indigenous cultural knowledge and mythology&mdash;as history would in literate societies&mdash;in the sense that it explains to culture bearers the origins of the cosmos, the natural order of things, and social values and beliefs. Philippine epics vary greatly in melody, rhythm, and performance practice so that they can be said to lie in a continuum between speech and song. A chant that is more speechlike would be governed more by the rhythm and intonation of the words, while a chant that is more songlike would emphasize sustained tones, constituting a melody that dominates the expression. Chants are principally learned and transmitted through an oral-formulaic process where a stock of textual verses or lines, normatively within the range of seven to eight syllables, are spontaneously fitted to preexisting musical contours of the tunes. With very few exceptions, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> <b>hudhud<i> </i></b>and <b>alim</b>,<b><i> </i></b>Philippine epics are usually unaccompanied and can be either syllabic (one syllable per note) or melismatic (one syllable to two or more notes). Most renditions of the epic are in free rhythm, thus warranting its chant status, such as the Kalinga <b><i>Ullalim </i></b>and <b><i>Gasumbi</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the Kinaray-a <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and certain sections in the Maguindanao <b><i>Diwata Kaslipan</i></b> and <b><i>Rajah Indarapatra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Bukidnon Manobo <b><i>Ulahingan</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Tboli<b><i> Tudbulol</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and the Sama<b><i> Kata-kata</i></b>. There are tunes, however, that are metered. In such cases, it becomes a chant or a song, depending on the text or the music governing the musical flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A vocal genre that is very popular in the Cordillera region of northern Philippines is the salidummay or <b>dewas</b>. Its text features seven-syllable verses. The first and second lines of the stanza are changing verses while the third and fourth lines feature fixed formulaic words, such as &ldquo;dangdang-ay sidong-ilay&rdquo; and &ldquo;insinalidumma-ay.&rdquo; This is why the salidummay is also referred to as <b>dangdang-ay</b><i> </i>(or <b>dongdong-ay</b>).<i> </i>Heard in social gatherings such as weddings and peace pacts, the salidummay has a repertoire of melodies usually in pentatonic scale. It may be rendered solo or in a chorus, often utilizing simple harmonization. A recent study implies that this genre may have been appropriated from the Western school and church songs that the Americans introduced to the peoples of the Cordillera region. In recent times, the salidummay has been sung with instrumental accompaniment, particularly with the guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bayok is a general term for &ldquo;song&rdquo; among the Maguindanao and Maranao people and is referred to as a love song among the Subanon of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. The Maranao bayok deals with various topics, such as praising important people in <b>bayok kapamodi</b>,<b> </b>narrating adventures of epic hero Bantugan in <b>bayok kandurangun</b>, expressing personal experiences in <b>bayok kapranon</b>,<i> </i>and disclosing about one&rsquo;s lost love in <b>bayok kaparongis</b>.<b> </b>Rendered solo and unaccompanied, the Maranao bayok features melismatic singing in loose meter and is performed by a professional singer called <b>onor</b><i> </i>or<i> </i><b>pabubayok</b>.<b> </b>Usually, a female bayok singer covers her mouth with a beautifully decorated fan when singing while a male performer places a fan on his chest. The onor or pabubayok is frequently invited to sing during festive gatherings called <i>kalilang</i>,<i> </i>and on other special occasions. The Maguindanao bayok, on the other hand, features a relatively syllabic singing style with limited vocal range. It is used to express, through metaphor, the singer&rsquo;s feelings and opinion on various topics, particularly about love and marriage. Like the Maranao bayok, the Maguindanao bayok is sung solo and unaccompanied. In the Maguindanao bayok, the performer&rsquo;s hand is placed on one cheek. The Subanon bayok generally features pairs of seven-syllable verses rendered in syllabic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">People in Mindanao and Sulu who profess a belief in Islam, like the Tausug, Maranao, and Maguindanao, render chanted prayers and religious songs in syllabic and melismatic styles. Among the Tausug, for example, the <b>lugu maulud</b><i> </i>is a song cycle with an Arabic text in prose called <i>janitla </i>and poetry called <i>jikil </i>about the birth and life of Muhammad. The lugu maulud is performed in a highly melismatic style by professional singers during celebrations of the Prophet&rsquo;s birthday. Another chant is the Tausug <b>tarasul</b>,<i> </i>which comments on some verses of the Quran and is used to express various aspects of Islam. The tarasul is also sung in memory of the dead and during the <i>pagtammat </i>or oral examination in Quran reading. Regular Friday noon service at a mosque is marked by a call to prayer called <i>bang </i>by the Maguindanao. The Islamic rite consists of a set of prayers that is accompanied by stereotyped body postures and hand gestures as main part of the service, which is closed by <i>lasib</i>,<b> </b>rendered in largely sustained ornamented high tones. An important chant during Ramadan or the month of fasting called <i>puwasa</i> by the Maguindanao is the <b>talawi</b>,<i> </i>which is sung in syllabic style on reciting tones and performed by a solo leader and answered by a chorus at the end of phrases with the word &ldquo;Muhammad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Western music, chant may refer to vocal music, which uses reciting tones in the rendering of texts as heard in church plainsongs of Christian liturgies. The Gregorian chant codified by Pope Gregory I (590-604) is one type of plainsong introduced in the Philippines by religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church. These chants, called <b>pasyon </b>and lectio,<b> </b>are sung in parallel harmony of thirds and are accompanied by a <b>cinco-cinco</b> (small five-stringed guitar). The most popular chant in lowland Christian cultures is the chant used for reading the pasyon, the verse narrative on the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ, which is read during the Lenten season&mdash;specifically, on Ash Wednesday, the Sundays of Lent, and Holy Week. In front of an altar of <i>santos</i> (saints),<i> </i>two or more chanters sing pasyon solo or antiphonally, using different styles called <b>punto</b>,<b> </b>among which are the <b>tres caidas</b><i> </i>and <b>deretso</b>.<b> </b>Related present-day practice is evidenced in Cagayan Valley during the Holy Week and in connection with death or the prevention of sickness, as seen in some Ibanag and Itawes plainsongs in neumatic notations copied by hand from the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong>Procession</strong></a>arium Sacri Ordinis Predicatorum</i></b>, 1861. Other times, a six-stringed Western-type guitar called <b>sista </b>among the Ibanag or <b>siesta </b>among the Itawes is used.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

Types of song arrangement vary according to the combination of vocal types&mdash;that is, soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), bass (B)&mdash;for which the arrangement is done. Combinations could include SAB, SB, SSAA, SSA, SA, TTBB, and TB. SSAA, SSA, and SA could refer to either adult or children&rsquo;s choir. The limits on highest and lowest notes, the timbre or vocal color (dark and bright sounds), the flexibility to sing with a full voice and running passages, and the competency of the choir (amateur, professional, church, civic, school, etc.) are important factors in song arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The textbook <b><i>The Progressive Music Series</i></b>, first published in 1915 and many times thereafter, the <b><i>Philippine National Chorus Collection</i></b>, 1930, and <b><i>Mga Tinipong Panabayang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>ing Pilipino </i></b>(Collected Philippine Songs for Chorus), 1969, are some of the pioneering collections of Filipino choral music arrangements.

Only a limited number of collections have been published locally, and even less sheet music or collections have been published internationally. Most choral arrangements have been originally for the solo voice in genres like <b>kundiman</b> (love song), pop,<b> </b>Original Pilipino Music (OPM), and Broadway. Examples of these are Nicanor Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\"><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong></a>&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig) arranged for mixed chorus by Lucio San Pedro, and his &ldquo;Ultimo Adios&rdquo; (Last Farewell) arranged by Liwanag Cruz also for mixed chorus. OPM was quickly transformed in the 1980s and the 1990s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Umiikot Sumisirko&rdquo; (Turn and Somersault) from <b><i>Hibang sa Awit</i></b> (Crazy for Songs) was arranged for the SATB choir by Robert Delgado. Cayabyab transformed his Metro Manila Popular Music Festival-winning piece, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/915\"><strong>Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika</strong></a>&rdquo; (How Beautiful Is Our Music), by rearranging it for mixed chorus. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4002\"><strong>Gary Granada</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bahay&rdquo; (Home), also a prizewinner in the Metro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\"><strong>Pop Music</strong></a> Festival, was adapted for a cappella choir in the UP Madrigal Singers&rsquo; version and with piano accompaniment in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4204\"><strong>UP Concert Chorus</strong></a> version by Delgado. The songs &ldquo;Mabuti Pa Sila&rdquo; (They&rsquo;re Lucky) by Granada and &ldquo;Isang Dugo, Isang Lahi, Isang Musika&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Blood, One Race, One Music) by Dodjie Simon, both winners in the Metro Pop Music Festival, were set for chorus by Deogracias Cruz and Delgado, respectively. The latter became part of standard Filipino choral repertoire in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Previous to this, it was common for folk songs to be remade into choral arrangements. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, Lucrecia Kasilag, Lucio San Pedro, Eliseo Pajaro, and Resti Umali were the main proponents of setting Filipino folk songs for choirs of mixed and equal voices. Santiago harmonized the earliest attempts at organized collection of Filipino folk songs. Kasilag wrote &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/886\"><strong>Dandansoy</strong></a>&rdquo; (Unfaithful) for both equal and mixed voices. She also based her Republic Cultural Heritage-winning piece <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>ng Tagalog</i></b> (Tagalog Mass) for chorus on Mindanao and Cordillera folk tunes. San Pedro has a published collection of folk melodies arranged for chorus, titled <b><i>Mga Katutubong Awitin, Isinaayos para sa Koro</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a>s Arranged for Chorus).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indeed, through the decades, the need to enrich the repertories of choirs in the country created a distinguished pool of Filipino choral arrangers. With more Filipino choirs participating in international festivals and competitions that require choral setting of folk songs from home countries, Filipino choral works are gaining exposure outside the Philippines. Some of the favorite works among local groups that have permeated the international choral scene are Delarmente&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ilay Gandangan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dumbele,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/983\"><strong>Pokpok Alimpako</strong></a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pamugun,&rdquo; Eudenice Palaruan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gapas&rdquo;<i> </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a>), George Hernandez&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/649\"><strong>Rosas</strong></a></strong></a> Pandan&rdquo; (Rose of Pandan), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4060\"><strong>Elmo Makil</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iddem-dem Mallida.&rdquo; The Tagalog folk song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\"><strong>Paruparong Bukid</strong></a>&rdquo; (Country Butterfly) has such charm that, at different times, Noli Laureola, George Hernandez, and Robin Estrada arranged it for chorus. All three arrangements have gained a popular following on both sides of the Atlantic, and both local and foreign choirs have their noteworthy performances posted on YouTube. Also very popular among foreign groups are Obispo&rsquo;s choral setting of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/884\"><strong>Dahil sa Iyo</strong></a>&rdquo; (Because of You) and Hernandez&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/991\"><strong>Rosas Pandan</strong></a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the individually published choral arrangements are &ldquo;Telebong,&rdquo; arr. Obispo, 1970; &ldquo;Da-Ba-Da&rdquo; [on &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/938\"><strong>Manang Biday</strong></a>&rdquo;], arr. Reynaldo Paguio, 1969; &ldquo;Dayo Dayo Kupita,&rdquo; arr. Santos, 1971; and &ldquo;Dahil sa Iyo&rdquo; (Because of You), arr. Obispo, 1969. The aforementioned arrangements were part of the Filipino series publication by the UP Madrigal Singers. The group also published a collection of songs from their repertoire, titled <b><i>Mga Awiting Bayan</i></b><i> </i>(Folk Songs). Madrigal Singers choirmaster Andrea Veneracion edited both the series and the book. Some of the songs in the book are &ldquo;Waway,&rdquo; arr. Palaruan; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\"><strong>Pamulinawen</strong></a>,&rdquo; arr. Feliciano; &ldquo;Manang Biday,&rdquo; arr.

Santos; &ldquo;Con Harapit Na an Adlaw&rdquo; (When the Day Is about to End) arr. Federizon; and &ldquo;Pokpok Alimpako,&rdquo; arr. Feliciano. These songs have become part of the standard repertoire of Filipino choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UP Concert Chorus also published San Pedro&rsquo;s choral works, titled the <b><i>Choral Works of Lucio San Pedro</i></b>. It includes the classic &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/993\"><strong>Sa Mahal Kong Bayan</strong></a>&rdquo; (For My Beloved Country), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1005\"><strong>Simbanggabi</strong></a>&rdquo; (Dawn Mass), and the choral setting of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1009\"><strong>Suite Pastorale</strong></a></i></b> in four parts: &ldquo;Abot Tanaw&rdquo; (Horizon), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/447\"><strong>Dapit</strong></a>hapon&rdquo; (Dusk), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/994\"><strong>Sa Ugoy ng Duyan</strong></a>&rdquo; (In the Cradle&rsquo;s Rocking), and &ldquo;Pistahan sa Nayon&rdquo; (Barrio Fiesta).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">San Pedro&rsquo;s collection of choral arrangements, <b><i>Mga Katutubong Awitin: Isinaayos para sa Koro</i></b>, published by Antonina Siapuatco, includes well-loved folk songs from the Tagalog, Visayas, and Ilocos regions, such as &ldquo;Aking Bituin&rdquo; (My Star), &ldquo;Pandangguhan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Atin Cu Pung Singsing&rdquo; (I Have a Ring), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/930\"><strong>Lulay</strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/855\"><strong>Ay Kalisud</strong></a>!&rdquo; (How Difficult!), &ldquo;Ili, Ili, Tulog Anay&rdquo; (Hush, Hush, My Baby), &ldquo;Magtanim Hindi Biro&rdquo; (Planting Rice Is Not Easy), &ldquo;Rosas Pandan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ti Ayat ti Meysa nga Ubing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Walang Kalungkutan&rdquo; or &ldquo;No Dua-Duaem Pay&rdquo; (If You Still Doubt My Love).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another important publication of local and foreign songs was made, this time by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Ongsiako, editor of the <b><i>Sundry Choral Series</i></b>.

Alejandro Consolacion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pater Noster&rdquo; was published by Hinshaw Music, Inc. For lack of music publishers in the Philippines, local choral music writers have also published their own works. Delgado came out with a collection titled <b><i>The Choral Works of Robert Delgado</i></b>, which is actually a compilation of the author&rsquo;s choral arrangements. The group Kompositor published its members&rsquo; choral music in a compilation titled <b><i>Pagbubunyi: Original Works for Unaccompanied Mixed Chorus</i></b>. Notable in this collection are Joy Nilo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Umawit Kayo sa Panginoon&rdquo; (Sing to the Lord), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3886\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Joed Balsamo</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amahan Namo&rdquo; (Our Father), and Alejandro Consolacion II&rsquo;s &ldquo;Veni, Creator Spiritus&rdquo; (Come, Created Spirit).

The first was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a>&rsquo; concert titled <b><i>Premiere</i> </b>held in 2013 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo. The group presented works of both foreign and local origin. Those written by Filipinos were Nilo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ayat, Asi Ken Kinalinteng&rdquo; (Love, Mercy and Righteousness), Palaruan&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Musician&rsquo;s Prayer,&rdquo; Alejandro Consolacion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Signore, Fa di Me Uno Strumento della Tua Pace&rdquo; (Lord, Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace), Ily Matthew Maniano&rsquo;s &ldquo;Euphonos,&rdquo; and Nilo Alcala&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ceremonial Burning.&rdquo; The other event was called <b><i>Likhawit: First Contemporary Choral Festival</i></b>, 2014, a UP College of Music co-production with the Asian Composers League and the Philippine Choral Directors Association. The concert&rsquo;s repertoire included Muyco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tinala&rdquo; (Imaging Stars), De la Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kalo-ob&rdquo; (Offering of One Spirit), Felice Macahis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nuageux&rdquo; (Cloudy), Balsamo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dakop-Dakop&rdquo; (Catch Me If You Can), Robin Estrada&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paghahandog&rdquo; (Offering), Toledo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sitsit Digudak&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kredo,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Banal-Pasakit&rdquo; (Holy Sacrifice), and Katherine Tranco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Salitaan&rdquo;<i> </i>(Saying).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Organizations that have encouraged the production of music arrangements are the NAMCYA, NCCA, UP Madrigal Singers, UP Concert Chorus, and UP Cherubim &amp; Seraphim. Many new choirs are joining the ranks, with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4207\"><strong>UP Singing Ambassadors</strong></a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4209\"><strong>UST Singers</strong></a> leading the pack. The University of the East Chorale, Ateneo<br />\r\nCollege Glee Club, Manila Chamber Singers, and many other groups follow the established groups in commissioning new choral works and arrangements as required by their participation in international festivals and competitions. The Children&rsquo;s Museum and Library, Inc&rsquo;s (CMLI) annual high schools choral competition Voices in Harmony, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation&rsquo;s (PAGCOR) Christmas Choral Competition, and the Philippine Civil Service Commission&rsquo;s (CSC) annual Government Choral Competition also require newly arranged music. The CMLI leans toward the popular genre since it caters to high school choirs from both private and public institutions. The PAGCOR competition enriches the Christmas choral repertoire for the season-themed songs it requires. The CSC government choral competition emphasizes civic-themed or patriotic songs that are arranged for chorus.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Mauricia D.

It is patterned after the sonata form, although with some distinguishing features. Instead of the four-movement sonata structure, the concerto is normally set in three movements (fast-slow-fast), omitting the minuet or scherzo. The first movement is cast in a modified sonata-allegro form called concerto-allegro. The three main parts of a sonata-allegro (exposition-development-recapitulation) are retained. However, in the concerto-allegro, the repeat sign for the exposition is dispensed with and instead, the exposition is written out twice, the first time for orchestra and the second time for soloist and orchestra. The last movement is almost always cast in rondo form. Brilliant cadenza passages, designed to showcase the soloists&rsquo; technical skills, appear in the first movement just before the recapitulation and occasionally in the other movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The standard three-movement concerto form was crystallized in the 18th century with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\"><strong>Wolfgang</strong></a> Amadeus Mozart and Franz Joseph Haydn. In the 19th century, one-movement concertos became fashionable. On a less ambitious scale than the concerto, the single movement featured sections with changing speeds and characters. They were called concertino or <b>konzertst&uuml;ck</b>. The repertory of concertos by Filipino composers consisted mainly of concertos for piano or violin, with a few written for other instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before the 1950s, only about 10 works were written in this genre. The majority of these works exhibited nationalist sentiments in their use of folklike melodies as thematic material. Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> in B-Flat Minor for Piano and Orchestra, Opus 12</i> </b>was the first large work by a Filipino to utilize folk melodies. It was premiered in an all-Filipino concert in Sep 1923, together with works by Tereso Zapata, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4021\"><strong>Cayetano Jacobe</strong></a>, and Juan S. Hernandez, all colleagues at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music. In 1924, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> presented his <b><i>Piano Concerto in B- Flat Minor </i></b>for his doctoral dissertation at the Chicago <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> College. Its three movements used folk tunes: &ldquo;Moderato e Maestoso&rdquo; used the Cebuano <b>balitaw</b> (love verses), &ldquo;Andante Amoroso&rdquo; the <b>kundiman</b> (love song) and <b>awit </b>(metrical romance),<b> </b>and &ldquo;Allegro Scherzando&rdquo; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/471\"><strong>San Roque</strong></a> &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/924\"><strong>Leron-Leron Sinta</strong></a>&rdquo; (Leron-Leron Beloved) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/886\"><strong>Dandansoy</strong></a>&rdquo; (Unfaithful). At the same school, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3942\"><strong>Rodolfo S. Cornejo</strong></a> performed <b><i>Piano Concerto in D Minor</i></b>, his master&rsquo;s thesis at the commencement concert.<i> </i>Other works by Cornejo, also for piano and orchestra in the konzertst&uuml;ck form, were <b><i>Philippine Rhapsodies</i> <i>nos. 1</i></b>,<i> </i>1939, <b><i>2</i></b>, 1942, and <b><i>3</i></b>, 1947. A previous work in the konzertst&uuml;ck genre was composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, <b><i>Rhapsodietta</i> <i>for Piano and Orchestra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1937, based on a Manobo theme collected during his research in the south when he was with the UP President&rsquo;s Committee on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a>s and Dance. Juan S. Hernandez, a graduate and later faculty member of the UP Conservatory during director Santiago&rsquo;s incumbency in the 1930s, wrote the <b><i>Piano Concerto in D Minor</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>It was cast in the traditional three-movement concerto structure. Though no folk tunes were quoted, the thematic material was folklike, supported by rich chromatic harmonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From this same period, concertos for violin and orchestra included violin virtuoso Conrado de la Cruz&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto in D Major</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto in F Major</i></b>,<i> </i>and Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto for Violin and</i> <i>Orchestra </i></b>in one movement. The scores of these works, however, are no longer extant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Concertos composed in the 1940s were those by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>, Lucio D. San Pedro, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a>. Buencamino&rsquo;s opus was programmatic in nature. Titled <b><i>Mayon Concerto</i></b>,<i> </i>1942, its three movements portrayed the gaiety of a fiesta in the Bicol countryside that had been interrupted by a violent eruption of the volcano, followed by the return of peace and calm, and ending with a hymn of thanksgiving. The first movement was premiered by pianist Corazon Langcauon at St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College in 1943. The first performance of the complete work was on 5 Feb 1950 at the graduation recital of the composer&rsquo;s daughter, Rosario Buencamino, at Holy Ghost College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s only work in the concerto medium, <b><i>Concerto for Violin and Orchestra</i></b>,<i> </i>was composed in 1948. Its three movements used folklike themes. The basis of the final movement was a motif derived from an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> tune, &ldquo;Naantoay.&rdquo; Celia Sucgang played the concerto for the first time in 1958 with the Filipino Youth Symphony Orchestra conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rosendo Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Concerto no. 1 in G Major</i></b>, 1948, and <b><i>Piano Concerto no. 2 in A Major</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1956, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><strong>Amada</strong></a> Santos-Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Concerto in A Minor</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1957, were written before they left for further studies abroad. The works were conventional in tonality and form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For a long time after the 1950s, composers continued to express their nationalist sentiments by writing works based on folk songs, as seen in Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Konzertst&uuml;ck for Violin and Orchestra</i></b>,<i> </i>1952, and Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Divertimento for Piano</i> <i>and Orchestra</i></b>,<i> </i>1965,<b> </b>based on a Cordillera theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Others, opting for the romantic programmatic style of the West in vogue at the turn of the century, gave their works more general descriptive titles, adding impressionistic touches and dissonances to a traditionally chromatic harmonic idiom. Particularly noted for his compositions in this mode is Alfredo S. Buenaventura, whose four concertos all bore descriptive titles: <b><i>Celebration </i></b>piano concerto,<i> </i>1977,<i> <b>Exultation </b></i>piano concerto,<b><i> </i></b>1978, <b><i>Determination</i></b> piano concerto,<b><i> </i></b>1980, and <b><i>Lakambini </i></b>(Muse)<b><i> </i></b>violin concerto,<b><i> </i></b>1983. Lucino T. Sacramento also gave graphic, evocative titles to his piano concertos: <b><i>Cradle Concerto</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1959, <b><i>Ang Maharlika </i></b>(The Nobility), 1974, and <b><i>Ang Bituin</i></b> (The Star),<b><i> </i></b>1975. His <b><i>Cradle Concerto</i></b> for piano<b><i> </i></b>was commissioned by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a> (MPFP) in 1959. The first movement conveyed the composer&rsquo;s exhilaration with the arrival of a first grandchild. The languid middle movement was reminiscent of a Philippine lullaby, &ldquo;Hili Na&rdquo; (Hush Now), while the finale expressed the joy of a fulfilled grandparent. Sacramento&rsquo;s violin concertos, <b><i>E Minor</i></b>,<b> </b>1969, and <b><i>D Minor</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1976, though untitled, were nevertheless descriptive. In the second movement of his first violin concerto, the composer painted a picture of a reposeful sea caressed by the afternoon wind as it caught the last drops of sunset. Also in the programmatic, romantic vein were Hilarion F. Rubio&rsquo;s <b><i>Panamin Concerto</i></b>, 1970,<b><i> </i></b>for cello,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>San Abel Concerto</i></b>, 1984,<b><i> </i></b>for B-flat clarinet, as well as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3848\"><strong>Rosalina Abejo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Aeolian Piano Concerto</i></b>,<i> </i>1954;<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a></b></i>, 1957,<b><i> </i></b>for marimba;<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Jubilee</i></b>, 1978,<b><i> </i></b>for piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After their studies in the United States, composers Rodolfo S. Cornejo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a> returned home with new compositional techniques. Cornejo produced three concertos after earning his doctor&rsquo;s degree in composition: <b><i>Second Piano Concerto in G Minor</i></b>,<b> </b>1950,<i> <b>Third Piano Concerto</b></i>,<b><i> </i></b>1968, and <b><i>Concerto for Violin and Orchestra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1972. <b><i>The Third Piano Concerto </i></b>had a clear-cut classical structure. In the second movement, a Tagalog <b>pabasa chant</b> was used as the main theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More significant contributions to the concerto genre were made by Eliseo M. Pajaro, whose works introduced new sounds strongly influenced by the neoclassic style of Paul Hindemith and a type of counterpoint based on pandiatonic harmonic structures. The first of four concertos, the <b><i>Violin Concerto no. 1</i></b><i> </i>in three movements, was commissioned by the MPFP. It was written in 1960 while the composer was in New York on a Guggenheim fellowship. Premiered in 1964 with Divinagracia Montalban as soloist, the work won for Pajaro his first Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1964. Typically neoclassic in style, the first movement was in the traditional concerto-allegro form, followed by the slow movement in modified third rondo form. The last movement was a series of eight variations with the theme making a final appearance before the last variation. His <b><i>Concerto for Piano and Orchestra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1964, was premiered at a festival of Philippine music sponsored by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC). Soloist was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4024\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Regalado Jose</strong></a></strong></a>. In May 1965, cellist Herminia Atienza Ilano played the <b><i>Concerto for Cello and Orchestra </i></b>at a festival of Philippine music held at the UP. The composer himself conducted the UP Symphony Orchestra at this performance. Pajaro&rsquo;s last concerto, <b><i>Violin Concerto no. 2</i></b>, was jointly commissioned in 1974 by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) and the LFC, and performed at the annual Festival of Philippine Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lucrecia R. Kasilag is known for her blending of Eastern and Western elements in her music. She was influenced by the neoclassicism prevailing in the United States during her studies there. Upon her return, her exposure to Philippine indigenous music led her to combine the Asian elements with her newly acquired techniques. Her three-movement <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/888\"><strong>Divertissement for Piano and Orchestra</strong></a></i></b>, 1960, was a whimsy on Muslim folk rhythms and themes with a neomodal flavor. The first movement employed the <i>singkil </i>rhythm as ground bass over a simple melody that used only the white keys of the piano. The second movement was a variation on a Muslim chant <b>dende-o-dende</b>,<b> </b>with an underlying syncopated ostinato. The last movement was in form featuring a rhythm juxtaposing twos and threes. Her <b><i>Violin Concerto</i></b>,<i> </i>1983, also followed the traditional classic three-movement structure. The canonic treatment of the second movement contrasted with the freer form of the finale, which utilizes changing tempi&mdash;allegro, andante, vivace. It was premiered by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4050\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4052\"><strong>Carmencita Lozada</strong></a></strong></a> on 26 Feb 1983, with Francisco F. Feliciano as conductor. Kasilag composed <b><i>Violin Concerto no. 2</i></b> in 1994, premiered by the Russian violinist Grigori Zhislin in a tribute concert in her honor at the CCP in August 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The composers whose works dominated the creative musical scene in the 1970s and 1980s include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a>, Francisco F. Feliciano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> M. de Leon, Manuel P. Maramba, OSB, and Jerry A. Dadap. Their works that bear the impact of the New Music movement did not include the concerto genre. Feliciano, Dadap, and de Leon&rsquo;s contributions to this genre were written before they had been abroad. These include Dadap&rsquo;s <b><i>Violin Concerto</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1965-66, de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Vertigo: Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra</i></b>, 1970, and Feliciano&rsquo;s <b><i>Violin Concerto</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1972. Manuel P. Maramba, OSB, received his musical training in piano, organ, and composition in the United States and Europe. His works showed a preference for serialism. Unlike his contemporaries who chose not to write concertos, he wrote a <b><i>Concerto for Piano</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1983, which featured an unusual mix of <b>kulintang </b>sounds with an alliterated running passage for the piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The yearly commissions and festivals of Philippine works conducted by the LFC and the CCP encouraged its members to write works for orchestra. Thus, in the 1980s, the older generation of composers wrote concertos, which departed in style from the conventional harmonic traditions they previously employed. New tonal combinations and textures surfaced in Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s one-movement <b><i>Concerto for Flute and Orchestra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1980, dedicated to flutist Santiago Yangco, who was the featured soloist at its premiere. Antonino Buenaventura wrote his works in the concerto form<i> <b>Parangal</b> </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te), a three-movement concerto for piano and symphonic band, 1982,<i> <b>Concerto for Trumpet</b></i>,<b><i> </i></b>1985, and <b><i>Concerto for French Horn</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1987. Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a, a jazz bassist, carefully integrated jazz idioms with modern harmonic techniques in his <b><i>Concerto for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Quartet and Orchestra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1981. Earlier, he composed <b><i>Concerto for Double Bass and Orchestra</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1969, which was followed by <b><i>Concerto no. 2 for Double Bass</i></b>, 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The very few recent additions to the concerto repertoire include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\"><strong>Chino Toledo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ekontra: Kongruo: Lunctum</i></b>, 2004, for piano and orchestra; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3938\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3939\"><strong>Jeffrey Ching</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Concerto da Camara</i></b>,<i> </i>2009, which was actually a work for solo guitar, solo violoncello, soprano, and 20 strings<i>. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In retrospect, the more than 50 compositions written in the multi-movement concerto and single movement or konzertst&uuml;ck genre by Filipino composers are widely divergent in style. From the first concerto, written in 1923, to those written in the past decade, the repertory testifies to the growth and development of Philippine art music.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

Music that is part of the represented scene is termed <b>diegetic</b> or <b>source music</b>; that which is external to the narrative is termed <b>non-diegetic</b> or <b>extradiegetic</b>. In diegetic music, characters in the film can hear the music that is part of the fictional world being depicted or which they inhabit. This contrasts with the extradiegetic music, also called the <b>score</b>, which can only be heard by the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music has three fundamental functions in Philippine films: (1) as accompaniment to silent film images; (2) as scoring, using existing or original music, which deepens the mood of the scene and the emotions of characters; and (3) as theme song, the elements of which become the basis for further musical variations that enhance the visual sequences. In principle, the second and third uses may overlap as required by this integrative audiovisual medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Music for the Silent Film</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first film was shown in the Philippines on 8 Sep 1897 by Swiss business partners Leibman and Peritz. They screened several Lumiere films, using a lumiere cinematograph. The show was accompanied by music provided by a guitarist under maestro Francisco P. de Barbat. The next year, 1898, Antonio Ramos, a Spanish military officer from Barcelona presented his own program of films, including those that he himself had shot in the Philippines, like <b><i>Escenas Callejeras</i></b> (Street Scenes), <b><i>Fiesta de Quiapo </i></b>(Quiapo Fiesta), and <b><i>Panorama de Manila</i></b> (Manila Panorama). Ramos is considered the first person to shoot a film in Manila. In 1905, Herbert Wyndham of the Edison Biograph also shot scenes in the Manila Fire Department (Sotto 1992, 5-6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music accompaniment was needed in silent films to muffle the noise of the projector, which probably was overwhelming, given the fact that the early films in the Philippines were shown in a small room adjacent to a store and the audience was seated near the projector. Moreover, early films had to compete with live public entertainments such as <i>bailes</i> (dances held in clubs and theaters) and the popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong><em>sarsuwela</em></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1902 until the erection of Albert Yearsley&rsquo;s Majestic Theater of 1912, which was large enough to be described as the first building solely dedicated to films, the screening of films, especially those managed by Walgraph, was billed with sarsuwela, songs, and musical interludes. But because they could not yet compete with the sarsuwela, which was the dominant genre of public entertainment, films rode on the popularity of the form. Thus, in 1906, the Cinematografo-Teatro Cervantes showed films as enticers, front acts, or divertissements to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2936\"><strong>Praxedes Fernandez</strong></a>&rsquo;s zarzuela, <b><i>Sensitiva</i></b>. In the advertisement for this zarzuela, the titles of films were not even announced, manifesting their low value compared to the main entertainment. Besides, up until 1909, only a limited number of films, mainly those from Pathe in France, were shown in Manila again and again, and so the medium quickly lost its novelty.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The orchestras for film were small chamber music ensembles, similar or identical to those that played in the sarsuwela. From 1902 to 1910, musicians involved in accompanying films were  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\">JoseEstella</a></strong>, with the Rizal orchestra quintet, at the Cinematografo-Teatro Nuevo Cervantes in 1905; Pedro Madariaga who directed music for the Gran Cinematografo Filipino in 1905 and the Gran Cinematografo del Oriente in 1906; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>, with Sexteto Orquesta Rizal, at the Gran Cinematografo-Teatro Cervantes in 1906; Manuel Egea who was in the Gran Teatro-Cinematografo Libertad; and Jose Vedal and Henri Niviere at the Walgraph. Except for Estella, a Filipino whose career was already well established in Manila, it was the foreign musicians who dominated the exhibition and marketing of film entertainment in Philippine cities. After Pedro Madariaga left the Gran Cinematografo del Oriente, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>replaced him as the director of the orchestra. Estella, Abdon, and Buencamino were therefore three of the important film music practitioners in early silent films. From them, the next generation of urban Filipino musicians, such as piano players <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>, would learn how to eke out a living by playing the piano to accompany silent films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the absence of archival data, it is not known specifically how the chamber music ensembles or orchestras from 1902 to 1910, and later the piano, managed to accompany the films&mdash;specifically, how they matched their music to the visuals&rsquo; narratives. What is clear, however, is that music was still just an arbitrary accessory to the images because music was performed ad hoc and was external to its production; it was added later in real time and was not part of the making of the film product. The repertory of music in silent films came from different foreign sources; but as years went by, local music must have been used more and more. Evidence of many extant collections of semiclassical music for small ensembles and piano albums from the period, many of which had simplified arrangements of popular classical music, would seem to prove that film musicians were quite equipped to tackle the wide range of moods and sentiments embodied in the projected images and narratives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the first American-owned movie production companies started to produce original films in the 1910s, there was an impetus to make music more expressive of the film&rsquo;s narrative, and sounds began to be organically connected to the visuals. Scoring, which appropriated canned music, was made through phonographs and records when these became available beginning 1910. Some theater owners utilized gramophones to substitute for live music performance in order to fill in the aural vacuum in silent films and to save up on the cost of employing live musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Canned music paralleled the stock music in albums which comprised of classical music with light and easy arrangements that were played by small music ensembles and pianists. However, phonographs were fragile machines with tiny sounds and not as reliable as pianos whose industrial cast-iron strength and versatility were unmatched by any other instrument. In some cases, the songs that were supposed to be performed by actors on-screen were dubbed live by actors who sang behind the screen, in sync with the screen images. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\"><strong>Jose Nepomuceno</strong></a>&rsquo;s production of <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b> (Country Maiden), a film adaptation of the highly successful <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Ilagan-Ignacio</strong>  <strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> of the same title in 1919, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\"><strong>Atang</strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">de la Rama</a> </strong> herself came on stage to sing &ldquo;Nabasag ang Banga&rdquo; (The Claypot Broke) in sync with the movements of her own image on-screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade of 1910s was an important time in Philippine film history, for it was then when films began to be locally produced. Then American resident Albert Yearsley was said to be the first to produce films locally. These were mostly documentaries of local events and historical subjects. His sensational 20-minute fictional film on the death of Rizal titled <b><i>La Pasion y Muerte de Dr. Rizal</i></b> (The Passion and Death of Dr Rizal), alternately called <b><i>El Fusilamiento de Dr.  <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b> (The Execution of Dr  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a></strong> ), was hurriedly shot in 1912 to compete with the American tandem of Harry Brown and Edward Meyer Gross who were going to screen in the same month the hour-long <b><i>La Vida de Jose Rizal</i></b> (The Life of Jose Rizal). What types of music accompanied these two Rizal films are not known, but by that time, there were already numerous pieces of music commemorating Rizal&rsquo;s death and heroism that musicians could choose from. Later on, American films that were locally produced depicted cultural practices like the pilgrimage to Antipolo, which both Yearsley and Brown-Gross produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s, Nicanor Abelardo&rsquo;s generation was succeeded by musicians like Spanish criollo Benito Trapaga, Miguel Velarde, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos Jr</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\"><strong>Leon Ignacio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3958\"><strong>Constancio de Guzman</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\"><strong>Ariston Avelino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4274\"><strong>Tito Arevalo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\"><strong>Santiago Suarez</strong></a>, and Spanish expatriate concert pianist  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3867\">Julio Esteban Anguita</a></strong>. There were no hard-and-fast rules on how the necessary piano music supplement could be realized in theater. But considering the expertise of Filipino musicians in composing for live musical theater, local music such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><em>kundiman</em></strong></a>, <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a></em>, and <b>danza</b> must have been utilized to meet the emotional requirements of the scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The practice of using canned music during the silent film era was to continue in sound films from the 1930s all the way to 1960s. It is still practiced in contemporary TV production. Canned music is properly called appropriated scores, which means music by composers other than the music director of the film, and it was definitely inferior to live performances, which were tailored to the specific communicative requirement of the film&rsquo;s narrative. Besides, canned music can never fully express the complexity of moods and emotions in a film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The extant scores of Jose Estella&rsquo;s &ldquo;Un Escena Musical en Antipolo&rdquo; (A Musical Scene in Antipolo) and &ldquo;Es La Virgen de Antipolo: Escena 161&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s the Virgin of Antipolo: Scene 161), now archived at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music Library, are original film music scores made either for Yearsley&rsquo;s or Brown-Gross&rsquo;s film in the mid-1910s or perhaps during the early 1930s. Which version was composed for whose film on Antipolo cannot be determined. The number &ldquo;161&rdquo; marked on the piece &ldquo;Es La Virgen de Antipolo&rdquo; in red-colored pencil would suggest that this score was linked to an original playscript, which may have been for a silent or a sound film. Other extant Jose Estella film music scores of the period that are now in UP are &ldquo;Ang Buhay ng Mangingisda&rdquo; (The Life of a Fisherman), a song from the film <b><i>Ang Uliran</i></b> (The Ideal) with words by Ilagan, and &ldquo;Apache Vals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Music in Pre-World War II Sound Films </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The establishment of the movie studio system in the country&mdash;with companies like the Nepomuceno-Harris-Tait partnership <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\"><strong>Filippine Films</strong></a>, 1934; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\"><strong>Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</strong></a>, 1935; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>, 1937;  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a></strong>, 1939; and X&rsquo;Otic Films, 1939&mdash;was a watershed in the history of Philippine film music. The task of synchronizing dialogue and environment sound with image involved other tasks such as dubbing, music recording, playback recording (a type of lip-synching), and rerecording. A well-known singer who did the singing voice of non-singing vedettes was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4720\"><strong>Fely Vallejo</strong></a>, who later married director Gerardo de Leon. The clapper device was necessary for syncing sound recording and image into separate tracks in the reels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film music score, technically speaking, therefore only arrived when the talking picture or sound movie technology became available. The first film of this kind in the Philippines was George Musser&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b> (The Aswang) produced by Manila Talktone in 1932. Not long after, Jose Nepomuceno, the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Movies,&rdquo; made <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\"><b><i><strong>Punyal na Ginto</strong> </i></b></a> (Golden Dagger), 1933, the first Filipino sound film. At that time, because the technology was new and the synchronization of sound and image was a challenge, Nepomuceno had to seek the help of American producer George Harris and his Hollywood technical team. Because there is no extant copy of Nepomuceno&rsquo;s film, one is deprived of describing the film score as an object of analysis and criticism. Nonetheless, in Harris&rsquo;s film <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b>, 1936, which was a joint project of Filipino and foreign technical crews, one witnesses the incorporation of classic Hollywood techniques in Edward Kilenyi&rsquo;s film scoring, which was composed in Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are five extant films from 1938 to 1941, which allow us to discuss the different uses of film music before it blossomed in the 1950s, a golden age of Philippine cinema. These films were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a></i></b>, 1937, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4369\"><strong>Eduardo de Castro</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><b><i><strong>Giliw Ko</strong> </i></b></a> (My Love), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\"><strong>Carlos Vander Tolosa</strong></a>, 1939; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a></i></b> (Real Mother), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4685\"><strong>Octavio Silos</strong></a>, 1939; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Pakiusap</strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Plea), directed by Octavio Silos, 1940; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\"><b><i>Ibong  <strong>Adarna</strong> </i></b></a> (Adarna Bird), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\"><strong>Vicente Salumbides</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>, 1941. <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b> was a south sea adventure film, <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b> and <b><i>Pakiusap </i></b>were romances, <b><i>Tunay na Ina </i></b>was a melodrama with music, and <b><i><strong> <strong><strong>Ibong Adarna</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> was mythological. Their being musical unmistakably had its influence from the Filipino sarsuwela tradition, and therefore they can be called  <strong>sarsuwela films</strong> &mdash;a term  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a></strong> coined for films that are made in the sarsuwela tradition, as opposed to filmed sarsuwela or an already existing sarsuwela made into film like <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b> and <b><i><strong>Walang Sugat</strong> </i></b>(No Wounds). Sarsuwela film music style was one that developed internally, even if there were some influences from Hollywood. Other sarsuwela films were Carlos Vander Tolosa&rsquo;s <b><i>Nasaan Ka</i></b> <b><i>Irog </i></b>(Where Are You, Beloved?) 1937, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong> <strong>Bituing Marikit</strong> </strong></a> </i></b>(Beautiful Star), 1937, and <b><i>Madaling Araw </i></b>(Break of Dawn), 1938; Octavio Silos&rsquo;s <b><i>Paruparong</i></b> <b><i>Bukid </i></b>(Country Butterfly), 1938; and Santiago Suarez&rsquo;s <b><i>Magbalik Ka Hirang </i></b>(Come Back, My Love), 1940. No copies of these films have survived, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The majority of the musical numbers in these pre-World War II films were newly composed by Edward Kilenyi for <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b>, Juan Silos Jr and Ariston Avelino for <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, Miguel Velarde Jr and Juan Silos Jr for <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, Miguel Velarde Jr for <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, and Francisco Buencamino Sr with his son Francisco Jr for <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Zamboanga</i></b> is an interesting film because it contains actual footage of the Muslim war dance <i>sagayan</i>, accompanied by authentic diegetic <b>kulintang</b> (brass  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a></strong> of graduated sizes) music. Its newly composed extradiegetic score for the dramatic actions, however, came from the convention of Hollywood, which uses a lush, late 19th-century romantic symphonic sonority, which has nothing to do with the Southeast Asian musical traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, many songs and dances were diegetic. This is so because the story revolves around Guia, a barrio lass who aspires to be an urbanite singer, following her attraction to the landlord&rsquo;s Americanized son Antonio, a musician. The matching of the characters&rsquo; identities and musical styles are apt and convincing. Well-thought-out is the imaginary scene showing the blind old man, the father of Jose who belonged to the peasant class and therefore more suited to be Guia&rsquo;s partner, playing an instrument of the poor, a bamboo cello or <em>musikong bumbong</em>. In this scene, the blind old man is hearing an extradiegetic music, as if telepresencing his auditors, the moviegoers, who are outside the screen&rsquo;s reality. What is remarkable in this scene is that it happens at around the time when the hacienda owners are listening to the voice of country girl Guia via the cosmopolitan radio, thus producing a parallelism, a poignant layering that mirrors what the old man is hearing. The intelligent musical plan in the scene clearly manifests Silos&rsquo;s sensitivity to the difference between diegetic and extradiegetic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The success in matching song genres with characterization is also evident in the other three extant films. In <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, the male protagonist named Ernesto sings Santiago&rsquo;s kundiman &ldquo;Pakiusap&rdquo; in an uncannily haunting scene by a river beside a nipa hut, which is the abode of his beloved Amparing. This song is the theme song of the movie, so to speak. In a romantic scene when Ernesto, the landlord&rsquo;s son, disguises himself as a peasant so he can approach Amparing in the fields, the danza &quot; <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/874\">Buhat</a></strong>,&quot;one of Velarde&rsquo;s most beloved songs, captures beautifully the coquettish lightness of the first encounter between the soon-to-be lovers. In <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, the unwed mother named Magdalena (named after the biblical figure) intones the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Latin as a song of mourning&mdash;a funeral song in front of the tomb of her father. Oppressed by conservative patriarchal values, Magdalena has to relinquish her motherly right to raise an illegitimate daughter to protect her family&rsquo;s honor. The song expresses the pain of her subjection to a cruel social world, which she cannot transcend. In <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, the bird sings exotic coloratura runs&mdash;a Spanish mannerism&mdash;as if this were the bird&rsquo;s language from a past and distant world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Moreover, in these extant films, diegetic music correctly gives viewers a sense of Filipino lifeworlds: musikong bumbong orchestra and jazz orchestra as symbols of rural and urban spaces, respectively, in <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>; marching brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\"><strong>bands</strong></a> and rondalla in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>; and even fantastical Filipino orientalist imagination of distant places in <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>. Sentimental scenes of longing are captured by kundiman songs, coquettish romance by the danza especially in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, and humor by the dirty songs of lowly &ldquo;clownish&rdquo; characters. In these song-and-dance numbers, one feels a manifestation of a distinctly Filipino sensibility. They have no counterpart elsewhere because they are rooted in the tradition of the indigenized sarsuwela. Even the convention of composing the music of opening and closing credits owes to the tradition of writing overtures, entr&rsquo;acte, and finales of sarsuwela music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, and <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b> are effective as sarsuwela films, specifically in correlating the characters with music genres and in rendering the liveliness of scenes through the kinetic spectacle of festive celebration, folk dancing, and collective music making, the dramatic articulation of the four films&rsquo; narratives generally fails to be at par with the musical and dance numbers. The function of the extradiegetic music to articulate the dramatic element is important, and it is this function that moves the story to action and suspense, thereby generating the film&rsquo;s energy and intensity. Except for <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, the films rely heavily on stock musical formulas or canned music in most of their extradiegetic music in rendering dramatic scenes. In <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, for example, Bach&rsquo;s <em><strong>Air in G</strong> </em> is used to simply fill in the passage of time as the distraught Amparing tries to borrow money that she needs to bail out her imprisoned father. The effect of this appropriated music is static, for it simply judges Amparing to be already pitiable and does not draw in the audience to increasing empathy. In <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, the horse chase depicting Juan abducting Maria and bringing her to his kingdom is accompanied by the orchestra playing the clich&eacute;d passage of 16 notes from Rossini&rsquo;s <em><strong>William Tell Overture</strong> </em>.In the next scene, while Maria stays in an inn, dialogues are backgrounded, as in melodrama, with inert appropriated&mdash;even ballet-like&mdash;symphonic music coming from a played-back sound recording machine that does not relate in any way to the emotional cues of danger and anxiety that Maria is facing. Canned extradiegetic music is all the more glaring in <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b> where it is used, as in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, as a melodramatic filler, thus failing to make the audience understand the complex dramatic emotions that Magdalena as a mother has to struggle with vis-&agrave;-vis the loss of her daughter&mdash;that is, between her biological instinct to care for her and the cruel and unjust patriarchally ordered social world that took her daughter away from her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the said pre-World War II films, the practice of canned music seems to be, on the one hand, a legacy of the less-planned matching of music score to visuals from the silent film era, during which time extradiegetic music simply filled in the acoustic space, without a careful planning of the score to move the dramatic shape of sound into a cohesive multimedia. On the other, this kind of scoring may have been influenced by the formulaic melodramatic music of soap operas of radio programs that had to cut down on the high cost of composing and recording original scores. Canned music was to survive many more decades and was even evident in the best dramatic films that the Philippines had made during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><strong>Film Music</strong> from 1946 to 2000</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film music in Philippine cinema during the postwar era was greatly influenced by the need to rehabilitate and uplift the Filipinos&rsquo; war-torn spirits. The tradition of theater and entertainment from American musicals and vaudeville became staples for many films during this era. The primary studios then&mdash;LVN Pictures, Sampaguita Pictures, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\"><strong>Premiere Productions</strong></a> (founded 1946)&mdash;mostly came up with films that provided escape for the audience. Thus production numbers, songs, and dances, just like the musical stage shows in the old Manila opera houses, were integrated into the film narratives. LVN&rsquo;s producer Do&ntilde;a Narcisa Buencamino de Leon, or Do&ntilde;a Sisang to her colleagues, opted to produce films based on metrical romances such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1163\"><b><i><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</i></b></a><i> </i>(Florante and Laura), 1939; <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, 1941 and 1955; and <b><i>Doce Pares</i></b><i> </i>(Twelve Pairs), 1954. Correspondingly, the type of music and soundtrack used in these films accompanied the dances and movements required by the film genre, while traditional music, folk songs, kundiman music, and Spanish-influenced music filled the aural atmosphere of the films. The acoustic texture also coincided with the producer&rsquo;s vision to portray Filipino countryside life and tradition through the music and dances. In the film <b><i>Barrio Fiesta</i></b>, 1959, the effervescence of the festivities was expressed through a merriment of guitar tunes and songs, and playful frenzy between the ladies and the men from the barrio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dominating the decade were prominent film scorers such as Francisco Buencamino, whose score for the film <b><i><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong> </i></b> (Muse of Pasig), 1950, featured the titular song composed by Nicanor Abelardo. Buencamino also created the film score for <b><i><strong> <strong>Kundiman</strong> </strong> ng Lahi</i></b> (Love Song of the Race), 1959, which used Nicanor Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/918\"><strong>Kundiman ng </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a></strong> &rdquo; (Love Song of Tears) as theme song. This is a film reminiscent not of the festive music of the town&rsquo;s celebration but of the rhythm produced by the pounding of a mortar and pestle which uniquely transitioned from a diegetic sound to non-diegetic, depicting the lives of people from the countryside. Another one of his works was the score for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> Dalita</i></b></a> (<b><i>The Ruins</i></b>), 1956, a film portraying the plight of the impoverished, which was a complete departure from the usually cheerful song-and-dance movie theme. The film&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/917\"><strong>Anak Dalita</strong></a>,&rdquo; a kundiman composed by Francisco Santiago with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5083\"><strong>Jesus Balmori</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5662\"><strong>Deogracias Rosario</strong></a>, was an apt rendition and orchestration of the postwar crises faced by the Filipinos. It showed the ruins of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, displaced families, makeshift shelters, and a bleak picture of a dying woman whose last wish was to see her only son who was sent to war. Other notable film scorers of this era, who continued with their craft until the 1960s, were Carlos Aguilar, Tito Arevalo, Ariston Avelino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3935\"><strong>Josefino Cenizal</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4339\"><strong>Joe Climaco</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4347\">F. H. Constantino</a></strong>, Constancio de Guzman, Juan Silos Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a>, Santiago Suarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\"><strong> <strong>Restie Umali</strong> </strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>, and Joaquin Velasco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the use of traditional folk songs, Juan Silos Jr also composed music that had sprightly rhythms, influenced by the tango and the polka, and were used to accompany vibrant film visuals. His works were mostly heard in films that showcased romantic comedy narratives starring  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a>, who depicted a boisterous tandem dancing spiritedly to fast-paced tunes and songs that were later on played in jukeboxes and over the airwaves. Among these films were <b><i><strong>Waray-Waray</strong> </i></b>, 1954; <b><i>Ikaw Kasi</i></b><i> </i>(You Are to Blame), 1955; and <b><i>Bahala Na</i></b> (Come What May), 1957. In an interview (Mercado 1977), Silos said that he was being very modest when he said that the music in a film actually is the reason why a film becomes a blockbuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music and sound heavily influence the audience&rsquo;s reaction and patronization of the films. Some Filipino films used Western canned music instead of original film compositions as soundtracks, an observation that received a stark commentary from film critic Pio de Castro (Del Mundo 1986). Jukebox film musicals that starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\"><strong>Diomedes Maturan</strong></a>, a young singer and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a> </i></b>(Call of the Stage)<b><i> </i></b>champion, captivated the audience in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His film <b><i>Rose Tattoo ng Buhay Ko</i></b> (Rose Tattoo of My Life), 1958, was a romance musical about an amateur singer who won a national contest, and it launched Maturan&rsquo;s career with LVN. The song was initially sung and popularized by a British solo singer named Lita Roza in 1956. Maturan also starred in comedy musicals such as <b><i>Botika sa Baryo</i></b> (Pharmacy in the Barrio), 1960, and <b><i>Prinsipe Diomedes at ang Mahiwagang Gitara</i></b> (Prince Diomedes and the Magical Guitar), 1961, both scored by Francisco Buencamino, and filled with lively musical and dance numbers. He was also the lead for other film musicals such as <b><i>Oy, Akin Yata Yan</i></b> (Hey, I Think That Is Mine), 1962 and <b><i>Yeba Chiquicha</i></b>, 1963, which were both scored by Leopoldo Silos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The late 1960s to the early 1970s was a continuation of romance musicals, especially with the rise of the young singing love team of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a> and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a></strong>. Their film musicals included <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971; <b><i>My Blue Hawaii</i></b>, 1972; and <b><i>Winter Holiday</i></b>, 1972. Many of their films were musicals featuring song-and-dance numbers and using mostly foreign pop hits. The song &ldquo;Alone Again (Naturally),&rdquo; written and originally performed by Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert Sullivan, was sung by Nora Aunor as the theme song for <b><i>A Gift of Love</i></b>, 1972, which was filmed in the United States. Film critics of this era lamented the commercialization of musicals, which merely cashed in on the popularity of the Aunor-Cruz tandem while perpetuating the use of canned foreign music in the film scores (del Mundo, in Tiongson 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mid-1970s to the early 1980s presented a counterpoint in film narratives, deviating from the long period of preoccupation with musicals and shifting to narratives that portray social and political realities while employing film aesthetic techniques from the West. Film music and sound went along with these changes, so visual narratives were now accompanied and relayed not by repetitive canned foreign music but by original, restrained tunes that communicated the sensibility and timbre of the issues articulated by the films. The Gawad Urian of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\"><strong>Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</strong></a>, a reputable film critics organization formed in 1976, handed out the Best Musical Score award only to films that use original music, preferably music created solely for the film itself. This award thrusts the film composer and scorer into the limelight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4486\"><strong>Max Jocson</strong></a> was a frontrunner in film music scoring during this period, with his well-received scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Manila in the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Rites of May</i></b>), 1976. Both scores conveyed the films&rsquo; temperament, highlighting the range of his musical capabilities. In <b><i>Itim</i></b>, the music was interwoven within the dynamics of both pagan and Catholic rituals, in between the anguished sounds of a distressed spirit during a s&eacute;ance and the sorrowful chants of the townsfolk during a <i>pabasa </i>(chanting of the passion of Christ). The music tracks created by the synthesizer were jarring but not overpowering, haunting but not horrifying, and melancholic but not melodramatic. Jocson&rsquo;s intentional irregular melodies and abruptly ended tones coincided with the combination of the mystery, darkness, and somehow the eerie solemnity in the film&rsquo;s scenes. Vanishing Tribe, a band composed of four members, used electronic music for the scores of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1194\"><strong>Jaguar</strong></a></i> </b>(Guard), 1979, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1139\"><b><i>Manila by Night</i></b></a>, 1980. For both film scores, the band employed a jazz-funk fusion aura for the sinister and dark character of the city spaces explored in the film narratives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another noteworthy film scorer for this decade was Minda Azarcon, a famous opera singer in the 1970s, who created the scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b>, 1976, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1300\"><strong>Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos</strong></a></i></b> (Three Godless Years), 1976. <b><i>Insiang</i></b><i> </i>opens with a melodramatic track against the backdrop of the 1970s urban life in Tondo, Manila&mdash;the garbage dump that coincides with the raucous environment, vulgar language, and chaos that envelope the community where Insiang lives. The rape and violence she endures in the hands of her mother&rsquo;s lover are foreshadowed by repeating snippets of initially soft melodies, which transform into quivers of malice as these are accompanied by the sound of running water from the faucet. The soft melodies eventually become sinister and dark, and the squeals of animals in the slaughterhouse at the beginning of the film are replaced by screams of a rapist butchered by his former lover. <b><i>Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos</i></b> has the same ominous timbre; the gloomy bass and organ tones are piled up along with the corpses and remains in the midst of death and destruction essayed by World War II and the Japanese occupation in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a></strong> scored important films such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1166\"><b><i>Ganito Kami Noon &hellip; Paano Kayo Ngayon?</i></b></a> (This Was How We Were &hellip; What Happens to You Now?), 1976, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, and highlighted his flexibility and originality as a film composer. In <b><i>Ganito</i></b>, guitar and string melodies, as well as patriotic themes, complement the film&rsquo;s Spanish setting and aid in recreating the context of the Philippine Revolution through the eyes of a simpleminded peasant, Kulas. <b><i>Bona</i></b><i> </i>is all about the sacrifice and irrational servitude of Bona to an aspiring actor, which is mirrored in the simple, repetitive percussion sound sequences that compose her character&rsquo;s leitmotif. The beats and cadences are like Bona&rsquo;s daily expressions of devotion to an abusive object of affection such as the chores and errands that occupy her day in a life of masochistic subservience. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a> did the scores for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><b><i>Aguila</i></b></a>, 1980, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1204\"><strong>Karnal</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>Of the Flesh</i></b>), 1983. In <b><i>Aguila</i></b>, Cayabyab creates a melodious theme song that varies to suit the temper of each scene and generally weaves in and out of the different types of music he uses to characterize each major period from the 1890s to the 1980s. In <b><i>Karnal</i></b>, Cayabyab&rsquo;s powerful orchestra music adeptly matches, balances, and supplements the themes of family tragedy and the cruelty of patriarchy in the film. From soft and deceivingly tender tones to soaring and shrill sounds, the music tracks carefully narrates the tension, violence, and darkness that plagued the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many dramatic films from the 1980s widely used original Filipino compositions as titular theme music. The practice of using Western canned music was replaced by the use of original film tracks, if not original Filipino pop songs or ballads. Filipino ballads composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\"><strong>Willy Cruz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\"><strong>George Canseco</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\"><strong>Rey Valera</strong></a> became theme songs for various local films in the 1980s and 1990s that capitalized on the genre of melodrama. The film narratives were woven around these songs. Willy Cruz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bituing Walang Ningning&rdquo; (Star without Sparkle), 1985, and &ldquo;Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas&rdquo;<b> </b>(I Wish This Were Forever), 1986, both titular theme songs, were sung by the lead film actress for both films, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a><i>.<b> Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</b></i>(Wishing It Would Never End) used the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/996\"><strong>theme song</strong></a>&rsquo;s fragments throughout the film, narrating the scenes of three female singers brought together by friendship, broken apart by jealousy, and eventually reunited through music. The titular theme song, which was sung at the end of the film, was an homage to the father of the lead character, who also composed the song before his death. George Canseco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gaano Kadalas ang Minsan&rdquo;<i> </i>(How Often Is Once), 1982, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1006\"><strong>Sinasamba Kita</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Worship You), 1983, were also recognized by award-giving bodies, with the former winning Best Theme Song and the latter Best Original Song. Rey Valera&rsquo;s compositions became popular movie theme songs in the early 1990s. Some of these were &ldquo;Maging Sino Ka Man&rdquo; (Whoever You May Be), 1991, sung by Sharon Cuneta, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/887\"><strong>Di Na Natuto</strong></a>&rdquo; (You Never Learn), 1993, sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>. These theme songs were constantly played on the radio and topped the original Pilipino music charts, and records and cassette tapes of these were sold out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film music themes since the 1990s were a combination of both Filipino and Western pop hits. Cayabyab continued to create scores that employed his own compositions and original Filipino music, two of which were <b><i>Hihintayin Kita sa Langit</i></b> (I Will Wait for You in Heaven), 1991, and <b><i><strong>Saan Ka Man Naroroon</strong> </i></b> (Wherever You Are), 1993. The song &ldquo;Hanggang sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan&rdquo; (Until the End of Eternity), composed by George Canseco, was the theme song for <b><i>Hihintayin Kita sa Langit</i></b>, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/995\"><strong>Saan Ka Man Naroroon</strong></a>,&rdquo; composed by Restie Umali, was for the movie with the same title.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4306\">Dionisio Jose &ldquo;Nonong&rdquo; Buencamino Jr</a></strong> did the score and theme song for <b><i>Natutulog Ba ang Diyos</i></b> (Is God Sleeping), 1988, with the titular theme music sung by Gary Valenciano. He also created the scores for <b><i>May Minamahal</i> </b>(<b><i>Loving Someone</i></b>), 1993, with the theme music composed by Willy Cruz and sung by Rachel Alejandro; for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1144\"><strong>Dahil Mahal Kita: The Dolzura Cortez Story</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Because I Love You</i></b>), 1993, composed by Manuel Mallilin and sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3860\"><strong>Ogie Alcasid</strong></a>; and for <b><i>Sana Dalawa ang Puso Ko</i> </b>(Wish I Had Two Hearts), 1995, composed by Bodjie Dasig and sung by Ariel Rivera. Buencamino also lent his musical skills to do the scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a></i></b>, 1997, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b></a>, 1998, which both won honors at the Gawad Urian. His film music contributions continued up to the new millennium. With the songs being played on the radios and sung by the singers on television, and with the advent of better sound quality through CD players, the rise of the artists in the 1990s, such as Valenciano, Alcasid, Alejandro, and Rivera, reinforced how the audience recognized and supported the films with titular theme songs, similar to the film-theme music partnership in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other film composers who were usually tapped by both mainstream and independent productions in the 1990s and 2000s were  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4504\">Jessie Lasaten</a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4074\"><strong>Joy Marfil</strong></a>, and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4378\">Vincent de Jesus</a></strong>. Jesse Lucas created the score for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1106\"><strong>Babae sa Breakwater</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Woman of Breakwater</i></b>) and put into good use the songs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a>, which can be categorized as novelty songs about the lives of the ordinary folk. Villame&rsquo;s witty rhymes and upbeat rhythms are realized within the film&rsquo;s desolate themes of urban migration and urban poverty. Soft music tracks also contrast Villame&rsquo;s lively limericks, allowing the viewer/listener space to balance out the varied melodies. Jessie Lasaten&rsquo;s work in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1287\"><strong>Segurista</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Dead Sure</i></b>), 1996, foregrounds the familiar sounds of the business districts of Metro Manila where the main character Karen is an insurance agent by day and a guest relations officer in a karaoke bar by night. Karaoke pop songs and the lively ballroom dance music begin to fade and are replaced with slow, sad tunes once Karen sets foot on her lahar-stricken hometown in Pampanga. And an innocent lullaby accompanies her bedtime stories while she puts her child to sleep, and signals another dizzying day of traveling back to the city. Joy Marfil&rsquo;s work for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1232\"><strong>Mga Munting Tinig</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Small Voices</i></b>), 2002, brims with hope and idealism, just like its main character Melinda, a young substitute teacher who chooses to serve in a public school in a remote province. Poverty and political unrest beleaguer the community, and the only respite of the children from this predicament is Melinda&rsquo;s effort to inspire them to hone their singing talents and participate in a local contest. The song&rsquo;s theme song, &ldquo;Mga Munting Tinig,&rdquo; is sung at the end of the film to remember one of the fallen choir members who became a victim of a clash between the military and the rebels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vincent de Jesus&rsquo;s film scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1319\"><strong>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Zsazsa Zaturnnah: The Movie), 2006, and <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila! </i></b>(I Do Bidoo Bidoo: The APO Is Here!), 2012, are well-known. In contrast to the film musicals in the 1970s, the songs for these films are local and original. De Jesus created the music for <b><i>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</i></b>, an adaptation of Carlo Vergara&rsquo;s graphic novel <b><i>Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah</i></b><i> </i>(The Amazing Adventures of Zsazsa Zaturnnah), published in 2003 and also  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/692\">adapted into stage</a></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\"><strong>Tanghalang Pilipino</strong></a> in 2005 in which de Jesus was the lyricist, composer, and musical director. The film&rsquo;s opening scene sets the mood for the entire film&mdash;a vivacious production number with characters singing and dancing in the rain, not like Gene Kelly&rsquo;s and Debbie Reynold&rsquo;s stylized version but capturing local color, complete with Manila&rsquo;s enormous puddles and hopeful teens hoping for a cancellation of classes. <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila!</i></b><i> </i>starts with a medley of songs from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>, the pop trio with the longest staying power in the country. The film is a scrapbook of pop music, gaudy costumes, and color splattered across the backdrop of Manila&rsquo;s bustle, its streets, landmarks, and daily commute. The images alternate with the medley&rsquo;s vibrancy and the flamboyance of the characters, which include a young couple expecting a child and are torn between their respective families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For some films during the late 1990s to the early 2000s, the theme music became the blueprint for the other film tracks. Same tunes were carved from the main theme song and spread out as fragments of music throughout the film&rsquo;s scenes, using a variety of instrumentations. This could have helped create a musical leitmotif for a specific character or space, but the repetitive tunes simply added to the recall of the theme song, instead of creating a tenuous synchronization of image and sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mainstream and major production studios dictate the use of foreign popular songs as film titles, and some films in the 2000s repeated the earlier practice of using Western canned music, some of which were even initially used already as foreign film theme music and as foreign film titles. Some examples include <b><i>Till There Was You</i></b>, 2003, produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\"><strong>Star Cinema</strong></a> and <b><i>Let the Love Begin</i></b>, 2005, produced by GMA Films. &ldquo;Till There Was You,&rdquo; a song written by Meredith Wilson in 1957, was also the title of a 1997 Hollywood romantic comedy film, produced by Lakeshore Entertainment and directed by Scott Winant. &ldquo;Let the Love Begin&rdquo; was written by Gloria Sklerov and Lenny Macaluso and was also used as a theme for the American movie <b><i>Thrashin</i></b>, 1986. For the Filipino film title adaptations, the popular songs were used not only as a means to boost the careers of the pop artists who sang the movie themes but also as a marketing strategy to sell the film and the CD soundtrack that came with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Film Music, 2000 to Present</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advancements in digital film at the start of the millennium pose more opportunities not only for independent filmmakers but for film music composers as well. With independent production comes more freedom in creative expression, versatility, and innovation in the use of sound and music apparatus, especially since the members of the film crew are no longer under the watchful eyes and control of a mainstream production studio. There is no need to create a contrived film narrative that could match a foreign or local pop hit, and the film scorer can focus on his/her individual artistic freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composers and musicians who are products of independent film festivals, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\"><strong>Cinemalaya</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\"><strong>Cinema One Originals</strong></a>, and other independent productions contribute to the growing list of film scorers. With the available technology, these composers have become more daring, experimenting with the different permutations of sound and instrumentation and allowing them further diversity and variation in the creation of film sound tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4287\"><strong>Teresa Barrozo</strong></a>&rsquo;s film score for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1206\"><strong>Kinatay</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Execution of P.</i></b>), 2009, won at Sitges Catalonian International Film Festival for Best Original Soundtrack and demonstrated her prowess in revealing the character&rsquo;s gradual mental torment through the use of a metal pad decay&rsquo;s sharpness and thinness, and an oboe&rsquo;s glissando. Diwa de Leon&rsquo;s work in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1136\"><strong>Busong</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>Palawan Fate</i></b>), 2011, offered a fresh and crisp dimension to Filipino indigenous instruments such as the mouth harp and native flute when he used them to accompany the main character Punay as she embarked on a journey to find a cure for her mysterious affliction. Francis de Veyra&rsquo;s music in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a></i> </b>(Tribe), 2007, featured the rap culture in the ghetto district of Tondo, Manila. The poetic street rhythms and amateur beatboxing dialogued with the danger and adrenaline rush of the proliferation of Tondo&rsquo;s gang wars and petty crimes. Francis Reyes collaborated with musicians Jett Pangan (lead vocalist of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a>) and Buddy Zabala to create the soundtrack of <b><i>Tulad ng Dati</i></b> (<b><i>Just Like Before</i></b>), 2006, which featured the songs of the famous 1990s band The Dawn. The film used a semidocumentary format and revolved around the Filipino rock band&rsquo;s members, central of which was Jett Pangan&rsquo;s character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popong Landero, a composer and actor from Mindanao, did the music for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1182\"><strong>Hunghong sa Yuta</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i><strong>Earth</strong> &rsquo;s Whisper</i></b>), 2008. Landero&rsquo;s music explored the vestiges of war. The deafening sounds of guns and grenades destroyed the hearing of the children living in the remote town of Hinyok. Somehow, music allowed for the articulation of these children who spoke using only hand gestures. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\"><strong>Jerrold Tarog</strong></a>&rsquo;s work in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1146\"><strong>Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Dream of Eleuteria</i></b>), 2010, accentuated the film&rsquo;s landscape, Olango Island, where Eleuteria was sent off by an entourage of townspeople as she slowly, and eventually, accepted her fate as a mail-order bride. Emerzon Texon&rsquo;s music in <b><i><strong>Sonata</strong> </i></b>, 2013, delved into an opera singer&rsquo;s loss of voice, which led to the decline in her career and her self-destructive tendencies. In between the classical tunes and string melodies, she found redemption in her friendship with a kind boy from her hometown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development in sound technology was crucial in the transitions in Philippine film music and sound. The variations in the reverberation levels and quality of sound and music in films, the types of microphones used over the decades, the differences in methods of recording sound, and the diversities in mixing practices, all contributed to the work of the film scorer and the audience&rsquo;s reception of the film music and sound. Technology allowed for a more polished and crisp sound color and quality, which gave leverage and freedom to the scorer and sound designer to explore more potentials in film scoring. The early decades dealt with the issue of matching reverberation quality to specific scenes or spaces. Thus the playback system was developed, which was a way to record the music separately in a conducive atmosphere to come up with the illusion that the sound was created by the image, where in fact, it was independent from it. From the playback system, some film scorers in the latter decades (1990s to present) also experimented with the use of live music in the film scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning 1990s, contemporary film and sound studios use more advanced and sophisticated sound engineering equipment. With the different computer music programs available for free download or purchase such as Audacity, Logic Pro, and LinuxSampler, the film scorer is now able to manipulate how sound and music can be designed and how these elements can effectively shape the viewers&rsquo; understanding of visual images on the screen. It is now easier for the scorer to fuse diegetic and non-diegetic sound and music, with a clarity and smoothness of transition and flow. Technology has also paved the way for higher quality of music embedded in, or accompanied by, soundscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film composer Teresa Barrozo explained that the collaboration between a film composer and a sound designer is important because with the designer&rsquo;s mastery of the sound equipment, he or she can create the specific, high-quality sound or tone needed by the composer to accompany his or her music. When she worked on the music for the film <b><i>Kinatay</i></b>, the drone sound produced from the sound designer&rsquo;s end effectively complemented the glissando sound created by her oboe instrumentation. She also added that a film composer&rsquo;s music composition is not realized until it is tested and implemented into a concrete sound space; in this aspect, the sound designer and sound engineer aid in maximizing the use of technology to further enhance the composer&rsquo;s creation, thus delivering an enriched and heightened multisensory experience for the listener/audience (Barrozo 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of computer music programs also gives the scorer flexibility and can prove to be more cost-efficient most of the time, compared to live studio film music recording. An example of which is producing a full orchestra track, without the need to hire an actual orchestra. The downside of this, however, is the possible lack of authenticity in sound as it is a mere sampling of the instruments. Thus some scorers still opt for the actual orchestra, quartet, or band, and live recording, instead of relying on the computer programs, so as not to sacrifice the quality and original timbre of the required music or sound for the film.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

The Argentine writer Carlos Vega (1898-1966) traced its origin to the English <b>contradance</b> or square dance, which was later adapted in Spain as <b>contradanza</b><i> </i>or<i> </i><b>danza</b>. Around 1825, it was brought to Cuba where it was combined with Afro-Cuban rhythms, and eventually evolved into the habanera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, the habanera as dance and music assumed various forms in regional folk repertoires. An example of the Filipinized version is the habanera from Magsingal, Ilocos Sur. The music is in 2/4 time and is divided into four sections (ABCD), each composed of eight bars. Section A is repeated immediately before going to section B, which is likewise repeated. Sections C and D are played three times in pairs, resulting in the form AABBCDCDCD. All four sections are in a major key, but the music modulates to the dominant in section C. The rhythms explored are very similar to those typically used in the Western habanera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other types of habanera are <b>habanera botole&ntilde;a</b> and <b>habanera de jovencita</b>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/777\"><strong>Habanera</strong></a></strong></a> Botole&ntilde;a is a courtship dance originating from Botolan, Zambales. Popular among the Ilocanos, it is performed during weddings as well as other social functions. Habanera de jovencita, on the other hand, is performed only by women as it is a dance that depicts a woman&rsquo;s debut or wedding. The dance commences in a slow tempo, which is carried through for the most part but speeds up toward the end. A well-known version of habanera was choreographed by Jovita Friese, with music accompaniment arranged by Nitoy Gonzales. This version has been included in the dance repertoire of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A repertory of folk songs in danza style has become immensely popular in the Philippines since mid-19th century. Folk songs such as the Visayan &ldquo;Walay Angay ang Kamingaw&rdquo; (Incomparable Sadness), the Tagalog &ldquo;May Isang Bulaklak na Ibig Lumitaw&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s a Flower Wanting to Come Out), and the Ilocano &ldquo;Ti Ayat ti Maysa nga Ubing&rdquo; (The Love of a Young Maiden) all utilized the duple, with the habanera dotted and triplet rhythms. It was as popular as the <b>kundiman</b> and <b>balitaw</b>, and some of the best original popular Filipino compositions, up until the introduction of American jazz and rock and roll, were in habanera style, such as Dolores Paterno&rsquo;s &ldquo;LaFlordeManila&rdquo; (The Flower of Manila), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4093\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>sdeCapiz&rdquo; (Memories of Capiz), Nicanor S.

At present, Filipinos are viewed as some of the most prolific, innovative, and well-represented hip-hop musicians in the world, vigorously pursuing this type of music in both mainstream and underground music scenes throughout the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\"><strong>Hip-hop</strong></a> is a form of multichannel artistic cum cultural expression. It is composed of poetry (MC-ing or rap), music (beats and rhythm), dance (breaking or b-boying), DJ-ing or turntablism, and visual arts (graffiti), and was born out of class and racial strife in the inner cities of the Bronx, USA, in the late 1960s to the 1970s. Practitioners within the community use these elements to express conditions of poverty and violence, and as voices of representation and counterculture. As the disparity between the privileged few and the disenfranchised African-Americans and other &ldquo;colored&rdquo; immigrant communities became more apparent, hip-hop became the veritable voice of the marginalized and their struggle. The 1980s and 1990s marked the so-called golden age of hip-hop in the United States. Major recording companies signed many rappers, and diversity in rap music styles came about. This was also the time when the music market picked up gangster rap and misogynistic rap as the most commercially viable rap music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hip-hop came to the Philippines in two waves from the United States. First, hip-hop music and culture, including movies, paraphernalia, and other elements of hip-hop, were brought in by the Fil-Ams (Filipino-Americans) or <i>amboys</i> (American Boys) who were <i>balikbayan</i> (Filipino returnees) to the homeland from the United States. Second, hip-hop also arrived in the country via the growing Filipino-American communities surrounding the US military bases in Clark and Subic, made up mostly of children American soldiers and naval officers had with local girls. From these groups, hip-hop communities started to form as early as the 1980s, mostly composed of breakdance crews like The Eclipse, Info-Clash Breakers, and Ground Control, and mobile DJ groups like Rock All Parties Crew (R.A.P.), former members of which included the then LA-based DJ Andrew E. or &ldquo;Rap Master Fordy,&rdquo; and Norman B, who later on formed the first known rap group in the country called Bass Rhyme Posse. Viva Records signed the group up in 1991, their self-titled album becoming the first album released by a rap group. However, the first rap music singles that were ever recorded in the Philippines came much earlier in 1980, when &ldquo;Na-Onseng Delight&rdquo; (Duped Delight) by Dyords Javier and &ldquo;Nunal&rdquo; (Mole) by Vincent Dafalong were released by WEA Records. The former was a spin-off of Sugar Hill Gang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rappers Delight&rdquo; and the latter, of Lipps Inc&rsquo;s &ldquo;Funky Town.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From these records, the subgenre novelty rap was added into the existing Philippine music industry&rsquo;s classification of rap music and has been one of the most commercially successful types of rap music in the country. Written and rhymed in the comedic style more identified with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a> and the gag acts of Reycards Duet, novelty rap centered on folk beliefs, traditions, and customs. It was viewed in the hip-hop community as &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; music, which basically means that the music was produced for commercial profit. Because these artists were &ldquo;manufactured,&rdquo; their styles of rapping did not exhibit a wide range of word and syllable play, prompting later rappers to describe it with derision as very &ldquo;old school.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was Francis M (Francis Magalona), also known as &ldquo;The Man from Manila&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Master Rapper,&rdquo; with his debut album <b><i>Yo!</i></b>, who brought hip-hop into the mainstream music scene. Riding on the post-EDSA wave of nationalism, Francis M released the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/946\"><strong>Mga Kababayan Ko</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Countrymen), which became the anthem for most Filipino youth at the time. Aside from his patriotic lyrics and ethnic-inspired beats and mixes, he also donned ethnic inspired costumes and accessories, like the <i>putong</i>, sarong, and batik vests, in his television appearances and concerts. His local rap style was influenced by global pop genres like world beat or ethnic fusion, which was fashionable during that time. Shortly after his success in the mainstream music industry, rappers and rapping became the new trend. Albums such as <b><i>The First Lady of Rap</i></b> by Lady Diane, <b><i>Hoy Tsismosa</i></b> (Hey! Gossip Girl) by Rapasia, <b><i>Bass Rhyme Posse</i></b> by Bass Rhyme Posse, <b><i>Humanap Ka ng Panget</i></b> (Look for an Ugly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>) by Andrew E., <b><i>I&rsquo;m Markie D.</i></b> by Denmark, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4905\"><strong>Michael V.</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Maganda ang Piliin</i></b> (Choose the Beautiful One) sold like hotcakes in record stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s was tagged as the golden age of Pinoy hip-hop because of the mass popularization of the genre, particularly in tri-media (radio, TV, and print) and dance clubs. This was also the dawn of hip-hop crews and numerous subgenres. While English rappers, such as Mastaplann, 4 East Flava, and Sun Valley Crew dominated the airwaves and dance clubs, a new subgenre called <b>party rap</b> was attributed to Andrew E., who established his own label Dongalo Wreckords. This label was originally meant to mentor and produce records of amateur rappers that hailed from different parts of the country. A massive campaign to popularize rap through radio contests, television shows, staged concerts in the communities, and box-office hit films, such as <b><i>Andrew Ford Medina: Huwag Kang Gamol</i></b> (Andrew Ford Medina: Don&rsquo;t Be an Ass) in 1991, brought hip-hop closer to the masses. One of the most popular products of Dongalo Wreckords was the Bicolano rap group Salbakuta, which popularized the song-turned-film <b><i>Stupid Luv</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1992, Francis M released his second album <b><i>Rap Is Francis M</i></b>, which marked the emergence of <b>conscious rap</b> amidst the growing popularity of party rap of which he was also an exponent. His second album had a stronger and more direct commentary on the social ills that plagued the country. In the album, he veered away from the more abstract motherhood statements on nationalism apparent in his first album and wrote more explicit, socially conscious songs, like &ldquo;Mga Praning&rdquo; (Paranoids), which zeroed in on addiction; &ldquo;Halalan&rdquo; (Election), which focused on corruption related to electoral politics in the country; and &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y mga Pinoy&rdquo; (We Are Filipinos), which talked about colonial mentality and the people&rsquo;s movement to push the American bases out of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taking its cues from the crunchier and stronger, more backbreaking lyricism of conscious rap, another subgenre emerged that displayed an almost antisocial stance. This was gangsta rap. The rap group Death Threat formed by Beware and Genezide became the quintessential group specializing in this subgenre in the country. Death Threat was a large community of rappers that included Gloc 9, who performed in all-black costumes, some of them with black hoods on, and with a fierce-looking bulldog on stage. Their debut album <b><i>Gusto Kong Bumaet</i></b> (I Want to Be Good)&mdash;the first gangsta rap album in the Philippines&mdash;centered on the day-to-day violence and struggles of the impoverished Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1997, one of the most highly regarded underground rap groups, Pamilia Dimagiba, released &ldquo;Broke-N-Unsigned,&rdquo; which continued the legacy of conscious rap started by the likes of Francis M. At the turn of the millennium, a growing and brewing hip-hop community moved from the ground to the mainstream, composed of &ldquo;new school&rdquo; rappers, DJs, and breakers from all walks of life from all over the country using various languages in their music and merchandise. There was still a great divide between English and Tagalog rappers, although Tagalog rappers would eventually be proven to be more popular with the masses, as evidenced by Tagalog rap music topping the charts more than their English counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 2000s, the growing popularity of hip-hop was largely due to the popularity of the Fliptop Battle League founded by Anygma, which made full use of social media to popularize the format of <b>rap battle</b> in the country. Most amateur rappers, like Smugglaz, Abra, Loonie, and Dello, used the battle league as launching pads for their music careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At present, Gloc 9 is the most popular and commercially successful rapper in the country. He has been able to fuse the conscious rap that was streamed from Francis M&rsquo;s beginnings with his own style and lyricism as seen in songs like &ldquo;Sirena&rdquo; (Mermaid), which deals with gender and homosexuality; &ldquo;Upuan&rdquo; (Chair), which talks about leadership; and &ldquo;Walang Natira&rdquo; (Nothing Left), which is a commentary on diaspora and Filipino labor migrants. The Philippine Hip-hop Music Awards, which was established in 2004, dubbed Gloc 9 as the Best Rap Artist for four consecutive years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent years, there has been a resurgence of progressive rap, which is similar to conscious rap, as more and more emcees do not only deal with current events and spit out social commentaries in their songs but also take to the streets to join social mass actions and campaigns against human rights violations and in support of the marginalized sectors in Philippine society. Notable progressive rappers and rap groups are Los <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/150\"><strong>Indios Bravos</strong></a>, with their songs &ldquo;Kamay sa Taniman&rdquo; (Hands in the Planting Fields), which is about the strife of Hacienda Luisita farmers, &ldquo;Lupa Ay Laya&rdquo; (Land Is Freedom), and &ldquo;Manong Salakot&rdquo; (Mr. Salakot); Tao sa Laya with their song &ldquo;Bintana&rdquo; (Window); BLKD, who participated in Fliptop; Kjah with his &ldquo;Bagong Henerasyon&rdquo; (New Generation); and Sabak with his &ldquo;Himig ng Paglaban&rdquo; (Tune of Resistance) and &ldquo;Buhay ng Aktibista&rdquo; (Life of an Activist). Other activist rappers are Tabakk Crew, Five Year Plan, and Gasera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although there were a lot of women in the hip-hop community, very few have been actually recognized as emcees or <b>femmecees</b> (female emcees) due to the machismo that is built-in in the genre here and abroad. Some of the most notable female emcees in the Philippine hip-hop scene included Lady Diane, also known as the &ldquo;First Lady of Rap.&rdquo; She released her debut single &ldquo;Sa-sa-sadam&rdquo; in 1991 as a social commentary on the Persian Gulf War, which became an instant commercial success. Around the same time, MC Lara was leading the group Rapbusters with songs like &ldquo;Superkuwento&rdquo; (Superstory) and &ldquo;Guwapo Ba?&rdquo; (Is He Handsome?), while the New York-bred Jug Honeyluv was rapping with 4 East Flava. Honeyluv produced and promoted a number of femmecees, including the female rapper and b-girl Bebe Riz. In the rap battle scene, Lil <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a>, Hearty Tha Bomb, Lady G, and Lil Death are some of the more famous names. Female emcees have yet to produce empowering and more political statements on women&rsquo;s issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As stated earlier, hip-hop is also composed of breaking, DJ-ing or turntablism, and graffiti. Breakers and crews in the Philippines include pioneer breaker J-Masta (formerly of Mastaplann), Battle Dynamics, Battle Krew, Balikbayan Tribe, True Asiatik Tribe, Zero Gravity, and Dynamic Rockers. Some of the most notable figures in DJ-ing are DJ Coki, DJ Ouch, DJ Kimozave, DJ Master of Disaster, DJ Medmessiah, and DJ crews, such as Spindicate Posse, Samahan ng mga Turntabolista sa Pilipinas (S.T.P.), and Salt&amp;Light Music Entertainment. The most famous DJ-ing battle tournament since the 1990s is the Disco Mix Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Grapistas</b> or graf writers&rsquo; crews include Caliph-8 of CPR Krew, Crime In Style, Elemento Syento Porsyento, Pinoy Bombers Crew, Samahan Batang Aerosol, Umaasa Andyan ang Toma, and Farm Friends Kolektib. Worth mentioning, too, are the music producers and beat makers who are some of the most crucial but unsung heroes in the making of hip-hop music. Notable beat makers and producers are MC Chase and Tala of Rondalla Productions, Lowkey Da Boy Wonder of Madd World, and DJ Jena and MC Dash of the Basis Production.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written byRoselle Pineda</strong> </em> <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251668480\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Over more than a century, many forms and styles of jazz have evolved, but the one thing they have in common is the technique of improvisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>The American Era (1898-1945)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1898, shortly after defeating the Spaniards in a short-lived naval battle in Manila Bay, the Americans brought into the country early forms of <b>jazz music</b>, such as <b>Negro spirituals</b> and <b>gospel music</b>, by way of their military troops that had many African-Americans among their ranks. Many of them brought with them their Edison phonographs, which became increasingly popular after World War I, together with 78-rpm record discs of music ranging from the <b>blues</b>, <b>ragtime</b>, <b>dixieland</b>, and, later on, the <b>swing</b>. Likewise, young diligent Filipinos deserving of a better education were able to study in various schools in the United States (US) and upon their return to the islands, they shared what they had absorbed, including the music that was flourishing at that time in the metropoles. As a result, the American population got the Filipinos hooked on jazz. Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a, one of the founders of traditional jazz in the country, in his published autobiography, said that in the 1920s, when radio was still quite new, young Filipinos sang along with their turntables and radio, singing songs such as &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t We Got Fun,&rdquo; &ldquo;All By Myself,&rdquo; &ldquo;April Showers,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Wild about Harry,&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Making Eyes at Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Second-Hand Rose,&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll Be Some Changes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Man.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a 1974 article for <b><i>Sunburst</i></b> magazine titled &ldquo;The Jazzy Days of Philippine Music,&rdquo; Eric S. Giron talked about gifted entertainer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\"><strong>Lou Borromeo</strong></a>, who was from the Visayan island of Cebu. Borromeo introduced the vaudeville, the American style of stage entertainment, to the country. At first, jazz bands merely accompanied the vaudeville shows. Later on, they took center stage. Borromeo himself became one of the bandleaders and was eventually known as the &ldquo;Philippine King of Jazz.&rdquo; </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Katy &ldquo;Mommy Kate&rdquo; de la Cruz was dubbed the &ldquo;Queen of the Vaudeville Era,&rdquo; which began in the early 1920s and continued until World War II. As early as then, she was scatting in a racy localized proto-jazz blues musical backdrop like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\"><strong>Balut</strong></a>-Penoy&rdquo; during stage shows before she had even heard of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, the originators of this style. She was in the spotlight for six decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, the new jazz messengers in the Philippines were the dance bands, which performed stock arrangements. The brass and horn sections&rsquo; harmony was in block closed-chord position and was often audibly predictable. Among the very popular swing bands of the 1930s were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a> Swing Masters, the Pete Aristorenas Orchestra, the Cesar Velasco Band, the Tirso Cruz Orchestra at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, the Mabuhay Band (also overseen by Tirso Cruz), and the Mecio Regalado Orchestra. These big bands provided dance music in the swing style for Manila&rsquo;s elite and for major provincial capitals during annual fiestas and other social events. It kept the jazz musicians busy and gainfully employed. It gave them an opportunity to travel around the country and eventually overseas where the pay was much higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> popular jazz venue in the mid-1930s was the Ugoy-Ugoy Cabaret<i>.</i> <i>Ugoy-ugoy</i> in Tagalog means &ldquo;swing.&rdquo; This was probably what inspired composer Miguel &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; Velarde&rsquo;s composition &ldquo;Ugoy-Ugoy Blues&rdquo; that was a hit in the early 1930s. This dance hall was dimly lit, and the music was nonstop. The taxi dancers were paid by the number of minutes, indicated by a whistle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1940s, a new jazz style took shape in America. Due to the outbreak of World War II that brought with it feelings of anxiety, chaos, and confusion, <b>bebop jazz</b> emerged as the new sound. Bebop was a highly complex and frenzied idiom that originated in the US East Coast. Although it was not yet available in Manila in the first half of that decade, it already captivated American jazz listeners in the mainland. It was to reach Manila only after the liberation of the ravaged country in 1945. With peace at hand, there was general euphoria in the Philippines, and jazz became synonymous with the celebration of victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Postwar Philippines (1946-69)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, commerce between the Philippines and the USA resumed, and less essential items were traded, too, including the famous <b><i>Victory Label Series Records</i></b> in 78-rpm records. These discs bore a red-white-and-blue graphic logo that was designed by an Army private who was paid 15 dollars to do it. The discs were the brainchild of Bob Vincent, who once kidded that the V stood for &ldquo;Vincent&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Victory.&rdquo; These Victory series gave the locals the opportunity to listen to recordings of renowned American jazz musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The disbanded swing big bands of the prewar era started to reorganize themselves and present dance music in the newly opened cabarets and nightclubs. American bases, such as the Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga, the Subic Naval Base in Zambales, Camp John Hay in Baguio, and Sangley Point in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>, became the centers of jazz music for armed forces personnel during their off-duty hours. The Army Navy Club and the Manila Hotel, both situated in Luneta, became high society&rsquo;s favorite watering holes. When Liberation finally happened, the name Chino Santos would ring a familiar bell to all those who enjoyed Latin music. Chino was a Puerto Rican American GI who reached the Philippines in 1945. He married famous Filipino radio scriptwriter Luz Mat Castro. He was jailed for going AWOL, an incident that sent his weeping wife scrambling to spring him from jail. Not long after his release, Chino introduced the modern techniques of playing Latin percussion instruments to the local scene, and his Latin ensemble played nightly at the famous Bayside Club along Dewey Boulevard in Pasay City during the 1950s. He was a good friend of Tirso Cruz Sr and his family, despite the friendly competition between them. Chino&rsquo;s band did not confine itself to Latin music, for he wrote many arrangements and transcriptions from jazz stalwarts Les Brown and Count Basie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 1945, renowned bandleader Tirso Cruz Sr opened a little club at the basement of their old house in Gagalangin, Tondo, Manila. Here the four Cruz siblings had their musical edges sharpened to a T&mdash;by Tirso, their father. The Cruz band, having lorded it over the Fiesta Pavilion and later the Winter Garden at the Manila Hotel for four years, moved over to the Riviera nightclub where the band played without interruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the early groups organized after the war was the Pete Aristorenas Band, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a> on alto sax and Narding Aristorenas on tenor sax. They were known to be the Glenn Miller Band of the Pacific. As the bandleader, Pete hired the young Annie Brazil as the band&rsquo;s female vocalist during its stint at Sangley Point. Among the big band orchestras during this period were Anastacio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>ril and His Orchestra, Tirso Cruz Orchestra, Nemesio Regalado Orchestra, the Ilaya Orchestra, Dr Tioco&rsquo;s band, Eddie Montes&rsquo;s band that played regularly at the Santa Ana Cabaret, Tino Gatchalian&rsquo;s Band, Clod Delfino&rsquo;s Band, and the Cesar Velasco Band. The Pepe Merto Band played at the Metro Garden in the Port Area of Manila, and the Iggy de Guzman Band played at the Clark Field Air Base. While Iggy de Guzman played at the enlisted Men&rsquo;s Club for many years, Pacifico Liamsuan&rsquo;s Band aka P.Y.&rsquo;s Band was the longest tenured band at the Officer&rsquo;s Club in Clark Field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1950s brought about a change in the direction of jazz. Moving away from popular music, it was beginning to assert itself independently. In America, the big band and swing era band were superseded by two new styles of jazz playing characterized by small-group ensemble. This was easier to manage, maintain, and employ. One style was bebop. Then there was cool jazz, the West Coast movement pioneered by trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Gil Evans and was more laid-back, lyrical, and lighter. This development overseas influenced the local jazz scene. Manila experienced a jazz boom. The big bands slowly faded away, and cool jazz became more popular among the college youth. Jazz became less geared toward the masses, becoming more &ldquo;sophisticated.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1950s, Caf&eacute; Indonesia soon became Manila&rsquo;s favorite jazz club. The young architect Bobby Ma&ntilde;osa of the Executives Band designed the club interiors. Among the top Filipino jazz musicians who played there were Angel Pe&ntilde;a, Narding Aristorenas, Lito Molina, Vestre Roxas, brothers Toots and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Dila, Neo Ragas, Tony Velarde, Rudy Sucgang, Bading Tuason, Piding Alava, Romy Katindig, Bobby Enriquez, Emil Mijares, Mon Guevara, Doming Monserrat, Omeng Concepcion, Terry Undag, Larry Allen, Fred Robles, and Doming Valdez. Other jazz players did their tour of duty at Caf&eacute; Indonesia, eventually graduating from the &ldquo;street school of jazz.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, a jamming outpost was established for jazz musicians who wanted to get together during their free time on a weekly basis. The DRB (Del Rosario Brothers) Marketing Corporation sponsored the venue at the DRB Theater located in Santa Mesa, Manila. Every Tuesday evening, special guests and well-known Filipino jazz musicians popped in and showed off their wares. Singer-socialite Nelda Lopez Navarro sat in and sang standards like &ldquo;Angel Eyes,&rdquo; &ldquo;When Sunny Gets Blue,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;m Happy.&rdquo; Guitarist Rudy Carpela and bassist Cris Abelardo (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>&rsquo;s nephew), among others, joined the fray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Fusion: The Marriage of Rock with Jazz (1970s Onward)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The late 1960s witnessed the emergence of a new branch of jazz called fusion in America or progressive rock in Europe. This new sound evolved out of experimentation by African-American Miles Davis who infused rock elements, like loud amplified electric guitars and bass, guitar riffs, synthesizers, and signal processing effects (like the wah-wah, phase shifter, and ring modulator), into his jazz performance. One of the first local groups to explore this evolving sound was a singing trio by the name of Six-Halves, which featured singer Lolit Llanto and keyboardist-composer Winston Raval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila in the 1970s experienced the growing influence of the hippie culture where drugs, sex, and rock and roll prevailed over the youth. In 1975, the first nationwide battle of the bands was staged by the couple Cesare and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a>. The eight-foot grand trophy was shared by winners Destiny and Mother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>, both headed by Berkley College of Music student Ed Crisologo Jose. The members of these two groups would eventually mature as professional musicians. They were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3883\"><strong>Bob Aves</strong></a>, Gabe Ascalon, Joey Puyat, Colby de la Calzada, Harry<i> </i>Tambuatco, Eggie Moran, Nick Lizares, Cherry Mapua, Uly Avante, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\"><strong>Richie Quirino</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the high intensity of the fusion era of the 1970s, jazz mellowed out considerably in the 1980s with a new sound called smooth jazz or pop jazz. This was a more commercial-sounding jazz and had mass appeal because it was simpler in form and execution. George Benson and David Benoit in America and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4031\"><strong>Eddie Katindig</strong></a> and nephew Boy Katindig in the Philippines were the popular names that cashed in on this popular trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1991, despite the closure of the US bases in the Philippines, local jazz grew. This twist of fate encouraged local musicians to search for their own identities and not be clones to the originators of the music. One such musician was guitarist-composer Bob Aves who spearheaded the research and development of indigenous music from the tribal groups of the northern mountain provinces of Luzon and the southern Muslim provinces in Mindanao. He fused these with elements of American jazz. Frustrated in his own country over the cold acceptance of his music due to centuries of colonial mentality, Aves went overseas where he achieved considerable success, participating in numerous jazz festivals worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the advent of this unexpected but welcome development, a multitude of artists recorded their original material either independently or with support from local major record companies. The Internet played a major role in promoting these artists in social networks, such as Facebook and YouTube. Johnny Alegre&rsquo;s Affinity, the groups WDOUJI and Ugoy-Ugoy, singers Mishka Adams and Skarlet aka Myra Ruaro, to name a few, would achieve considerable success from year 2000 and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2003, the Jazz Society of the Philippines was organized by 15 individuals to preserve and promote a common love for the art form. Five jazz festivals were staged in the Lopez-owned Rockwell commercial area in Makati in front of Monk&rsquo;s Dream jazz club owned by IT pioneer Gus Lagman. In 2006, this inspired one of the 15 members, Sandra Lim Viray, and her husband Jun, to create a foundation called P.I. Jazz.Org, which would stage yearly international festivals, with great success. JazzPhil-USA in Los Angeles headed by singer Charmaine Clamor followed suit; subsequently, the Jazz Society of Negros headed by Bob Coscolluela, and the San Francisco Filipino American Jazz Festival headed by Carlos and Myrna Zialcita, would inject a much-needed dose of jazz in their respective areas of operation.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written byRichie C.

Jota music is always in 3/4 time and is played in a fast tempo. The tonality is in major mode. There is usually a short introduction and sometimes a <i>saludo </i>to give the dancers time to enter and to bow. Music is divided into four to five sections of 8 or 16 measures to go with the change of dance steps. The melody is characterized by running passages in mostly upward movements. Dotted rhythms are used especially toward or at the end of the phrases. Manuel Walls y Merino included a music transcription of <b>jota valenciana </b>in his book <b><i>Musica Popular de Filipinas </i></b>(Popular Music of the Philippines), 1892.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As popular as the fandango during the Spanish colonial period, jota was widely known throughout the archipelago but was practiced with some variations on the dance steps as well as differences in the music. Jota is specified by words that indicate each jota subtype, such as <b>jota zapatilla</b> (jota with footwork), <b>la jota purpuri</b> (suite of dances jota), and <b>la jota surtido </b>(jota assortment). It is also named after the regions the subtype comes from, such as <b>jota batangue&ntilde;a</b>,<i> </i><b>jota cagayana</b>,<i> </i><b>jota manile&ntilde;a</b>,<i> </i><b>jota cavite&ntilde;a</b>,<i> </i>and<i> </i><b>jota Paragua</b>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most popular jota performed until the present time is <b>jota moncade&ntilde;a </b>from Tarlac, which combines Ilocano and Spanish music. Its dance steps have a trace of the <b>flamenco</b>. Jota is still popular among dance troupes and performed during gatherings, programs, and even in folk dance competitions.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Jeanna B.

Perhaps informed by Retana&rsquo;s 1888 ethnographic study <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a> Batangue&ntilde;o</i></b>, Manuel Walls y Merino observed in 1892 that although the kumintang<b> </b>was originally a <b>canto guerrero</b><i> </i>(warrior&rsquo;s song) that inflamed combatants, it no longer bore traces of the old form. By the Spanish colonial period, the kumintang had developed into a song-dance form in Batangas. An example of the kumintang then was &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/878\"><strong>Comintang de la Conquista</strong></a>&rdquo; (Comintang of the Conquest), transcribed with added but erroneous guitar and piano accompaniments by the Frenchman Jean Mallat ca 1840. The song bemoaned the singer&rsquo;s true but unrequited love, expressed in <i>plosa</i> form or dodecasyllabic quatrains. This source was reprinted in John Bowring&rsquo;s 1859 travelogue. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a> included an erroneous transcription of the &ldquo;comintang&rdquo; in his collection <b><i>Musica de la Antigua Civilizacion Filipina</i></b> (Music of the Ancient Philippine Civilization), 1887. The early 20th-century scholar Epifanio de los Santos described different versions of it in his essay &ldquo;El Folklore <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> de Filipinas&rdquo; (The Musical Folklore of the Philippines), 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Travelogues of the 1800s described the kumintang as a seductive love dance performed to a melancholy song accompanied by a guitar and <b>bajo de u&ntilde;as</b><i> </i>(string bass). Using amorous gestures, the woman offers a cup of wine to the man. He refuses at first and the dance continues, becoming more intense, until the couple&mdash;with the woman now sitting on the man&rsquo;s lap&mdash;finally drains the cup of wine. There are variations&mdash;sometimes it is the man who offers his love. Needless to say, the dancers modified their gestures when the friars were around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Based on Mallat&rsquo;s transcription, the music is in 3/4 time. The melodic line is in a quasi-recitative style moving within the compass of the bottom fifth of the minor scale, with occasional half step extensions above and below. It moves in a generally stepwise motion following a reiterated rhythmic pattern set by the strumming of the guitar. The text, a four-line stanza with 12 syllables per line, is set syllabically to the music&mdash;that is, one syllable per note. Each stanza is followed by a two-line refrain. The melody for the refrain is more disjunct, with a rhythmic accent on the second beat, which serves to emphasize the pain of the sentiments of the preceding stanza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some compositions that used the kumintang as material include a pianistic arrangement by Manila&rsquo;s piano teacher Diego C. Perez in his &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas y sus Cantares,&rdquo; 1886; Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;MutyangPasig&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig), 1926; and Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a>&rdquo; (Brown Race), 1962. In 1997, Elena Mirano found the kumintang still practiced in Batangas, but the term referred to the ornate and plucked guitar style in San Luis, Bauan.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

It sings about a love that is faithful and true but carries a sad tone, highlighting the sacrifices the lover does for his or her beloved. There are three theories regarding the origin of the term kundiman. First, it was believed to be a contraction of the phrase <i>kung hindi man</i> (would it not be so). The second was that it might have been derived from the verse &ldquo;Hele hele nang kandungan / Hele hele ng kundiman&rdquo;<i> </i>(Hush, hush, the cradle / Hush, hush, the kundiman). Third, Norberto Romualdez and Consejo Cauayani (1954) opined that kundiman could refer to the red cloth worn by male dancers or<b> </b>men in the countryside. This theory is supported by the folk song popular in General Trias, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>, in 1873, &ldquo;Mula Nang Mauso, Damit na <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Ever since the Cloth Kundiman Became a Fad):</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mula nang mauso, damit na kundiman</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang babae&rsquo;t lalaki ay nagpupulahan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lalong namumula ang kadalagahan,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Siyang pag-aalsa ng katagalugan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Ever since the cloth kundiman became a fad</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Women and men all turned red</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Especially the young girls</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Tagalog region rose in revolt.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composer and music historian Antonio J. Molina said that the kundiman is closely related to its predecessors: the <b>kumintang</b> and <b>awit </b>(metrical romance).<b> </b>The accent is similar to that of the second beat of the second bar of the kumintang and the second beat of the sixth bar of the awit. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>ly and textually, though, the kundiman represents some of the more significant facts of the Filipino psyche brought about by history and culture&mdash;sentimentality, sense of submissiveness, self-pity, yearning for freedom from want and deprivation, and the aspiration for a better future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The evolution of the kundiman as a literary musical form and as an <b>art song</b> could be traced to three or four stages of development. The first was its purely functional phase&mdash;an expression of love through extemporized text with the insertion of certain phrase formulae, such as &ldquo;kung hindi man.&rdquo; The music was taken from preexisting tunes identified as awit and/or kumintang. The next stage was the semi-stylization of the musical formulae in which metric pulses of Western dances (<b>valse</b>, <b>danza</b>, <b>fandango</b>, etc.) were integrated into the singing style. Another stage would be the elevation of the previously extemporized text to a literary-poetic verse format by schooled writers, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\"><strong>Patricio Mariano</strong></a>, Deogracias A. Rosario, Manuel Bernabe, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5083\"><strong>Jesus Balmori</strong></a>. While no longer relying on stock phrases, they nevertheless incorporated the principal thematic element in their texts&mdash;that is, the expression of unrequited and undying love, together with resignation to one&rsquo;s final fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The final stage was the composition of the music to suit the structural and aesthetic demands of the poetic text. As developed by formally trained composers, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, and Nicanor S. Abelardo, the classical kundiman assumed the standard three-part form where the first two sections were in minor and related tonal areas and the final part was in the parallel major. The melodies were characterized by certain motivic formulae, such as the opening phrase starting on the upbeat, accenting on the second beat. Harmonically, the kundiman&rsquo;s expression of uncertainty was portrayed through the various incomplete resolutions employed by composers such as Abelardo in the application of the chromatic harmony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The era of the kundiman has been generally placed between 1800 to 1930. The year 1800 was alluded to in the folk song &ldquo;Kundiman de 1800&rdquo; (Kundiman of 1800) composed by Francisco Santiago, now popular among schoolchildren. The song&rsquo;s serious mood was allegedly countered by its jocose lyrics when the printer of Emilia S. Reysio-Cruz&rsquo;s collection of folk songs, which Santiago harmonized, pressured him to rush this particular piece. The three quatrains of this kundiman run as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;

text-align:justify\">Contemporary composer and critic Felipe de Leon Jr speculated that the pathos in the kundiman could be due to the Spanish practice of disallowing Filipinos from speaking about their love for country, and so they used the kundiman as a subtler medium for their nationalistic expressions. Hence the kundiman not only expresses the lofty sentiment of love but also of heroism. The kundiman &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/909\"><strong>Jocelynang Baliwag</strong></a>&rdquo; (Jocelyna of Baliwag), for example, originally dedicated to Jocelyna (Pepita) Tiongson of Baliuag, Bulacan, really addressed a bigger muse&mdash;Mother Country. It inspired many a Katipunero<i> </i>(Filipino revolutionary) to fight for freedom from Spain, and was called the &ldquo;Kundiman ng Himagsikan&rdquo; (Kundiman of the Revolution). The lyrics of this kundiman run as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pinopoong sinta,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Niring kaluluwa,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nakakawangis mo,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mabangong sampaga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalisay sa linis,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dakila sa ganda</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Matimyas na bukal</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ng madlang ligaya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Edeng maligayang</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kinaluluklukan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ng galak at tuwang</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Katamis-tamisan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ada kang maningning</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Na ang matunghaya&rsquo;y</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Masamyong bulaklak</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Agad sumisikal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Beloved goddess</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of my soul,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">You are like</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fragrant <i>sampaga</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pure and clean,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of noble beauty,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The genuine spring</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From which flows complete joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Happy Eden</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The throne</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of the sweetest</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Joy and happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">You are the dazzling nymph</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whose gaze makes</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fragrant flower</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Grow instantly.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early decades of the 20th century, Francisco Santiago stylized the kundiman, elevating it to a higher creative plane as he fashioned a simple folk song into an appealing art song.

Other important kundiman of Santiago were &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\"><strong>Pakiusap</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Plea) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1767\"><strong>Madaling-Araw</strong></a>&rdquo; (Dawn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kundiman that were later written by Nicanor S. Abelardo were believed to have been inspired by Santiago&rsquo;s. Abelardo created some of the most famous artistic kundiman&mdash;among them, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\"><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong></a>&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/960\"><strong>Nasaan Ka Irog?</strong></a>&rdquo; (Where Are You My Love?), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/918\"><strong>Kundiman ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Kundiman of Tears). In 1920 Bonifacio Abdon composed &ldquo;Kundiman,&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;Kundiman ni Abdon&rdquo; (Abdon&rsquo;s Kundiman). Abdon was then the director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion Musical de Filipinas</strong></a>, which sponsored the concert of Russian cellist Boguomil Sykora, who wanted to conduct a native composition. Abdon wrote the kundiman, with text by his brother-in-law, Patricio Mariano. It was sung for the first time by a choir. Other famous kundiman were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Una Kong Pag-ibig&rdquo; (My First Love) and Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1415\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (My Country) with lyrics by Jose Corazon de Jesus. &ldquo;Bayan Ko,&rdquo; originally a song protesting American colonization, became the anthem of the parliament of the streets during the Marcos dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the pre-World War II era, the kundiman was composed to honor heroes on their birth or death anniversaries, to congratulate women on their birthdays and graduations as professionals, and as theme songs for films and organizations. Actively composing kundiman during this period were composers Castro Emiliano, Pedro Santos Gatmaitan, Gerardo Enriquez, Saturnino E. Villanueva, Facundo Perez, Dominador Rivera, Cornelio Lacsamana, Francisco Perez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\"><strong>Ariston Avelino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4156\"><strong>Lucino Sacramento</strong></a>, and Liberato Esguerra. The lyrics of these songs were provided by the composers themselves or by collaborating lyricists, among whom were Jose Katindig, Pio Ramirez, Maria M. Villanueva, Deogracias Rod. Gonzales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2763\"><strong>Florentino Ballecer</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4008\"><strong>Juan Hernandez</strong></a>, Leoncio Reyes, Filomeno Alcaraz, and Jose Dal&rsquo; Estrella.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s and 1930s the kundiman was used by <b>sarsuwela</b><i> </i>composers for their love songs. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\"><strong>Leon Ignacio</strong></a> created the &ldquo;Kundiman ni Angelita&rdquo; (Kundiman of Angelita) for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a> </i></b>(Country Maiden). In the late 1930s and in the decades after World War II, Filipino film musicals, which were really filmed sarsuwela, either used famous kundiman as title and theme songs&mdash;for example, <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1940&mdash;or commissioned composers to create new kundiman for the movies. Composers for the movies include Constancio de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\"><strong>Santiago Suarez</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the postwar era, the term kundiman has been used to mean not only a specific musico-literary form but also a style and a particular musical sentiment. As late as the 1960s, the classical kundiman formats were still employed by such composers as Lucio D. San Pedro in his &ldquo;Sa Simula Ako&rsquo;y Labong&rdquo; (In the Beginning I Was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Shoot), Felipe Padilla de Leon in his &ldquo;Ganyan ang Pagsimba&rdquo; (That Is How to Go to Church), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a> in his &ldquo;Kundiman ng Puso&rdquo; (Kundiman of the Heart) and &ldquo;Pighati&rdquo; (Grief), and Alfredo S. Buenaventura in his &ldquo;Huling Hibik ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (Last Cry of the Philippines). In the second half of the 20th century, kundiman sentiment was felt in the romantic ballads of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\"><strong>George Canseco</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3949\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\"><strong>Ernani Cuenco</strong></a></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong></a>. Current additions to the kundiman repertoire include Angel Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>s ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a>&rdquo; (In the Stream of Happiness), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4219\"><strong>Noel Velasco</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mutya ng Mayon&rdquo; (Muse of Mayon), Michael Dadap&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walang Paalam&rdquo; (No Goodbye), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walang Hanggang Paalam&rdquo; (Never Ending Goodbye).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There has been a proliferation of recordings of kundiman in different forms in the Philippines and abroad in the 21st century. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a>&rsquo;s multivolume <b><i>Classic Philippine Sentiments: A Keyboard Treasury of Love Songs and Folksongs</i></b> contains many kundiman arranged for solo piano. The series is made up of several albums, which include <b><i>Katakataka </i></b>(Surpising),<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/876\"><strong>Cavatina</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> Lambingan </i></b>(Romance),<b><i> Balikbayan </i></b>(Filipino Returnee),<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Pahimakas </i></b>(Farewell). In <b><i>Alaala</i></b> (Memories), Sunico also devoted a complete album to the kundiman of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>. The centennial album <b><i>Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng Himagsikan 1896-1898</i></b> (Songs of the Revolution 1896-1898), 1998, was a special recording of songs of the 1896-98 Philippine Revolution, many of which have been considered written in the kundiman form. The songs were arranged by Raul Sunico and sung by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a>, with Lester D. Demetillo on guitar and Antonio R. Maigue on flute. In 2007, the Berlin-based duo made up of baritone Jonathan de la Paz Zaens and pianist Abelardo Galang II recorded and released an album titled<b><i> Kundiman: Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\"><strong>Art Song</strong></a>s</i></b> in Germany, the land where the genre flourished in the 19th century. Joey Ayala&rsquo;s two modern kundiman, &ldquo;Kundiman sa Ulap&rdquo; (Kundiman in the Clouds) and &ldquo;Walang Hanggang Paalam&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>\"><strong>Subli</strong></a>me Farewell) were part of his album <b><i>16 Love Songs</i></b>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a> released <b><i>The Filipino Classics</i></b>,<i> </i>2006, a collection of classic Filipino songs from the 1920s to the 1960s arranged by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>.

The first five years produced the following top kundiman singers: Francisco Batomalaque, 1991; Alexis Sumicat, 1992; Nolito Gregorio, 1993; Joel Saavedra, 1994; and Cherry Batalla, 1995. Due to a change in the hotel&rsquo;s ownership in 1996, the annual fiesta faced an uncertain fate. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts eventually took over, and the 1996 edition was held on 4 Dec at the Folk Arts Theater, with Marya Deeda Barreto emerging as the winner. In 1995, another kundiman singing competition was started, this time by the Makati Coliseum and Cultural Affairs Office, to celebrate &ldquo;Buwan ng Wika&rdquo; (National Language Month) in the city. The competition, initially called &ldquo;Kampeon ng Kundiman&rdquo; (Kundiman Champion) and later renamed &ldquo;Kundiman sa Makati&rdquo; (Kundiman in Makati), has been held annually since.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

Liturgical music accompanies the official rites of the Christian churches, and this practice is rooted in the Jewish tradition of chanting a psalm from the Old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/197\"><strong>Testament</strong></a> as a meditative interlude between readings from the works of the prophets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early Christian chants were derived from Jewish chants. The codification of chanting, also called plainsong, plainchant or <b>cantus planus</b><i> </i>(to distinguish it from measured singing or <b>cantus mensuratus</b>), is attributed by tradition to Pope Gregory the Great who had also reformed the entire liturgy during the sixth century. What is now known as the Gregorian chant received its final form under Pepin the Short and Charlemagne mainly at Metz. Elsewhere, other repertories developed: Roman chant (Rome), Ambrosian chant (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a>), Mozarabic chant (Spain), Gallican chant (Gaul), and Byzantine chant (Byzantium). It was, however, the Gregorian chant that superseded these chants when it was adopted as the official chant of the Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gregorian chant is an enormous body of music composed of about 3,000 chants, all monophonic, with free rhythm, and sung partly by the soloist or cantor and the choir. Each chant consists of a single melody, sung either by the soloist or by the choir. It is sung without accompaniment, and the choir sings in unison. The music is in free rhythm, with no bar lines and time signatures. Instead, the music follows the rhythm of the words. The words themselves are mostly taken from the Bible, especially from the Book of Psalms. Until the 1980s, when the church began to permit translations, the chant was always sung in Latin. The music of the chants is based on the medieval church modes, rather than on the modern major and minor scales. It has its own notation written on neumes (a four-line staff with notes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early Christian church saw the distinction between high and low masses, and the ember days. Ember days were occasions for penance and prayer during which the lengthy &ldquo;Litany of the Saints&rdquo; was chanted. These were also times for priestly ordination&mdash;perhaps the most elaborate of the Catholic rites. Rites celebrating the administering of some sacraments did not require a specific music but used those appropriate to the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of liturgical music in the Philippines was said to have begun with the coming of the Spanish colonizers and the establishment of Catholicism. The Spanish educational system, established in 1596, required the Filipinos to learn how to play musical instruments, such as the organ, flute, violin, harp, and guitar. But history relates that the Filipinos&rsquo; first encounter with Christian religious music was during the Easter Sunday Mass on 31 Mar 1521, when the natives heard the chants of the Spanish priest and congregation. Priests of the different religious orders introduced European church music forms and styles. They built monasteries and churches, which became the prime centers of religious musical activities. Missionaries even used native chants to which they composed poems that explained catechism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Augustinians, the first missionaries to arrive, set up the first orchestra in the Philippines in 1601 in the Convent of Guadalupe in present-day Rizal province. They provided young boys with a musical education that enabled the latter eventually to teach music. Among the early Filipino music teachers were Fray Marcelo de San Agustin, an organist, singer, and composer, and Fray Juan de Alfaro, resident organist of the San Agustin Church. The Spanish curates who came to teach music in the Philippines include Juan de Bolivar, a prominent cantor who composed liturgical settings and Christmas carols aside from teaching the harp, organ, violin and flute; Lorenzo Castelo, &ldquo;el Orfeo Agustiniano,&rdquo; an accomplished singer-composer; Tenacio de Jesus, who wrote the convent choir books; Nicolas Sernanit, organist-teacher; and Manuel Arostegui, who promoted Filipino church music, especially the music of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a>, in Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Adonay, known as the &ldquo;Palestrina of the Philippines,&rdquo; best represents the golden age of church music in the Philippines. A gifted musician, Adonay entered the San Agustin Convent in Intramuros in 1856 and swiftly rose in rank from choirboy to composer, orchestra director, and official church organist. Among his important works were &ldquo;Liberame&rdquo; (Rescue Me), 1869, &ldquo;Benedictus&rdquo; (Blessed), 1895, &ldquo;Hosana&rdquo; (Praise), 1899, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/196\"><strong>Te Deum</strong></a>&rdquo; (You Are God),<b><i> </i></b>and a grand mass. Adonay wrote in a pure, simple style devoid of histrionics. Other noted Filipino musicians who studied under the Augustinians include Jose Valledo, David Jamena, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4098\"><strong>Pedro Navarro</strong></a>, and Tomas Mellaren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Franciscans also contributed greatly to the development of Filipino church music. Like the Augustinians before them, the Franciscans provided the natives with a musical education that eventually helped them find jobs as music teachers in Catholic schools. Among the prominent Franciscan music mentors were San Pedro Bautista, who taught music to the natives before being executed with Japanese Christians in Japan in 1597; Fr Geronimo de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r, founder and director of the music school in the Franciscan Convent of Manila; Fr Juan de Santa Marta, who taught singing and the playing and making of instruments; and Fr Jose de la Virgen, who wrote <b><i>Arte de Canto Gregoriano</i></b> (Art of Gregorian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>), 1727, in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Dominicans ran a music school in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> in Manila. The organization was not as large as that of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>&rsquo;s. However, it was reputed to have the finest organ in the city. Liturgical music was played on the famous and unique bamboo organ of Las Pi&ntilde;as built by Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a>. The organ, begun in 1816 and finished in 1824 during his stint as curate of Las Pi&ntilde;as, contains 950 bamboo pipes, 22 stops, 43 pipes to each register, and 12 pedals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1742 the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples de la Santa Iglesia Catedral was founded in honor of the Blessed Trinity. It later developed a curriculum patterned after that of the Conservatory of Madrid. The faculty of the Colegio, initially staffed by priests and later by laymen, taught solfeggio, vocalization, and the playing of the organ and string instruments. Among the well-known products of the institution were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3993\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong></a>, pianist-violoncellist; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4177\"><strong>Simplicio Solis</strong></a>, composer; Salvador Pi&ntilde;on, violinist-flutist; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4198\"><strong>Fulgencio Tolentino</strong></a>, pianist-composer; and Manuel Lopez, pianist-composer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was not uncommon then for parishes to have their own choirs, usually composed of young boys or <i>tiples</i>,<b> </b>who were taught Gregorian chant and other traditional Latin hymns in accordance with the reformed rites of the Council of Trent. Aside from the aforementioned Augustinian orchestra of Rizal, also noteworthy were the Manila Orchestra assembled by Fr Juan de Torres in 1643, and the orchestra assembled by Fr Toribio Varas in 1870, which was led by Adonay and later by Fr Arostegui. Unique in a predominantly non-Filipino repertoire was the singing of a European melody underlaid with Tagalog text, which was discovered as being part of a manuscript collection of prayers and songs in San Juan del Monte&rsquo;s Dominican church, dating from the second half of the 17th century. The sheet music was titled &ldquo;Letra en Tagalo&rdquo; (Letters in Tagalog), presumably sung by a choir. The choir was often accompanied by a string and flute ensemble, sometimes by an orchestra, and during the 19th century, by a pipe organ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bohol, prior to the great earthquake of 2013, was home to seven pipe organs housed in the churches of Baclayon, Dimiao, Garcia Hernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>y, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\"><strong>Lobo</strong></a>c, Loon, and Maribojoc. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\"><strong>Baclayon Church</strong></a>, particularly its ecclesiastical museum, was also where various <b>cantorales</b> (choir books) were located, including the <b><i>Kirial de esta Yglesia de Baclayon A&ntilde;o 1826 </i></b>(Sacred Music of Baclayon Church 1826), the <b><i>Antifonario de esta Iglesia de Baclayon </i></b>(Antiphonary of Baclayon Church), the <b><i>Salterio de esta Iglesia de Baclayon </i></b>(Psalms of Baclayon Church), and the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>l o Yntroitos de esta Iglesia de Baclayon A&ntilde;o 1827 </i></b>(Missal of Baclayon Church 1827). The Kirial contained 26 musical settings of the Ordinary Mass, among which were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/952\"><strong>Misa Baclayana</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> Misa Imperial</i></b>,<b><i> Misa Provincial</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Misa de Sales</i></b>. These choir books with neumatic notations written in five-line staves were similar to an extant music book printed in Manila in 1872 titled <b><i>Manual-Cantoral para el Uso de las Religiosas de Santa Clara de la Ciudad Manila </i></b>(Songbook for the Use of the Religious of Santa Clara, Manila).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tunes from popular and secular songs found their way into the Mass, often at communion or when there was a lull in the service, which was actually a violation of the Council of Trent&rsquo;s prohibition. These tunes were apparently used at the <i>misas de aguinaldo </i>or <i>simbang gabi </i>(dawn Masses) so that around 1630, these Masses were temporarily banned. The dawn Masses were also occasions for the singing of <b>villancicos</b> and Christmas carols. The <b><i>Misa Pastorela</i></b>, accompanied by organ, strings, castanets, and tambourines, was usually sung at the midnight Mass on Christmas eve or on Christmas day itself. Aside from the rites celebrated within the church, processions outside the church were a common feature of Catholic liturgy. For the Feast of Corpus Christi, temporary wayside chapels were built along the processional path to serve as stopping points for benediction and the singing of <b>motets</b> during the procession. Fiestas were also important occasions for performing liturgical music. The annual Quiapo fiesta is perhaps the most pompous and spectacular of all fiestas in Manila, culminating with a High Mass and a magnificent procession in the evening. Quiapo Church services generally feature excellent organists and singers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4077\"><strong>Natalio Mata</strong></a>, the church&rsquo;s organist, is remembered for his lamentative <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/187\"><strong>Siete Dolores</strong></a> de la Virgen </i></b>(Seven Sorrows of the Virgin) often played on Good Friday services. His son, Manuel, a talented composer, succeeded him as church organist. The Carrion family&mdash;Balbino and sons Juan, Jose, and Victorino&mdash;were noted church singers. Others were Hilarion Angeles, Agapito Enriquez, Valeriano del Rosario, and Juan Salvador. The Circulo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>, organized in 1893 by Fr Cipriano Gonzales in Pandacan, had as its goals the promotion of European music and the creation of a stimulating atmosphere for musical activity. Prominent Pandacan-born musicians include church singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3060\"><strong>Pantaleon Lopez</strong></a> and instrumentalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\"><strong>Ladislao Bonus</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1902, the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI) was established, declaring itself free of the Vatican. A few prominent musicians of the time became members of the church and wrote masses for the new church, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>, who wrote the Tagalog mass <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/953\"><strong>Misa Balintawak</strong></a></i></b>, 1910, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4014\"><strong>Lorenzo Ilustre</strong></a>, who wrote a mass for Easter with no specific title. Masses included in the 2010 compilation of the IFI titled <b><i>Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/965\"><strong>Pagsamba</strong></a> para sa Diyos at Bayan </i></b>(Songs of Worship for God and Country) were <b><i>Misa Rizalina</i></b> (Rizal Mass) by Antonio Buencamino,<b><i> Misa Porvenir</i></b> (Mass of the Future) by an unknown author, and <b><i>Misa Bantay Kilang</i></b> (Mass of Bantay Kilang) by Brigido Pablo. An earlier compilation of IFI songs was the<b><i> Imnaryong Pilipino</i></b> (Filipino Hymnal), 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Filipino composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries experimented with short forms such as the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\"><strong>Ave Maria</strong></a>,&rdquo; wedding songs, and short hymns. Among these were Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; (Hail Mary), &ldquo;Stabat Mater&rdquo; (Mother Standing), &ldquo;Hymn to Santa Cecilia,&rdquo; and works in the vernacular, &ldquo;Pananampalataya&rdquo; (Faith) and &ldquo;Pananalig at Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Faith and Love); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4221\"><strong>Manuel Velez</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo;; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2817\"><strong>Alejo Carluen</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cantico a Santa Teresita del Ni&ntilde;o Jesus&rdquo; (Hymn to Saint Therese of the Child Jesus); Paulino Cadsawan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tantum Ergo&rdquo;; Hipolito Rivera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jaculatorios a San Jose&rdquo; (Emotional Prayer to St. John); Amanda Cabrera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song to Our Lady Mediatrix of All Graces&rdquo;; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Nuptial Prayer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Salutaris&rdquo; (Help Us); and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ave Maria.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On his first year as pope in 1903, Pius X issued an encyclical, the &ldquo;Motu Propio,&rdquo; which discouraged the use of orchestras and brass bands to accompany masses and which sought to restore the solemnity and devoutness of liturgical music through the revival of the Gregorian chant. The encyclical came in the wake of a proliferation of masses that were characterized as frivolous, excessive, profane, sentimental, and lengthy. The appeal went unheeded for half a century, although considerable enthusiasm was noted among some church musicians to promote the chant. Today, the Gregorian chant is kept alive in some churches and monasteries such as the Manila Cathedral and the Benedictine Abbey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of the 19th century, reform-minded liturgists urged the adaptation of the Catholic Church rites to modern times. Pius X urged frequent communion and encouraged the convocation of Eucharistic congresses. These were held well into the 20th century. In 1937 an international eucharistic congress was convened in the Philippines. These congresses were occasions for the composition of vernacular hymns, which were based on extra-liturgical songs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> de Mayo&rdquo; (Flowers of May), &ldquo;Despedidas&rdquo; (Goodbyes), &ldquo;Himno al Sagrado Corazon de Jesus&rdquo; (Hymn to the Sacred Heart of Jesus), and &ldquo;No Mas Amor que el Tuyo&rdquo; (No Greater Love than Yours), which was composed for the 1937 congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This was also the era of anthologies and hymnals that collected Gregorian chants, Latin hymns, and music in other languages. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the famous collections was the<b> <i>Pius X Hymnal</i></b>.<i> </i>A Philippine compilation was also published to meet the demands of reformists who urged the use of the vernacular, arguing that Latin was a barrier to understanding the rites. However, the move toward a vernacular liturgy took more than a decade to materialize. In 1965, Vatican Council II decreed the reformation and vernacularization of the liturgy through the decree <b><i>Sacrosanctum Concilium </i></b>(the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council).<b><i> </i></b>As the rites had to be translated from Latin, the use of the vernacular was not substantially implemented until the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Liturgical reform meant the simplification of rites. Gone were the ember days and the distinctions between Low and High Masses. All masses had congregational or community singing. Vernacularization spurred the growth of liturgical music in the Philippines. This followed two tracks: local composition with English lyrics and compositions in Philippine languages. The example of the African <b><i>Misa</i> <i>Luba</i></b>,<i> </i>which set Greek and Latin texts to African music, the experiments of Clarence Rivers with Negro spirituals, and the examples of the medical missionaries reached the Philippines and demonstrated the viability of using new tunes for worship. In the 1960s, the guitar, previously banned from worship, began to be used at guitar or folk masses. Examples of these are <b><i>Sunday Mass </i></b>of Kristina Benitez, 1966, some portions of which have been translated and incorporated into Cebuano hymnals; <b><i>Misang Antipona</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>first accompanied by organ and later by guitar; and the popular <b><i>Tagalog Mass </i></b>by Eduardo P. Hontiveros, SJ, 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Experiments using Philippine materials began by adapting <b>folk tunes</b> to sacred texts. Latin texts for Gregorian chants were translated into English and other languages. These early experiments produced a whole corpus of liturgical music within less than a decade.<b> </b>On the forefront of such composition were priests and nuns, among them Hontiveros, Ruben Habito, Nemesio Que, Fruto Ramirez, and Manuel Francisco. Masses were composed in the different languages of the region, spearheaded by groups such as the Daughters of St. Paul and the San Jose Seminary. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3983\"><strong>Narcisa Fernandez</strong></a> and R. Villanueva composed Cebuano masses, while Pablito C. Maghari composed masses for the dioceses of Antique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A more radical move came with the publication of <b><i>Misa ng Bayang Pilipino </i></b>(Mass of the Filipino Nation), which incorporated Filipino practices, like the lighting of many candles and the use of the <i>mano po</i> (kissing of the hand),<i> </i>into the Mass. It also adapted the <b>pasyon chants</b>. The <b><i>Misa</i></b> concertized <b><i>Sacrosanctum Concilium</i></b>&rsquo;s decree that rites be adapted to the customs of a particular country. It was intended as a prototype for the further Filipinization and vernacularization of rites; however, due to bureaucratic inertia, it is now considered a historic curiosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 20th century, more contemporary and innovative forms and styles were applied to the composition of church music. At the Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music (AILM), Francisco F. Feliciano composed masses in the modern idiom and encouraged his students to compose liturgical musics that were Asian- and indigenous-inspired. Some composers, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a>, Manuel P. Maramba, OSB, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>, wrote masses based on indigenous themes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>&rsquo;s rhythmically and harmonically colorful <b><i>Misa </i></b>was based on structural elements of some Philippine indigenous music. Cayabyab wrote another mass with full orchestral accompaniment titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/951\"><strong>Misa 2000</strong></a></i></b>. This won the second prize at the quadrennial Onassis International Cultural Competitions in 2001. He completed three other masses: <b><i>Mass for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>St. Michael&rsquo;s Mass</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and the<b><i> Blessed Trinity Mass</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Parish church music was handled by parish choirs. The Venerable Orden Tecera (VOT) Church of San Antonio de Padua in Sampaloc, Manila, boasted of an excellent choir&mdash;the Coro Antoniano, composed of professionals and directed by Antonio J. Molina, composer of <b><i>Misa Antoniana</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>One outstanding mass for mixed chorus was Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s <b><i>Misa Santo Ni&ntilde;o</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to Vatican Council II, existing choirs were the Metropolitan Cathedral Choir composed of the San Carlos Seminary Choir; the boys&rsquo; choirs of Paco Catholic School, Manila Cathedral School, and Makati Catholic School; and the glee clubs of St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, St. Paul College, St. Theresa&rsquo;s College, Holy Spirit College, Maryknoll College, Santa Isabel College, and San Beda College. The last decades of the 20th century witnessed the growth in the number of church choirs all over the country where a parish normally kept several groups for their numerous services on Sundays. Many of these choirs also ventured into concertizing outside of the confines of their home churches, as far as Europe and the Americas. Among the prominent church-based choirs who have become world renowned are the Hail Mary the Queen Children&rsquo;s Choir, Loboc Children&rsquo;s Choir, Ateneo Chamber Singers, Chorus Paulinus, Imusicapella, Kammerchor Manila, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4103\"><strong>Novo Concertante Manila</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Publishing groups and audio tapes have facilitated the diffusion of Catholic liturgical music. Among the more prominent publishing groups were the East Asian Pastoral Institute, the Society of Saint Paul, Claretian Publications, SJB (St. John Bosco) Music <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, MCB (Manila Cathedral Basilica) Music, and the Jesuit Music Ministry. Many of the popular mass songs being sung at the turn of the 21st century came from the numerous publications of the Jesuit Music Ministry, which include <b><i>Himig Heswita</i></b> (Jesuit Melody), 1982; <b><i>Himig Heswita 2</i></b> (Jesuit Melody 2), 1994, which contained choral arrangements and a segment titled &ldquo;Parangal kay Honti&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te to Honti), featuring the unpublished works of Fr Eddie Hontiveros, SJ; <b><i>Alay Kapwa Huwag Limutin</i></b> (Brotherly Offering, Do Not Forget), 1996; <b><i>Hangad: Himig at Titik</i></b> (Desire: Melody and Lyrics), 1998; and <b><i>Bayan Umawit</i></b> (Sing, People), 2003. Following the Jesuit Music Ministry&rsquo;s publications, SJB Music Company printed Lester Delgado&rsquo;s Misa Delgado Book Series beginning 2008, which has eight volumes to date: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/959\"><strong>Narito Ako</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Here I Am),<b><i> Pag-aalay </i></b>(Offering),<b><i> Sa Kanyang Pagdating </i></b>(On His Arrival),<b><i> Paglalakbay </i></b>(Journey),<b><i> Liwanag ng Pasko </i></b>(Light of Christmas),<b><i> Jesus, My Savior</i></b>,<b><i> Cross of Christ</i></b>, and<b><i> Sing to the Lord</i></b>. Claretian Publications released Tinnah dela Rosa&rsquo;s <b><i>Gaudium Mass</i></b> (Mass of Rejoicing), 2012, specifically for the new English translation of the Roman Missal, which was initiated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. MCB Music published Alejandro Consolacion II&rsquo;s <b><i>Misa Inmaculada Concepcion</i></b> (Mass of the Immaculate Conception), 2007, and his <b><i>Mass of St. Therese of the Child Jesus</i></b>, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mainline Protestant churches, like the Baptists, Methodists, and Episcopalians, did not gain a foothold in the Philippines until the 20th century when mission boards began sending personnel to the Philippines. More inclined toward traditional part-singing and the use of the organ, whether in choral or congregational singing, the Protestant churches enjoyed excellent sacred music. Among the more prominent Protestant choirs were the New Covenant Singers, the AILM Chorale, His Sounds, and the Ellinwood Chancel Choir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music, as an institution, actively propagated the use of indigenous musical materials and ideas in worship. It graduated many Asian church musicians who became active in their respective countries, invigorating worship by the inclusion of cultural elements in their rites, particularly music. Among the institution&rsquo;s projects was the compilation of hymnals of world music gathered from the various Christian churches of Asia, <b><i>Sound the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> CCA Hymnal</i></b>, published by GIA Publications Inc, 2000. The institution also published its <b><i>AILM Collection: Hymns, Psalms, and Songs for Worship </i></b>in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of charismatic groups and Pentecostal churches characterized the religious atmosphere of the 1980s. These groups used simple repetitive songs for the unstructured prayer meeting. The more complex Gospel music was sung for meditative interludes. The term &ldquo;Gospel&rdquo; encompassed a variety of contemporary musical idioms, such as jazz, rock, disco, ballads, and rap with biblical or religious lyrics. All these were also called inspirational music. A whole industry of Gospel music grew with the spread of these groups. Gospel music was also performed in concert halls. Although such performances might have appeared to be pure entertainment, they had a noble purpose and were seen as extensions of worship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These concerts were a form of evangelism, which counteracted widespread secular music considered to be destructive of Christian values. Prominent performers of Gospel music include Ray-an Fuentes, Carlo Orosa, Pinky Marquez, Carla Martinez, Joanne Lorenzana, Edward Granadosin, Tricia Amper-Jimenez, Steve Cadd, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4097\"><strong>Joel Navarro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4002\"><strong>Gary Granada</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>.

Marches vary in tempo, ranging from the slow and stately, such as those for funerals, to the very brisk, like the marches of John Philip Sousa. Some folk dances, like the <b>chotis lallo</b> or <b>chotis vintarina</b>,<i> </i>use march music in moderate tempo. Plays like the <i>komedya </i>and the <i>sinakulo </i>utilize different kinds of marcha. In the komedya, major entrances and exits necessitate marches. Christians, kings, and queens are accompanied by a slow marcha. Fast exits and entrances are done to the beat of the <b>paso doble</b>, a double-time march. The <b>punebre</b><i> </i>or funeral march accompanies the mournful wailings of a widowed queen or a princess in anguish. In the sinakulo, entrances of the <i>hudyo </i>(jews) are accompanied by the lively paso doble, while entrances of the <i>banal</i> (holy) are accompanied by the punebre. The resurrection and ascension of Christ are sometimes accompanied by the Philippine National Anthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The numerous military and town bands that proliferated during the Spanish colonial period included marches from Europe and the United States in their repertoires. The bands played <b>serenatas </b>or open-air concerts in the <i>calzada </i>and Luneta in Manila as well as town plazas everywhere. They were integral parts of the town fiesta celebrations and religious processions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marches were composed at various times in Philippine history to support certain political aims. In the revolution against Spain, the &ldquo;Alerta Katipunan&rdquo; (Katipunan, Alert) rallied many a Katipunero<i> </i>(Philippine revolutionary) toward battle, while the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a> Magdalo&rdquo; (Magdalo March), originally composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\"><strong>Julian Felipe</strong></a> for Emilio Aguinaldo, became the Philippine National Anthem. Under the American colonial government, a few marches were written, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Triumphal March,&rdquo; 1930, and Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mabuhay ang Kasarinlan&rdquo; (Hail to Independence), 1938. To support Filipino-owned companies threatened by American monopoly interests, composers were commissioned to write promotional music, such as the &ldquo;Germinales&rdquo; march composed by Jose A. Estella for the Germinal Tobacco Factory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese occupation, Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines), with text by Catalino Dionisio, virtually replaced the national anthem. Other marches of the period were Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dai-itiw ng Kalibapi,&rdquo; Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Martsa ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (March of the New Philippines) and &ldquo;President Laurel March,&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magkakapitbahay-Martsa&rdquo; (Neighborhood March).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The march was also used by anti-Japanese forces, particularly the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon (People&rsquo;s Army against the Japanese) or Hukbalahap. Marches called people to assemble for a meeting or a performance. Among the more popular marches then were &ldquo;Hukbalahap ng Bayan&rdquo; (Hukbalahap of the People) of Nueva Ecija and &ldquo;Pamisan Metung a Panig Mitatag Ya&rdquo; (A United Front Let Us Establish) of Pampanga. The Hukbalahap also did their own version of &ldquo;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines), which denounced Filipino collaborators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, many band musicians composed marches. These were Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s &ldquo;Defenders of Democracy March,&rdquo; 1948, &ldquo;National Defense March,&rdquo; 1953, &ldquo;President Magsaysay March,&rdquo; 1954, and &ldquo;Brown Brothers March,&rdquo; 1955; Hilarion F. Rubio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Silahis March&rdquo; (New Day March), 1980; Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang March&rdquo; (New Birth March), 1972; and Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Festival March,&rdquo; 1969, &ldquo;Golden Heart March,&rdquo; 1971, &ldquo;Angononian March,&rdquo; 1972, and &ldquo;Maharlika March&rdquo; (Nobility March), 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A march not intended for the brass band but for the chorus and piano was composed by Angel Pe&ntilde;a in 1989, titled &ldquo;Awit ng mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1797\"><strong>Sakada</strong></a>&rdquo; (Song of the Seasonal Cane Workers).

The term originates from the American music industry and, though it may not be widely used among Philippine audiences, such music has always been enjoyed by many Filipinos. Locally, musicians or listeners alike would simply refer to such songs as <b>kantang nakakatawa</b> (funny song).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\"><strong>Novel</strong></a>ty songs may take the form of a parody. Fred Panopio created several songs in the American &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; style (country music), a good example of which was &ldquo;Ang Kawawang Cowboy&rdquo; (The Pitiful Cowboy), which parodied Glen Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhinestone Cowboy.&rdquo; Dyords Javier recorded what inadvertently became the first Filipino rap recording, &ldquo;Na Onseng Delight&rdquo; (Duped Delight), which got its inspiration from Sugarhill Gang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rapper&rsquo;s Delight.&rdquo; Certainly, the borrowing of an existing melody or any musical element and their reinsertion in another culture became a source of humor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">American pop music, being a primary influence, is a rich source for Philippine novelty music. In the borrowing, it is often the cultural reception that gives a comical element to the music, which may not be present in the original. The yodeling in American country music, for example, was not perceived to be a novelty or a funny way of using the voice by the American audiences, but it became both in Philippine novelty songs. When rap music became popular, its lack of melody and greater focus on rhythm was perceived to be a new way of making music. It was this novelty that led to people labeling Philippine rap as novelty songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Novelty songs are also inspired by fads or current events. In 1966, talk of <i>aswang</i> (ghoul) menacing Manila inspired the Big Three Sullivans to record &ldquo;Aswang,&rdquo; whose melody was based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pandangguhan.&rdquo; In the 1980s, radio announcer Johnny Midnight became a sensation and created a controversy with his &ldquo;toning&rdquo; therapy. Inspired by this, the group Tatlong Pinoy sang &ldquo;Toning,&rdquo; which borrowed the melody from &ldquo;Banana Boat.&rdquo; Later in the same decade, political tensions in the Middle East, which directly concerned many overseas contract workers, inspired Lady Diane to sing the rap novelty song &ldquo;Sa-Sa-Saddam.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several novelty songs became a celebration or a lamentation of day-to-day predicaments or concerns. Rapasia&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Hoy! Tsismosa&rdquo; (Hey! Gossip Girl) complained of a gossipy girl. Champion bike racer Jesus &ldquo;Jess&rdquo; Garcia Jr recorded &ldquo;Buhay Siklista&rdquo; (A Cyclist&rsquo;s Life), relating the ups and downs of such a life. Bobby Gonzales sang about the confusions and difficulties in courtship in &ldquo;Hahabol-Habol&rdquo; (Chasing After). Novelty songs also served as a mild form of protest about a controversial issue in society. The Big Three Sullivans sang &ldquo;Nagbomba si Candida&rdquo; (Candida Goes Nude), a song asking a sweetheart why she went nude on film. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Likas Yaman&rdquo; (Natural Resources) complained of the exploitation of natural resources. The male vocal Pop trio APO Hiking Society&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/849\"><strong>American Junk</strong></a>&rdquo; was a song protesting pervasive American cultural influence. Interestingly, most of the songs were in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some novelty songs gave the listener advice, such as Andrew E.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Humanap Ka ng Panget&rdquo; (Look for an Ugly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>) and Yoyoy Villame&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mag-Exercise Tayo Tuwing Umaga&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Exercise Every Morning). Most certainly, sexual humor also was well represented. Pacing and Tacing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ipasok Mo Na&rdquo; (Put It In) and the Big Three Sullivans&rsquo; &ldquo;Pagbigyan Mo Ako&rdquo; (Give In to Me) were illustrations. Novelty songs may even be of a totally nonsensical nature as in Yoyoy Villame&rsquo;s &ldquo;Butsikik&rdquo; and &ldquo;Motokoy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Novelty songs have surely been around even before the term was adopted, what with the Filipino&rsquo;s penchant for humor. Sylvia La Torre sang them in the 1950s and 1960s in addition to her repertoire as the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> Queen&rdquo; and as a popular folk, pop, and classical musician. She recorded &ldquo;Waray Waray,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bahala Na&rdquo; (Come What May), &ldquo;Puting Texas&rdquo; (White Fighting Cock), &ldquo;Galawgaw&rdquo; (Impish Girl), &ldquo;Golpe de Gulat&rdquo; (Kick of Surprise), &ldquo;No Money, No Honey,&rdquo; and many others, all with a folk instrumental background of chamber string group composed of violins or <b>rondalla</b> instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later on, the influence of rock and roll started to filter through. For example, &ldquo;Hello Party Line&rdquo; by Bobby Gonzales had a heavier use of horns and included a drum set and electric guitar. Still later, a heavier rock and roll flavor was used in his &ldquo;Hahabol-Habol.&rdquo; Other comic artists who recorded during this period were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4757\"><strong>Apeng Daldal</strong></a> with &ldquo;Sa Loob ng Sine&rdquo; (Inside the Movie House), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4936\"><strong>Elizabeth Ramsey</strong></a> with &ldquo;Magapatuka Na Lang Ako sa Ahas&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d Rather Be Bitten by a Snake), and the ReyCard Duet with &ldquo;Katabi Ko&rsquo;y <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>w / Alis Diyan&rdquo; (A Ghoul&rsquo;s Beside Me / Get Out) which was inspired by The Rivingtons&rsquo; &ldquo;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow.&rdquo; Even balladeer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, dubbed &ldquo;Asia&rsquo;s Queen of Songs,&rdquo; made a contribution to the novelty song tradition with &ldquo;Ako ang Nagbayo&rdquo; (I Pounded [the Unhusked Rice]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s brought in the &ldquo;teenage idol&rdquo; craze and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a> recorded &ldquo;Pearly Shells,&rdquo; a local hit that prompted the Big Three Sullivans to parody it with &ldquo;Kanin Baboy&rdquo; (Pig Slop). Winnie Santos, aspiring young star and sister of then teen star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>, made a contribution to the novelty song list with &ldquo;Split na Tayo&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Part Ways). Tarzan and Baby Jane, a father and daughter duo, specialized in the genre and recorded several songs, among them &ldquo;Sari-saring Kapit Bahay&rdquo; (All Sorts of Neighbors), &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Maglaro&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Play), &ldquo;Baby Ko&rdquo; (My Baby), &ldquo;Tipitinpitin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babay Na sa Daddy&rdquo; (Say Goodbye to Daddy). Bebeng Samson specialized in songs with a gay or homosexual theme, such as &ldquo;Hoy Mestiso!&rdquo; (Hey, Mestizo), &ldquo;Manuela,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a> sa Luneta&rdquo; (Tears in Luneta), which was sourced from Eddie Peregrina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memories of Our Dreams.&rdquo; The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a> Band, a popular pop-rock combo of that time, recorded &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You Are the Miss Universe of My Life), which, although clearly a love song, may be considered a novelty since it expressed love in an unusual way. The folk singer Cinderella recorded a song along similar lines in &ldquo;T.L. Ako sa Yo&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m Truly in Love with You) when she expressed love heavily using the slang of the times. This decade also heralded the start of Tito, Vic, and Joey&rsquo;s (Sotto, Sotto, and de Leon, respectively) <b><i>Tough Hits</i></b> album series. They eventually produced a total of 12 albums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Disco music was at its height in the 1970s and 1980s. This inspired several Filipino artists to create new material in the genre or to parody disco hits. The male singing group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4005\"><strong>Hagibis</strong></a> was partly inspired by the American group Village People. Hagibis recorded such novelty-disco hits as &ldquo;Katawan&rdquo; (Body), &ldquo;Legs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nanggigigil&rdquo; (Irresistible Urge). Yoyoy Villame&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mr. Robot-bot&rdquo; was another disco-inspired novelty song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1980s and 1990s brought on a surging interest in rap music. The new aesthetics of this musical style provided fertile ground from which the novelty song could sprout. Rapper Andrew E. (Andrew Espiritu in real life) is best known for his hit &ldquo;Humanap Ka ng Panget&rdquo; (Look for an Ugly One), and other rap pieces like &ldquo;Banyo Queen&rdquo; (Bathroom Queen), &ldquo;Wag Kang Gamol&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t Be an Ass), &ldquo;Bastos Daw&rdquo; (Rude, They Say), and &ldquo;Binibirocha.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4905\"><strong>Michael V.</strong></a> (Beethoven del Valle Bunagan in real life but also known as Bitoy) started his comic career by releasing &ldquo;Ang Ganda-Ganda Niya&rdquo; (She&rsquo;s So Beautiful), a rap piece that served as a retort to Andrew E.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Humanap Ka ng Panget.&rdquo; Still another example of novelty rap would be the Rap trio Salbakuta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stupid Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jumboday.&rdquo; Later on in this period, rock combo ensembles gained popularity, and the group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a> created a string of originals in the novelty tradition, such as &ldquo;Mr. Suave&rdquo; (Mr. Smooth), &ldquo;Picha Pie,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Yes, Yes Show,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silvertoes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Touch My Birdie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maniwala Ka Sana&rdquo; (Hopefully, You Believe), and &ldquo;Mang Jose&rdquo; (Mister Jose).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The coming of the new century saw an explosion of novelty songs and artists. Representative of this period were Michael V&rsquo;s non-rap &ldquo;Hindi Ako Bakla&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m Not Gay); Blakdyak&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bikining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a>&rdquo; (Black Bikini), a remake of Bert Dominic&rsquo;s 1970s novelty song, and &ldquo;Modelong Charing&rdquo; (Gay Model); Tuesday Vargas&rsquo;s &ldquo;Babae Po Ako&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m a Girl); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> Agbayani&rsquo;s &ldquo;Otso-otso&rdquo; (Eight-Eight), &ldquo;Si Misis&rdquo; (The Missus), and &ldquo;Atras Abante&rdquo; (Backward Forward); Gladys and the Boxer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sasakyan Kita&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll Indulge You); and Vhong Navarro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Totoy Bibo&rdquo; (Smart-aleck Totoy), &ldquo;Don Romantiko&rdquo; (Master Romantic) &ldquo;Pamela One,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cha Cha Cha,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kanta Tayo&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Sing). Also of note were female and male singing groups that produced novelty songs with a heavily suggestive sexual flavor: the Sexbomb Girls&rsquo; &ldquo;Spaghetti Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;&rsquo;Di Ko Na Mapipigilan&rdquo; (I Can&rsquo;t Contol It Any Longer); Masculados&rsquo; &ldquo;Jumbo Hotdog,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nakaka &hellip;&rdquo; (Inducing &hellip;), and &ldquo;Sana Mama&rdquo; (Hopefully, Mama); and Viva Hot Babes&rsquo; &ldquo;Bulaklak&rdquo; (Flower), &ldquo;Kikay&rdquo; (Crazy Girl), &ldquo;Basketbol&rdquo; (Basketball), and &ldquo;Batuta ng Pulis&rdquo; (Policeman&rsquo;s Nightstick).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The performers themselves composed many of the songs mentioned. But there were also those who specialized in composing music for others. Mar Lopez, founder of the Big Three Sullivans, also composed music for several novelty singers from the 1960s onward, such as Bebeng Samson, and Tarzan and Baby Jane. Another prolific novelty song composer, Lito Camo began to be heard in the late 1990s through such performers as Sexbomb Dancers, Bayani Agbayani, Viva Hotbabes, Masculados, April Boy, Angelica Jones, and Ai-Ai de las Alas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It must be noted that if there is a great body of novelty song material produced in the national language, there are also songs of this genre in other Philippine languages. The most vibrant representation would be in the Visayan language, with Yoyoy Villame (who interestingly also composed songs in Ilocano) and his associate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4187\"><strong>Max Surban</strong></a> being most prolific contributors. Villame&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kinilao&rdquo; (Raw Food) and &ldquo;Islahanon&rdquo; (Islander) and Surban&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kolokoy&rdquo; (Jester), &ldquo;Tilawan Ta&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll Taste), &ldquo;Silhig Airline&rdquo; (Broomstick Airline), and &ldquo;Albularyong Buta&rdquo; (Blind Quack Doctor) exemplify novelty songs in Visayan. Indeed, the richness of the Philippine novelty song tradition speaks of the lighthearted manner in which Filipinos take on the joys and trials that cross their paths.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written byJose Valenciano</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

It consists of an instrumental overture, arias (solo songs), duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, choruses, and other vocal combinations, and instrumental interludes. Its creation demands a librettist, composer, and often a choreographer; its staging requires a soloist, choristers, instrumentalists, dancers, conductor, stage director, set, costume and lighting designers, and other components of a theatrical production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An opera usually consists of one to several major divisions or acts, which are sometimes divided into scenes. The first act is usually preceded by an overture, the instrumental prologue that introduces the work, and consists of principal themes to be developed in the opera. Arias are elaborate solo songs expressing a character&rsquo;s reaction to an emotional situation, while recitatives are half-spoken and half-sung passages, which carry the action to the next aria. Vocal duos, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, as well as choral, ballet, or intermezzo (additional instrumental numbers), provide variety and fuse drama and theater with the most dominant element&mdash;music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Introduced by European opera companies that visited the Philippines periodically since the late 1860s, opera was a major attraction in Manila in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For its inauguration in 1860, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> del Principe Alfonso featured a French opera company directed by Maugard. In 1868, an opera company directed by Stefani first performed in the same theater. The Assi-Panades Italian opera company performed at the Circo Teatro de Bilibid in 1874. Other performances followed: <b><i>Faust </i></b>at Teatro Variedades, 1882; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> di Lammermoor </i></b>at Teatro de Tondo, 1886 and 1888; and <b><i>Carmen</i></b>,<b><i> Ernani</i></b>, and<b><i> Aida </i></b>at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3303\"><strong>Teatro Zorrilla</strong></a>, 1894.

Operas were very popular, and plays with plenty of villains or plots that had touches of immorality would run for weeks. As plays progressed, boys went about selling cigars and sweet meats. Smoking was permitted, and clouds of smoke toward the close of performance often obscured a view of the stage. The audiences, while critical, were also exceedingly enthusiastic. Firefighters with hoses in hand were visibly present in the theater, ever ready to put out any accidental fire that might be ignited by oil lamps. Frequently the opera lasted until two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, as the audience was given time between acts to obtain refreshments at the numerous restaurants in the vicinity of the theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a brief interruption caused by the 1896 Revolution and the Philippine-American War, opera presentations resumed in 1902. In four months, about 40 operas were presented at the Teatro Zorrilla, including <b><i>Il Trovatore</i></b>,<b><i> Cavalleria Rusticana</i></b>,<b><i> Lucia di Lammermoor</i></b>,<b><i> Aida</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<i> <b>Carmen</b></i>.<i> </i>An Italian company arrived in Nov 1906, and in a four-month season presented 30 operas at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand Opera House</strong></a>, including <b><i>I Puritani</i></b>,<b><i> La Sonnambula</i></b>,<b><i> Norma</i></b>,<b><i> Tosca</i></b>,<b> <i>Ernani</i></b>,<b><i> L&rsquo;Africana</i></b>,<b><i> Manon</i></b>,<b><i> La Gioconda</i></b>,<b><i> Aida</i></b>,<b><i> Il</i> <i>Guarany</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Les Huguenots</i></b>.<i> </i>In the next season, 22 operas were staged in 48 subscription shows and 18 special performances at the Manila Grand Opera House.

Lapu, in a dream, sees an alliance between the Philippines and America that will help rescue the maidens. The incorporation of the &ldquo;Spanish March,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; and the Philippine National Anthem underscored the pro-American message of the opera.<b><i> Lakambini</i></b>, on the other hand,<i> </i>is a story of the ill-fated lovers Gat Balagtas and Lakambini whose union is aborted by Balagtas&rsquo;s conscription and death in a war against foreign invaders.

Both works pointed the way, though, for future operas with their Filipino libretti originally in the vernacular and based on local themes and stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As opera gained a wider audience, organizations supporting the art were formed, including the Manila Chamber Music Society, Islanders Choral Society, National Opera Company, Artists Guild of the Philippines, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4106\"><strong>Opera Guild of the Philippines</strong></a>, Music Theater Foundation of the Philippines, Zarzuela Foundation, and Philippine Opera Company, as well as the government&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a> (MPFP) and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the post-World War II era, a number of composers created operas inspired by the life and works of <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>. The first was Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> </i></b>(Touch Me Not), based on Rizal&rsquo;s novel. The three-act work on the libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a> was premiered at the Far Eastern University (FEU) Auditorium on 5 Feb 1957 by the MPFP. Written in the style of the <b>verismo opera </b>composers (Puccini, Mascagni, Leoncavallo), Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s opera featured a music that was inspired by the dramatic and highly emotional events of the story. Maria Clara&rsquo;s beautiful aria for soprano, &ldquo;Kay Tamis ng Buhay&rdquo; (How Sweet Is Life), <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s coloratura aria &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ni Sisa&rdquo; (Sisa&rsquo;s Song), and the duets &ldquo;Idilio sa Azotea&rdquo; (Idyll in the Azotea) and &ldquo;Sa Lupang Pangako&rdquo; (In the Promised Land) for the lovers Maria Clara and Ibarra were fine examples of the intensely dramatic portions of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Subversion), based on Rizal&rsquo;s second novel, was premiered on 8 Nov 1970 at the CCP, jointly sponsored by the CCP and the MPFP. Anthony Morli wrote the libretto with Tagalog-language consultant Eduardo P. de Leon. More intense, tragic, and revolutionary, <b><i>Fili</i> </b>had less of <b><i>Noli</i></b>&rsquo;s<b><i> </i></b>humor, idealism, or romance. Its music featured elaborate treatment of the rhythms of the <b>balitaw</b>, <b>danza</b>, <b>kundiman</b>, <b>kumintang</b>, and <b>awit </b>(metrical romance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another Rizal-inspired opera was <b><i>Binhi ng</i></b> <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan </i></b>(Seeds of Freedom) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>, in three acts with a prologue and libretto by Ricardo R. Pascual. Commissioned by the Rizal Centennial Commission, it was premiered on 30 Dec 1962 at the FEU Auditorium. The work focused on Rizal&rsquo;s thoughts from the time of his exile to his imminent martyrdom. A musical breakthrough, <b><i>Binhi</i> </b>(Seed)<b> </b>was the first Filipino opera written in the 20th-century neoclassic idiom. The use of the Philippine and Spanish national anthems projected the conflict between the ardent desire of the Filipinos to be free from the tyrannical rule of Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composers also based works on the lives of other historical figures. Pajaro&rsquo;s second opera, the three-act <b><i>Balagtas at</i> <i>Selya </i></b>(Balagtas and Selya) with libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3230\"><strong>Dionisio Salazar</strong></a>, premiered at the CCP on 21 Jul 1978, with the composer conducting. The opera tells the tragic love story of Balagtas and Selya. Through the machinations of a rival, Balagtas is sent to jail where he composes &ldquo;Kay Selya&rdquo; (To Celia) and most of <b><i>Florante at</i></b> <b><i>Laura</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Selya marries the jailer against her will. &ldquo;Bakit?&rdquo; (Why?) for soprano and &ldquo;Huling Paalam&rdquo; (Last Farewell) for baritone were well-known arias from this opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alfredo S. Buenaventura&rsquo;s three-act <b><i>Diego Silang</i></b> was commissioned by the MPFP and premiered on 14 Mar 1968 at the FEU Auditorium. Diego Silang, leader of the Ilocano, revolted against the Spaniards and was killed by the traitor Miguel Vicos. To avenge his death, his wife Gabriela continued the struggle. Buenaventura wrote four other operas: <b><i>Maria Makiling</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1963, libretto in three acts by I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado; <b><i>Alamat ng Pinya </i></b>(Legend of the Pineapple), 1970, libretto in two acts by Felicitas Reyes; <b><i>Princesa Urduja </i></b>(Princess Urduja), 1970, libretto in three acts by Regalado; and <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>,<i> </i>1973, libretto in three acts with prologue by Regalado.<b><i> Maria Makiling </i></b>is about a maiden, variously referred to as a fairy, a goddess, or half-nymph, whose acts of kindness are recounted in the legends about her. <b><i>Alamat ng Pinya </i></b>concerns the origin of the pineapple according to a Mindanao myth. <b><i>Princesa Urduja</i> </b>is about a legendary pre-Spanish princess-warrior in Pangasinan. <b><i>Hinilawod </i></b>is based on a Panay epic of the same name as recorded by F. Landa Jocano. Buenaventura&rsquo;s musical style combined the conventional and contemporary with clear, melodic fines supported by contemporary harmonies and rhythmic organization.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lucino T. Sacramento&rsquo;s three-act <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1973, with libretto by Servando de los Angeles, was commissioned by the MPFP and presented in cooperation with the CCP. Based on the awit by Francisco Balagtas, the opera showed traces of Abelardo&rsquo;s lyricism, which matched the eloquence of Balagtas&rsquo;s verses. Sacramento&rsquo;s other opera, the one-act <b><i>Pagmamahalan</i> </b>(Loving), 1969, with libretto by Regalado, extolled Philippine rural life and values. It was commissioned by Centro Escolar University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a> wrote the one-act opera <b><i>Si Pagong at si Matsing</i> </b>(The Turtle and the Monkey), 1984, with<b> </b>libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\"><strong>Rene O. Villanueva</strong></a>. It was based on the folktale &ldquo;The Monkey and the Tortoise&rdquo; narrated by Jose Rizal in his <b><i>Two Eastern Fables</i></b>. <b><i>Why Flowers Bloom in May</i></b>, Kasilag&rsquo;s last major work that she finished in early 2007, tells the story of the sun king Rayo and his devotion to his beloved earth maiden, Mara, who tends to her flowers. The libretto was written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\"><strong>Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Francisco F.

Based on the novel wrongly attributed to Fr Jose Burgos, the work tells of the assassination of the reformist Spanish governor-general Don Fernando Bustamante and the revenge taken by his wife Luisa aka La Loba Negra. Feliciano&rsquo;s expressionistic writing identified with the early atonalists, and the use of <b>pasyon chants</b> and dark orchestral colors complemented the intensely dramatic plot. Another opera written by Feliciano was <b><i>Sikhay sa Kabila ng Paalam </i></b>(Zeal despite Goodbye), with libretto by Sedfrey Ordo&ntilde;ez and Beth Puyot, and direction by Anton Juan. A music drama based on Jose Rizal&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\"><strong>Mi Ultimo Adios</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Last Farewell), it was premiered in Dec 1993 at the Rizal Park. His third opera, <b><i>Ashen Wings</i></b>, was composed in 1995, with libretto by Anton Juan Jr and Beth Puyot. It was first performed at the Samba Likhaan Open Air Theater in 1995, and was staged later that year in New York. The opera tackled the problems of land grabbing, the imposition of alien cultural and political values on the indigenous psyche, consumerism and capital materialism, and the issue of power, set in a changing space and time that alternated between the present and the past. Feliciano&rsquo;s last opera, <b><i>Dangal ng Lahi </i></b>(Honor of the Race), with libretto by Beth Puyot, tells the story of the life and martyrdom of former chief justice Jose Abad Santos and was premiered in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1996, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3939\"><strong>Jeffrey Ching</strong></a></strong> composed <b><i>Rendezvous in Venice</i></b>, with Daniel Huang as his co-librettist.

It was staged on 30-31 May 1997 in Makati. <b><i>Das Waisenkind</i></b> (The Orphan) by Jeffrey Ching was commissioned by Theater Erfurt Germany, and had its premiere in Nov 2009. It was a multicultural music theater with libretto in seven languages, a large orchestra that combined traditional symphonic and electronic instruments, and a huge case of opera singers, speaker, mimes, chorus, and dancers. It was an opera in two acts. The opera was awarded by the Theater Erfurt Audience Prize as the best opera production of its 2009-10 season. Ching&rsquo;s fourth work for theater, <b><i>Before Brabant</i></b>, 2014, was a chamber opera commissioned by the Hong Kong Arts Festival, and inspired by Robert Copland&rsquo;s <b><i>The Knyght of the Swanne</i></b>, written in 1512, one of the many sources of Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; which was set in Brabant. It was premiered on 18 Mar 2014 at the Hong Kong Ampitheater as part of the 2014 Hong Kong Arts Festival, which commissioned Ching for the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Based on Luna&rsquo;s masterpiece, the opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></i></b>, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a> and libretto by Fides Cuyugan-Asensio, who was inspired to write the libretto after reading Santiago Pilar&rsquo;s book <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>: The Filipino as Painter</i></b>, debuted at the CCP Main Theater under the direction of Alex Cortez in Feb 2003. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3954\"><strong>Jerry Dadap</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Lorenzo Ruiz, Escribano</i></b> (Lorenzo Ruiz, Court Clerk), with libretto by Ophelia Dimalanta, translated into Filipino by Florentino Hornedo, is about the life of the first Filipino saint, Lorenzo Ruiz.

Although opera was not fully Filipinized, the composers&rsquo; nationalism was expressed in allusions to or quotations of folk themes and folk styles. Their sentiments were also reflected in the use of Tagalog libretti based on Philippine literature, myths, legends, epics, peasant life, and episodes from national history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As operas in the early 1930s began to feature an all-Filipino cast, many opera singers achieved prominence and recognition.

It was already popular in the Philippines before the 1850s. The people, especially the elite in Manila, were fond of holding <i>bailes</i> (dances) in connection with life-cycle events like birth anniversaries, weddings, and baptisms, and other important occasions, like the arrival of the galleons. Writing in 1844, Lafond, a French writer, mentioned that the Spaniards did very little dancing but paid local dancers to dance the fandango, bolero, and <b>cachucha</b>, which all share a common feature: triple time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fandango, along with the other aforementioned dances, was popular in the country from the late 18th to the first half of the 19th century, as suggested by the many versions of the dance found across the country, even in remote areas like the riverine Agusan Valley where the Manobo had already incorporated the dance rhythm <b>pinandanggo</b> into their traditional dance repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Mindoro, the pandanggo is called <b>pandanggo sa ilaw</b> (Fandango of Light) because it is said to represent fishermen&rsquo;s families guiding back fishermen to the shore in candlelight. In this type of pandanggo, dancers have oil lamps or small glasses with candlelight placed on each of their hands, which they later transfer to their heads. Despite the difficulty required in balancing the glass on the dancers&rsquo; heads, it has remained a favorite among dance troupes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> composed an original music for this specific dance, which was printed along with the dance patterns in the public school textbook <b><i>Philippine National Dances</i></b>, 1946, edited by Francisca Reyes Tolentino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subject of fishing that the Mindoro pandanggo represents is similar to the <b>pandanggo oasiwas</b> from Pangasinan, which cultivated the tradition of fishermen drinking wine and dancing after a good catch. The word <i>oasiwas</i> in Pangasinense means swinging, and this refers to the dancers swinging oil lamps, loosely enclosed in scarves knotted at the ends, with their hands. In 1995, the University of the Philippines (UP) Concert Chorus staged a pandanggo oasiwas as part of a choral arrangement of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/899\"><strong>Hatinggabi</strong></a>&rdquo; in the group&rsquo;s restaging of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b>sarsuwela</b> <b><i>Ana Maria</i></b> at the UP Abelardo Hall Auditorium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regional variations of the pandanggo include the <b>pandanggo Ivatan</b> of Batanes, <b>pandanggo arikenken </b>of Ilocos, <b>sayaw sa Obando</b> of Bulacan, <b>pandanggo rinconada</b> of Camarines Sur, <b>pandanggo sa pa&ntilde;o</b> of Leyte, and <b>pandanguiado burawe&ntilde;o</b> of Samar and Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite these differences, most versions have an introduction and the <i>saludo</i>. All versions share melodies that are characterized by conjunct pitch contour and movement. In a dance music version transcribed in Manuel Merino Walls&rsquo;s <b><i>Musica Popular de Filipinas</i></b>, 1892, Walls&rsquo;s music accompanied an amorous couple from an unknown place dancing, using a salacot. The music had two sections repeated. Other pandanggo versions could have as much as seven sections. The music is played faster after each repetition, the meter sometimes shifting from 3/4 to 2/4. This hemiola effect is probably what makes the pandanggo rhythm distinctive. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> can see this in Diego Perez&rsquo;s piano medley, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas </i></b>(Memories of the Philippines), 1886, in which the primary triple rhythm of the left hand is displaced by the two-beat groupings on the right. The influence of this piano piece can be seen in later arrangements by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pandanggo music is used for songs as well. In the Tagalog region, there is a form of entertainment called<i> </i><b>pandangguhan</b>,<i> </i>which is performed during Lent. In this sung pandanggo, singers exchange verses among themselves using popular tunes, outdoing each other in their knowledge of the <b>pasyon</b><i> </i>and the Bible. Clearly, in such mixing one sees the indigenous tradition <i>duplo</i> and <i>karagatan</i> being merged with the already acculturated form of pandanggo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\"><strong>Pandanggo</strong></a></strong></a> is also used, again perhaps with different tunes, during weddings when the elders advise the newlyweds. Singers are called <b>pandanggeros</b><i> </i>and <b>pandanggeras</b>, and they sing and dance in slow sway-balance steps. The term also refers to a type of song used to entertain the workers in the rice field.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Jeanna B.

The pasyon text may be written in Tagalog or in other major Philippine languages, like Kapampangan, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Bicol, Ilonggo, Cebuano, and Waray. There are also pasyon narratives among the Ibanag and Itawes of Cagayan, the Gaddang of Nueva Vizcaya, and the Cuyunon of Palawan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></a> among the Ibanag and Itawes is rendered with a <i>lectio</i> whose text, together with neumatic musical notations, is copied in handwritten form from the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong>Procession</strong></a>arium Sacri Ordinis Predicatorum </i></b>(Sacred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>s of The Orders of Preachers) of 1861. Among the Tagalog, the first published pasyon text was Gaspar Aquino de Belen&rsquo;s <b><i>Mahal na Passion ni Jesu Christong P. Natin na Tola</i></b> (The Sacred Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\"><strong>Poetry</strong></a>), 1703. It was so popular that it had a fifth printing by 1760. However, the most commonly used pasyon text was <b><i>Casaysayan ng Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab ng Puso ng Sinumang Babasa</i></b> (An Account of the Sacred Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ Which Should Inflame the Heart of Anyone Who Reads It) by an unknown writer, first published in 1814. This version has also been referred to as <b><i>Pasiong Mahal</i></b>; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong>Pasyong <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, because it begins with the account of the creation of the world; and <b><i>Pasyong Pilapil</i></b>, after the priest who made corrections on the later edition of the text. No form of musical notation accompanies the Tagalog pasyon text. The <b><i>Pasiong Mahal</i></b> contains more than 2,500 stanzas in octosyllabic quintilla featuring five eight-syllable lines per stanza. Another Tagalog version but not as popular is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto de la Merced&rsquo;s<b><i> El libro de la Vida</i></b> (The Book of Life), also known as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1926\"><strong>Pasyong Candaba</strong></a></i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasyon is usually chanted during Lent by Catholics and Aglipayans alike in the socioreligious occasion called the <b>pabasa </b>(reading) in private homes, chapels, or in more public places like the parish church and town plaza. Chanted nonstop during Holy Week before Good Friday, the pasyon takes about 18-30 hours of straight singing. Continuous singing of this length is not practiced in the Spanish and Mexican Lenten traditions. It relates to the Philippine cultural practice connected with epic singing during important celebrations of the community. The pasyon may also be chanted, though rarely now, during wakes and death anniversaries, as well as during the reenactment of Christ&rsquo;s Last Supper called <i>huling hapunan </i>or <i>la ultima cena </i>on Maundy Thursday evening. In many towns of Rizal and Bulacan, the pabasa led to the dramatization of the pasyon episodes in the passion play called <i>sinakulo</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are various melodies and musical styles in the rendering of the pasyon. Heard among the Tagalog is a whole range of tunes, from old chant-like melodies to those borrowed from folk songs, popular songs, and even operas. In the province of Rizal, for example, <b>istilong panawagan</b><i> </i>is characterized by a very slow tempo, which contrasts with the metrically fast <b>istilong pahudyo</b>. <b>Istilong tagulaylay</b><i> </i>is also slow paced and is used especially to express grief and lament. Pasyon in many towns of Rizal is closely linked with the<i> sinakulo </i>theater tradition. Specific melodies are identified with characters of the play, such as the above-mentioned istilong pahudyo, <b>istilong Birhen</b>, and <b>istilong Hesus</b>. The Cuyunon of Palawan, who use a Tagalog text, have a repertoire of melodies called by various names, like <b>punto Nasareno</b>, <b>punto responso</b>, and <b>punto tres kaida</b>.<b> </b>When pasyon singers wish to hurry along the singing to complete the pabasa, certain melodies are used that will allow them to render the text in a continuous and brisk manner. This practice has been noted in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>, Rizal, and Pampanga where the term <i>pasalsal </i>is specific to the hurried rendering of the text to finish the pasyon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because the text is in five-line stanzas while melodic phrases tend to be symmetrical, various techniques are employed to reconcile the difference. In a widely used, old Tagalog <i>punto</i>, the first musical phrase encompasses lines 1 and 2, while the second musical phrase covers lines 3, 4, and 5. In adapting folk song melodies or similar tunes, a four-phrase melody is first sung for lines 1 to 4, which is repeated to render lines 2 to 5. Another formula makes a four-phrase melody coincide with lines 1 to 4 and appends a stock melody or standard melodic ending for line 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Generally, pasyon chanting is done a cappella. But among the Ibanag and Itawes, the use of a<b> </b>small five-stringed guitar called <b>cinco-cinco</b><i> </i>is a traditional practice. Many innovations in pasyon singing have been introduced, like the use of the guitar or <b>rondalla </b>(ensemble of stringed instruments) for accompaniment first noted in Pampanga in the 1970s, and the use of the accordion by a traveling group of pasyon singers from Cainta, Rizal, in the early 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The chanting of the pasyon is performed in two basic group formations. In the first, two people or groups of people sing alternately. In the second formation, each of the singers take turns in singing a stanza of text. A leader-chorus style is practiced by the Cuyunon where the leader begins and is later followed by the chorus in harmony. Sometimes, it is sung solo. The performance of the pasyon in most urban cities is evidenced by informality: instructions are provided while the chanting is already ongoing, or the succeeding melodic line to be used is hummed, or cues are given on its intended rendition. At times, conversations in between the chanting of the lines are also tolerated. Another important feature of the pasyon is the element of play, which is injected in its performance. Although the general structure of the text is formal, the chanting is marked by the heightening or lowering of pitch level, and the unexpected change and choice of amusing melody, usually contemporary popular tunes. This relaxed informality in the chanting of the pasyon is crucial to its performance as it fits the temperament that is called for by the social occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasyon chanting tradition is seen by many of its practitioners as a <i>panata </i>(vow)<i> </i>made by an individual or family, which in many cases has been passed on from one to two generations back. Like many indigenous rituals, the pabasa is held by sponsors, usually a family, to ask the divinity for good health, children, or good luck in a job or exam, and to give thanks for favors received. The process of sponsorship is represented by the possession of the <i>poon</i> (statue), which is handed down from one generation to the next. Due to financial constraints, many modern-day practices of the pabasa in urban locations, outside of the dedicated traditionalists in the provinces, are no longer sponsored by families but by the <i>kapatiran</i> (brotherhood/sisterhood), usually bound by their common business interests or active participation in church-based organizations, and groups like this take turns as the <i>hermano/hermana</i> (brother/sister) for a given year. Carrying this tradition among collective groups enhances their relationships, marked by the passing of the statue from one host to another, and establishes group solidarity. The socioreligious function of the pabasa in the communities of present-day Philippines, as well as the adaptability of the ritual to changing times, will ensure the dynamism, relevance, and continuity of this tradition.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

Originally a Bohemian dance, it was popular in Europe and the United States in the early 19th century. The polka also became a great favorite at Philippine soirees and balls. It eventually faded from the ballroom scene, but polka variants appeared in many local folk dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/789\"><strong>Polka</strong></a></strong></a> music is always in quick 2/4 time. It is characterized by lively melodic figurations combining 8th and 16th notes over an accompaniment figure of continuous 8th notes or one broken by a quarter or combinations of both. Utilizing the Western tonal system, the melodies are supported by simple tonic, subdominant, and dominant harmonies. The music is frequently in two or three sections made up of double periods of 16 measures each. The sections are variously repeated. In the <b>polkabal</b> of Quezon, it is ABABABAB. The <b>polka sala</b> of Calapan, Mindoro, is ABAC. Polka rhythms are found in many folk songs such as the Tagalog &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/924\"><strong>Leron-Leron Sinta</strong></a>&rdquo; (Leron-Leron Beloved) and &ldquo;Magtanim Ay Di Biro&rdquo; (Planting Rice Is Never Easy), and the Ilocano &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\"><strong>Pamulinawen</strong></a>&rdquo; (Stonehearted).<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

But the definition of &ldquo;popular&rdquo; and &ldquo;pop&rdquo; has evolved since the 1920s, and these terms are now differentiated in some books and encyclopedia. &ldquo;Popular&rdquo; may be a description of music that has been widely distributed or highly patronized by the masses. &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; on the other hand is used as a genre whose various styles have evolved from the 1950s rock and roll music and is considered an industry product. As developed in the United States (US), pop music would include varied types such as <b>blues</b>, <b>ragtime</b>, <b>jazz</b>, <b>vaudeville music</b>, <b>swing</b>, <b>rhythm and blues</b>, <b>country and folk music</b>, <b>skiffle</b>, <b>ballad</b>, <b>protest songs</b>, <b>rock and roll</b>, <b>bebop</b>, different kinds of <b>rock</b>, <b>soul</b>, <b>Latin American beat</b>, <b>disco</b>, and <b>rap</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although many types of pop music have roots in the musical traditions of communities, pop music is called such not because it necessarily emanates from the populace but more because of its great accessibility to the public. From the middle of the 20th century to the early 21st century, records, cassettes and compact discs have been mass-produced by the music industry. These have been circulated through mass media&mdash;that is, through radio, television, and, recently and more powerfully, the Internet&mdash;and are marketed to capture a large segment of the listening public. Popular acceptance by the public sometimes has nothing to do with the quality of the song or the brilliance of the performer. It can as well be engineered by disc jockeys, media hype, promotional gimmicks of recording companies, and online networks, which thus define the state of the genre at a particular time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Until 1973, pop music in the Philippines only meant Western pop music. The musicindustry that flourished in the country depended largely on importations of current US hits or local record productions of foreign labels. Generations of Filipinos thus grew up singing songs by Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Dave Clark Five, Timi Yuro, Paul Anka, The Cascades, The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Cat Stevens, Don MacLean, and Stevie Wonder. Because of the dominance of the American Top 40 hits in local airwaves, it was the American teenage pop stars who were idolized by the Filipino youth. Original Filipino songs, mostly <b>kundiman</b><i> </i>and other folksongs, comprised but a tiny percentage of local record production and sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early years of American colonial rule, popular music in the Philippine consisted of the <b>kundiman</b>, <b>danza</b>, <b>balitaw</b>,<b> </b>and other traditional forms, some of which were adaptations of foreign forms. The pop stars at the turn of the century were <b>sarsuwela</b><i> </i>singers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\"><strong>Maria Carpena</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a>delaRama. By the 1920s, American recording companies, like Victor Records and Columbia Records, were attracted enough to local music to record popular kundiman and sarsuwela songs such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a>-Dalita&rdquo; (Child of Woe), 1917; Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;MutyangPasig&rdquo; (Muse of Pasig), 1924, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/960\"><strong>Nasaan Ka Irog?</strong></a>&rdquo; (Where Are You, Love?), 1926; and Constancio de Guzman&rsquo;s &ldquo;BayanKo&rdquo; (My Country), 1928. In 1928, JovitaFuentes, who had gained international fame for her performance as Cio Cio San in the opera <b><i>Madame</i> <i>Butterfly</i></b>,<i> </i>recorded &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/855\"><strong>Ay Kalisud</strong></a>&rdquo; (Ah, Misery) and other Filipino folk songs for Odeon Records in Germany. This was followed by another Filipino opera singer, MercedesMatias, who recorded &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1767\"><strong>Madaling-Araw</strong></a>&rdquo; (Dawn) and &ldquo;MutyangPasig&rdquo; for the same German company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vaudeville, the moving pictures, and the radio opened the floodgates to American popularmusic. Filipino musicians quickly adopted the new music styles, creating their own versions of jazz, as shown in the naughty &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\"><strong>Balut</strong></a>&rdquo; (Duck Egg) popularized by Filipino &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Queen&rdquo; KatydelaCruz in the 1920s; <b>fox-trot</b>, like Pedro Bermechea&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magandang Juaning&rdquo; (Beautiful Juaning), circa 1920, which was revived in the 1970s by YoyoyVillame as &ldquo;Mag-Eksersays Tayo Tuwing Umaga&rdquo; (Let Us Exercise Every Morning); and <b>boogie</b> and rock and roll, as exemplified by the compositions of Fred Panopio like &ldquo;O ang Babae&rdquo; (Oh, Women). By the 1950s, American popularmusic had become so pervasive that Filipino performers were being gauged by how good a copycat they were of American originals. Contests were launched for the &ldquo;Elvis Presley of the Philippines&rdquo; (EddieMesa), the &ldquo;Doris Day of the Philippines&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Valenzuela), the &ldquo;Perry Como of the Philippines&rdquo; (DiomedesMaturan), and the &ldquo;Timi Yuro of the Philippines&rdquo; (NoraAunor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The desire of Filipino popmusicians to produce music they could call their own and which they hoped would find support among the youth first found expression in Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Juan de la Cruz Band</strong></a>&rsquo;s experimentation with <b>hard rock</b>, which used plaintive Filipino lyrics. &ldquo;AngHimigNatin&rdquo; (Our Music), performed extemporaneously by the band in 1973, may be considered the first Pinoy (slang for Filipino) rock piece. The song bewailed the lonely struggle of Filipino musicians to have their music accepted by an audience attuned and addicted to foreign music. But it likewise voiced the conviction that the Filipino people would find unity only when they learn to appreciate and sing their own songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang himig natin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang inyong awitin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upang tayo&rsquo;y magsama-sama</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sa langit ng pag-asa</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Sing</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Our own song</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">So that we&rsquo;ll all be together</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the heaven of hope.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;AngHimigNatin&rdquo; paved the way for other rock musicians, like Maria Cafra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a> (originally of the Juan de la Cruz Band), to enter the music industry. In 1974, the year when the Miss Universe international beauty contest was held in Manila, a group that called themselves <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a> was able to make a dent in the Manila music scene with their first hit &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You Are the Miss Universe of My Life). This was immediately followed by another hit, &ldquo;Pers Lab&rdquo; (First Love). In a way, Hotdog softened the initial shock of the audience in hearing the seemingly jarring combination of Western pop sound and Filipino lyrics. Led by the Garcia brothers, Dennis and Rene, Hotdog pioneered what became labeled as <b>Manila sound</b>, a teenybopper kind of music reminiscent of the American pop songs of the 1950s. Their other more popular and relevant hits include &ldquo;Annie Batungbakal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Manila,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bongga Ka Day&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Fabulous, Girl), with the latter two remade and recorded by artists of a later generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila Sound was clearly music the young could identify with. The tone was irreverent. Composers used chord progressions and song structures that were easily identifiable with the Western sound that the audience had been used to. But the language was colloquial or Taglish, a combination of Tagalog and English, as in Cinderella&rsquo;s &ldquo;T.L. Ako sa &rsquo;Yo&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m Truly in Love with You) and &ldquo;Ang Boyfriend Kong Baduy&rdquo; (My Gaudy Boyfriend). The theme mostly revolved around young love, like ApoHikingSociety&rsquo;s &ldquo;Syota&rdquo; (slang for girlfriend). Other groups such as VST &amp; Co. became known for their disco tunes, like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>in Mo, Isasayaw Ko&rdquo; (Sing and I Will Dance), &ldquo;Rock Baby Rock,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Magsayawan&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Dance). Following this trend of dance music was The Boyfriends with their hit &ldquo;Sumayaw, Sumunod&rdquo; (Dance, Follow).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several factors helped to create a climate conducive to the development of <b>Pinoy popmusic</b>. In 1975 the Broadcast Media Council (BMC) issued Memorandum Order 75-31 requiring all radio stations to play at least one Filipino composition every hour. This was later expanded to two per hour, and finally to three per hour in 1977. The BMC ruling and the subsequent support of the Kapisananngmga BrodkastersaPilipinas gave more exposure to local musicians and encouraged recording companies to pay attention to local talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Similarly, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\"><strong>Rolando S. Tinio</strong></a>&rsquo;s translations of Cole Porter, Burt Bacharach, and Jim Webb songs, among others, showed the wide range of experiences and emotions the Filipino language could express, and the flexibility of Filipino to be accommodated in modern musical form. The poetry that was Tinio&rsquo;s translations as performed by CelesteLegaspi in front of a jampacked Little Theater (now Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino) at the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines(CCP) encouraged other musicians and poets to use popmusic as a vehicle for their creativity. In 1977, another CCP musical event,<b><i>Tales ofthe Manuvu</i></b>,<i> </i>with libretto by literary critic and poet BienvenidoLumbera, pointed to the possibility of using indigenous tales as material for rock. The <b>rock opera</b>, which was composed by Nonong Pedero, produced hits like &ldquo;Noong Unang Panahon&rdquo; (Once upon a Time) and launched Leah Navarro as a pop singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first Metro Manila PopularMusic Festival or Metropop was held at the Folk Arts Theater in 1978. The festival was an annual competition in song composition aimed at encouraging the production of original Filipino popmusic. The best song was chosen, however, not on the basis of a distinctive Filipino quality or sound but on how well it approximated what recording companies perceived to be international popmusic standards. The fact, though, that losers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anak&rdquo; (Child) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;ymgaPinoy&rdquo; (We&rsquo;re Filipinos) won in terms of record sales over that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;KayGandangAtingMusika &rdquo; (How Beautiful Is Our Music) was a telling commentary on the supposed international criteria of the Metropop Festival. The festival ran until 1985, producing original songs that would shape the development of the local music industry. It was revived from 1996 to 2003 by GMA Network. Consequently, the competition influenced several organizations to put up more avenues for producing original songs in the new millennium&mdash;namely, the Himig <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> and Philpop songwriting competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the first day of its release in 1978, Aguilar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Anak&rdquo; sold an unprecedented 30,000 copies. It became an instant hit even in Japan and has since been translated into several foreign languages. Philippine music scholar Felipe de Leon Jr asserted that even if the song was in Western folk form, its <b>pasyon</b>-like quality and the familiar Filipino theme of the ill fate that befalls children who do not heed their parents&rsquo; advice endeared &ldquo;Anak&rdquo; to million of Filipinos. On the other hand, the radical content of Heber Bartolome&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;ymgaPinoy&rdquo; became easy to digest because of the chiding tone employed and the humorous way he assailed those who continue to ape American ways. Through the medium of rock, Heber successfully called attention to the need for Filipinos to take pride in their own Filipino-ness:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tayo&rsquo;y mga Pinoy</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tayo&rsquo;y hindi Kano</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Huwag kang mahihiya</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kung ang ilong mo ay pango</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(We&rsquo;re Filipinos</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">We&rsquo;re not Americans</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Don&rsquo;t be ashamed</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">If you are pug-nosed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The jubilation of local musicians at being accepted by an audience they had thought impossible to reach resulted in greatly increased productivity and, most importantly, a greater variety of songs. During this period, many important albums were released, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Mga Tula at Awitin ni Florante </i></b>(The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1932\"><strong>Poems</strong></a> and Songs of Florante), Mike Hanopol&rsquo;s <b><i>Awiting Pilipino </i></b>(Filipino Songs), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ako at si</i> <i>Celeste </i></b>(Celeste and I), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>NgayonatKailanman </i></b>(Now and Forever). A variety of hit songs emerged, such as Nonoy Gallardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1283\"><strong>Saranggola</strong></a>niPepe&rdquo; (Pepe&rsquo;s Kite), which in metaphoric language was Philippine history in song, and the 1978 love song &ldquo;Nakapagtataka&rdquo; (How Puzzling) performed by HajjiAlejandro and revived by her daughter Rachel Alejandro. This explosion in record production proved that local records were marketable and could compete with foreign labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Pinoy Pop Forms</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although Pinoy pop musicians create their own compositions, the musical forms they write in are almost always derived from or inspired by American popmusic. Pinoy rock, for instance, ranges from rock and roll (typified by Sampaguita), to Beatle-type music (Heber Bartolome and his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a>), to Alice Cooper&rsquo;s kind of heavy rock (Juan de la Cruz Band, Maria Cafra, Mike Hanopol, Wally Gonzalez). All make use of the amplified sounds of electric guitars, drums, synthesizers, and other electronic instruments. On the other hand, many Pinoypop songs have also been created in the mold of the safe, &ldquo;middle-of-the-road&rdquo; type of music, the best example being the compositions of the ApoHikingSociety and JoseMariChan in the late 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contrary to the term &ldquo;folk,&rdquo; Pinoy folk music is not rooted in the folk traditions of Filipinos but draws mainly from the repetitive, simple folk tunes popularized by Western folk groups like Peter, Paul, and Mary, and folk singers such as Joan Baez, and Bob Dylan. Folk singers FreddieAguilar, Florante, Coritha, and the folk group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a>, for example, who began their careers in folk houses that proliferated in the 1970s, accompanied their songs with the same plucking of classical or acoustic guitar strings as their Western counterparts. And like their Western counterpart, their songs were vehicles for social commentaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An encouraging development in Pinoy folk music came with ethnic fusion, which uses the ethnic instruments and musical patterns and rhythms from the folk traditions of the <i>lumad </i>(indigenous cultural communities). The group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/861\"><strong>Baleleng</strong></a>, for example, derived their name from the popular Tausug folksong form <b>baleleng </b>and draws materials and rhythms from the song traditions of the Tausug and Sama of Sulu. JoeyAyala and his group Ang Bagong Lumad fused the ethnic rhythms of Mindanao cultural communities with Western pop forms. The sounds emanating from the <b>hagelong</b><i> </i>(two-stringed lute) and the <b>kubing</b><i> </i>(mouthharp) were not just embellishments but are integral parts to Ayala&rsquo;s music. The ethnic music patterns have become so naturalized that in the song &ldquo;Mirasol,&rdquo; for example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a> succeeded in making his guitar sound like a <b>kulintang</b>,<b> </b>the eight-brass gongs of graduated sizes found in Mindanao. Versatile RyanCayabyab also dabbled in this ethno-pop form to produce the successful Pop Cola commercial in which the rhythmic patterns of the <i>singkil </i>were used. Pinoy jazz musicians, like BoyKatindig and Eddie Munji, have been particularly successful in transforming folk tunes to jazz, and in experimenting with a variety of ethnic instrumentation. The use of ethnic instruments, lumad music patterns, and rhythms for contemporary modern expression may just pave the way for creating what can truly be called Pinoypop music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When disco music became a fad in the United States, Pinoy pop musicians also produced their own version of Pinoy disco music. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4005\"><strong>Hagibis</strong></a>, which became known as the local version of the Village People in the late 1970s and early 1980s, produced Pinoy disco music reeking with machismo. Even Hotdog created songs in the regularized disco 4/4 beat, sometimes spicing the song with social comments as in their hit song &ldquo;Annie Batungbakal,&rdquo; which recounted the sad story of a girl who hid behind the anonymity of her daytime job as a salesgirl, but who reigned at night as disco queen of Manila&rsquo;s Coco Banana, a popular discotheque in the late 1970s for both gay and straight crowds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rap, which became a craze in America in the late 1980s, is actually an old musical form popular with black singers. It is a fast-paced rhythmic narration aided by electronic music instruments and performed with dancing. Pinoy rap was initiated by Francis Magalona. In his hands, rap became a call for patriotism, as seen in his immensely popular &ldquo;MgaKababayanKo&rdquo; (My Countrymen), or as a chastisement of drug addicts, as in &ldquo;Praning&rdquo; (colloquialism for paranoid). Other rappers have since emerged to deal with a variety of Pinoy experiences, like Andrew E., who recorded &ldquo;Humanap Ka ng Panget&rdquo; (Look for an Ugly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>) and Gloc 9, who became widely recognized in the following decade with hits such as &ldquo;Hari ng Tondo&rdquo; (King of Tondo), &ldquo;Sirena&rdquo; (Mermaid), and &ldquo;Magda.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s saw the rise of alternative bands rooted in the 1980s underground music scene. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a> became the standard for mainstreaming alternative rock songs. Formed in 1989, the band, whose members were Ely Buendia, Marcus Adoro, Buddy Zabala, and Raimund Marasigan, began playing their original songs on campus at the University of the Philippines Diliman. They released their first commercial album with BMG Records in 1993 titled <b><i>Ultraelectromagneticpop! </i></b>and from there, hits followed one after the other, including &ldquo;Pare Ko&rdquo; (Brod), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a>&rdquo; (Happiness), &ldquo;Magasin&rdquo; (Magazine), &ldquo;Alapaap&rdquo; (Clouds), &ldquo;With a Smile,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/905\"><strong>Ang Huling El Bimbo</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Last Airhead). The group was able to record seven studio albums. The use of distortion, power chords, and ringing riffs on the guitar, the poetic lyrics about daily encounters, emotions, and social concerns, and the unpretentious vocals all created a soundscape that captured a sometimes murky, sometimes rock and roll, sometimes drum-heavy style. This was also the style adopted later on by other popular alternative bands, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a>, Yano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a>, Chicosci, Sandwich, Moonstar88, and 6CycleMind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The alternative rock style in mainstream continued toward the beginning of the 21st century, but the music noticeably evolved due to developments in sound recording. Bands like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4184\"><strong>Sugarfree</strong></a>, Kamikazee, Urbandub, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a>, Kjwan, Rocksteddy, Itchyworms, and Peryodiko also developed a newer style which was a fusion of other styles, such as punk, electronic, progressive rock, heavy metal, ska punk, and grunge. And they learned to employ various media such as music video productions, TV shows, and new radio stations that featured alternative and rock music, such as Jam 88.3 and NU 107 Rock, to tap into the large audience of college students and young working class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is significant to note how the independent music has become linked to the pop music as a result of the move of major recording labels to sign up underground alternative bands. Genres known only in the indie scene began to emerge and gain a greater following, thus creating new tastes in popular music. A successful independent band that crossed over to mainstream was Up Dharma Down. With the use of keyboards, synthesizers, drum samplers, experimentation with electronic and various sounds and instrumentation, and the distinct vocal quality of female lead Armi Millare, the band produced songs that were not only popular in the country but also recognized internationally. Indie bands (aside from those with alternative rock style) that proceeded to invade the pop music scene include Orange and Lemons, which had a retro style influenced by The Beatles and The Cure. Radioactive Sago Project, which first signed up with major label Viva Records then resorted to the indie scene after their first album, became more popular after the release of their second album under an independent label. The band brought together spoken word poetry, humor, irony, jazz, punk, soul, Afro-Latin, and a lot of other sporadically mixed styles that conveyed novelty and appealed to critical audiences. Fronted by four-time Palanca award-winning writer Lourd de Veyra, the band&rsquo;s popular hits include &ldquo;Ayoko ng Baboy&rdquo; (I Don&rsquo;t Like Pig) and &ldquo;Astro.&rdquo; All these three bands were under Terno Recordings, an independent label that sought to popularize music with unique-sounding characteristics, which may include jazz, indie rock, house, techno, fusions, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other side of the spectrum, movies and television drama began using theme songs to create mass appeal. The songs became popular simultaneously with the movie or show or became the main component for a movie or TV show&rsquo;s audience recall. In 1991, pop singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a> popularized the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\"><strong>Rey Valera</strong></a> song &ldquo;Maging Sino Ka Man&rdquo; (Whoever You May Be) for the movie of the same title where she was also the lead actress. Other movies that utilized the mass popularity of songs were &ldquo;Nandito Ako&rdquo; (I Am Here), 1994, music by Aaron Paul del Rosario, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1278\"><strong>Sana Maulit Muli</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Hope It Happens Again), 1995, music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>. This trend even extended in the 2000s: &ldquo;Kailangan Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw&rdquo; (What I Need Is You) and &ldquo;Kailangan Kita&rdquo; (I Need You), both in 2000 and both by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3860\"><strong>Ogie Alcasid</strong></a>, and &ldquo;My First Romance,&rdquo; 2003, music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a> series on TV networks <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> and GMA became more memorable because of the pop hits associated with them, such as &ldquo;Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo&rdquo; (I Promise You), composed by Rey Valera; &ldquo;Bituing Walang Ningning&rdquo; (Star without Sparkle), composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\"><strong>Willy Cruz</strong></a>; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/891\"><strong>Forevermore</strong></a>,&rdquo; composed by Joey Benin; and &ldquo;Mula sa Puso&rdquo; (From the Heart), composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4167\"><strong>Vehnee Saturno</strong></a>. These songs were performed by popular solo artists, usually female, who have successfully released pop records. A singer would be deemed truly popular after she (or he) has crossed show business platforms&mdash;that is, from singing, to acting, to hosting, and sometimes to dancing. These qualities have been achieved by &ldquo;popular female idols&rdquo; such as Sharon Cuneta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4220\"><strong>Regine Velasquez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3999\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Sarah Geronimo</strong></a></strong></a>, and Rachelle Ann Go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino show bands, included in entertainment acts in bars, hotels, cruise ships, and event functions around the country and even around the world, and primarily reaching <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a> audiences, have been around since the early 20th century. They usually perform versions of popular songs of various genres and would usually consist of one or two lead singers with a versatile singing quality and range, a keyboardist, a guitarist, a bass player, and a drummer. From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, some of these bands began to compose original songs that later gave them access to the pop music industry. The band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a>, whose members included their main composers Joey Benin, Joey Generoso, and Naldy Gonzales, released their first album in 1989 and succeeded with their hit songs &ldquo;Hold On&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forevermore.&rdquo; Their musical style may be described as R&amp;B with pop jazz nuances. This style was very similar to the bands that later on became popular. Southborder, formed in 1996, became widely known for their hits such as &ldquo;May Pag-ibig Pa Kaya&rdquo; (Can Love Still Be There), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/910\"><strong>Kahit Kailan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Ever), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/985\"><strong>Rainbow</strong></a>,&rdquo; all composed by keyboardist and vocalist Jay Durias. Freestyle, originally from Davao, also became popular beginning 1999 through their hit songs &ldquo;Before I Let You Go,&rdquo; &ldquo;So Slow,&rdquo; and the remake of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/859\"><strong>Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang</strong></a>&rdquo; (Why Did You Come Just Now). Bands such as these are still active in the 21st century, but are less prominent in the mainstream industry as newer acts have persisted. Acoustic artists came into popularity in the early 2000s, making music that was mostly cover versions with guitar or keyboard and vocal arrangement. MYMPled in this style, but Jimmy Bondoc was able to utilize it, together with his keyboard and his voice, in his composition &ldquo;Let Me Be the One&rdquo; in 2003. Nyoy Volante also composed and recorded original hits with his band, himself on the guitar: &ldquo;Nasaan&rdquo; (Where) in 2005 and &ldquo;What Do I Do?&rdquo; in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Pinoy Pop Lyrics and Themes</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the surface, it would indeed seem that Pinoypopmusic was simply the local version of whatever music was popular in America. But musical form is only half the song. The language of the song has its own rhythm, too, and expresses feelings or captures experiences unmistakably and originally Pinoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional views about love, a carryover from the kundiman, continued to dominate Pinoy love songs, even if these were in the pop forms of Bacharach, Jim<b> </b>Webb, or Paul <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\"><strong>George Canseco</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;NgayonatKailanman&rdquo; (Now and Forever) and his &ldquo;Hanggang sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan&rdquo; (Till the End of Infinity) were typical expressions of the age-old Filipino hope that love will last forever. But the language was more controlled, the lines more poetic. In JoelNavarro and Rolando Tinio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pagsinta&rsquo;y Pang-araw at Gabi&rdquo; (Love Is for Every <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2170\"><strong>Day and Night</strong></a>), the different stages of a love relationship unfolded beautifully in the images of nature (i.e., rice grains and clouds) and the passing of time. Such a song clearly captured the rhythm and poetry in the native language. There were some love songs, however, that seemed to be imbued with a modern temper, depicting the modern Filipina as no longer the shy or coy type, as shown in &ldquo;Lumapit Ka&rdquo; (Come Near). Songs of this type, however, were few and did not really advocate significant changes in the traditional man-woman relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the hands of younger songwriters, more varied Filipino experiences were explored. Deriving from the music of The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, and Bob Dylan, singers like Mike Hanopol, Freddie Aguilar, HeberBartolome, and Florante used the medium of rock or Western folk music to gain insights into their own social condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mike Hanopol and Freddie Aguilar focused on the attitudes and social mores of Filipinos that impede their personal growth. They criticized Filipinos for their pride, their love for show, and their laziness&mdash;for example, Freddie Aguilar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Katamaran&rdquo; (Laziness). They chided Filipinos for their hypocrisy and insincerity, as in Mike Hanopol&rsquo;s rock piece &ldquo;Mr. Kengkoy&rdquo; (Mr Funny Man). They assailed those reared with all the comforts of life for not making positive contributions to society. In &ldquo;LakisaLayaw&rdquo; (Spoiled Brat), his most popular rock composition, Mike Hanopol offered the image of a <i>jeproks </i>(Filipino slang for a spoiled, idle person who dresses the part) with all the vices in the world. The music made noisy proclamation of the message of the song&mdash;that the only fate for such people was jail. Though modern and Western in form, these songs had a didactic strain that may account for their popularity among the masses, since native literature, from proverbs and folktales, to popular dramasand novels, has always claimed the function of teaching. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rising above didacticism, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a> portrayed in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/984\"><strong>Pumapatak ang Ulan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Rain Falls) the tragedy of idle youth in a fast-changing urban society. In a jazzy, melancholic beat heightened by a flute in the background, the drabness of city life was expressed in the meaningless activities forced on a person by poverty and the continual rain. The ApoHikingSociety, composed of JimParedes, DannyJavier, and Boboy Garovillo, was one of the most versatile groups in the country, and has had the longest staying power in the popmusic scene. The group&rsquo;s songs ranged from the romantic to the sardonic, the most radical being their innovative &ldquo;AmericanJunk,&rdquo; 1986, which satirized the Americanization of the Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1983, they were among the few Pinoy pop musicians who joined the millions of Filipinos who protested the slaying of Ninoy Aquino. Immediately after the assassination, they composed a song based on the popular protest slogan &ldquo;Hindi Ka Nag-iisa&rdquo; (You Are Not Alone), which did the rounds among street parliamentarians but never made it to the airwaves. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\"><strong>Jim Paredes</strong></a> recalled that no radio station was willing to play the song because it was too politically charged. Protest, he discovered, had to thrive outside the industry. Freddie Aguilar suffered a similar fate when his interpretation of the popular 1928 protest kundiman &ldquo;BayanKo&rdquo; (My Country), which he interspersed with strains of &ldquo;Philippines, My Philippines,&rdquo; could not, ironically, be aired over mainstream radio but only rang out from loudspeakers mounted atop jeepneys during rallies and demonstrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The problems of poverty were most successfully explored in the songs of Heber Bartolome, who used his songs to raise his listeners&rsquo; social consciousness about the gravity of their poverty. His images included beggars lining the streets with hands outstretched, as in &ldquo;Buhay Pinoy&rdquo; (Filipino Life); starving, skeletal, and ailing children seeking relief from their suffering, as in &ldquo;Awit sa mga Magulang&rdquo; (Song to Parents); and girls who become prostitutes because they are poor, as in &ldquo;Nena.&rdquo; Bartolome made all these accessible for public consumption with Beatle-influenced instrumentation. He traced the problems of the Philippines to it being, in reality, an enslaved nation despite its supposed independence. In his stirring and powerful &ldquo;Awit Ko&rdquo; (My Song), Bartolome summoned the image of babies born with fists clenched, their protest against their nation beholden to foreigners beginning too early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pinoypop protest music would not be complete without the mention of the group Asin. Even before environmental issues came to the fore, Asin was already lamenting the pollution and destruction of the environment in their song &ldquo;Masdan ang Kapaligiran&rdquo; (Look at the Environment). Only later did other music artists like the ApoHikingSociety and rapper Francis Magalona pick up on issues such as protection of the ozone layer, global warming, and forest denudation. Another significant group that contributed socially relevant songs was the young vocal group Smokey Mountain. The first group was formed in 1989 by composer and producer Ryan Cayabyab with singers Geneva Cruz, James Coronel, Tony Lambino, and Jeffrey Hidalgo, who all continued to be part of the music industry after the group disbanded. Their hit songs include &ldquo;Paraiso&rdquo; (Paradise), a song of hope despite the depreciating environment; &ldquo;Better World,&rdquo; a call to recover the beauty of the world; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>,&rdquo; a song about a child narrating about her mother living in another country as a domestic helper. Their other popular love songs include &ldquo;Kailan&rdquo; (When) and &ldquo;Can This Be Love.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">What gave Pinoypopmusic its Filipino character was essentially the poetry in its lyrics and the Filipino-ness of the experience it sought to capture. Folk singer Florante de Leon perhaps best articulated the meaning of Pinoypop music. In his song &ldquo;Laya&rdquo; (Freedom), he explained that the sound of Pinoy music may be something most listeners were familiar with, but the lyrics spelled the difference and identified the music as Filipino. He further called attention to the important role songs with Filipino lyrics played in helping the Filipinos free themselves from the enslaving force of colonial mentality:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kung pakikinggan ang inaawit ko ngayon</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sasabihing narinig n&rsquo;yo na ito noon</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ngunit ngayon ang titik ay iba</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mapapansing ito&rsquo;y Tagalog na.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dati rati ang isipan ko&rsquo;y alipin lang</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Isip ng banyaga ang aking kinagisnan;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aking pinutol ang tanikala</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upang ang isip ko ay lumaya</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(If you listen to what I am singing now</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">You will say you&rsquo;ve heard this before,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But now the words are different</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">You&rsquo;ll notice they&rsquo;re already in Tagalog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once, my mind was a slave</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">I wakened first to foreign thoughts,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But I broke the chain</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">So that my mind would be free.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Pinoy Pop Today</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, BMC was dissolved. Radio stations went back to the old practice of airing mostly American Top 40 hits. This development and the popularity of disco music and minus-one tapes effectively shut out Pinoypopmusic from the airwaves. For a time, groups like Baleleng from Mindanao were confined only to provincial radio stations. Manila-based pop musicians and performers thus formed the Organisasyon ng mga Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM, which also refers to Original Pilipino Music), to rally support for Pinoypop music and to help secure more protection for songwriters, performers, and musicians in their contracts with recording companies. Though some asserted that the audience was never lost and that Pinoypopmusic continued to be created, local recording companies were not too keen on producing Pinoypop songs, thus accounting for the relatively few productions during the early part of the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, however, President Corazon C. Aquino issued Executive Order 255, restoring the order for all radio stations to play Filipino songs, this time four per hour. Once again the climate became conducive to Pinoypopmusic production. Pop musicians responded by producing new hits, using new forms such as rap. Under the new dispensation, the Philippine pop music industry also became hospitable to the compositions of protest songwriters, such as InangLaya, Susan Fernandez-Magno, JessSantiago, and Joey Ayala at ang Bagong Lumad. Of these protest song artists, the music industry was kindest to Joey Ayala at ang Bagong Lumad, seeing great commercial promise in the ethnic instrumentation that the group had naturalized into their music, and Universal (formerly Wea) Records spent a considerable amount of funds to promote the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today the struggle of the Pinoy pop musician against the dominance of American popular music in the local music industry continues. But there are many encouraging signs. Individuals and organizations continue to strive to maintain and promote Original Pilipino Music. Songwriting competitions, such as Metropop Song Festival, Himig Handog, and Philpop, endeavor to do this. Societies and organizations that work to ensure that artists are protected are spirited about their important responsibility. Music industry groups&mdash;such as the Filipino Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3878\"><strong>Asosasyon ng Musikong Pilipino</strong></a>; and OPM&mdash;work seriously for the rights of their artist members. Nationwide workshops and camps on songwriting are more active in the second decade of the 21st century. The organization 7101 Music Nation, for example, has pioneered the Elements Songwriting Camp. There are also web programs and sites dedicated to promoting OPM, such as radiorepublic.com, amplify.ph, opmtunes.com,<i> </i>and philippinemusicregistry.com.<i> </i>Websites such as Soundcloud and YouTube have given way for amateur, independent, and even signed Filipino artists to post and share their talents and songwriting products online and to a wider audience. But more importantly, Filipino musicians continue to write songs in their native language, and the very rhythm of the language may well be transforming their music and creating sounds that are original, modern, and distinctly Filipino.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5335\"><strong>Teresita Gimenez-Maceda</strong></a>, u</strong> </em><em><strong>pdated by Cristina Maria P.

Set to tradi&shy;tional song forms like the <b>kundiman</b>,<b><i> </i>danza</b>, and <b>composo</b>, or to agitational martial beat, or, as in current times, to Western folk and rock tunes, protest songs in the Philippines have always been part of rallies and strikes, efforts to unite a sector or a people under a common cause, and the people&rsquo;s struggles for independence. Indirectly they have also served to mir&shy;ror and record the history of a people&rsquo;s struggle for liberation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>The Revolution of 1896</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the Philippine song forms that have been used to stir deep patriotic sentiments throughout various phases of the Filipino people&rsquo;s struggle for independence and freedom is the <b>kundiman</b>. Associated almost always with the theme of sincere but unrequited love, the melodic patterns of the kundiman were already close to the hearts of Filipi&shy;nos at least a hundred years before the 1896 Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music of the kundiman is characterized by extreme lyricism delineated by a highly moving melo&shy;dic contour. Expressive of pain, suffering, sadness, loss, and tears, it became, during the period of revolt against Spanish colonial rule, the language not only of the suffering lover who pledges undying love to his beloved even as his love is unreciprocated, but also of the suffering revolutionary who willingly lays down his life for Inang Bayan or the Motherland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the hands of the Katipunero<i> </i>(Philippine revolutionary), the kundiman was transformed to contain revolutionary meaning. Some&shy;times, the song spoke directly about the revolutionary experience, as in the song &ldquo;Sa Dalampasigan&rdquo; (On the Seashore), which recalled the martyrdom of Burgos and Rizal in the hands of the treacherous friars and appealed to all Filipinos to take to the mountains and the fields to continue the fight for freedom. At other times, the kundiman took the form of an allegory as in &ldquo;Iginanti&rsquo;y Pinatay&rdquo; (The Favor Returned with Death), a song with the same melody as that of the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a> de 1800&rdquo; (Kundiman of 1800), known more popularly as &ldquo;Doon Po sa Amin&rdquo; (In Our Town). In &ldquo;Iginanti,&rdquo; the traveler&rsquo;s act of stabbing and chopping off a leafy tree that had given him shade could be read as colonial ex&shy;ploitation. In some cases, however, revolutionary mean&shy;ing may have been read into the lyrics, which simply ex&shy;pressed pure, undying love for an idealized woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a> referred to the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/909\"><strong>Jocelynang Baliwag</strong></a>&rdquo; (Jocelyna of Baliwag), ca 1896, as a <b>kundiman ng himagsikan</b> (kundiman of the revolution). Dedicated to Pepita (nickname of Jocelyna Tiongson of Baliuag, Bulacan), the piece was de&shy;scribed as the &ldquo;Musica del Legitimo Kundiman Procedente del Campo Insurecto&rdquo; (Music of the Legitimate Kundiman Coming from the Rebel Camp). This song, together with other folk kundiman of the time, greatly appealed to the revolutionary sentiments of the Katipunero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period of the Philippine revolution spawned many songs other than the kundiman. It was common practice among the Katipunero to take marching songs from the Spanish colonial forces and endow these with new lyrics that express the particularities of the na&shy;tion&rsquo;s struggle. Such was the case with &ldquo;Alerta, Katipunan&rdquo; (Alert, Katipunan), originally a Spanish mar&shy;tial song. The Katipunero version sang of the hardships revolutionaries must bear and the extraor&shy;dinary courage they must have to secure the freedom of Inang Bayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The triumph of the revolution that was to bring about a free society purified of the evils of colonial rule and consecrated to honor virtue and excellence was already envisioned in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4093\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/940\"><strong>Marangal na Dalit ng Katagalugan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Noble Hymn of the Tagalog Region), 1896, a song that could have been the Philip&shy;pine national anthem had Bonifacio lived to become president. Independence, however, was thwarted by America, the new colonizer. The struggle would continue long after the Philippines was granted its &ldquo;flag independence&rdquo; in 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>The Mass Movements of the 1930s</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Voices of protest continued to be raised against the American colonial order. From the turn of the century, poets began to write patriotic lyrics to kundiman music while schooled musicians innovated on its music, modulating it from major to minor. In 1928, the popular poet Jose Corazon de Jesus wrote the lyrics of the immortal &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1415\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (My Country) to the music composed by Constancio de Guzman. Originally created to protest American colonization of the country, the song was revived in the 1970s and 1980s to protest against the Marcos dictatorship. No other Philippine protest song has had the power to evoke such strong patriotic fervor and to unite people of different political backgrounds, consolidating them in the face of violent dispersal. Long considered the anthem of protest movements, &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; is the only kundiman sung with clenched fists. It remains contemporary because its lyrics and melody have always had great affective power among Filipinos and dramatizes the unchanged condition of Inang Bayan:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang Bayan kong Pilipinas</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lupain ng ginto&rsquo;t bulaklak</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pag-ibig ang sa kanyang palad</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nag-alay ng ganda&rsquo;t dilag</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Philippines!

Radicalized labor&shy;ers and peasants saw the importance of organized action to fight for their rights and to change the social system. Political parties with a markedly revolutionary character were established. The largest of these were the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP), which had the Kalipunan ng mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a>pawis sa Pilipinas and the Kalipunang Pambansa ng mga Magsasaka sa Pilipinas as its labor and peasant arm, and the Partido Sosialista ng Pilipinas (PSP), which had the Aguman Ding Maldang Talapagobra (AMT) for its mass organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The desire and the struggle for radical changes in society found articulation in the many militant songs created by the members of these radical organizations. The song form became an important political weapon for organizing and recruiting new members, a means for peasants and workers to confront their collective problems, and a way to strengthen their resolve to continue with the struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the songs of the PKP revolved around the theme of class struggle. The songs stressed the need for the laborers and peasants to unite in order to put an end to their exploitation in the hands of the ruling class, represented by the American imperial power and by local capitalists and landlords. The songs were mostly set to martial music. A few were adapted from the songs of communist parties of other countries, such as &ldquo;Sulong Ka Bayan&rdquo; (Onward, Country) from the Italian &ldquo;Bandiera Rosa&rdquo; (Red Banner). Most effective when sung in strikes and demon&shy;strations, the song chided the <i>tamad na burgis</i> (lazy bourgeois) who were not ashamed to live off the sweat of the laboring class. Even after the PKP went underground, songs con&shy;tinued to be used to keep the fire of commitment among its members burning and to instill in their minds the justness of the cause they were fighting for. Songs like &ldquo;Rebolusyong Sosyal&rdquo; (Social Revolution) and &ldquo;Sisikat ang Bagong Araw&rdquo; (A New Day Will Rise) made more frequent reference to the waving of the red banner and called for unity among the oppressed in order to stage a social revolution and establish a soviet order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs were also created during this period to address the youth and women sectors. &ldquo;Gumising Ka, Kabataan&rdquo; (Wake Up, Youth), written for a youth con&shy;gress in the mid-1930s, called on the youth to take on a more active role in the struggle for freedom. &ldquo;Babaeng Walang Kibo&rdquo; (Passive Woman) asked mothers to listen to their children&rsquo;s cries of hunger and to understand their oppressed condition in the context of the class struggle. These songs, along with other PKP songs, survived the 1930s and became standard songs in pro&shy;test actions of the 1960s and the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like the PKP, the PSP, which was founded in the early 1930s by Pedro Abad Santos, made effective use of songs to spread its political cause. Mass meetings and <i>paradas </i>(parades) were always accompanied by singing. Singers with strong and powerful voices were especially recruited by poet Lino Gopez Dizon, one of the pillars of the party, to travel from barrio to barrio to sing PSP-AMT songs that encouraged other peasants to join the movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PSP-AMT was inclined to use traditional song forms for radicalizing the consciousness of peasants. Usually plaintive kundiman and danza served to awaken the unaware to the value of joining a move&shy;ment to fight the unjust tenancy system and to put an end to their <i>darayang kasakitan</i> (bleeding pain). In general, PSP songs showed a great distrust of government. In Lino Gopez Dizon&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1925\"><strong>Pasion ding Talapagobra</strong></a>&rdquo; (Passion of the Peasant Workers) or <i>pulang pasyon </i>(red passion), which was considered the bible of the movement, the government was described as a <i>limatac</i> (a parasite). In the song &ldquo;Balen, Qng Siping Mu Ding Anac Mu&rdquo; (Motherland, Beside You Are Your Children), it was a <i>dambualang tampalasan</i> (an abusive monster); and in the song &ldquo;Masdan Yu ing Palacad ning Gobierno Pilipinas&rdquo; (Ob&shy;serve How the Philippine Government Rules), it was the people&rsquo;s enemy responsible for arbitrary arrests, impris&shy;onments, and deaths of peasant leaders. On the other hand, the rich were portrayed as greedy traitors in the song &ldquo;Mibangun Ca, Anacpawas&rdquo; (Arise, Worker).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PSP-AMT songs contained threats that were more pointed and direct in tone. &ldquo;Masdan Yu ing Palacad Ning Gobierno Pilipinas&rdquo; warned both the rich and the government of an impending revolution should they continue to be abusive. In &ldquo;Ortelanong Talapagobra, Sulung qng Labanan&rdquo; (Peasant Workers, Onward with the Fight), the PSP-AMT members pre&shy;sented themselves as <i>sundalus ning lahi </i>(soldiers of that revolt; literally, soldiers of the race), who fight not for money but for the people&rsquo;s welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the whole, the PSP-AMT songs heightened the awareness of peasants of the inherent power of their class, and called on them to never lose sight of the goal of the struggle&mdash;that is, the establishment of a society ruled by <i>hustisya ning Bathala</i> (justice of God) whose members were not only the people&rsquo;s soldiers but, more significantly, <i>pangapala</i> (blessed). The songs articulated the movement&rsquo;s vision of a society that would replace the unjust and oppressive landlord-tenant system with one where men no longer relate to one another as master and slave but as <i>pamicacapatad</i> (brothers and sisters), where harmony exists because of <i>pamicalulugud</i> (love) and <i>pamidamayan</i> (com&shy;passion for one another), and where everyone can live decently because there is enough for everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>The Anti-Japanese Struggle of the 1940s</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">In 1938 the PSP and the PKP merged. One of the reasons for the merger was to prepare for the possible invasion of the Philippines by Japanese forces. On the eve of the invasion, the merged PKP-PSP came out with a dec&shy;laration, which, among other things, pledged support to the governments of the United States (US) and the Philippines and called for a united front against the Japanese. On 29 Mar 1942, the PKP organized the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon or Hukbalahap, which, after World War II, was converted to the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two of the main problems of the Hukbalahap were recruiting volunteers and organizing support groups in the towns and barrios. In Nueva Ecija, the popular peasant leader Juan Feleo experimented with the use of drama and song to attract people to the movement. He organized the Nueva Ecija Cultural <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a>tic Association, which accompanied troops to villages and performed skits and songs that served to explain the aims of the Hukbalahap and the impor&shy;tance of a united front against the Japanese. The method proved successful, so the Hukbalahap adopted this and formed the Cultural Information Division (CID), com&shy;posed of talented guerrilla fighters and young women who also served as couriers or first-aiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Propaganda became the primary task of the CID. Many of the songs created by CID members explained the goals of the Hukbalahap and depicted the condition of Inang Bayan under fascist rule. The songs were meant to convince people of the necessity of forging a united front against the Japanese and of waging guerrilla warfare. The united-front policy of the Hukbalahap could explain why Huk songs did not manifest any Marxist-Leninist or socialist ideas de&shy;spite the Huk guerilla movement being led by the merged PKP-PSP and instead became highly re&shy;miniscent of the patriotic songs of the 1896 Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CID thus became part of the organizing force of the Hukbalahap. To recruit prospective Huk guerril&shy;las or to establish a Huk base in the towns, a group went to barrios and towns to perform for the townspeople when there was no Japanese presence around. Songs like &ldquo;Hukbalahap ng Bayan&rdquo; (People&rsquo;s Hukbalahap), &ldquo;Pamisan Metung a Panig Mitatag Ya&rdquo; (Let Us Establish the United Front), and &ldquo;Hukbo ng Bayan&rdquo; (People&rsquo;s Army) reminded the people of their tradition of revolutionary courage and fervor and their immediate aim of taking up arms to drive the Japanese forces away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs also served as the Huk guerrilla movement&rsquo;s news bulletin. Issues and orders were explained to guerrillas and townspeople through songs and skits. For example, in the struggle waged by Huk guerrillas to gather the <i>palay</i> (rice) harvest before the Japanese could confiscate it, songs were created by CID members to stress the importance of cooperation and the need for secrecy to ensure the success of the operation, as found in the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a> Struggle&rdquo; sung to the tune of the PKP&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng Rebolusyunaryo&rdquo; (Song of the Revolutionary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs also became the vehicle for launching at&shy;tacks against Filipino leaders who collaborated with the Japanese. The CID parodied the KALIBAPI Hymn &ldquo;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines) in their anti-KALIBAPI version, &ldquo;Tindig Aking Inang Bayan&rdquo; (Stand Up, Mother Country). The song asked the people to join anti-Japanese organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Hukbalahap became then known as a &ldquo;singing army.&rdquo; Huk guerrillas brought to battle not only their rifles and machine guns, but their guitars and <b>bandurria</b> as well. Huk Supremo Luis Taruc testified that in the battlefield, Huks sang martial songs like &ldquo;Sulong Gerilyerong Sandatahan&rdquo; (Onward Armed Guerrillas) or &ldquo;Hukbo ng Bayan&rdquo; (People&rsquo;s Army) to boost the morale of fighters and inspire bravery and courage. Because the Huk guerrilla saw the war in intimate terms, whether the song was set to martial music, borrowed martial tunes from the US Army, or to the native kundiman and danza, whether it was a song to recruit or inspire the guerrilla forces, or lament the tragedies in a guerrilla&rsquo;s life, the language used was always personal and familiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Involvement in guerrilla warfare exacted tremend&shy;ous sacrifice and hardship from the guerrillas. &ldquo;Ing Bie ding Anac Mu, Balen Cung Alipan&rdquo; (The Life of Your Child, My Enslaved Country) and &ldquo;Lakad Lakad, Gerilyero&rdquo; (Walk On, Guerrilla) described how the guerrillas relied on the sap of vines, like the <i>malacatmon</i>, on Mount Arayat in order to survive hunger and thirst; how they pined for their loved ones; and how they consciously disciplined themselves to give up per&shy;sonal wants and needs. All these were borne by the guerril&shy;las because only through struggle and the willingness to sacrifice could the guerrillas wipe away the tears and restore the happiness and wholeness of their Inang Bayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In sum, the Hukbalahap songs played the pivotal role of firing up the patriotic sentiments of the people, serving to record the historical experiences and senti&shy;ments of guerrillas during the war, and mobilizing men, women, and the youth in the fight for freedom from Japanese rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But despite the patriotism of the Huk guerrillas and their show of support to American troops that had returned to liberate the country, the Hukbalahap was not recognized by the American government after World War II. On the contrary, its leaders and members were impris&shy;oned, harassed, or killed. Soon after, former Huk members took to the mountains to continue the fight, this time against the American military and the young Philippine Republic. The Hukbalahap became the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan or HMB in 1949.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imperialism and class struggle resurfaced in the HMB songs. Old PKP songs were revived, the Philip&shy;pine national anthem was rewritten, and new songs were created to address current needs of the move&shy;ment. As they were hunted down as bandits and brigands, the HMB guerrillas reaffirmed themselves as legitimate fighters for freedom as in &ldquo;Gintong Catimauan&rdquo; (Golden Freedom):</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">E que tulisan, e que bandido</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tau caming manintun catuliran</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">E bale ing mate, mibual qng parang</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aquit mi yang sumala gintung catimauan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(We are not traitors, we are not bandits</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">We are men and women seeking justice</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Death matters not nor does falling in the battlefield</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">So long as we witness golden freedom rising.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>The Protest Movements of the 1960s and 1970s</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The arena for protest action shifted radically in the mid-1960s from the countryside to the university campus. The emergence of student activism in the Philippines was a reaction to the worsening political and economic conditions in the country, the reality of American control over most aspects of Philippine life, and international events such as the Vietnam war and the resulting worldwide protest against it. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, student activism drew inspiration from the revolution in China and the radical student movement in countries such as France, Germany, and even the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through organizations like the Kabataang Makabayan and the Samahan ng Demokratikong Kabataan, students were exposed to Marxist-Leninist and Maoist ideology. They were increasingly made aware of the manipulations of American im&shy;perialism over Philippine economic and foreign poli&shy;cies. Issues of feudalism and capitalism were discussed in teach-ins and in small discussion groups or DGs. Like other sectors, artists themselves got more in&shy;volved in social and political issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this context, the importance of the song in orga&shy;nizing, mobilizing, and politicizing the masses was underscored. At the start, activists revived and sometimes rewrote PKP songs popular from the 1930s. As the movement gained steam and its Maoist leanings became more evident, they adopted songs from Mao&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The basic theme of most songs during this period was class struggle, as in &ldquo;Awit ng Pakikibaka&rdquo; (Song of Struggle). Songs such as &ldquo;Ang Masa&rdquo; (The Masses) followed Mao&rsquo;s dictum that the revolutionary struggle must emanate from and be directed toward the masses:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mula sa masa, tungo sa masa</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ito ang ating patnubay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the masses, toward the masses</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is our guiding rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other songs sought to depict the three main issues perceived to be plaguing Philippine society: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism. The three issues were usually treated separately except in &ldquo;Ang Paglaban&rdquo; (The Fight), a song composed for the play <b><i>Barikada</i></b> (Barricade), and the rewritten version of the PKP song &ldquo;Sulong Ka Bayan&rdquo; where imperialism was personi&shy;fied by the <i>tamad na </i>Yankee (lazy Yankee), the bureaucrat capitalist by the<i> tamad na burgis</i> (lazy bourgeois), and feudalism by the <i>asenderong tamad</i> (lazy hacendero). Of the three issues, imperial&shy;ism appeared in the majority of the songs. The <i>imperialistang kano</i> (American imperialist) was identified as the main cause for the oppressed condition of the masses&mdash;the enemy to fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Though most of the songs of the student move&shy;ment were martial in beat, the plaintive kundiman surfaced now and then in rallies where &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; was sung whenever the call to disperse the demonstrators was issued by the Metrocom, and in programs honoring those who died in mass actions through the song &ldquo;Araw na Lubhang Mapanglaw&rdquo; (A Day of Extreme Sadness) and the classic &ldquo;Mendiola&rdquo; written in memory of students who died in the clashes be&shy;tween activists and soldiers during the demonstrations on 26 and 30 Jan 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Protests under Martial Law</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mar&shy;tial law period showed greater experimentation in both form and content, and more flexibility in adapt&shy;ing to various types of melodies and styles, both local and foreign, to express varied experiences. Protest singers translated songs from Latin America to Filipino such as Victor Jara&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Plegaria a un Labrador&rdquo; (A Worker&rsquo;s Prayer), which was translated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4164\"><strong>Jess Santiago</strong></a>; &ldquo;Cuando Voy al Trabajo&rdquo; (Going to Work), translated by Karina Constantino-David; and the internationally renowned Chilean song of Sergio Ortega and Quilapay&uacute;n &ldquo;El Pueblo Unido, Jam&aacute;s Ser&aacute; Vencido&rdquo; (A United People Will Never Be Defeated), translated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5742\"><strong>Maria Luisa Torres-Reyes</strong></a> and which became one of the most sung protest songs during the martial law period. Rock music, which began as a protest medium in the West, was also adopted to express revolutionary aspirations, as in the song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/945\"><strong>Mga Babae</strong></a>&rdquo; (Women) written by an underground songwri&shy;ter, Ka Arting, then popularly known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> ng Hukbo (Florante of the Army).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The break from the typical ideological songs char&shy;acterized by sloganeering, martial beat, and general&shy;ized messages was precipitated by the migration of poets to the music field. In the hands of poets, the revolutionary/protest song was liberated from its formula structure, which moved predictably from state&shy;ment of oppressive condition to affirmation of revolu&shy;tionary optimism and the triumph of the masses. Now, a wider range of experiences was explored and more issues were particularized. Fresher and novel images were employed and language became more lyrical, more concrete, and subtler. Cultural production under martial law became more creative, if not more powerful, largely because of the need for indirection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Created right after the declaration of martial law, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oy Utol, Buto&rsquo;t Balat Ka Na&rsquo;y Natutulog Ka Pa&rdquo; (Hey Brother, You&rsquo;re Nothing but Flesh and Bones, and Yet You Sleep) was a powerful dramatization of the conditions in the early 1970s: the cries of pain and anguish underneath the facade of calm and gaiety, the hunger, the repression, the climate of fear. This was Heber&rsquo;s first composition and perhaps the earliest protest song created during the period, using rock instrumentation as embellishment to an essentially Western folk music (much like Bob Dylan&rsquo;s fusion of rock and folk). The folk-rock form enabled the songwriter to progress from mere observation to chiding: &ldquo;At kung tayo&rsquo;y mananahimik at di kikilos / Ang dapat sa atin ay tawaging / Mga gago!&rdquo; (And if we remain silent and refuse to act / What we deserve is to be called / Morons!). Heber also tackled the graver issue of the presence of the US military bases in the Philippines in his song &ldquo;Awit Ko&rdquo; (My Song), a rock piece that expressed anguish and frustration over the Filipino&rsquo;s impotence to act. In contrast to Heber&rsquo;s Beatle-influenced instrumentation and his leanings to rock music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a> Montano adapted Chuck Berry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Johnny B. Goode&rdquo; to satirize the country&rsquo;s system of education that blunted rather than sharpened the minds of students in his &ldquo;Bobo ng Diliman&rdquo; (The Moron of Diliman). The Nuklus Band, in their song &ldquo;Dambuhala sa Morong&rdquo; (The Monster in Morong) used the power of rock to express rage against the Marcos government&rsquo;s building of a nuclear plant in Morong, Bataan. Poet-songwriter Jess Santiago drew from the tradition of the Western folk song, an ex&shy;tremely popular protest medium in America in the 1960s. Santiago&rsquo;s songs, most of them in ballad style, were eloquent testimonies of the kinds of oppression suffered by the people. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a> suc&shy;cessfully fused rock and traditional <i>lumad</i> or native instrumentation in the early 1980s to produce a distinc&shy;tive music that captured the rhythm and soul of Minda&shy;nao in order to articulate the ugly realities of Minda&shy;nao life, such as vanishing rainforests, bombing of markets, and hamletting of whole communities, as well as to celebrate its everyday scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the countryside, revolutionary songs had a more practical and creative application. Out of the reach of the music industry and the print media, places like Samar made full use of the song as a historical document to record military atrocities and encounters. Waray traditional folk forms were revived and revitalized to become vehicles of revolutionary ex&shy;pression. The <b>ismayling</b>, a traditional song-debate between a man and a woman on varied topics, like court&shy;ship, farming, and other tropical issues, was used to ex&shy;plain party issues or deepen the people&rsquo;s understanding of national issues from the party&rsquo;s point of view. The song form was also employed by the New People&rsquo;s Army (NPA) as a news bulletin to facilitate the transmission of news that would otherwise take three weeks to disseminate. Set to a simple folk melody, the news was learned by heart and dissemi&shy;nated to the people much faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the peoples of Kalinga, Abra, and Bontoc, song forms like the <b>salidummay</b>,<i> </i><b>donglala</b>,<i> </i><b>oynasi</b>,<i> </i><b>balasibasem</b>, and <b>idi mid</b> were recast in verbal joust form to narrate significant events in the strug&shy;gle of the Cordillera people against the Chico Dam project and the militarization of the area, discuss issues affecting the people, and situate the tribal problems in the context of the Cordil&shy;lera struggle as a whole. In recent years, some of these songs have been recorded and performed by the song group Salidummay. In Iloilo and Cebu, extemporaneous ballads like the <b>composo</b> were utilized to explain the NPA&rsquo;s role in the revolution, discuss the latest Philippine Constabulary and NPA encounter, or expose the anomalies of the Marcos government. These songs were rich in folk humor, as in the long but never boring song &ldquo;Ali Macoy,&rdquo; which bared the prob&shy;lems under Marcos&rsquo;s New Society, capping each section with the line &ldquo;Ali Macoy, ali Macoy / Atong dugmukon ang itlog ni Macoy (Ali Macoy, Ali Macoy / We will crush the balls of Macoy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Political detention centers contributed their share of freedom songs. &ldquo;Mutya&rdquo; (Muse), adapted from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\"><strong>Bonifacio Abdon</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kundiman,&rdquo; was an offering of love and life to the beloved country and a pledge to remain free even behind the high walls and barbed wires of Bicutan. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1918\"><strong>Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa</strong></a>&rdquo; (Love of One&rsquo;s Native Land), a poem by the revolution&shy;ary hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>, was set to kundiman music in 1979 by Salvador Luis Jorque and became one of the most popular patriotic songs of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The assassination of Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr on 21 Aug 1983 marked the turning point or the dec&shy;line of the Marcos dictatorship. Various sectors and classes of Philippine society became one in their outpouring of grief and indignation. Together with the martyr&rsquo;s widow, Corazon C. Aquino, they gathered in Liwasang Bonifacio and affirmed the &ldquo;Panata sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan&rdquo;<i> </i>(Pledge of Freedom), penned by the nationalist Jose W. Diokno and translated to Filipino by Jose Lacaba, &ldquo;to intensify action and determination / Until we gain freedom, democracy and sovereignty.&rdquo; The pledge was later set to music by Lutgardo Labad and performed by the group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4116\"><strong>Patatag</strong></a><i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As protest action escalated, songs were spontaneously created to satirize the ex&shy;cesses and repressive policies of the dictatorship, as seen in both <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4016\"><strong>Inang Laya</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Binagoongang Lipunan&rdquo; (Society of Fermented Fish), a pun on Marcos&rsquo;s Bagong Lipunan (New Society), and &ldquo;Turismo&rdquo; (Tourism), and to decry the indignities and low pay suffered by public school teachers, as in Jane Po&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1517\"><strong>Titser</strong></a>&rdquo; (Teacher). Protest singers like Heber Bartolome, Jess Santiago, Susan Fernandez, Joey Ayala, Paul Galang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4002\"><strong>Gary Granada</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3922\"><strong>Noel Cabangon</strong></a>, Inang Laya, and Patatag braved tear gas, water cannons, and arrest to perform in protest marches, such as the weeklong march from Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog to Manila called &ldquo;Lakbayan,&rdquo; in rallies and demonstra&shy;tions, <i>pulong bayan</i> (town meetings), and open forums held in towns and cities all over the country. Pinoy folk and pop singers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a>, Coritha, the groups <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a> also joined in the mounting protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/791\"><strong>Protest Songs</strong></a> after the Dictatorship</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The toppling of the Marcos dictatorship through four days of peaceful EDSA Revolt from 22 to 25 Feb 1986 was celebrated in song.

Cassette<span style=\"letter-spacing:1.3pt\"> tapes and later </span>CD albums of<span style=\"letter-spacing:1.3pt\"> Asin, </span>Patatag<span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">, Salidummay, </span>Inang Laya, Susan Fernandez, Jess Santiago,<span style=\"letter-spacing:.9pt\"> Paul Galang, </span>Gary Granada, Noel Cabangun, and other protest singers became available to the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The entry of protest singers into the pop music industry enriched and invigorated Pinoy pop and rock music. Joey Ayala formed a new group, Bagong Lumad (New Indigenous People), and created songs that carried social and environment themes. Bayang Barrios would later leave the group to distinguish herself in creating a unique and beautiful blending of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> chanting and rhythm with pop/rock music to tackle social issues. Dong Abay, a member of Patatag, formed the popular band Yano to give expression to the anti-establishment sentiment of the youth in the 1990s in &ldquo;Banal na Aso, Santong Kabayo&rdquo; (Holy Dog, Saintly Horse); to reminisce the bravery of the poor during the extraordinary days of People Power but whose lives have not improved in &ldquo;Kumusta Ka Na?&rdquo; (How Have You Been?); and to pay homage to the lowly flip-flops&mdash;symbolic of the poor&mdash;that have witnessed political repression in &ldquo;Tsinelas&rdquo; (Flip-Flops). Meanwhile, youth groups emerged with refreshing new ways of tackling social issues, determined not to sound too grim in order not to alienate their young audience. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, Paroky<span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">a</span> ni Edgar, Color It Red, River Maya, the reggae band Brown Man&rsquo;s Revival, and others were extremely popular during the whole decade of the 1990s and produced an extraordinary wealth of songs that served as social commentaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Decades may separate today&rsquo;s rock bands from those who dared to fuse Pinoy<i> </i>lyrics with Western-influenced sounds, but there is today an appreciation for the legacy of protest music as seen in the new productions by young rock bands like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4184\"><strong>Sugarfree</strong></a>, Dicta License, Radioactive Sago, Jr. Kilat, and Missing Filemon who write lyrics not only in Filipino but in other Philippine languages like Cebuano to express contemporary issues in punk, hip-hop, rap, revitalized reggae, and other forms. There have been other developments that keep alive independent and protest music production outside mainstream<span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\"> music </span>industry and Metro Manila. The astounding speed with which computer technology is advancing now makes available to lyricists, music composers, and performers new devices to produce and new platforms to disseminate their own creations, wage people&rsquo;s campaigns, and launch protest. At the height of the impeachment trial of President Joseph &ldquo;Erap&rdquo; Estrada in Dec 2000, for instance, the anonymous &ldquo;White Album&rdquo; that surfaced during the protest rallies encouraged people to copy the CD of anti-Erap songs. When the &ldquo;Hello Garci&rdquo; political scandal erupted in mid-2005, anti-GMA ringtones and songs were also disseminated widely via CDs and uploaded to the Internet. YouTube, too, has since become a popular site for protest. But as popular protest gives rise to new groups, new forms, and new articulations, the one song that has been the constant protest anthem is still the plaintive kundiman &ldquo;Bayan Ko.&rdquo; <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5335\"><strong>Teresita Gimenez-Maceda</strong></a></em></strong> <br />\r\n<v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251681792\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

The dance was said to have been first introduced in the court of Louis XIII by Rigaud, a dance master from Marseille after whom the dance originally called <i>rigaudon</i>, was named. The <b>quadrille</b> later spread to the other courts of Europe. It was introduced in the Philippines in the 19th century and became an important feature of Malaca&ntilde;an balls in the late Spanish period and during the pre-World War II era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>rigodon de honor</b> was performed in Malaca&ntilde;an during the term of American Governor-General <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Howard Taft to win local sympathy for the colonial government. It was a dance that emphasized a person&rsquo;s prestige and status, as it was done with much fanfare, with each participating couple announced as they promenaded and danced around the ballroom, to be admired by all the guests. Participants belonged exclusively to high society&mdash;representatives from the cabinet, legislature, uniformed services, local government, and cultural sector; the diplomatic corps; and well-known personalities&mdash;who took the occasion to display their most fashionable formal wear. The rigodon became the highlight of official Malaca&ntilde;an revelries from the Quezon administration to the time of Marcos. But its popularity declined after. The last rigodon de honor held in the palace in the 20th century was on the third inauguration of Ferdinand Marcos in 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jun 2008, at the 110th anniversary of Philippine independence, the traditional rigodon de honor at the ceremonial hall of Malaca&ntilde;an was revived, and it has since then been held regularly. Aside from Malaca&ntilde;an, there have been establishments that cater to the Philippine elite such as Club Bulaque&ntilde;o and Club Filipino, Kahirup and Mancomunidad Pampangue&ntilde;a, and diasporic Filipino communities such as the Rotary Club of Toronto in Canada, the Circulo Kapampangan of Houston, Texas, and the Filipino-Australian Seniors in Sydney, Australia, which also promote the dancing of the Filipino-Spanish quadrille.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music that accompanies the dance is made up of separate sections corresponding to the different figures of the dance: <i>zeta</i> (figure Z), <i>casamiento</i> (marriage), <i>hatid</i> or <i>visita </i>(escort or visit), <i>cambio pareja</i> (change partners), <i>cadena</i> (chain), and <i>cadenilla</i> (small chain). The rhythm for each of the figures may be in simple 2/4 time or, occasionally, in compound 6/8 time. There are many versions, too, of the dance, but it always opens with the <i>anuncio </i>(announcement) and ends with the <i>saludo</i> (bow).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music of each section is usually in two parts, each made up of double periods of 16 measures each. The number of times each part is repeated varies depending on the space available and on the number of couples dancing.

Through the latter&rsquo;s influence in the ensuing decades, Pinoy rock evolved and continues to evolve into many local varieties. Reaching the Philippines via radio, television, and film and the sale of recordings and electronic instruments in the 1950s, rock and roll spread to middle-class Filipino teenagers who formed bands called combos, which made use of amplified electronic instruments, notably guitar and drum sets. A string of imported hits by The Atlantics, Duane Eddy, and, most of all, The Ventures, became templates for Manila&rsquo;s teenage bands. Amplified noise, distorted sound, and the projection of masculinity were some of rock&rsquo;s most distinctive characteristics. Rock and roll was mainly consumed by youth cultures that found in the music an outlet for their voices and social experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first eminent local group practicing the genre was RJ &amp; The Riots, led by then 15-year-old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\"><strong>Ramon Jacinto</strong></a> (lead guitar and vocals) with young colleagues Jimmy Colayco (rhythm guitar), Alan Austria (bass guitar), and Bernie Evangelista (drums). They appeared for the first time in the high school Christmas party of Ateneo de Manila University in Dec 1960, riding on the popularity of instrumental rock and roll, called surf music among Manila&rsquo;s student audiences. Surf was a predominantly guitar-oriented style invented by an American soloist named Dick Dale, who combined rock and roll beats with Mexican and Middle Eastern overtones.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Within two years, the enterprising Ramon Jacinto released a number of his own trendy recordings using an Ampex<i> </i>300-3 multitrack tape recorder, which was the nucleus of the RJ Sound Studio that he had set up at home, and launched Rajah Records, a record label he had registered. Furthering his initiatives, he assembled his own radio station, DZRJ-AM, manned by a volunteer group of classmates. Popular American vinyl records were imported and broadcast by DZRJ to satisfy a growing demand for the latest international hits. In 1962, The Ventures arrived in the Philippines to perform at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a>, but appeared only as a duo. The Ventures&rsquo; principal members, the guitarists Don Wilson and Bob Bogle, called on the Riots&rsquo; drummer Bernie Evangelista and bassist Alan Austria to complete their ensemble. It was clearly a triumph for The Riots, and especially Ramon Jacinto, whose instrumental singles, such as &ldquo;Weightless,&rdquo; &ldquo;Teenstone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advertising Man,&rdquo; had by then earned a cachet among rock aficionados as Manila&rsquo;s premier representatives of surf music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Riots released a considerable number of vinyl records in the 45-rpm single format as well as in the long-playing 33-rpm album format. Other musical groups flourished in the surf music bandwagon, particularly The Technicolors from the high school grades of the American School, later renamed International School. Led by the young teenage guitarist Eddie Villanueva, an agile and dexterous instrumentalist, the Technicolors released their own original instrumentals in 1963 under the independent Pioneer Records imprint. Their string of hits, particularly &ldquo;Sombrero,&rdquo; &ldquo;A-Line,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Los Arcos,&rdquo; were imitative of The Shadows, a British group that distinguished itself among the slew of American surf era artists, and who also backed up the English pop star Cliff Richard. The Technicolors included among its members drummer Tony Tuviera (who would gain prominence as a television producer decades after) and rhythm guitarist Paul Pascal, who would resurface a decade after as an influential rock composer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other local instrumental combos prospered in this milieu such as The Electromanics, led by two mainstays: young guitarist-tunesmith Ernie Delgado and drummer Lito Toribio. Effectively eschewing the Riots&rsquo; upscale direction, the Electromaniacs sounded increasingly less Westernized and more Asian as they cultivated a mass audience. They exploited a network of coin-operated jukebox machines to distribute hits to the farthest Philippine provinces. Dyna Records, an independent label founded in 1959 by James Dy, a Filipino-Chinese businessman, cultivated the Electromanics&rsquo; 45-rpm singles such as &ldquo;Oh I Miss You So&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lover&rsquo;s Guitar.&rdquo; Spurred by their manager, the screen actor Jose Mari Gonzales, The Electromaniacs doubled their exposure in a series of musical films in vogue, emulating the Hollywood sorties of Elvis Presley, the mid-1950s rock and roll phenomenon. The movie appearances of Jose Mari and The Electromaniacs were billed in competition with actor-singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4546\"><strong>Eddie Mesa</strong></a>, dubbed the &ldquo;Elvis Presley of the Philippines,&rdquo; and his backup band, The Hi-Jacks. The Hi-Jacks was led by a tandem: Nonoy Jereza (rhythm guitar) and Dado Amores (drums), with the dexterous lead guitarist Ben Tesoro. The Hi-Jacks&rsquo; records, which predominantly featured versions of popular international hits, were also released by a fledgling Dyna Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The largest Philippine record company of the time was the Mabuhay Recording <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (Mareco), which issued their products under two record labels&mdash;namely, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a> and Mabuhay Records. Its owner was Manuel P. Villar, who later was described as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Recording.&rdquo; In the 1950s, Villar released a novelty song titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1025\"><strong>Waray-Waray</strong></a>&rdquo; (a person from Samar or Leyte) that inadvertently became a Filipino rock and roll milestone. Set in a familiar blues progression (I-IV-V), the song&rsquo;s theatrical irony of using Tagalog lyrics while extolling the qualities of the Waray regional folk had a comedic spin. Interestingly, the recording artist was the actress Sylvia La Torre, a classically trained vocalist dubbed the &ldquo;Queen of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>.&rdquo; The entertainment value of &ldquo;Waray-Waray&rdquo; was unparalleled in its time. The ditty was a singular exception to Mareco&rsquo;s traditional recordings of <b>kundiman</b>, <b>balitaw</b>, and other Filipiniana materials. The success of the novelty experiment led Villar Records to release &ldquo;Hahabol-Habol&rdquo; (Chasing After), a Tagalog song with a boogie-woogie rhythm that satirized an apparently indecisive damsel, as a follow-up. The featured recording artist was the stage singer and actor Bobby Gonzales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1963, the newly established Mareco Broadcasting Network debuted its first radio station, DZBM-AM, putting the businessman Villar on a path that allowed him to dominate the Philippine recording industry by amassing franchises of major American labels, such as Columbia, RCA, Warner, Elektra, Atlantic, and Mercury. But ironically, surf music&rsquo;s commercial expectations came to a standstill. The super nova effect of an English rock and roll group called The Beatles had overturned a popular yet unprepared music establishment. In Apr 1964 alone, the &ldquo;Fab Foursome&rdquo; simultaneously occupied numbers 1-5 in the Billboard Hot <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> Trade Chart, a historical feat no act has achieved since. The torrent of the mythical &ldquo;British Invasion&rdquo; led by the Beatles and followed by similarly odd-named groups, such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Kinks, changed prevailing norms of entertainment, fashion, and lifestyles. The spectacular rise to fame and glamour of working-class English musicians demonstrated a new kind of power&mdash;that of an entertainment form called rock and roll as a formidable social equalizer. The Swinging Sixties then became especially propitious to Dyna Records, the small and independent startup located on Raon Street, Manila, because its exclusive UK-based record franchises, particularly EMI and Parlophone Records, enjoyed an astonishing windfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Domestic reaction to the turn of events was swift and inclusive. Neighborhood combos flourished throughout Manila outside the schools. The British heroes&rsquo; fans imitated their songs and outfits. The emerging Marikina shoe industry heeded a surging demand for &ldquo;Beatle boots.&rdquo; So lucrative was the market that a combo called The Glenmores rose to promote Glenmore Shoes, whose proprietors were the band&rsquo;s managers. The popular Glenmores featured a husky vocalist and keyboardist named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\"><strong>Mike Hanopol</strong></a>, who would later on play a major role in the unfolding story of Philippine combos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most prominent of the new combos were D&rsquo;Downbeats composed of Tony Jalandoni (lead guitar), Charlie Mielieb (rhythm guitar), Eddie Reyes (organ), Tonet Fabie (bass guitar), and Filipino-American Joey Smith (drums and vocals). They were hired as a front act for the two Beatles concerts at the Rizal Memorial Stadium on 4 Jul 1966. But the resounding success of the sold-out concert quickly took a bad turn. The Beatles&rsquo; cold response to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos&rsquo;s invitations for them to come to Malaca&ntilde;an Palace earned them the Marcoses&rsquo; ire. The Manila International Airport&rsquo;s departure area then became the scene for much regret on both sides, prefiguring the checkered futures of both the Beatles and the Marcos regime. The one redeeming aspect of the whole controversy was the emergence of a rock stalwart named Joey Smith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oblivious to the disappointing Beatles episode, Philippine television immersed itself in rock and roll shows through the mid-1960s. Televised dance contests took a sharp detour toward rock and roll, particularly <b><i>The Nite Owl (Dance Party)</i></b>, 1961-63, on Channel 11 hosted by the Manila Broadcasting Company radioman Lito Gorospe. The show&rsquo;s resident Wonderers combo, later renamed The Celtics, mimicked the day&rsquo;s radio hits for a crew of after-office dancers, but the show was poorly received and waned quickly. As Mod, hippie, and flower power paradigms of beauty swept through Philippine households, so did the preferences of its impressionable youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Acumen and creativity flourished in this era, with 45-rpm singles serving as launching pads for the new emerging captains of the Philippine recording industry. The Ramrods, consisting of Orly Ilacad (lead guitar), Manuel Galvez (rhythm guitar), Virgilio Bertol (bass), and Tony Tuviera (drums), with the line supervision of Ilacad&rsquo;s cousin Vic del Rosario, released singles under various imprints, such as ANS Records (&ldquo;Do The Soul&rdquo;), Mustang Records (&ldquo;Venus&rdquo;), and Pioneer (&ldquo;Bionic Cha-Cha&rdquo;). Their efforts were limited but outcomes would be far-ranging in later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Newly introduced American TV syndications&mdash;namely, <b><i>Shindig!</i></b> in 1964-66 and <b><i>Hullabaloo</i> </b>in 1965-66&mdash;were drawing exceptional worldwide viewership. Emulating this, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> Channel 9&rsquo;s new television variety show <b><i>Nineteeners</i></b>, hosted by actor Ed Finlan and a young prodigious songwriter, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>, featured &ldquo;cage dancers&rdquo; and cameos enacted by sons and daughters of rich families. A cavalcade of bands took prime time, and the Jungle Cats featuring Nilo Santos (vocals), Danny Bornilla (keyboards), Nides Aranza-Mendez (drums), Tony Aranza-Mendez (bass), and a young lead guitarist named Wally Gonzalez topbilled the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1967, Wally Gonzalez and Mike Hanopol (now turned bassist) had joined Joey Smith&rsquo;s newly reconstituted Downbeats, by then regarded as Manila&rsquo;s top rock and roll band. After a contract show in Guam starring Bobby Gonzales and the singer-actress Vilma Valera, the duo of Gonzalez and Smith proceeded to Japan to scout for further engagements and to look up Filipino drummer Eddie Fortuno (who later renamed himself &ldquo;Edmund Fortuno&rdquo;) who was part of the D&rsquo;Swooners, a Filipino soul music band making waves in the Japanese psychedelic music scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rock historian Julian Cope (2007) narrates that D&rsquo;Swooners was formed in 1963 and by 1965, it headed for Hong Kong, landing a record contract with the Diamond Records label. Cris Solano (vocals, bass), Charlie Cajilig (guitar), Ernie Espiritu (organ), Ronnie Parina (trumpet), and Eddie Fortuno (drums) released a weepy 1950s-style ballad &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\"><strong>Sonata</strong></a> of Love&rdquo; composed by Cris Solano that brought them offers to do front acts for shows by visiting rock stars such as Manfred Mann. Attending Mann&rsquo;s show in Hong Kong was the Japanese singer-actor Yuzo Kayama, who arranged for the group to appear on Japanese TV. In 1967, the meek Japanese audiences in Tokyo were captivated by D&rsquo;Swooners&rsquo; wild performances. The band was immediately signed up with the Phillips label of Japan, whereupon they released two albums in 1969 before disbanding. Thereupon, Edmund Fortuno returned to Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a similar development, after an impressive jam session in Tokyo&rsquo;s Shinjuku district, Wally Gonzalez and Joey Smith were hired to form a cover band for the Japanese entertainment circuit, which they called Zero History. Their erstwhile Downbeats colleague Mike Hanopol was summoned from Manila to sing and play keyboards, along with a bassist singly named Rino. In early 1970, a performance by Zero History in a Yokohama shopping center caught the attention of Shinki Chen, a known guitarist with strong connections to Ikuzo Orita, the president of Polydor Records of Japan. As a platform for Shinki Chen&rsquo;s thriving career, a &ldquo;power trio&rdquo; named Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki with Joey Smith (drums and vocals) and Masayohi Kabe (bass) was formulated by Ikuzo Orita in 1971, who by then had transferred to Atlantic Records. The trio released an album titled <b><i>Eve</i></b>. In 1972, after contractual complications, a second Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki album was assembled by Joey Smith for Atlantic Records, assisted by his Zero History colleague Mike Hanopol, in the wake of Chen and Kabe&rsquo;s departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, martial law was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos on 21 Sep 1972. Midnight curfews were imposed and public gatherings were curtailed, turning Greater Manila into an insular culture. Ramon Jacinto fled, narrowly escaping Presidential Decree 1081, and soon his government-sequestered DZRJ was being helmed by an officer in charge from the Philippine Army. Due to the turn of events, a term called <b>Pinoy rock</b> was invented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dodie Gonzalez, the enterprising elder brother of Wally Gonzalez, the musician, had produced an album titled <b><i>Up in Arms</i></b> for a group named the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Juan de la Cruz Band</strong></a> (JDLC). The band was organized by Wally together with the drummer Edmund Fortuno, both of whom had returned in late 1970 from their respective Japanese stints. JDLC figured prominently as the rhythm section of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a> conducted by Redentor Romero in the 1971 production of <b><i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i></b>, the rock opera at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. But an early breakup ensued before their album could be recorded. Fortuno led an exodus of Juan de la Cruz Band members who regrouped as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> Bayan. This event seemed to convince Wally Gonzalez to start all over. But the elder Gonzales intervened. With blocked prime airtime bought from DZRJ, the album tracks of a new Juan de la Cruz Band were broadcast before an impressionable youth market. Their seminal long-playing album <b><i>Up in Arms</i></b>, 1971, was released by Sunshine Records, a subsidiary label of a larger independent record company, Vicor Records, owned by the cousins Vic del Rosario and Orly Ilacad of the 1960s combo The Ramrods. Not before long, in 1973, Sunshine Records issued Gonzales&rsquo;s second JDLCB album, the historic <b><i>Himig Natin </i></b>(Our Music), a bold set of collaborative rock compositions by his touring partners Hanopol and Smith. The trio had reached the critical mass and the Juan de la Cruz Band became a household name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rival DZBM station of Mareco was quick to mine the rising commercial trend, airing hit singles dominated by their flagship franchise, Motown Records, and marginally attended by album tracks from their vast catalog of foreign licenses. Perhaps because of their diverse library of hits in all genres, DZBM&rsquo;s impact on Philippine rock music would have been peripheral at best, if not for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a> band. Signed and affiliated to Villar Records, the siblings Rene Garcia (guitar and vocals), Dennis Garcia (bass), and Jess Garcia (drums) led the group that included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4015\"><strong>Lorrie Ilustre</strong></a> (keyboards) and a medley of female singers, such as Ella del Rosario, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a>, and Maso Diez, who would all become entertainment luminaries. The Hotdog was a subdued version of an earlier Garcia family undertaking, a cover band named Red Fox. They crafted a succession of novelty songs starting with &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You Are the Miss Universe of My Life) and &ldquo;Manila,&rdquo; initially described as rock ballads. But with each successive release by the band, such as &ldquo;Bongga Ka Day&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Fabulous, Girl), the group veered farther and farther away from their rock influences and became proponents of a pop genre aptly named <b>Manila Sound</b>&mdash;after their song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward 1974, DZRJ&rsquo;s daily primetime slot of songs featuring the Juan de la Cruz Band was reinvented as a diversified Pinoy Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Rhythm show. As proposed by the station&rsquo;s disc jockeys Allan Austria (aka Double A) and Emil Quinto (aka Charlie Brown) to their government-led management, the program would feature recordings by Philippine rock musicians from all sectors, including compatible genres such as blues and folk music. A mobile recording studio was set up by Austria, using the station&rsquo;s four-track tape recorder and mixing board, for live-in-the-booth recordings to facilitate the entries of contestants for one of its sponsors, RC Cola, and its First National Battle of the Bands, produced by RC Cola&rsquo;s then CEO, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3787\"><strong>Cesare Syjuco</strong></a>. More than 200 new songs were said to have been recorded for the Pinoy Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Rhythm show, and these entries were aired in succession through many weeks. These &ldquo;demos&rdquo; paved the way for artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>, Bong Gabriel, Johnny Alegre of Hourglass, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3883\"><strong>Bob Aves</strong></a> of Destiny, and many others, who thrived in the mainstream Philippine record industry in later years. It did not take long for <b><i>Pinoy Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Rhythm</i></b>,<i> </i>the show&rsquo;s title, to be shortened to <b><i>Pinoy Rock</i></b>, the term that would also be used to describe the Philippines&rsquo; expansive reinvention of Western rock and roll. The program would be hosted by Sonny Pecson (aka Little Rock), Bob <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1268\"><strong>Posas</strong></a> (aka Bob Magoo), and Dante David (aka Howlin&rsquo; Dave), all of whom would carry on until the mid-1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1977, Nilo Santos, formerly with the Jungle Cats, embarked on a promotional campaign for his spouse, the rock vocalist Tessie Alfonso, who had assumed the stage persona &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>.&rdquo; She had been collaborating on original songs with the Olongapo-based guitarist Gary Perez. This culminated in a self-titled album released by Vicor Records. Her carrier single titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/873\"><strong>Bonggahan</strong></a>&rdquo; (Revelry) reaffirmed a local penchant for novelty, with its deliberately gay Tagalog jargon exhorting the audience to &ldquo;all have a good time.&rdquo; Santos also crafted an image for Pinoy rock as an entertaining yet probative medium of expression. By then he had also assumed the management of Mike Hanopol&rsquo;s solo career, whose new material struck a similar chord with the listening public. Hanopol&rsquo;s prodigious album releases&mdash;namely, <b><i>Buhay Musikero </i></b>(A Musician&rsquo;s Life), 1976, by Jem Records, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>ing Pilipino</i></b> (Filipino Songs), 1977, and <b><i>Buksan</i></b><i> </i>(Open),<i> </i>1978, by Blackgold Records&mdash;were defining moments for Pinoy rock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">MARECO by this time had recorded but only released two singles, &ldquo;Jeepney Rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Probinsiyana&rdquo; (Country Girl), from Edmund Fortuno&rsquo;s JDLCB splinter group. In 1977, finally, under Villar&rsquo;s A&amp;W Records subsidiary, the complete Anak Bayan album saw the light of day, becoming one of Pinoy Rock&rsquo;s resounding successes. In 1978, the first album of the much-admired Olongapo-based band Maria Cafra, led by the brothers Resty Fabunan (guitar) and Jun Fabunan (bass), was released by Jem Records. That same year, the first Wally Gonzalez solo album, <b><i>Wally on the Road</i></b>, was released by Vicor Music Corporation. By then, though, the country&rsquo;s commercial music industry had rebounded from the onslaught of bands and took a new turn for what became known as the Original Pilipino Music (OPM) genre. In a much simpler time, the classic rock era, was drawing to a close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the heyday of popular music festivals and when balladeers were in vogue in the late 1970s, folk music artists straddled the fine line between pop music and rock music. Singer-songwriter soloists like Florante, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\"><strong>Freddie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a> (and later, his sister Cynthia Alexander), and Emil Sanglay and groups like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a> prospered in Manila&rsquo;s rock venues but retained their entertainment sheen. But the underground music scene faced the opposite way, returning to basics in the early 1980s, as a younger generation of aspiring musicians learned to play guitar from <b><i>Jingle</i></b> magazine and borderline music publications that reproduced lyrics without copyright permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A boom in <b>punk music</b> was underway. Punk was a rudimentary and hard-edged reaction to the excesses of classic 1970s rock. At the turn of the decade, foreign bands like the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and The Ramones caused punk rock to spread worldwide. By 1985, a record imprint named DMZ Records was created by the couple Leslie David and <b><i>Jingle</i></b> magazine editor Ces Rodriguez. The first album DMZ released was by Betrayed, and it was issued on cassette tape format, featuring two lineups of the band on both sides. Betrayed was Manila&rsquo;s seminal punk band consisting of Eddie Siojo (vocals), Buddy Trinidad (guitar), Chris Carire (bass), and Carl Avecilla (drums). In its second edition, Buddy Trinidad continued with Boyet Miguel (bass), Manny Pagsuyuin (drums), and Dominic Gamboa (vocals). Due to the demand for the cassette&rsquo;s first edition, it was reissued by Twisted Cross Records, another cassette-based imprint owned by the alternative rock entrepreneur Tommy Tanchanco, whose <b><i>Brave New World</i></b> events also highlighted bands, such as The Wuds, Urban Bandits, and the <b>new wave band </b>Identity Crisis. The cultural influence of the events Tanchanco organized led to the emergence of alternative rock stations such as DWXB-102.7, LA-105, and even NU-107.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1985, the second major wave of Pinoy rock was underway. Two friends, guitarist Teddy Diaz and drummer JB Leonor, had formed a band called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a> with bass guitarist Clay Luna, and later, vocalist Jett Pangan. The quartet performed in clubs and recorded a demo titled &ldquo;Enveloped Ideas,&rdquo; a copy of which they submitted to a now-defunct radio station, DWXB-102.7. When the group topped the radio station&rsquo;s playlist in 1986, the group&rsquo;s loyal following brought them to the attention of Ricky Ilacad of Octo-Arts Records. By that time, their bassist Clay Luna had migrated to the United States and had been replaced by Carlos Balcells. Before disbanding, their recording career with Octo-Arts had spanned eight albums from 1986 to 1995. It included the contributions from later guitarists Atsushi Matsura and Francis Reyes, who took the place of Teddy Diaz after two albums, after his tragic death in 1988. The band&rsquo;s reunion in 2000 yielded five additional albums for Sony Music Entertainment, making The Dawn the most prolific rock band in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contrast, The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, a band formed by University of the Philippines students Ely Buendia (guitar and vocals), Marcus Adoro (guitar), Buddy Zabala (bass), and Raimund Marasigan (drums), was rejected at every turn until BMG Records Pilipinas agreed to sign them up and released their first album <b><i>Ultraelectromagneticpop!</i></b> in 1993. The album featured a carrier single in the proven novelty vein of rock and roll titled &ldquo;Pare Ko&rdquo; (My Dude), a composition with Tagalog lyrics peppered with invectives that talked about the travails of unrequited love. In its maiden release, 300,000 copies were sold. Emerging from the Club Dredd movement instigated by the entrepreneur Patrick Reidenbach, the Eraserheads was at the forefront of a host of alternative rock groups that included Color It Red, Hungry Young Poets, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a>, Afterimage, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\"><strong>Wolfgang</strong></a>, Razorback, and many other bands that would soon gain prominence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The quartet continues to perform until the present day through a jigsaw puzzle band career that spans seven studio albums, three extended play (mini-album) releases, and four anthologies, with sales nothing short of spectacular. Their second album, <b><i>Circus</i></b>,<i> </i>1994, sold 200,000 copies; and the third album, <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>,<i> </i>1995, sold 400,000 copies. The four members are proponents of their own bands as well, with Buendia leading two groups, Pupil and The Oktaves; Adoro leading Markus Highway; Zabala joining The Dawn; and Marasigan leading an unspecified number of bands and projects, including Sandwich, Pedicab, and Squid9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To make passing mention of groups and artists from the 1990s until the present would be an oversimplification because of the sheer number of bands that proliferated during this period. Bands such as Yano, The Youth, Sugar Hiccup, and Teeth set the stage for much that the Eraserheads would accomplish. The rap-metal subgenre, colloquially termed the<b> Kupaw Movement</b>, fronted in the 1999-2003 period by bands such as Greyhoundz, Slapshock, Cheese (later renamed Queso), and Skychurch, sparked much excitement in 2000-2010, with Slapshock alone selling between 20,000 and 30,000 compact discs a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A corporate rock band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a>, originally assembled by the rock impresario Lizza Nakpil, had its revolving door of musicians that included Rico Blanco and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Ma&ntilde;alac. It exemplified how the concept of rock music could serve the commercial demands of OPM. Independent record labels in the new millennium, such as Terno Recordings, created a large niche of their own, featuring innovative bands like Orange &amp; Lemons, and Up Dharma Down, whose album <b><i>Fragmented</i></b> caught the attention of <b><i>Time </i></b>magazine in 2006. Presently, the extremely wide variety of subgenres and styles developing in Pinoy rock, some even effectively merging with OPM, would require much further analysis.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Juan Bautista H.

Accompaniment is secondary to the solo part, unlike in a chamber sonata for violin and piano, in which both instruments play principal parts. Like most music literature written from the end of the 17th century onward, solo works may be broadly classified into tonal (i.e., with melodies and harmonies constructed in relation to a tonal center) or atonal (i.e., with melodies and harmonies constructed with an obscure or nonexistent tonal center). Solo works may be cast in simple form or as self-contained pieces with two-part (binary) and three-part (ternary) structure; in compound form or as a series of simple pieces or movements as in sonatas, suites, or concertos or concerti; or in other 20th-century innovative forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine instrumental pieces that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were written by versatile and homegrown musicians trained in singing, playing of instruments, and composition in convents and institutions, such as the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> during the Spanish regime.

Together with Conservatory of Madrid-trained <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a> and second-generation musicians like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4076\"><strong>Manuel Antonio Mata</strong></a> (son of Natalio), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4173\"><strong>Rosalio Silos</strong></a> (son of Antonio), and the self-taught musician-revolutionary <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4093\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4095\"><strong>Julio Nakpil</strong></a></strong></a>, they yielded a combined output that included piano arrangements of Philippine folk songs, piano transcriptions of European orchestral works, as well as original pieces for piano, cello, or guitar in two- or three-part forms, such as <b>gavotte</b>,<b> mazurka</b>, <b>paso doble</b>, <b>habanera</b>,<b> </b>and <b>waltz</b>, which reflected the styles of light European music and European dance forms popular at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The establishment of the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music in 1916 under the American civil administration introduced the study and performance of a prescribed repertory of Western art music literature. Exposure to various forms in school and to performances here and abroad and through records and tapes led to the writing of compositions modeled after major genres in Western classical music. By the mid-1930s, Philippine solo instrumental literature reached its peak as seen in the works of composition graduates Nicanor S. Abelardo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3942\"><strong>Rodolfo S. Cornejo</strong></a>, and Antonio J. Molina, a composition student of Abelardo. Altogether, these composers produced composite forms, specifically three-piano concertos, four-piano sonatas, two sonatas for violin and piano, one sonata for cello, and single forms and character pieces such as <b>nocturnes</b>, <b>romanzas</b>, and <b>caprices</b> for piano, violin, and cello.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This initial body of solo works was augmented considerably by succeeding generations of composers who trained locally and/or abroad and who became charter and associate members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC). Like their predecessors, a number sought to express their nationalism through the creative use of Philippine folk songs or nonmusical ideas or programs pertaining to Philippine culture. Others produced works in the 20th-century neoclassic style and in the avant-garde idioms. In <b><i>The League of Filipino Composers 1989 Directory and Catalogue of Selected Works</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>piano compositions far outnumber those for violin, cello, and flute, with the least number belonging to the guitar and brasswinds. Similarly, the contest pieces commissioned by the National Music Competitions for Young Artists founded in 1972 were solely piano pieces for categories A (elementary), B (high school), and C (college), totaling 30 compositions. In 1990 the first violin pieces for categories B and C were commissioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Piano</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Works for piano manifested influences of the romantic, impressionistic, contemporary, and avant-garde schools of composition. The earliest extant solo piano piece written by a Filipino was Diego Perez&rsquo;s paraphrase of perceived traditional native Philippine music in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas y sus Cantares, Gran Potpurri para Piano </i></b>(Memories of Filipinas and Her Songs, Great Collection for Piano), 1886. Other works before the 20th century include Julio Nakpil&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/986\"><strong>Recuerdos de Capiz</strong></a>&rdquo; (Memories of Capiz), and Filemon Sotto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meditacion&rdquo; (Meditation), 1892. In the 1900s, the romantic bravura style of pianism was exemplified by Francisco Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Souvenirs of the Philippines</i></b>,<i> </i>a fantasy in the style of a Paganini-Liszt etude; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Mayon</i></b>,<i> </i>a descriptive fantasy for piano and orchestra also arranged for piano solo, &ldquo;Larawan&rdquo; (Portrait), &ldquo;Lullaby,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><strong>Kumintang</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo;; Rodolfo S. Cornejo&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Rhapsodies nos. 1</i></b>,<b><i> 2</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>3 </i></b>for piano and orchestra in the style of Liszt; and A. Doronilla&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Rhapsody</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>also of Lisztian influence. All of these works employed Philippine folk songs as thematic material. A 19th-century piano genre called <b>lyric or character pieces</b>, which exploited the evocative capabilities of the piano, surfaced in Nicanor S. Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/889\"><strong>First Nocturne</strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fantasie Impromptu,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Valse Caprice&rdquo; (Sudden Waltz); Francisco Santiago&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nocturne in E-Flat Minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Valsette in F&rdquo;; Cornejo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nocturne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Song without Words,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Etude in A-Flat&rdquo;; and Lucino T. Sacramento&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song without Words&rdquo; and &ldquo;Romance.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano works of Antonio J. Molina&mdash;namely, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/937\"><strong>Malikmata</strong></a>&rdquo; (Phantasm), 1939, and &ldquo;Camia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dancing Fool,&rdquo; both 1942&mdash;were significant departures from the heavily romantic style of the foregoing pieces. Manifesting the influence of Debussy, these compositions contained devices such as the whole-tone scale, pentatonic scale, and the use of 9th and 11th chords. The first was inspired by the poetry of Rafael Zulueta da Costa (the second part of &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo; in <b><i>Like the Molave</i></b>), the second by the poetry of Francisco Icasiano (&ldquo;To a Camia&rdquo;), and the third by the character <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Touch Me Not). All three pieces were in ternary design flanked by a brief introduction and coda. The first and third parts were usually in the whole tone and pentatonic scale with 9th and 11th chords while the middle parts were lyric and tonal with conventional harmonic progression. The composer suggested a reading of the poetry along with the performance of &ldquo;Malikmata&rdquo; or &ldquo;Camia,&rdquo; which he called &ldquo;piano poems.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sayaw ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a>&rdquo; (Igorot Dance), 1939, was &ldquo;boldly modern&rdquo; with its vigorously repeated percussive chord-clusters on the left hand and 16th-note motifs on the right. It was an attempt to portray an ethnic dance from northern Luzon. His &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Love Song), 1950, leaned toward late romanticism with its modulatory harmonic progressions and lyrical and original melodies. The title implied cantabile and espressivo vocal lines with instrumental interludes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1950 onward, most solo piano works were written in the modern idiom. <b>Toccatas</b>, brilliant pieces aimed at showcasing a performer&rsquo;s techniques, were written by Antonio J. Molina, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, Ruben R. Federizon, Ben Tupas, and Jose Alvarez, whose composition won first prize in the 1983 Young Composers&rsquo; Competition sponsored by the LFC. The output in piano literature grew steadily with individual contributions and the commissioned contest pieces of the NAMCYA. The contemporary concert repertoire of individual pieces started with the works of Alfredo S. Buenaventura, Bernardino F. Custodio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a>. Santos&rsquo;s three-part <b><i>Mountain City Suite</i></b> was inspired by the mountain scenery and festivals of Baguio City and Bontoc, Mountain Province. The piece played easily and each movement had a distinct melodic and rhythmic character. He also wrote 12 pieces in the 12-tone technique. Bernardino F. Custodio&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong>Sarimanok</strong></a> &rdquo; and &ldquo;Pauli-uli&rdquo; (Repetition) were NAMCYA contest pieces and effective recital numbers. &ldquo;Sarimanok&rdquo; contained rhythmic motifs suggesting Muslim dances, while &ldquo;Pauli-uli&rdquo; was in theme and variation form using the first four measures of the folk song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\"><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Nipa Hut).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lucrecia R. Kasilag&rsquo;s &ldquo;Theme and Variation&rdquo; featured pianistic techniques of increasing levels of difficulty in a variety of styles. She also wrote the only group of pieces for prepared piano known as <b><i>Derivations I</i></b>,<b><i> II</i></b>,<b><i> III</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>IV</i></b>. Inspired by the eruption of the longest sleeping volcano in the world in 1991, she composed &ldquo;Elegy on Mt. Pinatubo&rdquo; in 1992. Two years later, she wrote &ldquo;Serendipity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The NAMCYA collection of piano contest pieces was a variety of traditional and mostly contemporary pieces written by LFC members. Alfredo S. Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Emotions nos. 1</i></b>,<b><i> 2</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>3 </i></b>were nocturne-like pieces with expressive melodies and contemporary harmonies. Kasilag&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rondeau&rdquo; and &ldquo;Derivations V: Caprice,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> M. de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kimkim&rdquo; (Clenched), and Ramon P. Santos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Klintang&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abot-Tanaw III&rdquo; (Horizons), were formidable additions to the piano concert repertoire. &ldquo;Klintang&rdquo; was inspired by techniques of playing the <b>kulintang </b>(eight-brass gongs of graduated sizes) and drew from the piano&rsquo;s upper registers a &ldquo;stream of kulintang sounds&rdquo; a la <b>perpetuum mobile</b> through rapidly alternating double notes on the left and right hands. In the middle section, sustained clusters in various registers in the bass, alternating with phrases of rapid single notes on the right hand, suggested a dialogue of timbral contrast between a gong and a kulintang. In &ldquo;Abot-Tanaw III,&rdquo; Santos brought together the kulintang and the piano through a novel approach&mdash;by using the piano as a sound source.

The repertory of Western-influenced single and self-contained instrumental pieces created by conservatory-trained Filipino composers represented a literature identified with the romantic, impressionistic, and other early 20th-century idioms, and avant-garde or New Music techniques. The use of Philippine-related programs (nonmusical ideas) invested these compositions with a Philippine identity.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Mauricia D.

In the case of the last three, the piano usually accompanies or supports the solo instrument. The normal scheme of movements is allegro-andante-minuet-allegro. Frequently, however, the <b>minuet</b> or <b>scherzo</b> is omitted, leaving a fast-slow-fast order of movements. In some sonatas of the 19th century, such as those of Franz Liszt, the alternating fast and slow movements were merged into one long, continuous movement with contrasting sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a rule, each movement of the sonata follows a preordained structure. The first movement is almost always cast in sonata-allegro form, which consists of a repeated exposition<b> </b>introducing the principal themes, a development<b> </b>that amplifies this material, and a recapitulation<b> </b>or summing up that restates the themes. In the second movement, any one of a variety of forms may be used: sonata-allegro, a simple ternary (ABA) or binary (AB) form, a theme and variation, or a <b>sonatina </b>(abridged sonata-allegro). The third movement is always cast in a large tripartite form: minuet (aababa)-trio (ccdcdc)-minuet (aba). The same scheme is used for movements called scherzo, the difference only being in the tempo and character of the themes. The final movement is either another sonata-allegro structure or a <b>rondo </b>(ABA; ABACA; ABACABA). The same sonata structure is found in other instrumental music, like the symphony, such as string quartet and other types of chamber music, and concerto, though slightly modified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, composers learned to write sonatas in conservatories or academies of music. The earliest recorded sonata by a Filipino is the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\"><strong>Sonata</strong></a> in G Major</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1921, for piano composed by Nicanor S. Abelardo. Cast in three movements (allegro-adagio-presto), the work was first presented during his graduation recital. This was followed in 1922 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sonata Filipina in D-Flat Major </i></b>in three movements, also for piano. Santiago used folk song melodies as thematic materials. The first movement, &ldquo;Moderato Assai,&rdquo; is based on the Tagalog <b>balitaw </b>and the <b>Visayan folk song</b> &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/930\"><strong>Lulay</strong></a>&rdquo;; the second movement, &ldquo;Andante,&rdquo; is based on a <b>kundiman</b>;<b> </b>and the final movement, &ldquo;Rondo,&rdquo; uses the &ldquo;Magtanim Ay Di Biro&rdquo; (Planting Rice is Never Fun) melody. Like the earlier Abelardo opus, the sonata formed part of Santiago&rsquo;s graduation recital program. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3942\"><strong>Rodolfo S. Cornejo</strong></a>&rsquo;s three sonatas belong to this same period, and evince a similar style of writing. Written while still a student, first at the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music and then at the Chicago <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> College, were his <b><i>Piano Sonata</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1929, <b><i>Sonata for Violin and Piano</i></b>, 1932, and <b><i>Sonata for Cello and Piano</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1932.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The solo sonata literature in the ensuing decades was sparse. Composers favored the shorter, one-movement pieces, which were then in vogue. With their descriptive titles, these pieces were more readily appreciated by the general audience. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><strong>Amada</strong></a> Santos-Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Sonata in D-Flat</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1942, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\"><strong>Rosendo Santos</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano Sonata</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1948, were both written as academic requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of the 1960s and 1970s, more sonatas appeared. The founding of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> (LFC) in 1955 brought about a reawakening of interest in chamber music, particularly due to their annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP)-sponsored Philippine Music Festivals. Solo sonatas by LFC members include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sonata for Viola and Piano</i></b>,<i> </i>1969; Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Sonata</i> <i>for Doublebass and Piano</i></b>,<i> </i>1970; Hilarion F. Rubio&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano</i> <i>Sonata</i></b>,<i> </i>1971; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> M. de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Perlas Sonata for Cello and Piano</i></b>,<i> </i>1971; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Piano</i> <i>Sonata no. 1</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1976, and <b><i>Piano Sonata no. 2</i></b>,<i> </i>1977. Earlier in 1961, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a> composed the <b><i>Sonate</i> <i>Orientale </i></b>for piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the United States, Rosendo Santos, while serving as band director and resident composer at Wilkes Barre College, wrote several sonatas for wind instruments and piano: <b><i>Sonata Allegro for Tuba</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1969; <b><i>Sonata no. 1 for Tuba</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1970; <b><i>Sonata no. 2 for Clarinet</i></b>,<b> </b>1971; <b><i>Sonata in G Minor for Piano</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1984; and <b><i>Sonata in</i> <i>F for Horn</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1989. Angel Pe&ntilde;a wrote his <b><i>Sonata no. 2 for Double Bass and Piano</i></b> while he was living in Hawaii in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sonata form has not been popular with the younger generation of composers who have favored more contemporary forms and techniques. The only exception is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3938\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3939\"><strong>Jeffrey Ching</strong></a></strong></a> who has composed eight sonatas for solo piano, three for flute (1985, 1988, and 1989), and one for violin (<b><i>D Major</i></b>, 1986-89). His <b><i>&ldquo;Superklavier&rdquo; Sonata</i></b>, 1992, has been revised a number of times from 1998 to 2012. He has two versions of his arrangement of Wagner&rsquo;s <b><i>Wesendonck Lieder</i></b>&mdash;one for mezzo-soprano, viola, and piano, and another for mezzo-soprano, violoncello, and piano, titled <b><i>Wesendonck Sonata</i></b>, 2012.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

These topics point to the song type&rsquo;s origin in traditional marriage negotiations, which are still practiced by the <i>lumad </i>(indigenous cultural communities), particularly in Southern Mindanao, in which representatives of the families of the wife-giver and the wife-taker &ldquo;debate&rdquo; or outdo each other concerning the value of the soon-to-be bride in terms of bride price and dowry. In other places where the social exchange leading to marriage is no longer done, the song debate evolved into a public entertainment form in social gatherings, especially at weddings where the male singer expresses and defends the role of men in the family or community, and the female singer, the role of women. Centering therefore on the theme of male-female relations, the debate is often witty and humorous, eliciting loud laughter and side comments from listeners. Philippine song debate forms are called by various names, like <b>dallot </b>(Ilocano), <b>liwliwa </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>), <b>erekay</b> (Cuyunon), <b>balitaw </b>(Cebuano), <b>panonoroon </b>(Maranao), <b>pagsindil </b>(Tausug), <b>setolu </b>(Tboli), and <b>stalo </b>(Blaan). The most popular song debate among the Tagalog and Cebuano is the <b>balitaw.</b> These forms utilize only two singers except the liwliwa, which is sung by two groups of men and women in alternation, and the pagsindil by three or more professional singers who take turns singing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine song debate forms are often accompanied by musical instruments like <b>kutibeng </b>(five-stringed guitar) for the dallot,<b><i> </i>yuke</b> (ukelele) for the erekay, harp or guitar for the balitaw, and <b>gabbang </b>(bamboo xylophone) and/or <b>biola </b>(violin) for the pagsindil. Among the Tboli and Blaan, gender opposition and complementarity are symbolically represented in the marriage negotiations by a woman singing, accompanying herself with the bamboo-plucked zither, and a man singing, accompanying himself with the two-stringed lute. The instruments usually provide melodic and harmonic ostinati as support to the singing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A private and more intimate type of song rendered in alternation between a male and female singer is the Hanunuo <b>ambahan </b>(courtship song) accompanied by a three-stringed fiddle called <b>gitgit</b>.<b> </b>A subtype of song debate called <b>dayunday </b>has evolved among Maguindanaon speakers in Cotabato since the 1970s, in which two men, accompanying themselves on the guitar, compete with each other on stage in front of a woman, using improvised and using playful innuendos in verse about love and desire.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

Sound art &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; are commonly hybrid in form, with practitioners coming from various disciplines, such as the plastic and visual arts, theater and film, electronic and new media, and popular music. Sound artists frequently utilize the electronic platform but also engage in the acoustic medium, including the human body and the sonic environment, generally employing formalistic approaches as well as improvisation, interactivity, spatial dimension, and extended technique (known within the craft as sound bending). The art, however, may still be considered in its infancy and its definition, including the minimal requirements for a piece to be considered as belonging to sound art, is still evolving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While sound artists currently distance themselves from music as a discipline (e.g., preference for &ldquo;noise&rdquo; over musical sounds and identification as &ldquo;sound artists&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;composers&rdquo;), sound art falls within the broad-spectrum definition of music as &ldquo;organized sound,&rdquo; and the initial examples were associated with 20th-century music movements. Often cited are the Italian Futurist school and Luigi Russolo&rsquo;s 1913 manifesto <b><i>The Art of Noises</i></b>, which called for the use of modern technology in art, culminating in the construction of the <b>intonarumori</b>, an assemblage of noisemaking machines. The early avant-garde French composer Erik Satie pioneered the use of everyday sounds in his ballet <b><i>Parade</i></b>,<b> </b>1916-17, and the recontextualization of musical performance from presentational to ambient and functional in <b><i>Musique d&rsquo;Ameublement</i></b><i> </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>Furniture</strong></a> Music), 1917. Advancements in technology, particularly the invention of the tape recorder, allowed for the use of nonmusical sound sources and the electronic medium in the <b>musique concrete</b> compositions of Pierre Schaeffer in the early 1940s. Meanwhile, the musical experimentations of American composer John Cage further established the use of nonconventional sound sources, improvisation, and indeterminacy in compositions such as <b><i>Imaginary Landscapes</i></b>, 1939-52. Edgard Varese pioneered electronic music in his works, such as the <b><i>Poeme Electronique</i></b> composed in collaboration with renowned architect Le Coubusier for the Philips Pavilion in the World&rsquo;s Fair held in Brussels in 1958. Other contributing sources for sound art include the fields of acoustics, conceptual art, media art, Dadaism, spoken word, experimental theater, and acoustic ecology. The very first use of the term in the United States, however, is attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Hellerman&rsquo;s show <b><i>Sound/Art</i></b> held in New York in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">What might be considered the earliest examples of Philippine sound art were the works of composer Jose M. Maceda (1917-2004) such as <b><i>Cassettes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a></i></b>, 1971, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a></i></b>, 1974, which foreshadowed current experimentations with everyday sounds, the electronic media, and nonconventional avenues of presentation. In fact, Maceda has become a legendary figure in today&rsquo;s Filipino sound artists circle, being regarded as a cult hero, whose revolutionary musical ideas parallel their own aesthetic principles. The development of the craft, however, took place independently, outside the world of the academe and art music. Pioneering groups began sprouting as early as 1989, such as the Children of Cathode Ray<i> </i>established by Jing Garcia aka autoceremony. Typical of the current crop of sound art practitioners, Garcia&rsquo;s background was in the recording and media industries, writing as well as a tech editing for <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b>. His work <b><i>Bali-ing at Dawn</i></b>, 2013, was a 30-minute piece that digitally manipulated a field recording made by Maceda in 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Co-founding the Children of Cathode Ray<i> </i>with Garcia, Tad Ermita&ntilde;o is one of the most prolific sound artists in the country, active in both the local and international art scenes. Ermita&ntilde;o is a media artist, writer, and filmmaker who classifies himself as a media artist with a special interest in sound. His piece titled &ldquo;Quartet,&rdquo; 2008, featured at the International Symposium on Electronic Art, revealed his interest in elementary robotics. In this interactive work, he installed solenoid beaters on Javanese gamelan instruments that are triggered by the &ldquo;conducting&rdquo; motions of viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like Garcia and Ermita&ntilde;o, Earl &ldquo;Tengal&rdquo; Drilon maintains an active presence in Philippine media arts. Tengal is a filmmaker and music producer who has been involved in sound art since 2005, exhibiting his work, performing, and giving lectures in Europe and Asia. As a curator, his notable projects include <b><i>Sinemusikalye</i></b>,<b> </b>2008, commissioned by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, which involved multiple video projectors, giant screens, and live and electronic sounds. Tengal founded the SABAW Media Art Kitchen, an initiative dedicated to promote works created by artists, makers, and designers from the Philippines and the Southeast Asian region. In his work titled <b><i>30</i></b> <b><i>Sounds in a Filing Cabinet</i></b>, 2013, Tengal fitted sensors in each of the drawers of a library card catalogue, which, when pulled, triggers a recording from the Maceda ethnomusicology archive, allowing for a total of over a million sound combinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Instrument builder<b> </b>Lirio Salvador<b> </b>embodies another segment of the country&rsquo;s group of sound artists. Salvador, reminiscent of the Futurists, salvages industrial refuse, such as gears, pipes, springs, and utensils, and crafts them into sound-producing sculptural assemblages. He founded the ensemble Elemento that regularly performs in festivals and art exhibits using his instruments and homemade synthesizers. In 2012, Salvador&rsquo;s work was featured at the Vargas Museum at the University of the Philippines in an exhibit titled <b><i>Sandata</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other artists who have made significant contributions to the expansion and development of sound art in the country include Cris Garcimo aka BLEND:ER, an electronica enthusiast who has experimented with <b>audio acrobatics</b> and <b>technoid sonic landscapes</b> since 1999. Mark Laccay, an award winning audio engineer and sound designer, worked as the main audio consultant for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> Collection Digitization Project. Laccay established ArtisteConnect, a platform for crowdsourcing funds for local creative endeavors. Erick Calilan<b> </b>aka Ugong, who uses mixers, effects, and other consumer electronic devices in his work, released a CD titled <b><i>Morka Pica</i></b>,<i> </i>2007. Malek Lopez,<b> </b>who began as a classical guitarist as well as a filmmaker, is considered one of the pioneers of live electronica in the country. He has collaborated with international composers, fusion jazz groups, improvisation ensembles, and techno performers. Arvin Nogueras<b> </b>aka Caliph8 is a sound creator and vinyl archivist, who performs and creates music with Malek Lopez and Fred Sandoval<b> </b>of the group Bent Lynchpin<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the notable events that highlight sound artists in the country is the annual Fete de la WSK that began as a parody of the French Embassy-sponsored Fete de la Musique in 2008. The festival features performances, exhibits, lectures, and workshops dedicated to contemporary electronic, digital, and experimental sonic art and other artistic expressions. The Lopez Museum held <b><i>Reverb</i></b> in 2011, which featured the works of artists like Eric Ambata, Kawayan de Guia, Tad Ermita&ntilde;o, IC Jaucian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\"><strong>Diokno Pasilan</strong></a>, Ronald Tomas, the collaborative E.X.I.S.T.

In 2013, the UP Center for Ethnomusicology commemorated its 16th anniversary with an exhibit dedicated to the life and work of Jose Maceda titled <b><i>Listen to My Music</i></b> at the Vargas Museum. The affair was highlighted by most of the sound artists mentioned above who featured pieces in confluence with Maceda&rsquo;s work and philosophy.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Verne de la Pe&ntilde;a</strong> </em><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251687936\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources: </strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a> 2011; E.X.I.S.T. 2010; Licht 2007; <b><i>The</i> <i>Philippine Star</i></b> 2008b; Varese 1966; Wong 2013.</p>\r\n"

The word &ldquo;symphony&rdquo; is derived from the Greek <i>syn</i> (together) and <i>phone</i> (sounding) and combined in the Latin term<i> symphonia</i>. Symphonic works are extended compositions fororchestra and may consist of several movements as in a <b>symphony</b> or a <b>suite</b>, or of a single movement with multiple sections, as in a <b>symphonic poem</b> or a <b>concert overture</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The symphony is a<b>sonata</b>written for orchestra with three to four basic contrasting movements within a musically unified scheme.The concert overture is usually written in sonata-allegro form, like the first movement of a symphony.In a suite, which is an ordered set of individual pieces, the element of unity is either musical or nonmusical. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> means it has a common key, form, source, or a nonmusical idea. A nonmusical idea, also called a &ldquo;program,&rdquo; is usually indicated in the title or described in the remarks accompanying the score.The symphonic poem, also known as the <b>tone poem</b>, is based on a nonmusical poetic or realistic concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early examples of Philippine orchestral writing were mentioned by Antonio J. Molina in his article &ldquo;Music: Between God and Man.&rdquo; First performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong></a> on 30 Dec 1911 was a set of seven compositions inspired by episodes in the life of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>: &ldquo;Rizal at the Dawn of Life&rdquo; byFranciscoBuencamino, &ldquo;Rizal under the Robe of Minerva&rdquo; by Crispino Reyes, &ldquo;Rizal on the Pegasus&rdquo; by Tereso Zapata, &ldquo;Rizal, the Fatherland&rsquo;s Crusader&rdquo; byJuanS.Hernandez, &ldquo;Rizal in Lonesome <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/447\"><strong>Dapit</strong></a>an&rdquo; by Gavino Carluen, &ldquo;Rizal in His Last Night&rdquo; by Antonio G. Escamilla, and &ldquo;Rizal Glorified&rdquo; byMarceloAdonay.These seven composers came from diverse backgrounds.Buencamino was a pianist-teacher-composer known for his brilliant piano works, such as<b><i>Mayon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a></i></b> (The Mayon Volcano) and<b><i>Larawan</i></b><i> </i>(Portrait). Reyes was a piano teacher at San Beda College and Colegio de San Juan de Letran and composer of several <b>sarsuwela</b>. Zapata was a violinist and conductor of the First Constabulary Band, and composer of a four-movement symphonic suite and two operas. Hernandez was a pianist and composer of a piano concerto,<b><i>Maria Clara&rsquo;s Song</i></b>, and a Mass. Carluen was a pianist-organist-composer and brother of opera composer Alejo. Escamilla was a member oftheAsociacion MusicaldeFilipinas. And Adonay was the humble<i>tiple </i>who rose to become conductor of the orchestra at San Agustin Church and composer par excellence of church music. The only thing they had in common was that they were all drawn into this endeavor by their innate patriotism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1916, the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music was founded.As enrollment increased, Zapata, and much later, Hernandez, joined the faculty. In 1920, the conservatory started to produce graduates who became the country&rsquo;s prominent teachers, performers, and composers of symphonic works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1921 to 1950, majority of compositions were cast in the mold of Western classical forms, such as the symphony, suite, overture, and tone poem.Such works quoted or creatively utilized<b> </b>Filipino Folk songs as thematic material and sometimes featured <s>i</s>ndigenous instruments.With few exceptions, these were mostly written in the musical language of the late 19th-century romanticists which was characterized by well-defined<s> </s>tonalities, lyrical melodies, chromatic harmonies, and rich orchestral colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The above trend continued but new approaches also surfaced.Original themes emerged; some<b> </b>were juxtaposed with existing melodies. Music performance resources were expanded to include choirs, soloists, and/or narrator. With certain foreign-trained composers writing in the modern idiom, the musical language expanded to include that of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The years 1951-70 witnessed the birth of three institutions that became potent forces in the creation and performance of Philippine symphonicliterature. The first was theLeagueofFilipino Composers (LFC), organized in 1955 under the auspices of the Regional Music</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nCommission of Southeast Asia, which held yearly festivals that premiered commissioned works by its members.The second was the MusicPromotionFoundationofthePhilippines (MPFP) created by law in 1956, which funded scholarships for orchestral musicians and awarded prizes to outstanding works.And the third was the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines(CCP), inaugurated in 1969, which founded its own orchestra and commissioned new symphonic works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a result of the establishment of these institutions, more commissioned symphonic genres were produced. While compositions in the standard classical forms of overtures, suites, and symphonic poems continued to be written, more works broke away from the previousmold. Moreover, a good number of pieces were written by younger composers who had studied modern composition technique in the United States or Europe, and whose creative energies continue to have an impact on modernism in Philippine symphonic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Symphonies</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>balitaw</b>-based <b><i>Filipinas Symphony</i></b>, 1928, byJoseEstella is considered the first Philippine symphony. Nicanor S.

The curriculum required its graduates to present a public recital consisting of an orchestral work and solo vocal or instrumental pieces. The required recital format repertoire was observed until the 1940s. Thus, Juan S. Hernandez wrote <b><i>Simoun Overture</i></b> in 1920. Abelardo presented <b><i>Mountain Suite</i></b>, among other works, in 1921. However, while on a study grant at the Chicago Music College, he composed <b><i>Cinderella Overture</i></b>, 1931, which won for him the Wesley La Violette scholarship in composition. In 1922, Santiago presented <b><i>Philippine Overture</i></b> and <b><i>Intermezzo</i></b>, both for orchestra, and several solo and ensemble pieces for piano, voice, violin, and cello.

In 1968, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3914\"><strong>Alfredo Buenaventura</strong></a> also wrote <b><i>Corregidor Symphonic Poem</i></b>, 1968, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2192\"><strong>Gomburza</strong></a></i></b><b><i>Symphonic Poem</i></b>, 1981. Biblical events as programmatic elements appeared in tone poems like Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s<b><i>The Transfiguration of Christ</i></b>, 1950, which was for orchestra and female voices. This was commissioned by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> and was followed by Manuel P. Maramba&rsquo;s work on a similar title, <b><i>Transfiguration I</i></b>, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folklore, especially legends and epics, was also a favorite program in tone poems. This was seen in Pajaro&rsquo;s <b><i>Lifeof<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></i></b>, 1951, which was based on the Ilocano epic and which utilized melodies from Ilocano folk songs, such as &ldquo;Pamulinawen,&rdquo; (Stonehearted Lady) &ldquo;TiAyattiMaysangaUbing&rdquo; (The Love of a Young Child), &ldquo;ManangBiday,&rdquo; and a traditional wedding chant, <b>dallot</b><i>. </i>The tunes were all in juxtaposition, as countermelodies or as leitmotifs. The sonic idiom consisted of neomodality, triadic, quartal, and quintal harmonies, parallel fourths, fifths, and chromaticism. Another piece was Alfredo S. Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Manik Buangsi</i></b> <b><i>and Tuan Putli</i></b>, 1978, based on a Tausug-Samal tale that unfolds in six sections: &ldquo;Dreams and Longings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Opening of the Celestial Kingdom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Courtship and Romance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Royal Wedding,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dangerous Journey,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Death of Tuan Putli.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some tone poems rendered homage to endeared people, like Rodolfo S. Cornejo&rsquo;s <b><i>Ruby</i></b>, 1964, which included a choral obbligato, actually a two-syllable vocalise (singing with syllables) on Ruby, the only word sung in the entire work. &ldquo;Ruby&rdquo; is the composer&rsquo;s daughter.Another work is Eduardo Parungao&rsquo;s<b><i>Parangal at Pagpupugay </i></b>(Commemoration and Salutation), 1977, which was originally for band and rescored for orchestra in 1977. It honored Mariano Zabat Jr, a prominent band conductor, and all the country&rsquo;s dedicated band leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two composers whose program was abstract were Bayani M. de Leon who composed <b><i>Batong-Buhay</i></b> (Fine-Grained Stone), 1968, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a> who did <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a> Symphonic Poem</i></b>, 1963. Santos would later write his <b><i>Penomenon</i></b>, 1980, which consisted of five pieces, each one depicting in the abstract events in Filipino life: Pagdiriwang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></a>, Balang, Harana, Agay-ay. The opus creatively explored the atmospheric dimensions and experiential facets of each event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Other Works</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compositions apart from the aforementioned standard symphonic genres have emerged and could be classified under four groups, all of which manifesting nonconventionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One group consists of abstract, single-movement symphonic works, like <b>symphonic prelude</b>, <b>symphonic variation</b>, <b>symphonic toccata</b>, and <b>symphonic rhapsodies</b>.These include Eliseo Pajaro&rsquo;s<b><i>Variations and Fugue</i></b>, 1959; Antonino Buenaventura&rsquo;s<b><i>Variations and Fugue on a Mountain Folk Tune</i></b>, 1972; Francisco F. Feliciano&rsquo;s <b><i>Prelude and Toccata</i></b>, 1973, <b><i>Variations uber ein Gestalt</i></b>, 1977, and <b><i>Prelude and Toccata</i></b>, 1980; Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s<b><i>IgorotRhapsody</i></b>, 1959, and <b><i>Symphonic Variations on Two Manobo Themes</i></b>, 1983<i>;</i>and Lucio D. San Pedro&rsquo;s<b><i>Ilocano Fantasy </i></b>and <b><i>Visayan Fantasy</i></b>, 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A second group of nonconventional symphonic works is characterized by its use of extended performance media (voice plus orchestra) and includes Pajaro&rsquo;s<b><i>Ode to the Golden Jubilee</i></b>, 1958,<b><i></i></b>for soloist, narrator, chorus, and orchestra and <b><i>Man and Theater</i></b>, 1963, for baritone, special chorus, and orchestra; Jose M. Maceda&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/965\"><strong>Pagsamba</strong></a> </i></b>(Worship), 1968, for 116 instrumentalists, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> voices, chorus of 25 men; Felipe Padilla M. de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng Buhay</i></b>(Song of Life), 1969, a symphonic drama for baritone, narrator, and orchestra; Bayani M. de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Revelations</i></b>, 1982, for even mantric sound-grids for orchestra; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>&rsquo;s<b><i>The Transfiguration</i></b> <b><i>of Jesus Christ</i></b>, 1983, for chorus, orchestra, and narrator; Alfredo S. Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Rizal</i></b>,<b><i>the Great Malayan Antagonist: A Symphonic Drama</i></b>, 1990; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\"><strong>Chino Toledo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sandaang Tagpi-Tagpi </i></b>(A Hundred Patchworks), 1998, for chorus, gongs, and orchestra; and Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Nagnit, Igak, G&rsquo;nan, Wagnwag Nila (Alingawngaw ng Kagitingan)</i></b>, 1997, for seven choruses, four orchestral groups, and audience; and<b><i> UP Dangal ng Karunungan, Dangal ng Bayan </i></b>(UP Seat of Wisdom, Pride of the Motherland), 2008, for tenor, soprano, speech choir, chorus, orchestra, and gamelan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Works in the third group are characterized specifically by the use of Philippine indigenous instruments. This group was exemplified by early examples of Lucrecia Kasilag&rsquo;s compositions, such as <b><i>Legend of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong>Sarimanok</strong></a></i></b>, 1963, for orchestra and indigenous instruments, and <b><i>Dularawan </i></b>(<b><i>Golden Salakot</i></b>), 1969, for mixed chorus and indigenous instruments. In a different idiom, but &ldquo;symphonic&rdquo; in treatment for it utilized varied tone colors, was Jose M. Maceda&rsquo;s avant-garde compositions, like <b><i>Ugma-ugma</i></b>, 1963; <b><i>Agungan</i></b>, 1965; and <b><i>Aroding</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1983. Maceda&rsquo;s new music was passed on to Ramon Santos who wrote <b><i>L&rsquo;bad</i></b>, 1995, for <b>kwintangan</b>,<i> </i>three<i> </i><b>agung</b>,<i> </i><b>gandang</b>, and orchestra. The title of the piece, which was abstract, was derived from the word <b>lebad</b>, the smallest musical unit that is constantly repeated, altered, and juxtaposed with other units in the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last group no longer belongs to symphonic literature per se, but is included because the works constituted contemporary integrative art musics. These include Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Terminal Lamentation</i></b>, 1982, musical graphics for voice and percussion, and <b><i>Kulambo: Isang Kayumangging Puntod</i></b>, 1986, for chorus and orchestra; Laverne de la Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Quadratos</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1981, for three dancers and flute, and <b><i>Si Suan, Si Suan</i></b>, 1983, for solo singer/puppeteer/actress; Christine Muyco&rsquo;s <b><i>Ginun-ag</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013, for computer music, solo dance, and voice; <b><i>Ilig-Duta</i></b>, 2006 (Flow of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>) for large orchestra, bamboos, and gongs; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Lisan&ndash;Leaving </i></b>(Sound Film on the Plight of the Iraya-Mangyan),<b><i> </i></b>2007, for solo singer/puppeteer/actress; and Ramon Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Awit</i></b>, 1983, a multimedia piece for three guitars, vocalists, percussion, dancers, and <b><i>Daragang Magayon: An Istorya ni Magayo</i></b><i>n </i>(Daragang Magayon: The Story of Magayon), 2013, a full-length ballet with animation, videos, lights, rondalla, percussion, piano, chorus, soloists, and narrator.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Mauricia D.

The term was taken from the word &ldquo;<i>villano</i>&rdquo; (rustic) and, though simple in music texture, it was cultivated into a complex secular polyphonic music during the late 15th century and the 16th century. Beginning the 17th century, texture became simple again or monophonic, and the use of devotional and religious themes gained importance. From its secular constitution, villancicos<i> </i>(also referred to as <b>letra</b> or <b>tono</b>) became a genre of monophonic sacred songs with popular elements that were sung in Spanish or in the vernacular. It was this style that was heard in church services in Spain and its colonies, particularly during liturgical feast days such as Christmas, Ascension, Epiphany, and Corpus Christi. There was a rapid decline in its popularity from the 18th to the 19th century, but it continued to be widely cultivated in Latin America and in the Philippines. Although religious in function, the villancico continued to exhibit predominant secular and popular elements. Due to its extensive utilization during Christmas, by the mid-19th century, the term villancico was used to refer to Christmas songs. Since then, this has been the generally accepted meaning of the term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest existing music source of villancicos in the Philippines probably dates from the second half of the 17th century. This source has been preserved in the Dominican church of San Juan del Monte, and one in the collection stands out because it is in the vernacular, titled &ldquo;Letra en Tagalo[g]&rdquo; (Lyrics in Tagalog). This source was followed by another set, probably composed in the 18th century, found in the five-volume anthology of sacred music <b><i>Manual-Cantoral de Santa Clara</i></b> published in the early 1870s. Included in volume 4 of a multivolume anthology was a set of four <b>villancicos al santisimo</b><i> </i>(songs to the Most Holy) performed during the feast of the Corpus Christi, a villancico al santisimo for Holy Thursday, and a set of four villancicos for Christmas&mdash;namely, &ldquo;El Rey de los Cielos&rdquo; (The King of Heaven), &ldquo;Ea <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/82\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>Pastores</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (Come, Shepherds), &ldquo;O Grande Mysterio&rdquo; (Grand Mystery), and &ldquo;Venid Gentes Todas&rdquo; (Come All Peoples).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/799\"><strong>Villancico</strong></a>s became songs for Mass Proper (entrance, offertory, communion, and so on) in the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a> de Aguinaldo</i> (nine-day dawn Masses), which starts on 16 Dec to honor the Virgin. It is also sung in the <i>Misa de Gallo</i> (midnight Mass) on Christmas Eve, together with the Mass Ordinary (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, and so on)&mdash;that is, the <i>Misa Pastorela</i>. There are historical accounts that mention of Spanish friar musicians assigned in the Philippines who composed villancicos. Among them were Fray Lorenzo Castello (1686-1743), an Augustinian from Valencia, Spain, assigned to the San Agustin Church in Intramuros, Manila, who composed two volumes of villancicos as well as arias, and Juan Bolivar (1708-54), an Augustinian friar renowned for his exquisite singing ability who was known to have composed polyphonic villancicos and settings of the Gloria and Credo in the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of the genre&rsquo;s widespread usage through the annual Christmas season for over three hundred years, traditional Spanish villancicos are quite popular across the islands. The &ldquo;Pastores a Belen&rdquo; (Shepherds at the Nativity) and &ldquo;Nacio Nacio Pastores: Villancicos de Navidad&rdquo; (Rise, Rise Shepherds: Songs of the Nativity) are popular among the populace, even until now. These compositions are included in the Department of Tourism publication titled <b><i>Villancicos: Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>ing Pamasko </i></b>(Villancicos: Christmas Hymns), 1971, compiled and edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3848\"><strong>Rosalina Abejo</strong></a>, RVM, 1922-91.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the villancico performed during the Christmas Masses, villancico was also practiced in related cultural devotional practices, such as the <i>pastores</i>, the <i>panunuluyan</i> in Tagalog-speaking areas,<i> </i>and the <i>suroy</i> in Bohol, which are all extra-liturgical folk Christmas traditions. The Bicol pastores is a musical reenactment of the nativity story where singers, wearing colorful costumes accompanied by<i> </i><b>musikeros</b> (musicians), dance and sing to the villancico tune<i> </i>&ldquo;Pastores a Belen.&rdquo; The panunuluyan<i> </i>is a Philippine Christmas dramatization done through song of Joseph and Mary&rsquo;s search for lodging on the night of Jesus&rsquo;s birth. This could have originated from the Mexican nine-day <i>posadas</i>, but the panunuluyan is done only for a day. Lastly, <i>suroy</i> in Bohol means &ldquo;to go around.&rdquo; It is a unique tradition of caroling in the town of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\"><strong>Lobo</strong></a>c held for a total of 40 days. It starts on 24 Dec and culminates on 2 Feb. This is participated in by <b>cantores</b><i> </i>and<i> </i><b>cantoras</b><i> </i>(male and female singers, respectively), and band musicians, as well as children. They go to different barangays every day to give Christmas cheer through the singing of villancicos and other songs. Vernacular villancicos, such as the <b>daygon</b> (Visayan Christmas songs), are strong evidence that the villancico tradition has been significantly entrenched in the social life of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The villancico also paved the way for musicians in the islands to compose in the genre. Remigio<i> </i>Calahorra (1833-90), a Spanish peninsular professor of the Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, wrote a villancico<i> </i>that has survived and is now part of the archive collection of the UST Benavides Library. Although rhythm and meter are not the distinguishing features of the genre as seen in the 17th and 18th century examples, composed villancicos in the Philippines beginning in the 19th century utilized rhythmic patterns that are a distinctive feature of Misa Pastorela music<i>. </i>Composed villancicos from this period also manifest the use of insistent dotted rhythmic patterns in 6/8 time, as evident in the Calahorra villancico. Other trained Filipino musicians followed suit. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a> (1848-1928), considered the most prominent Filipino church musician of the late 19th century, elaborately composed a villancico titled &ldquo;A Belen Pastores,&rdquo; complete with orchestral accompaniment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the turn of the 20th century, Filipino musicians trained in the conservatory composed in the genre. By this time, the genre was already codified with the following musical style characteristics: (1) a predilection in the use of 6/8 meter and occasional use of duple meter, (2) extensive use of the distinguishing dotted eighth notes and pastorela rhythm, (3) employment of <i>tra la la la</i> syllables, and (4) utilization of the <b>two-part song form</b> (copla and estribillo). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> (1889-1947) wrote &ldquo;Philippine Christmas Carol,&rdquo; a medley of Christmas songs that exhibits the said villancico characteristics. Another composition titled &ldquo;Gloria de Dios (Villancico Filipino)&rdquo; (Glory of God) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a> (1894-1980), found in the Filipiniana collection of the University of the Philippines Music Library, demonstrates an attempt to recognize the villancico as an appropriated Filipino tradition. The music exhibits clear villancico stylistic features, with text adapted from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&rsquo;s famous poem &ldquo;Christmas Bells.&rdquo; Tagalog, Spanish, and English lyrics were incorporated into the notated music. Another noted composer of the Filipino villancico is Felipe de Leon Sr (1912-92), who wrote &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/978\"><strong>Payapang Daigdig</strong></a>&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a>ful World). This piece is unusual because it is a solemn and melancholic Christmas carol. It was the arrangement of Lucio San Pedro (who deliberately omitted the second part) that changed its tone&mdash;a closer scrutiny of the original composition, particularly of the second part, shows that de Leon did utilize the distinguishing Filipino villancico rhythm. De Leon also composed &ldquo;Noche Buena&rdquo; (Christmas Eve Feast) and &ldquo;Pasko na Naman&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Christmas Once Again). In the anthology of villancico she herself edited, Rosalina Abejo composed a piece titled &ldquo;Villancico Filipino.&rdquo; Lucio San Pedro&rsquo;s most important contribution in this genre was making good choir arrangements of Filipino-composed villancicos. He arranged &ldquo;Diwa ng Ating Pasko&rdquo; (Our Christmas Spirit) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\"><strong>Ramon Tapales</strong></a> and did a Christmas medley titled &ldquo;Mga Awiting Pasko&rdquo; (Christmas Hymns), which culminates in the original Cebuano but has been translated to Tagalog and is more popularly known as &ldquo;Ang Pasko Ay Sumapit&rdquo; (Christmas Has Come).<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo-Chua</strong> </em><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251689984\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
