The period experienced growth in musical activities, including the flourishing of many orchestras, bands, and other private music groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zamora&rsquo;s music theory book is significant for it is in Tagalog. Its publication was the civic-minded response of a proactive priest who saw the problem of music illiteracy in the country and the need to hone the skills of professional musicians so that they could read music at a time when there was a vibrant cross-cultural exchange between Europe and modernizing Asia. Through this book, the <i>indio </i>musicians were able to cope with the score-reading requirements of music for civic ceremonies and public entertainments such as zarzuelas and operas that were brought from Europe to Asian cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is divided into two major parts. The first part discusses the basics of western music theory. The second part emphasizes the interpretative aspects of music. The first part has 15 short chapters that explain the rudiments of music, such as the seven notes of the diatonic scale, notes and their values, rests, clefs, rhythm, dynamics, meter, accidentals, key signatures, major and minor modes, and intervals. The second part focuses on articulation and musical symbols used to indicate playing techniques, phrasing, and music writing. It includes explanations of appoggiatura, the mordent, tremolo, syncopation, legato and staccato playing, fermata, and repeat signs. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Author, David R.M. Irving. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 393 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written by Australian musicologist David R. M Irving, <b><i>Colonial Counterpoint</i></b> is a music history of early colonial Manila, covering the period of the trans-Pacific Manila Galleon trade (1569-1815). The book looks into a period in Philippine music history when the Philippines was at the center of complex intercultural encounters that came with globalization or early modernity. It highlights the crucial role that Manila played in the transmission of Western ideologies in this part of Asia, utilizing music as a vehicle for this global flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Irving, a classical violinist specializing in historically informed early music performance, provides an account of the cross-cultural encounters between Spaniards and Filipinos, which helps us understand intercultural dialogues of the time. To frame his discussion, Irving utilizes the musical concepts of &ldquo;counterpoint,&rdquo; &ldquo;enharmonic exchange,&rdquo; and &ldquo;circle of fifths&rdquo; to represent the complex and layered intercultural exchanges in Manila, a colonial port city which hosted many ethnic groups. He grounds his analysis on difficult-to-access historical sources culled from various archives around the world, which together provide a mosaic-like representation of the musical life in Manila of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Chapters 1 and 2, Irving discusses the multiple voices that made up Manila&rsquo;s &ldquo;contrapuntal&ldquo; (aka multicultural) society. He demonstrates in detail the principal voices that constituted the varied social structures and textures of the city composed of Filipinos, Chinese, and Spaniards, as well as to a lesser extent the Japanese, Mexicans, and Africans. According to Irving, the diverse cultural identities of Manila&rsquo;s society proved to be a dynamic element in the transculturation process. Irving supports this with a discussion on the flow of musical commodities brought to the country by the missionaries who converted the natives to the Christian faith. These included sacred printed music books, treatises, and musical instruments for the use of the church. The eventual dissemination of these materials to the native populace led to material cultural exchanges in the Philippines which was part of the Hispanic world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Chapters 3, 4, and 5, Irving explores the early cultural practices of the Filipinos, in particular, their music, dance, language, and poetry as observed by early Spanish historians. These colonial ethnological and organological accounts prove to be illuminating in understanding early Philippine acculturated music practices. Irving emphasizes the significant role of the religious missionaries in the spread of Western music traditions in the archipelago and beyond&mdash;to Guam, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. He provides information on missionaries who were involved in music production and dissemination of Western music during this period. Subsequently, he discusses the eventual appropriation of Western musical ideals that resulted in Spaniards &ldquo;hispanifying&rdquo; the music of the Filipinos or vice versa, Filipinos &ldquo;filipinizing&rdquo; the Spanish foreign. This complex process of the blending of native and western musical styles brought about the irrevocable shift of Filipino musical practices from indigenous traditions to that of syncretic or hybrid transformations. As a result of this <i>mestizaje</i> process, the author contends that the contrapuntal dialogue between the two opposing cultures came to an agreement that led to a formation of a distinct Filipino musical identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Chapters 6, 7, and 8, Irving explores the hierarchical, disciplining musical practices in Spanish Philippine colonial society. Chapters 6 and 7 particularly look into the music rules that governed what music was to be played in the ecclesiastical institutions, although there was some degree of subversion from the local clergy who had some voice in the music administration. In Chapter 8, the author discusses the seasonal and occasional fiestas in which music became a symbol of the colony&rsquo;s subjection to the Spanish empire. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo-Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Reared in the tradition of Western art music in different genres, these composers went into one or several of the following performance media such as the orchestra, chamber, theater, choral, solo voice, solo instrument, and mixed Asian and Western instruments. For the information on composers who lived between 1894 and 1942, this book has been an invaluable music reference for Philippine music and musicians that practiced in modern urban settings in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Different aspects of Philippine musical life and development are illuminated. The interviews provide a view of music training of the composers, their artistic lineage and connection to maestros of regimental bands and orchestras from the colonial past, the types and standards of music-making and performance of their times, and the ideas that inspired them to write their compositions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>, for example, was a concert pianist before World War II, but he later committed himself to find the Filipino in his compositions. Felipe Padilla de Leon Sr was sought out by the Japanese in the early 1940s so he could provide music for the invaders&rsquo; propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book reveals that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\"><strong>Antonino Buenaventura</strong></a> was involved with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a>; that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4156\"><strong>Lucino Sacramento</strong></a> was commissioned to write music for political personalities; and that Rodolfo de Leon appropriated local, easy to find materials for music education in the public schools. The composers&rsquo; narratives are followed by a summary of their works, including honors, awards, and citations that they received. A good number of the composers who were interviewed became National Artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>, Felipe de Leon Sr, Jose Maceda, Lucrecia Kasilag, Antonino Buenaventura, Eliseo Pajaro, Lucio San Pedro, Ramon Santos, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

It is widely read among students of music in the country after its two printings despite its poor scholarly documentation of sources. The book divides the historical narrative into three periods: (1) prehistoric, (2) Spanish, and (3) American occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the discussion of the first period, Santiago extols the aboriginal peoples in the country as endowed with a natural gift for music (1). Citing sources by Pigafetta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a>, and Norberto Romualdez, Santiago enumerates ancient musical instruments such as the music ensemble in Cebu in the first encounter with Europeans, the mouth harp and flute of the Aetas, the bamboo zither, drum, flute, and panpipes of the Tingguian, and the kudyapi<i> </i>of Palawan. Santiago also notes the difference between flat gongs of the North and bossed gongs of the South. Mention is also made about the various species of indigenous lutes (guitars) among non-Muslim tribes in Mindanao. Santiago then surveys the pre-historic folk songs of Filipinos such as <b>tagumpay</b> and <b>sambotani</b>, citing Paterno, whose unreliable writings were later discredited; and the songs of the Tingguian, Aeta, Tagalog, and Ilocano from the writings of Epifanio de los Santos and Wenceslao Retana. A more detailed discussion is given to the <b>comintang</b> of Batangas. The section on primitive dances pertains to the mimetic dances of the Aeta, the Palawan Tagbanua dance used in curing rituals, and the couple dances of the Tingguian, Ilocano, and Tagalog of Batangas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the section on the Spanish period, Santiago discusses the antiphonal chanting in the <b>pabasa</b> (reading/chanting) of the passion text during Lent, the ever popular Filipino love song <b>kundiman</b>, citing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> and Manuel Walls. The assimilated pantomimic dances fandango<i>, </i><b>lulay</b><i>, </i><b>cari&ntilde;osa</b><i>,</i> and <b>surtido</b>, and the couple dances <b>curacha</b> and <b>balitaw</b> are also mentioned. Santiago then discusses literary and musical societies, whose data must have come from Raymundo Banas&rsquo;s book published in 1924, including popular music disseminated through printing, such as Dolores Paterno&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/890\"><strong>La Flor de Manila</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Flower of Manila), Pedro Castaneda&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Mestiza&rdquo; (The Mestiza), and peninsular Ignacio Massaguer&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Bella Filipina&rdquo; (The Beautiful Filipina). These are in the international 19th century hispanic style habanera. Santiago ends the section on the Spanish period by mentioning the contribution of the Augustinian friars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last section on the music during the American occupation, Santiago discusses <b>sarsuwela</b>, an opera by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\"><strong>Ladislao Bonus</strong></a>, recounts the three triumphant American tours (1904, 1909, 1915) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a>, narrates the establishment of the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music in 1916 and follows its history as an institution, notes the rise of recorded music of the 1920s, and writes on the character of the public and private schools which spearheaded the movement for the teaching of folk songs in the elementary and high school curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santiago advocates the development of artistic and cultural nationalism, emphasizing the need for Filipino musicians to assert their identity in the face of Spanish and American cultural imperialism in the islands. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Maceda. Unlike the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a> booklet, which must have also been a lecture given a few months before this work at the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music, this monograph has a scholarly documentation of sources and bespeaks an intellectual who had some background in philology or linguistics and a familiarity with the emerging bibliography of Philippine music up to the 1920s, and even with international practices in museology. It contains valuable and accurate drawings of music instruments that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a> utilized in his lectures on Philippine music in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Following an intuitive classification of instruments based on the music of common practice (i.e., Western music), the book is divided into six sections: (1) Introduction, where sources are presented, (2) Percussion Instruments, a category that is roughly analogous to Hornbostel and Sachs&rsquo;s idiophones, (3) Wind Instruments, aka aerophones, (4) Stringed Instruments, aka chordophones, (5) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Airs, and (6) Closing Remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the percussion category, the instruments like <b>kalutang</b>, <b>bukaka</b>, <b>sulibaw</b>, <b>tugo</b>, <b>ludag</b>, <b>neguet</b>, <b>gansa</b>, <b>kulintangan</b>, <b>gabbang</b>, and <b>subing</b> (the last can be considered a mouth-resonated aerophone) are detailed. Romualdez&rsquo;s digression on the etymology of kulin/tang/an is correct linguistically for the root word /tang/ means the onomatopoeic sound &ldquo;tang, tang, tang.&rdquo; Wind instruments included are <b>bansik</b>, <b>tulali</b>, <b>balinging</b>, <b>lantoy</b>, <b>sahunay</b>, <b>pasiyak</b>, <b>pasiyok</b>, and <b>diwdiw-as</b>. Stringed insturments include <b>pas-ing</b>, which is properly an idiophone because it is more struck than plucked, Karaga (aka Caraga) guitar, <b>buktot</b>, <b>butting</b>, <b>gurimbaw</b>, <b>kudyapi</b>, <b><i>lithuit</i></b>, Bontok violin, and Negrito violin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the section on songs, called Musical Airs, <b>ayegkha</b>, <b>toddanan</b>, <b>pagpag</b>, <b>ayoweng</b>, <b>milling ayoweng</b>, <b>tud-ob</b>, whistle, <b>tangngo</b>, <b>annaoy</b>, <b>kalloye</b>, <b>kadumang</b>, <b>panila</b>, <b>diw diwas</b>, <b>kalusan</b>, and <b>bunkaka</b> are mentioned. Most indigenous terms of instruments called &ldquo;violin&rdquo; and &ldquo;guitar&rdquo; are now known in Maceda&rsquo;s work <b><i>Gongs and Bamboos</i></b>. For vocal music genres, Romualdez&rsquo;s terms need to be checked with post-1950s ethnomusicological works. The Agusan Manobo tud-ob, for example, is a mistake for it is tud-om (the /b/ and /m/ phonemes are bilabial). Despite its shortcomings because systematic musicology did not yet exist in the country, the book remains a remarkable scholarly document in understanding aboriginal Philippine music. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press. 326 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Considered as the most significant publication on traditional Philippine music to date and arguably the most comprehensive of its kind in the world, this book is written by Jose Maceda who pioneered systematic ethnomusicological research in the Philippines. It maps out the distribution of music instruments that are meaningful to 63 indigenous cultural minorities in the Philippine archipelago. It details information on the shape and material of diverse instruments, the manner of playing them, along with brief ethnographic accounts of their performance contexts and social use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Preface, Maceda informs the reader that the book started out as a personal project of collecting music instruments attached to his research in 1952. Through the years, the project evolved into an institutional enterprise, especially with the support of the National Research Council of the Philippines in the 1970s, which allowed his students from the University of the Philippines such as Felipe de Leon Jr, Marialita Yraola, Arsenio Nicolas, Eufracio Abaya, Rosario de Santos, Cynthia Zayas, and Daisy Noval to travel to remote and far-flung areas to do basic research pertinent to ethnomusicology surveys of traditional music in the country. The instruments brought by these students to the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music, with the corresponding field recordings and field reports, accumulated and were then catalogued by Maceda&rsquo;s fellow musicologists Corazon Dioquino and Marialita Yraola. Maceda&rsquo;s friendships with international scholars such as Harold Conklin, Robert Garfias, Renato Rosaldo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Pfeiffer, Alain Martenot, and Nicole Revel, added materials to his collection that are now housed in the UP Center for Ethnomusicology. This most valuable repository of recorded traditional Philippine music in the country also became the source of Maceda&rsquo;s creativity in the realm of new music compositions that later influenced the works of composers Ramon Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>, and La Verne de la Pe&ntilde;a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is a summation of Maceda&rsquo;s effort to understand traditional Philippine music as a positive science. After the Introduction in which he situates the study within layers of Philippine cultures through history, Maceda classifies the instruments into three &ldquo;regional&rdquo; types: those of the Negrito in different parts of the archipelago, including those of the Agta Dumagat (Quezon), Ayta Magbukun (Bataan), Batak Palawan, Ata in Negros Oriental, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>nwa in Agusan del Norte; those used in the Cordillera in Northern Luzon, such as those played by the Balangao, Bontok, Ibaloy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, Isneg, Kalingga, and Kankanaey; and those of Southern Philippines, like those found among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Bukidnon, Hanunuo Buhid, Higaonon, Agusanon Manobo, Tboli, Tiruray, Maguindanao, Maranao, Yakan, and Tausug. A synoptic table matching names of indigenous groups from the region with varying native names of instruments and their instrumental combination ends each chapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the conclusion, Maceda summarizes his findings into abstractions that draw on the notion of &ldquo;dualisms,&rdquo; or what is better known in the research literature as &ldquo;complementarity in difference.&rdquo; This principle is at the heart of Philippine music aesthetics. In the Philippines, the interlocking of oppositional colors and rhythms symbolizes complementarity and harmony, which entail recognizing and giving equal attention to opposing elements rather than annihilating one difference for the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\"><strong>Manila Critics Circle</strong></a>&rsquo;s National Book Award for Music in 1998. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

The four large format choirbooks contain an important collection of liturgical music written on cowhide parchment, bound in carabao hide, and profusely ornamented with illuminated letters in yellow, red, and black, The cantorales are dated 1826-7 and are preserved in the Ecclesiastical Museum of the Baclayon Church. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> cantoral in the museum, entitled <b><i>Kirial de Baclayon</i></b>, is a valuable collection of masses from the Hispanic world. One mass in this book, entitled <b><i>Missa Baclayana</i></b><i>,</i> stands out for it is believed to have been composed locally by an unknown composer. The masses were copied by hand by anonymous <i>escrivientes de solfa</i> (music scribes) of Baclayon Church in the early 19th century. The collection suggests the importance of music in the religious services of the churches in Bohol, and points to the practice of singing and playing on the pipe organ. Of interest is the notation used in the <b><i>Kirial,</i></b> which uses square and diamond neumes on a five-line staff. This pseudo-neumatic notation is metered according to common practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chua divides her study of the cantorales into three parts. The first part presents the historical and cultural context behind the production of the cantorales. The second part provides a detailed analysis of the musical features of the masses and other sacred songs found in the compilation. The last part offers the musical <i>incipits</i> (beginnings) of the songs in the collection, and a transcription into modern notation of five of the masses. A set of photographs of the different churches in Bohol, and the pipe organs found there are included in the book, thus documenting the churches and their instruments before some of them were destroyed in the earthquake that shook the island in late 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book&rsquo;s contribution to Philippine music scholarship lies in its being the first archival musicological analysis in the country that is both paleographic (i.e., it decodes nonconventional music notation) and codicological (i.e., it is a physical examination of a music manuscript). The author&rsquo;s comprehensive structural analysis of the <b><i>Kirial de Baclayon</i></b> in chapter five provides a model for future studies that will deal with music archival materials. Her music analysis includes the examination of elements that unify the five parts of the mass, i.e., use of head motives and paraphrase technique; the investigation of modal scales used; harmonic analysis in the polyphonic parts of the collection; and the inspection of cadences within the pieces with its detailed description and cataloguing of the books and scores found in a local museum&rsquo;s collection. The book is an important reference that advances the study of Philippine church music heritage from the Spanish colonial era. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Published 2007. Author, Raul C. Navarro. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press. 252 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book focuses on the American colonial policies in early 20th century Philippines, which were centered on the public educational system and which aimed to shape the minds of the Filipinos. These policies were congruent to the American colonial government&rsquo;s needs and requirements in administering the new colony. Navarro discusses issues such as the use of the English language, instead of Filipino, in the educational system; the colonial government&rsquo;s historical narrative that emphasized the American contribution to the improvement of the living standards of the people in the colony; and the American control of the economic life in the country, which curtailed the nationalist sentiments of the people, and the eventual commercialization of education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book has four chapters and concentrates on the music introduced to the public schools as an important medium that contributed to the success of the American educational enterprise. Navarro&rsquo;s main argument centers on the reshaping of the native population&rsquo;s minds through the introduction of songs that valued the then prevailing American concept of an ideal life, thus eventually creating and channeling the desire for things American among the Filipinos. Secondary themes include the westernization of Filipino songs in which folksong texts were slanted and mistranslated, and the continuing practice of using western musical forms in the composition of new simple Filipino songs used in the public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book contributes to the understanding of the role of music in the shaping of Philippine society during the American colonial period. It contains data on the educational system under the Americans and examines the texts of the songs and their melodic and harmonic settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition, the book argues for the existence of a strong relationship between music, culture, and politics. To support this argument, Navarro analyzes musical data collected from the period 1898-1935 through the lenses of the sociological and political theories of Foucault and Bourdieu. The Foucauldian concepts such as &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; and &ldquo;docility&rdquo; are used to support the reading on the role of music in the conflict between colonialism and nationalist assertion (i.e., the birth of a hybrid Filipino-ness that is manifest in the &ldquo;docile&rdquo; body of the young who attended the public schools and who embraced American ideas.) Using Bourdieu&rsquo;s concept of the &ldquo;field,&rdquo; Navarro upholds the importance of a music which channeled American culture that then dominated the social and cultural lives of the natives, thereby advancing American colonial objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book won the National Book Award (History Category) given by the National Book Development Board and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\"><strong>Manila Critics Circle</strong></a> in 2008. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

The book is made up of two parts: the first deals with the life and works of Adonay; and the second presents an edition of selected works followed by editor&rsquo;s notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With a foreword by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Summers, the book employs archival research methods, oral history interviews, examination of extant manuscripts, inventory of music sources, and music critical editing. The introduction of the book, written by Elena Rivera-Mirano, discloses the difficulty of writing a biography and inventory of works of a composer who died early in the 20th century and whose only descendant, Marieta Adonay-Cadsawan died in the 1950s, leaving no heir. With no family conserving the Adonay patrimony, Mirano pieces together in her essay all information that her research team had mustered from disparate sources. Mirano&rsquo;s contribution, entitled &ldquo;The Case of Marcelo Adonay, Musician,&rdquo; consists of a short biography of the composer, from his childhood in Pakil to his work as musician in San Agustin in Manila to his death. The essay by Ma. Patricia Brillantes Silvestre contextualizes Adonay&rsquo;s life in the cultural history of Manila, from the 1870s to the 1930s, particularly San Agustin Church in Intramuros. Adonay learned music from that institution, especially from Augustinian friar Arostegui who was a famous Basque musician. Silvestre used newspaper accounts to describe the vibrant cultural life of the city and the surrounding areas, paying close attention to the shifts in Adonay&rsquo;s activities inside and outside the church as he moved through peaceful and revolutionary episodes during his time. The essay by Edna Marcil Martinez is an inventory of the 18 extant works of Adonay, including a listing of lost and attributable works. The inventory is followed by Dioquino&rsquo;s analysis of the form of Adonay&rsquo;s most famous work, <b><i>Peque&ntilde;a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a> Solemne sobre Motivos de la Missa Regia del Canto Gregoriano </i></b>(Short Solemn Mass Using the Motives of the Missa Regia in Plainchant), based on the Macabasco copy version dated 1949. Author Mantaring follows with another formal musical analysis containing a description of the music and history of the extraliturgical devotional practice <b>Rosario de Difunto</b> (Rosary for the Dead) and <b>Gozos</b> (Versicles). Part 1 of the book ends with I&ntilde;igo Vito&rsquo;s reflections on his role as a custodian of local heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rest of the book contains edited works by Adonay, including two settings of the <b><i>Peque&ntilde;a Misa</i></b>. The editorial notes follow this section. A glossary of terms is appended to the end of Part 2. Beautiful colored pictures of churches and other heritage objects are interspersed as section markers in the book. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

The concept of <b>punto</b>, melodic structure, is introduced in this chapter. This concept is important for understanding the construction of other song genres that have different text patterns, different melody-text structuration, and different themes. Chapter 3 talks about the awit, a song in<i> plosa</i> text form. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> is sometimes accompanied by a dance in <b>pandanggo</b> style. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><strong>Kumintang</strong></a></strong></a>, noted by 19th century writers as the &ldquo;canto nacional&rdquo; of the Tagalog is identified as a type of awit from the province of Cumintang or Comintan, a 17th and 18th century name for the province of Batangas. Chapter 4 discusses the pabasa,<i> </i>which is a public chanting of the verses from the<i> pasyon</i>, a verse narrative on the passion and death of Jesus Christ performed during the Lenten season. Chapter 5 is on the <i>subli</i>, a devotional dance accompanied by percussive instruments honoring the image of the Holy Cross of Bauan, Batangas in Maytime. And Chapter 6 speaks of the <b>kanta</b>, the vocal genre that is influenced by the Spanish diatonic music tradition. Kanta also displays contemporary influences not heard in the other forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The author combined archival and secondary research with ethnomusicological field methods. Thus, in addition to surveying available literature and archival sources, she collected data through participant-observation and interviews with the practitioners by living with communities in Southwest Batangas. The research behind the book was undertaken in connection with her doctoral dissertation submitted to the Philippine Studies Program of the University of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a descriptive fashion, the author summarizes her findings in a chart, which identifies the different types of songs, their uses, the details of performance, including time, occasion, performers, and listeners to particular song types, genre structures, thematic materials, performance practices, and appropriate musical expression. She also identifies if they are chant-like or influenced by diatonic music, rhythmic in character or textured (solo, duet, accompanied), and whether they are performed with dance movements or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In line with the structural-functionalist style of ethnomusicogical writing from the 1960s, the work gives voice to the fading traditions of vocal music in Bauan, Batangas. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Raul C.

Author, Raymundo C. Ba&ntilde;as. Manila: Oriental Printing. 131 pages. Second edition titled <b><i>Pilipino Music and Theater</i></b>. Published 1970. Quezon City: Manlapaz Publishing Co. 264 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is the first attempt to write Philippine music history from a local point of view. This short but encyclopedic review of Philippine music written by Raymundo C. Ba&ntilde;as, a public school teacher, is described by P. Rodriguez Versoza in his prologue as the product of a local intellectual&rsquo;s historicist mind, which tried to counteract the excessive attention given to Western art music in foreign music books proliferating in the country in that period. Published in 1924, it was later criticized as faulty and inadequate by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E. Arsenio Manuel</strong></a>, although Manuel himself conceded that it is an indispensable source of information. No Philippine music history publication has been as influential and popular as this book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The author&rsquo;s understanding of the subject matter is gleaned from hard data gathered from newspapers clippings on Philippine music, scores (manuscripts and prints), photographs of musical events, and personal interviews with contemporary musicians of the period. These priceless materials, 3,089 articles collected over many decacdes by Ba&ntilde;as, is proof that the author wanted to write the history of music and theater in the Philippines based on systematic research. His collection of photographs and handwritten notes was sold by the author to the Philippine National Library in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book originally consisted of six chapters. Chapter I, &ldquo;The Early Music of the Filipinos,&rdquo; is about the music practices of the Filipino people, acknowledging both native indigenous and Western-influenced music practices. Chapter II, &ldquo;Various <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Organizations and Institutions,&rdquo; is a description of major groups involved in the production of Western-influenced music in the era. Chapter III, &ldquo;The Tagalog Theater,&rdquo; deals with the development of Filipino theater forms from the earliest times to the indigenized <b>sarsuwela</b> of the early 20th century, with references to known performers, composers, and playwrights. Chapter IV, &ldquo;Famous Filipino Musicians,&rdquo; includes short biographies of the outstanding musical artists of the turn of the 19th century, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3854\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\"><strong>Marcelo Adonay</strong></a></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4021\"><strong>Cayetano Jacobe</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3993\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong></a>, and Pedro B. Navarro Jr. Chapter V, &ldquo;Other Filipino Musicians,&rdquo; discusses the young and emerging musicians, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"><strong>Francisco Buencamino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4077\"><strong>Natalio Mata</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\"><strong>Ladislao Bonus</strong></a>, Jos&eacute; Estella, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>. Chapter VI, &ldquo;Addenda,&rdquo; discusses the orchestra and the conductor, and violin-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In an expanded form, the book was revised and published under the direction of Manlapaz Publishing in 1969 and reprinted in 1975, both under the title <b><i>Pilipino Music and Theater</i></b><i>.</i> The chapter headings and descriptions were changed as follows: I.

Manila: University of Santo Tomas Press. 144 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is a collection of nine essays covering the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, the early American occupation, the life and works of nationalist and traditionalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, and the music of the modernist composers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3938\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3939\"><strong>Jeffrey Ching</strong></a></strong></a>. First presented in professorial chair lectures and in local and international conferences and later published in local journals or as conference proceedings, the book contains narratives on music as artistic composition and/or historical text, highlighting the influence of historical processes on musical creation in Philippine society, and vice versa. Using secondary data published between 1937 and 1998 and distilling information from interviews and primary sources found in archives, these processes are discussed in the first three chapters: &ldquo;Our Spanish Colonial Heritage,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Music of the Philippine Revolution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a>: from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a>s to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\"><strong>Art Song</strong></a>&rdquo; and in the chapters titled &ldquo;Defining the Nationalist Tradition in Philippine Music&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ang Lirisistang Tagalog&rdquo; (The Tagalog Lyricist).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of particular interest in the book are the chapters on &ldquo;Francisco Santiago: The Man, Musician, and His Philosophy,&rdquo; Walter H. Loving and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Modernism in Philippine Music: Lucrecia R. Kasilag in the Forefront,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Understanding the Early Music of Jeffrey Ching.&rdquo; In these sections, the author displays a comprehensive grasp of the material in terms of data and attention to detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essay &ldquo;Francisco Santiago: The Man, Musician and his Philosophy&rdquo; hails Santiago as a pioneering spirit in the development of nationalism in the Philippines. The advancement of the ternary form kundiman from its folk origin to the level of art song was Santiago&rsquo;s main contribution to Filipino culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essay &ldquo;Walter H. Loving and the Philippine Constabulary Band&rdquo; highlights the devotion that Loving showed to music. Loving was assigned to the Philippines just as he started his career as a band conductor in the United States. In bringing the Philippine Constabulary Band to the 1904 St Louis Universal Exposition, Loving was able to present the &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; side of Filipino culture, which countered the Philippines&rsquo; image as a country of &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; dog-eaters and the live exhibition of people from the Northern Cordillera. The essay also narrates the violent death that Loving faced at the hands of a Japanese soldier during the Battle of Manila in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The chapters on composers Kasilag and Ching do not dwell on the historical contexts of their composition but pay tribute to the composers and provide lengthy discussions on their modernist achievements as composers. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Raul C.

Appendices and Bibliography of 130 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is an introductory survey of music in the Philippines written by an American ethnomusicologist, scholar-researcher, and a broadcast journalist who was the director of the School of Music at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a> from 1952 to 1961. Because of its simplicity and comprehensiveness, the book has a wide circulation in secondary schools and remains a dated but indispensable source of information about Philippine music. The book is based on both secondary and primary research and, in writing it, Pfeiffer had to rely on his extensive exposure to the music of the Philippines, especially in the Visayas and Mindanao; read colonial historical accounts and ethnographies current during his time, and solicited contributions and music transcriptions from Filipino scholars and musicians such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4060\"><strong>Elmo Makil</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4003\"><strong>Emmanuel Gregorio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R.

Arsenio Manuel</strong></a>, Felipe Jocano, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>. The book is replete with 31 illustrations of indigenous musical instruments and 112 song texts and instrumental transcriptions of tape recordings from his collection listed at the end of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is divided into sections based on history and geography. Part <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the book is devoted to the indigenous music of some 105 ethnolinguistic groups in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. In Luzon, the most well known vocal genres in Northern Cordillera&mdash;mortuary songs, folk epics, secular songs as well as the popular salidummay&mdash;are discussed. There is also a discussion on the music of the &ldquo;Negritos&rdquo; (Aeta). Northern Luzon music instruments are also described. The <b>ambahan</b> (song poem) of Mindoro is mentioned. In the Visayas, Pfeiffer focuses on the music of the Ati and the Sulod of Panay who have epic singing. In Mindanao, the author discusses the music of the <b>kulintang</b> ensemble as well as other instrumental music of the Maranao, Tausug, and Maguindanao. This is followed by a discussion on hunting songs, narrative songs, love songs, and lullabies among the hill peoples of that island. Excerpts of text transcriptions of some epics of Mindanao and Sulu close this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Part Two, Pfeiffer delves into Filipino folk music of the Christian indigenous groups. In this section, the author describes the Visayan <b>balitaw</b> from Bohol, which is associated with courtship and entertainment. This is followed by a discussion on folk songs performed at specific seasons of the year such as the <b>daygon</b> (Christmas) and the <b>pasyon</b> (Lent) both of which are performed from memory. The rest of Part Two details Filipino folk dances like the <i>itik-itik</i> and <i>tinikling, </i>which are accompanied by a string ensemble called the rondalla or the comparsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last section deals with modern Filipino music, which is the product of the Filipino familiarity with musical practices and types that are Western in origin. This type of music making is found in concert halls, performed by organized music organizations. Performances include the staging of operas and zarzuelas by theatre troupes and supported by rondallas, bands, and orchestras. This acculturated music is also sung and played in churches, music schools and conservatories. It is distributed in films, on the radio and television, and produced by recording companies. A list of Filipino composers, including members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> from Abejo to Tapales who contributed to the development of modern Filipino art music is found in the last part of the book. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Cecilia L.

Author, Manuel Walls y Merino. Madrid: Imp. de M. G. Hernandez. 46 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is a short musical anthology of traditional Philippine folk musical forms written by the Spanish bureaucrat Manuel Walls. The anthology is annotated with historical information on the customs and traditions of Filipinos, in particular the various musical genres practiced in the archipelago in the late 19th century. In the preface, Antonio Pe&ntilde;a y Go&ntilde;i hails Walls as the first to write in detail about the music of the Filipino people as practiced during Walls&rsquo; 10-year stay in the Philippines prior to the 1890s. The book was dedicated to Francisco Asenjo Barbieri of the Royal Spanish Academy, who was known to have encouraged the author to publish this short compendium of Filipino music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is divided into two parts:<i> </i>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1039\"><strong>La Musica Popular de Filipinas</strong></a>&rdquo; (Popular Music in the Philippines) and &ldquo;Cantos y Bailes de Filipinas&rdquo; (Songs and Dances of the Philippines).<i> </i>The first part is a short essay briefly discussing the current state of Philippine music in the 1890s and its important role in the special events of the life of the Filipino community. It refers mostly to Philippine music forms influenced by Spain, i.e., the singing of fandango while sowing rice which the author compares to the practice of the Galician rice harvesters, and the humming of slow songs during the husking of rice which is similar to the singing of Murcia gardeners while gathering mulberry tree leaves. Walls also mentions the presence of musical forms prior to the Spanish colonization, mostly related to dancing, community feasts, and the various native languages. However, he laments the loss of these old customs, writings, and music because no earlier writer had preserved them, except for a few short descriptions of events in historical writing such as those accounts found in Sinibaldo de Mas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a>, Wenceslao Retana, and Fray Juan Francisco de San Antonio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second part of the book enumerates seven Filipino popular musical forms:<i> </i>the <b>pasion</b>; the <b>cumintang</b>; the <b>cundiman</b>; the <b>curacha</b>; the fandango; the jota <b>valenciana</b>; and the <b>balitao</b>. Walls provided short musical excerpts and brief descriptions of each musical form, as well as historical and other interesting facts pertaining to their practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This brief musical account is valuable as it provides a historical description of popular musical genres that developed in the Filipino communities during the Spanish colonial period. If music, as the author says, is the &ldquo;most beautiful manifestation of character,&rdquo; then the book affords a glimpse of the temperaments, dispositions, and the cultural practices of the Filipino people in the late 19th century. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Author, Christi-Anne Castro. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 234 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book investigates the role of music and music performance in identity and nation construction in the Philippines, contextualizing them within the country&rsquo;s major cultural institutions. The author explores these institutions as sites where cultural and political forces contended, conflicted, and negotiated the directions the arts took in the postcolonial 20th century Philippines. The work examines the hybrid cultural productions that were assertions of cultural identity and nationhood in music emanating from metropolitan Manila, the capital city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Castro employs the concepts of modernity, hybridity, and includes theories of nationalism in her work. Central to her interpretation is the concept of the constructed nature of culture and community as well as the power of an imagined community in the formation of national identity. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> basic argument is that shared emblems and symbols are used by the State to foster a sense of national identity and thus further political nationalism. This process then provides the basis for the discussion of a heterogenous range of cultural expressions. The book is a set of case studies examining the narratives of the country&rsquo;s musical organizations and institutions and their contributions to the development of a national consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of the advent and development of modernity in Philippine music, which the author dates to the late 19th century, when Filipino composers began to write music in a western idiom that articulated aspirations towards equality and nationhood among native-born Filipinos. With these musical works, an early sense of collective identity was demonstrated. The succeeding chapters explore the development of a Philippine music culture by studying organizations and institutions that arose during the post colonial period. The author assesses the ideologies projected by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in Chapter 2, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in Chapter 3, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a> in Chapter 4, and the songs of the EDSA Revolution in Chapter 5. A common theme that binds the chapters is the relation of music to politics in Filipino nation building. She uses the archival method and the ethnographic interview to investigate the place of music and musical institutions and organizations in the development of the concept of nation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo-Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It is the only periodical, based on empirical research, that is devoted exclusively to traditional music in the Philippines. The first three volumes, in Filipino, were produced in 1977-1979 by the Philippine Music Documentation Center. This now defunct office was manned by teachers of Philippine music at the UP Department of Musicology (formerly Department of Music Research) under the helm of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>. At its inception, Maceda envisioned <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1041\"><strong>Musika Jornal</strong></a></i></b> as a vehicle for disseminating knowledge on Philippine music to the Filipino masses in the national language. Four years after Maceda&rsquo;s death, the journal was revived by Ramon Santos in 2008, this time in English, constituting volumes 4-9, under the management of the UP Center for Ethnomusicology. The journal features original research on Philippine music, but a good number of articles are about music from other countries or on topics that belong to the fields of music history and popular culture.

Author, Manolete Mora. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press. 233 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book by Mora, an Australian ethnomusicologist of Spanish-Italian descent, is a study of the indigenous music-culture of the Tboli people, in particular, of the multilayered meanings of <b>utom</b>, which is central to Tboli music aesthetic experience. Utom draws in connections between music and nature because the Tboli perceive their music to be a &ldquo;mental image&rdquo; (mimesis) of nature. Mora shows these connections by looking into the myth of the supernatural interpenetrating with the lives of humans and imbuing the &ldquo;magical&rdquo; practices that constitute Tboli understanding of the world. He describes these nature-human relationships as spiritual. By exploring the complex nuances of Tboli utom, Mora reflects on how the Tboli approach the natural and supernatural realms through the use of sounds. For the Tboli, utom may mean an instrumental composition, a melodic or percussive rhythmic line, the non-ornamental notes of a basic musical fragment, a central field, or a segment of music that contains referential motifs. In short, utom is that which links the musical patterns with extramusical referents in nature. According to Mora, &ldquo;as with musical mimesis, utom is not only a mode of representation, an artistic means for representing the world, but also a way of entering into a relationship with that world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first two chapters provide a cultural and historical background on the Tboli people living in the highlands of Southwestern Mindanao. Chapter 1 explains how understanding music and the way it is created is closely linked to the Tboli idea of magic associated with the power emanating from the spirit world. Chapter 2 classifies the various instruments used by the Tboli to perform utom according to their cultural function and gender. Chapter 3 discusses how one can become a musical adept in Tboli, an ability which is normally attributed to supernatural anointment, usually transmitted in dreams. Chapter 4 focuses on musical analysis of the utom&rsquo;s structure, relating each element to its own extramusical referent, coupled with heavy improvisation. Chapter 5 discusses the linguistic, natural, and social referents that connect to the performed utom, reflecting the relationships of people, events, and places, and serving as symbols and icons in the creation of utom. Chapter 6 reiterates that utom reflects how Tboli people relate to one another, and to their surroundings, governed by the principle of reciprocity, wherein mutual recognition and respect of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; is considered paramount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For its emphasis on local knowledge, this book demonstrates how an understanding of Tboli music culture can pave the way to an appreciation of the relationship of aesthetics to ethics in Tboli music, which conveys the social value for respect, moral uprightness, and reciprocity in one&rsquo;s relationships with the &ldquo;Other.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\"><strong>Manila Critics Circle</strong></a>&rsquo;s National Book Award for Folklore in 2005, and was a finalist in the Gintong Aklat Awards for Social Science in 2006. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

The first is an introduction to the Maguindanaon culture of kulintang as practiced in the village of Simuay, Sultan Kudarat, where the author was born and raised. It includes a description of the instruments of the palabunibunyan ensemble, which consists of the <b>kulintang</b>, the <b>agong</b><i>, </i>the <b>dabakan</b>, the <b>gandingan</b>, and the <b>babandir</b>. The performance context of the music, which includes festive activities such as weddings, is also discussed. In order to learn the kulintang, one has to have keen ears and eyes in order to imitate the seasoned performers, or one may opt to go for lessons with an expert player who will expect the student to learn the art by rote. Techniques in playing are also explored, complete with pictures and diagrams. This section concludes with the analysis of the cyclical form of the musical improvisation on the kulintang and an explanation of how one introduces the theme, how one may proceed to different sections through ascending and descending transitions, and finally, how one can end the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section of the book presents the repertoire, which consists of 20 representative pieces from the basic Maguindanaon rhythmic modes&mdash;<b>binalig</b>, <b>sinulog</b>, <b>tidtu</b>, and <b>tagunggo</b>. These pieces are simplified transcriptions crystallized from actual performances. Patterns of the other ensemble instruments for each rhythmic mode are also included. The notation employed is a boxed cipher notation system which has been developed by the author over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book was published to introduce the kulintang to students unfamiliar with Maguindanaon culture. Although there have been criticisms about the simplification of the pieces, the book has been instrumental in teaching an oral tradition in a Western music educational setting. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Janine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Arianne A.

A foreword by Exequiel &ldquo;Lito&rdquo; Molina and an introduction by Angel Pe&ntilde;a are included in the volume. The book proper is divided into three sections: (1) The American <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a> in the Philippines (1898-1946); (2) A Pinoy jazz photo chest from the personal collection of the author; and (3) Twenty-one one-on-one interviews with respected Filipino jazz luminaries both here and overseas.

There is little doubt that the live performances by Filipino musicians did much to awaken a keen appreciation of jazz in Asia. Often criticized as being mere imitators of American jazz luminaries, Filipino jazz musicians like Angel Pe&ntilde;a actually started to shape a Philippine jazz style, composing, and arranging works drawn from a repertoire of Filipino traditional songs and folk music of the late 1930s and early 1940s. The tradition continues to the present day fueled by artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3883\"><strong>Bob Aves</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Section Two contains photos of foreign jazz artists and aficionados who have collaborated with Filipino counterparts. Section Three contains interviews with jazz luminaries like Fred Robles, Bob Aves, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, Johnny Gonzalves, Emil Mijares, Tony Velarde, and John Lesaca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Mabuhay Jazz: Jazz in Postwar Philippines</i></b> is the second volume of the set. It explores the development of jazz music in the country from the 1950s to the 1970s. It is likewise divided into three sections. Section One traces jazz music influences on Filipino musicians from pre- to post-World War II, recounting the diffusion of Latino music, the rise of the Tirso Cruz family of musicians, the resurgence of swing music, the formation of the Philippine musicians&rsquo; guild, the emergence of Bobby Enriquez, and the roles of the University of the Philippines Upsilon Sigma Phi Fraternity, Cafe Indonesia, and the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center in the production and consumption of jazz music in the Philippines. Section Two of the book publishes more rare and valuable photographs from Quirino&rsquo;s collection. Section Three of the book contains thirteen one-on-one Interviews with Filipino musicians like Charmaine Clamor, Mar Dizon, Rudy Regalado, Sandra Lim Viray, and Aya Yuson, some of whom were not active during the period in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Contemporary Jazz in the Philippines: 1970 to the year 2010</i></b> is the last of the three documentary histories. This volume covers the narrative of jazz music in the Philippines from the martial law period to the present. It chronicles the dynamic transformations that jazz idioms in the Philippines had to undergo as its practitioners negotiated the larger political economic situation in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book follows the template of the first two volumes. Section One contains discussions on the fusion of rock and jazz; the Battle of the Bands; the rise of the Greenhills Music Studio; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\"><strong>Lito Molina</strong></a>&rsquo;s Jazz Friends, a group that included among its members the major proponent of jazz in the Philippines, Angel Pe&ntilde;a; the proliferation of jazz clubs and festivals, and the publication of the landmark CDs <b><i>Pinoy Jazz</i></b> I and II. This section also describes the rise of artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4199\"><strong>Tots Tolentino</strong></a>, Tateng Katindig, John Lesaca, Johnny Alegre, Rayben Maigue; the effects of digital technology and travel (exchanges between jazz musicians across state borders); the popularity of jazz as underground music in the 1990s (e.g. the Monk&rsquo;s Inn as performance site); the rise of Filipino jazz on internet sites, and the revivals of the Big Band tradition. Section Two also contains a Pinoy Jazz Photo Chest while Section Three provides another set of one-on-one interviews with jazz practitioners like Colby de la Calzada, Tateng Katindig Jr, Jacqui Magno, Bo Razon Jr, and Rosario Vergara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written by a cultural insider, as Quirino is a practicing jazz musician, these books offer a wealth of information about the networks of jazz music performers, the spaces they inhabit, the agencies and audiences who listen to jazz. All these are a valuable resource for studying jazz as a sociological phenomenon in the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Collis H.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S. Buenconsejo</strong></a>. New York and London: Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is a study of the indigenous music culture of the Agusan Manobo, which includes <b>tud-om</b> (ritual song), dance, and speech. It situates Filipino indigenous expressive culture within a very broad theoretical context, yet one that is near to the Manobo experience. After describing the research area in Chapter 1, the book discusses the Manobo mythology of exchange in Chapter 2 and links this to the Manobo cosmology in Chapter 3. This cosmology is the basis of Manobo ritual, the content of Chapter 4, where tud-om is envoiced. Chapter 5 explores the aesthetics of this song genre in depth. Without exoticizing Manobo music culture, the author argues that myth and ritual have a historical and material basis. He examines the Manobo&rsquo;s reciprocal exchange relationship with nature that teems with &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; and Manobo society&rsquo;s relationship with the &ldquo;invading&rdquo; outsiders, the subject of Chapter 6. These Visayan immigrants displaced the aboriginal Manobo in middle Agusan Valley in Mindanao after the clearing of the Agusan rainforests begun in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional Manobo unaccompanied song tud-om reflects an exchange relationship with nature spirits, and involves the voices of spirit familiars who reveal commonly held truths about wrongdoings in sacrificial rituals in attempts to avert sicknesses and death. The author argues that the face-to-face encounter between persons in a curing ritual where tud-om is sung is an embodiment of meetings between humans and spirits. In these ritualistic interpersonal exchanges, tud-om is a structured performance conveying recognition and respect of the other as required by customary human politeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The next section deals with the coming of the Visayan settlers and how social relations changed in the realm of political economy, resulting in a shared but asymmetrical social world. In this section, Buenconsejo focuses on how Agusan Manobo have adapted to the new material reality of capitalism. This has resulted in the transformation of Manobo mythological thought about exchange and reciprocity. This transformation is manifest in the notion of subjectivity. In the imported political-economic system, the Visayans settlers are regarded as the occupier of the higher position, thus breeding dependency and loss of self-esteem among the Manobo. Yet, as a people whose culture has been deeply embedded in the intricate workings of exchange and reciprocity, the Manobo have negotiated their subordinate position by incorporating the presences of their Visayan &ldquo;patrons&rdquo; in their rituals in the form of spirits that &ldquo;speak&rdquo; and are incarnated in Manobo mediums. The author reiterates that this mimicry is a form of negotiation where basic social order is reinstated through the diplomatic confrontation between the members of marginalized society and the representative dominant culture (Visayan spirit) on the aesthetic level. As such, hostile social relations are restrained, helping to strengthen the moral foundations of equality and mutuality that aid in returning a basic social order to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book was published as part of the Routledge series Current Research in Ethnomusicology: Outstanding Dissertations.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\"><strong>Ramon P. Santos</strong></a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press. 215 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To date, this is the only book that offers a deep formal and critical analysis of modern and postmodern art music in Philippine scholarship. It deals with the music of two major Filipino composers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>, two orally-transmitted indigenous genres, Ibaloy <b>b&rsquo;diw</b> and Maranao <b>bayok</b>, and the institutional early history of the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music. Written by a composer-scholar equipped to tackle complex music analysis in well-written prose, the book evaluates the musical styles of the genres selected in their proper historical and cultural contexts, thus shedding light on crucial ideas (e.g., classicism, lyricism, modernism, postcolonialism) that are embedded in the musical works and that speak of the uniqueness of the individual creative agencies who craft music deemed &ldquo;Filipino.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chapter 1, which is given the most weight in terms of treatment, is about the music of the dean of Filipino composers, Nicanor Abelardo, considered the founder of music modernism in the Philippines. In this chapter, Santos writes a compelling account of the styles of some of Abelardo&rsquo;s best academic compositions from 1921, the year of Abelardo&rsquo;s graduation from the composition program of the UP Conservatory of Music, to 1931, the year when Abelardo graduated from the Chicago <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> College. In a masterful example of analysis that can come only from a music critic who is also a composer, Santos discusses the dramatic lyricism of Abelardo&rsquo;s art kundiman, the classicism of his abstract instrumental music that employs sophisticated harmonic explorations, and the experimentation in &ldquo;atonal&rdquo; and expressionist idioms found in works written for Abelardo&rsquo;s degree in Chicago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chapter 2 is about two well-known and contrasting indigenous music genres: the improvised, antiphonal b&rsquo;diw of male-female elders in Ibaloi society and the solo lyrical song bayok of the Maranao. In this chapter, Santos elaborates on the improvisatory nature of the formal musical processes in both b&rsquo;diw and bayok in their ethnographic contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chapter 3 deals with the subversive nature of Jose Maceda&rsquo;s compositions. In contrast to Abelardo who was a progressive modernist composer of the early 20th century who wrote within the European neo-classical musical canon, Maceda, a postmodernist, transgressed all there was in conventional Western music. Ironically, no matter how radical Maceda was in his works, his initial ideas were in fact from the same Western root, albeit from the dissenting avant-garde tradition of the 1950s (musique concrete, Varese, Xenaxis). Santos chronicles the metamorphosis in Maceda&rsquo;s ouvres from 1960s to 1990s, from the aesthetics of massed sounds of Maceda&rsquo;s early period to the later deconstructionist works, which utilized conventional concert instruments. According to Santos, Maceda&rsquo;s works are embodiments of a philosophy grounded in music as a humane, collective enterprise that contested its Western parentage, for Maceda&rsquo;s works more importantly embody Asian concepts of drone and melody, infinity in time, and indeterminacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last essay is an institutional history of the UP Conservatory of Music in its early years, particularly its role in fostering nationalism through Filipino folk song and dance research and publications in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\"><strong>Manila Critics Circle</strong></a>&rsquo;s National Book Award for Music in 2005. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.
