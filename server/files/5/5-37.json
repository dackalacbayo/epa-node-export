Filipino artisans copied the Spanish guitar and bandurria during the Spanish colonial era. These two instruments, combined with several other new instruments, became the base of the Philippine <b>rondalla</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Besides the regular bandurria, there is the <b>piccolo bandurria</b>. Shaped like a teardrop, it has a hole in the middle and a neck that connects the strings from the body to the tuning pegs. Both the regular bandurria and the piccolo bandurria have six sets of strings tuned in the intervals of fourths, the first highest string being G, followed by D, A, E, B, and F#. The doubling or tripling of strings produces a fuller sound and strengthens the tones. Starting from G, each course has strings grouped in 3-3-3-2-2-1. The piccolo bandurria resembles the standard bandurria, but is smaller and tuned an octave higher. It plays all forms of variations and ornamental and coloratura passages, and sometimes carries the main melody together with the standard bandurria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The standard bandurria plays the main melody, similar to the role of the violin, clarinet, or the trumpet in the orchestra. In the absence of the piccolo bandurria, it also plays ornamental and virtuoso passages. Both instruments are played with a plectrum, the speed of the up and down stroke of the right hand producing the characteristic vibrating sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the inclusion of the solo bandurria category in the National Music Competitions for Young Artists in 1976, solo bandurria artists emerged. These include Elaine Espejo Cajucom, Leonor Llorin, Victoria Dalaza, Niki Zen Obmasca, and Edna Culig. Under the baton of Rose Puertollano, Culig performed <b><i>Czardas</i></b> by Vittorio Monti with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> at the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> in 1978. Culig also produced <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/899\"><strong>Hatinggabi</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Midnight), 1993<i>, </i>the first classical bandurria album with guitar and piano accompaniments. Together with classical guitarist Gerry Duran, her rendition of &ldquo;Curacha&rdquo;<i> </i>in the album, a Visayan traditional dance piece, won<i> </i>for Bravo Filipino<i> </i>in 2004 the Best Cultural Show on Air at the Philippine Catholic Mass Media Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A document that provides a comprehensive and in-depth study of the instrument is Culig&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s thesis, &ldquo;The Philippine Bandurria: Its Artistic and Educational Possibilities,&rdquo; 1995. Aspects covered in the paper include the bandurria&rsquo;s historical background, construction, literature, graded repertoire (etudes and pieces), playing techniques (traditional and nontraditional), and some recommendations.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Edna Marcil M.

This bamboo tube is 40-80 cm in length and 3-6 cm in diameter, with a handle on one end and with the other half sliced away to form two elongated tongues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is played by grasping the handle with one hand and striking the instrument&rsquo;s tongues against the lower palm of the opposite hand. The tongues are actually two slits that, when struck, vibrate and create a buzzing sound whose pitch is altered when a small hole in the handle is either covered with the thumb or left open. In northern Luzon, the buzzer is known by various names: Kalinga and Isneg <b>bungkaka</b>;<i> </i>Kalinga <b>balingbing</b><i> </i>and <b>ubbeng</b>;<i> </i>Bontok <b>avakkaw</b>;<i> </i>Tinguian and Isneg <b>bilbil</b>; Isneg <b>pahinghing</b>,<i> </i><b>patuaw</b>,<i> </i>and <b>paginggeng</b>;<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> <b>pakgong</b>;<i> </i>Kankanay <b>pewpew</b>;<i> </i>Ibaloy <b>pakkung</b>;<i> </i>Iwak <b>pagkong</b>;<i> </i>and Yogad <b>tallelet</b>.<i> </i>In some areas like southern Kalinga and Isabela, the sound of the instrument is believed to drive away evil spirits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bamboo buzzer is commonly played in an ensemble of six. All players use a single rhythmic pattern but have different entry points so that patterns interlock. Among northern Kalinga children, the buzzer is used as a toy and may be played singly or in an ensemble and simulates the rhythmic patterns of other Kalinga instruments. The bamboo buzzer of the Iwak is played solo or in group unison, and is used by women to ease their fatigue as they go to the fields. The Ibaloy pakkung is played singly, producing long sustained sounds with varying overtones. The Yogad of Isabela use bamboo buzzers of varying pitches, as in <b>tanggik</b><i> </i>(soprano), <b>kangkang</b><i> </i>(alto), <b>belber</b> (baritone), and <b>baho</b><i> </i>(bass). A cog-wheel type of bamboo rattle called <b>karalat</b><i> </i>and a metal triangle called <b>bukingking</b><i> </i>complete the tallelet ensemble, which plays during the Holy Week.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

Philippine drums, which are played at festive celebrations, processions, and rituals, are of many varieties, shapes, and sizes. Drums are often made of wood, while drumheads consist of goat, deer, cow, pig, or reptile skin. They are attached to the body and tightened through different techniques of lacing using rattan and string. Other drumheads use hoops made of wood and padded rattan. Only very few Philippine drums have the skin nailed permanently to the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A drum&rsquo;s shape can be <b>cylindrical</b>, <b>conical</b>, <b>barrel</b>, <b>kettle</b>, or <b>goblet</b>. Specific drum types tend to be common to a group of people (e.g., short conical drums among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> or goblet-shaped drums among the Maranao).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A cylindrical drum has two drumheads of the same diameter. Single-headed cylindrical drums include the <b>gimbal</b><i> </i>of the Tagbanua, Batak, Palawan, Ata, Higaonon, Mandaya, and Mansaka peoples, and the <b>talibung</b><i> </i>of the Zambales Aeta. Examples of double-headed cylindrical drums are the Tinguian <b>tambol</b>;<i> </i>the Sama Dilaut (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>), Ilonggo, Maguindanao, Sama, Tausug, Higaonon, and Tboli <b>tambul</b>;<i> </i>the Sama Dilaut, Maranao, Sama, and Tausug <b>gandang</b>; the Manobo <b>gibba</b>; the Agusanon-Manobo <b>gimba</b> or <b>gimbe</b>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> <b>gimbar</b>; the Cuyunon, Ilonggo, and Tagbanua <b>tambor</b>; and the Blaan <b>tanongong</b>, <b>tnanggong</b>, or <b>tiyongon</b>. Other examples of double-headed cylindrical drums are the bass drum <b>bombo</b> of the Cebuano, Ilocano, and Tagalog, often played in town bands; the <b>redublante</b> or snare-type drum of the Cuyunon and Tagbanua; and the Sama <b>tambol</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A conical drum has a wider upper end, which is covered with skin; its bottom is open and narrower. Examples are the Ifugao <b>libbit</b><i> </i>and the long tapered drum <b>ludag</b><i> </i>of the Isneg or Apayao. An indigenous kettledrum-type of drum is the bowl-shaped Maguindanao <b>dabakan</b>.<i> </i>The goblet-shaped drum is easily identified by its pedestal, which supports the instrument&rsquo;s bowl-shaped body; the Maranao <b>dabakan</b>, also called <b>dadabuan</b>,<i> </i>is typical, as is the Tagalog <b>tugtugan</b>,<i> </i>which accompanies the <i>subli </i>dance of Batangas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine drums are played in various ways. Most common is the use of two sticks to sound the instrument, as with the dabakan, tambol, gibba, and tugtugan.<i> </i>Other drums are struck with bare hands, as with the Ibaloy <b>sulibaw</b><i> </i>and <b>gimbal</b>, and the libbit. The combination of hand-and-stick playing technique is used for the ludag, while a padded mallet is used for bombo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The drums usually provide rhythmic support in an ensemble. In Southeast Asia, the drum is played with various gongs, such as the <b>gangsa</b> (flat gong) ensemble of the Ibaloy, Iwak, Tinguian, and Isneg of the Cordillera, and the kulintang<i> </i>or bossed gong ensembles of Mindanao. Drums may also be used together with flutes, as with the Cuyunon <b>tipanu </b>ensemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">Log drums include the Blaan <b>amdel</b> or <b>amdol</b>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>gan and Tagakaolo <b>edel</b>, the Bagobo <b>odol</b>, the Blaan <b>tlodol</b>, and the Sama Dilaut (Badjao), Tausug, and Yakan <b>tuntungan</b>.

The one-stringed fiddle is native to the Blaan, Bukidnon, Manobo, Tagakaolo, Tboli, and Subanon of Mindanao. The instrument usually has a coconut shell for a body, which is covered with leaves, bark, reptile skin, or thin wood. It has a long slender bamboo neck to which a peg is attached for tightening the hemp string. The instrument&rsquo;s bow is made of bamboo and hemp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Examples of one-stringed fiddles are the Bukidnon and Manobo <b>dayoray</b>,<i> </i><b>dayuray</b>,<i> </i>and <b>dayuday</b>;<i> </i>the Bukidnon <b>dioray</b>;<i> </i>the Blaan and Manobo <b>duwagey</b>; the Blaan and Tagakaolo <b>duwagay</b>;<i> </i>the Manobo <b>kogut</b>;<i> </i>the Agusanon-Manobo <b>cogot</b><i> </i>and <b>kugot</b>;<i> </i>the Ata <b>kagot</b>;<i> </i>the Tboli <b>dwagey</b>;<i> </i>and the Subanon <b>kutet</b>.<i> </i>Usually played solo by women for entertainment, the instrument is placed on the lap at a vertical but slightly tilted position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three-stringed fiddles are the Bugkalot (Ilongot) <b>litlit</b> and <b>gisada</b>, and the Hanunuo and Buhid <b>gitgit</b>.

Examples are Balangaw <b>kallaleng</b>;<i> </i>Kalinga <b>ullimong</b><i> </i>and <b>olimong</b>;<i> </i>Ifugao <b>ungiyong</b>,<i> </i><b>pitu</b>,<i> </i>and <b>tappang</b>;<i> </i>and Bontok <b>teptepew</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A ring flute has a thin band made of rattan, bamboo, or leaf wrapped around the blowing hole. This is found in southern Philippines, such as the Blaan, Jama Mapun, Maguindanao, Mangguangan, Palawan, Sama, Tausug, Tiruray, and Yakan <b>suling</b>. Other types of ring flutes are Palawan <b>beberak</b>;<i> </i>Higaonon <b>dagoyong</b>;<i> </i>Subanon <b>glantoy</b>;<i> </i>Blaan and Ata <b>falandag</b>,<i> </i><b>pulundag</b>;<i> </i>Maranao <b>insi</b>;<i> </i>Bukidnon <b>kinsi</b>,<i> </i><b>kunsi</b>;<i> </i>Ata <b>lantey</b>,<i> </i><b>lantoy</b>,<i> </i><b>lantuy</b>;<i> </i>Ilonggo <b>plawta</b>;<i> </i>Agusanon-Manobo <b>poluypoy</b>;<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a> and Sama <b>pulaw</b>;<i> </i>Agusanon-Manobo <b>saguysuy</b>;<i> </i>Tboli <b>seleli</b>,<i> </i><b>sloli</b>;<i> </i>Subanon <b>thulalai</b>;<i> </i>Mangguangan <b>tiwali</b>;<i> </i>and Bukidnon <b>tompuy</b>,<i> </i><b>tumpuy</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another type is the transverse flute, which is borrowed from the West as a result of Spanish colonial contacts, such as the Ilonggo and Cebuano <b>flauta</b>;<i> </i>Waray <b>plahuta</b>; Manobo Cotabato <b>plawta</b>,<i> </i><b>plauta</b>;<i> </i>Batak, Cuyunon, and Tagbanua <b>tipanu</b>;<i> </i>and Sulod <b>tulale</b>,<i> </i><b>tulali</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bontok and Tinguian have a panpipe called <b>diwdiw-as</b>, which consists of varying sizes of open pipes tied together. This type of panpipe is disappearing and is also known as <b>dadayu</b> among the Balangaw and <b>diw-as</b> among the Kalinga and Kankanaey. It is different from the Kalinga <b>sagaypo</b>, <b>saggeypo</b>, <b>saysay-op</b>, and the Bontok <b>sapsap-ok</b> or <b>sagay-op</b>, which is ensemble music made of closed pipes blown individually in an interlocking manner by three or more musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The flutes are usually made by the players themselves who use indigenous ways of determining tube lengths and finger-hole distances. In some cases, the basic unit of measurement is the bamboo tube&rsquo;s circumference or finger width and length. A bamboo tube may be balanced to approximate its center and determine the position of the thumbhole. According to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> (1990), the placement of hole stops in indigenous Philippine flutes reveals an Asian theory of gapped scales that is not based on the usual Pythagorean or ancient Chinese cycle of fifths but on a concept of ratio and proportion with the octave as a fundamental reference point that is produced by the thumbhole. The flutes are commonly played solo by men to court women, and for general entertainment.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

The earliest <b>bronze drums</b> date from around late third to early second millennium BCE in a region known as Dong Son, which covers present-day North Vietnam, Laos, and Yunnan in Southern China. This bronze instrument spread to as far as places in Java Sea in ancient times, but no extant evidence of bronze drum has ever been found in the Philippine archipelago to date. What bronze instrument took root in the islands was the <b>bronze gong</b>, which came in various sizes and shapes, either flat or with a central boss or knob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Bossed gongs</b> are predominant in Southeast Asia. They differ in diameter, shape, and depth of their rims, and the manner in which they are played. In the Philippines, they are found in Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu archipelago, which participated in millennia-old maritime trade network with Borneo (Brunei and Kalimantan), Sumatra, Melaka, and even as far South as Java. <b>Flat gongs</b>, along with bossed gongs, are found in the hills of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Central Vietnam, some parts of Indonesia, and northern Philippines, and they came to the Philippine islands beginning the sixth century from China, indirectly passing through trading ports of Continental Southeast Asia, west of Nusantara, like Funan, Champa, and Melaka, before they reached the other side in Brunei or Jolo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In northern Philippines, flat gongs made of bronze, brass, or iron are found among the Isneg, Tinguian, Kalinga, Bontok, Ibaloy, Kankanaey, Gaddang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, and Bugkalot (Ilongot), for whom gong playing is part of peace-pact gatherings, marriages, prestige ceremonies, feasts, or rituals. The instruments are highly valued as family heirlooms, especially those made of bronze alloy, and their owners enjoy great prestige.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The flat gongs are called <b>gangsa</b> by the Bontok, Ibaloy, Bugkalot, and Kalinga. Other terms are <b>cangsa </b>(Bontok), <b>gangha</b> (Ifugao), <b>hansa</b> (Isneg), <b>pahyuk</b> (Bugkalot), and <b>palay-an</b> or <b>palay</b> (Ayta Magbukun). The word &ldquo;gangsa&rdquo; comes from the Sanskrit word <i>kansa</i> or <i>kangsa</i>, which means &ldquo;metal bell&rdquo; or &ldquo;brass alloy&rdquo; and has cognates for the same type of instrument called <b>khan</b> or <b>khenha</b> among the Edde of Central Vietnam or gangsa in old Javanese and Malay. The gongs vary in size, averaging about 30 cm in diameter with a rim depth of about 5 cm. Only males play gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gongs are either struck with a stick or slapped with the hands. The Kalinga call the style of playing a gong using a stick <b>pattong</b>: the gong is suspended from a V-shaped bone or wooden handle held in the left hand while the right hand strikes the gong with the stick. If played <b>topayya </b>style, it is secured to the player&rsquo;s loincloth or belt, lain across the lap that acts as a resonator, struck by the left palm at the center to create a ringing sound, struck similarly by the palm then slapped strongly by a hand that then slides to the gong&rsquo;s outer edge. The Tinguian call this style <b>sinuklit</b>, while the Bontok call it <b>takik</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Gangsa</b> are played in an ensemble, the number of the gongs and the combinations with other instruments varying from group to group as well as within one group. The Kalinga and Tinguian topayya ensemble consists of six gangsa of graduated sizes. The first four gongs&mdash;<b>balbal</b>, <b>salbat</b>,<b> katlo</b>,<b> </b>and <b>kapat</b>&mdash;produce identical rhythmic patterns in staggered entries. The <b>pokpok </b>or fifth gong makes a repeated two-tone drone over which the <b>anungos </b>(sixth gong) plays a freer rhythmic pattern. The basic musical element of drone and melody may be applied to this contrapuntal structure, with the four gongs in canon supplying the melody and the two gongs the drone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalinga have a six-gong ensemble played in <b>palook </b>or <b>pattong</b> (also <b>pattung</b>)<b> </b>style while dancing. Holding the gong handles in the left hand, the performers dance in a line in alternate steps without moving from their place, all the while striking the inside of the gong with a stick. Then the lead man begins moving, followed by the rest of the gong-bearing men, who form long curving lines, stoop, sway, and crouch while holding the gongs close to, then away from the body. They play two basic contrasting rhythms called <b>dawdaw </b>and <b>sapi </b>in a fast tempo. Soon, the women join the dance with outstretched arms, their feet moving to the gong rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Ibaloy <b>sulibaw </b>ensemble combines two gangsa with a pair of iron bars called <b>palas </b>and two conical drums, the smaller of which is called the sulibaw (76 cm tall) and the larger <b>kimbal </b>(80 cm tall). These narrow conical drums are made of hollowed-out logs with a deerskin head. At their biggest bulge they measure about 20 cm in diameter. The drums are slanted beside the male performer who is seated on a low stone or log. Both drums are struck with palms, sounding a continuous rhythmic drone against which the two gongs play individual rhythmic patterns in counterpoint. The gongs, <b>kalsa </b>and <b>pinsak</b>,<b> </b>are struck on the flat surface. The kalsa plays a reiterated rhythm against which the pinsak weaves an improvisatory rhythm. The palas are struck against each other in a continuous fast beat. The ensemble is played during the <b>peshit</b>, which celebrates a peace pact between warring groups, honors dead ancestors, or is sponsored by elders for community celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Karao have an activity similar to the Ibaloy peshit called <b>babeng</b>.<b> </b>During this festivity, women dance the <b>tinebtebak </b>accompanied by a seven-gong ensemble also called <b>tinebtebak </b>or <b>itundak</b>.<b> </b>The gongs&mdash;<b>saleksek</b>, <b>meleok 1</b>,<b> meleok 2</b>,<b> banengbeng</b>, <b>sitot 1</b>,<b> sitot 2</b>,<b> </b>and <b>dulon</b>&mdash;are struck on the inner side with a cloth-padded stick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalinga and Tinguian have smaller gongs-and-drum ensembles. The <b>inila-ud </b>is made up of three gongs called <b>patpat</b>,<b> kebang</b>,<b> </b>and <b>sapul</b>,<b> </b>and a drum or <b>tambul</b>.<b> </b>The gongs are laid on the players&rsquo; laps and struck with a stick held in the left hand, while the right palm taps a counter-rhythm. The <b>pinala-iyan </b>ensemble is comprised of four gongs called the <b>talugutok</b>, <b>saliksik</b>,<b> pawok</b>,<b> </b>and pattong, and a drum or tambul. The Ibaloy <b>kulimbet </b>ensemble is made up of two long drums and a gong, and plays during a curing ceremony. The Isneg ensemble of <b>hansa </b>(two gongs) and a <b>ludag</b> (conical drum) accompanies the <i>tabok</i><b> </b>and<b> </b><i>talip</i><b> </b>dances. The pairing of the drum and gong is a musical feature that unifies gong traditions of Northern, Central, and Southern Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wide distribution of bossed gongs in both inland and coastal Central and Southern Philippines links this region to the larger cultural area that includes Central Vietnam, Sabah, Brunei, Kalimantan, and Sumatra. Central and Southern Philippine bossed gongs are of three types. The <b>agung</b>,<b> </b>with their deep, slightly turned-in rims, are hung on wooden frames or from house rafters, or if small enough, held in the hand. They are played singly, in groups, or as part of larger ensembles. They are also called <b>pulakan </b>(Tausug, Sama), <b>buahan</b> (Tausug), <b>bua </b>(Sama), <b>lebua </b>and <b>pengegungan </b>(Yakan). The <b>gandingan </b>have narrower, very slightly turned-in rims, and their bosses are not as prominent as the agung&rsquo;s. They are suspended and played in ensembles or singly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gongs-in-a-row, graduated bossed gongs laid in a row on a wooden frame or mat, is called <b>kulintang</b>, which plays an important soloistic role in gong ensembles. The name of the instrument is derived from the word <i>tang</i>, which means sound. The Maguindanao, Maranao, and Sama kulintang have eight gongs, the Tausug eight to eleven, and the Yakan five to seven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kulintang (Maguindanao, Maranao) or <b>kulintangan </b>(Tausug, Sama, Yakan) is the solo instrument in large ensembles that include suspended gongs and drums. The suspended gongs are classified according to the sounds they produce. The <b>babendil </b>(Maguindanao, Yakan) or <b>babandir </b>(Maranao), which are about 20 cm in diameter and have a narrow, very slightly turned-in rims, make a thin sound when struck on the rim with a bamboo stick. The one or two suspended agung produce stopped, muffled sounds. The Maguindanao and Maranao suspended gandingan generally produce freely vibrating sounds. The Tausug, Sama, and Yakan strike the agung in such a way that they vibrate freely. When used in this manner, the agung are called <b>tunggalan </b>(Tausug), <b>tamuk </b>(Sama), or <b>lerukan</b> (Yakan). Drums called <b>debakan </b>or <b>dabakan </b>(Maguindanao), <b>dadabuan </b>(Maranao), or <b>tambul </b>(Sama) set the rhythmic patterns. The Yakan use a piece of split bamboo called <b>gandang </b>in lieu of the drum. The last kulintang gong is played by another performer who strikes a punctuating ostinato and is called <b>tungtung </b>(Tausug), <b>solembat</b> (Sama), and <b>nulanting </b>(Yakan). Mindanao highlanders play suspended agung, singly or combined with drums or other instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> del Sur use suspended agung called <b>gagung</b>.<b> </b>Used singly, the gagung summons people from the fields, communicates messages during courtship, accompanies dancing, or announces a death. The Subanon low-bossed, narrow-rimmed gandingan is used only in a sacred ritual, the <b>megayap</b>,<b> </b>where it is combined with a gagung and a pair of porcelain bowls. The <b>babandil</b> is larger than the gandingan, with a wider turned-in rim. The three varieties of gongs are used in different combinations to form ensembles that are performed during weddings and other festive occasions or <b>beklog</b>.<b> </b>The gandingan ensemble is made up of a large gong called <b>gagung</b> <b>pon</b>,<b> </b>a babandil,<b> </b>and a pair of porcelain bowls called <b>pinggan</b>.<b> </b>The <b>thanggunggu </b>ensemble uses two gagung: the large gagung pon and any of the smaller gagung called <b>gagung thumbaga </b>or <b>burnay</b>,<b> gagung tiyanggi</b> or <b>shalabon </b>or <b>gagung galang</b>.<b> </b>Three gagung&mdash;a gagung pon and a pair of smaller gagung&mdash;comprise the <b>gandang-gandang </b>ensemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Zamboanga del Norte, two performers play the gagung&mdash;one striking the boss, the other the rim&mdash;to accompany the <i>sabay</i><b> </b>dance. Occasionally, three performers play one gagung: using a cloth-padded mallet, one strikes the boss, one the gong&rsquo;s face, and one the rim with two bamboo sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bukidnon play one agung to accompany the <i>saut</i>,<b> </b>a dance depicting the war between the Magahat and the eventually victorious Bukidnon. It also announces the arrival of the groom&rsquo;s party during a wedding. At festivities that celebrate a bountiful harvest, dancers wearing cascabels on their legs and ankles are accompanied by an agung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The south Cotabato Blaan agung, <b>salmagi</b>,<b> </b>are played by men for entertainment, particularly during wedding festivities. Three salmagi are played in ensemble. Two are hung next to each other; the third is placed apart and played by striking the boss with a <b>bagol</b>,<b> </b>a padded beater, and dampening the vibrations by holding the rim or <b>falnimak</b>.<b> </b>The second performer, seated on the floor, plays the pair of salmagi using a bagol held in each hand and assisted by a third person who keeps the gongs from swaying against each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Small, light gongs with narrow rims, which produce more delicate sounds, are used by the Tiruray in an ensemble of five agung. The smallest gong is called <b>segarun</b>.<b> </b>It leads the music with its steady, regular rhythm. The <b>manitad</b>,<b> maning gula</b>,<b> tumabuk</b>,<b> </b>and <b>tumuktuk </b>follow with their own rhythmic patterns. The ensemble is played for visitors during community gatherings or festive occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Palawan, a gong ensemble called <b>basal </b>performs during feasts and ceremonies. It is made up of at least four instruments: a drum or <b>gimbal</b>;<b> </b>two small suspended gongs with turned-in rims called <b>sanang</b>; and a large, wide-rimmed, high-bossed agung. Sometimes one or two more agung are added to the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are also ensembles of 6-11 hanging melody gongs called <b>tagunggu </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Bukidnon, Tagakaolo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>gan) or <b>kulintangan </b>(Manobo Cotabato). The melody gongs are hung on ropes in pyramidal order, with the smaller- and higher-pitched gongs near the top. The Manobo Cotabato kulintangan uses eight graduated bossed gongs hung from a bamboo frame and held in place by ropes. The gongs, from highest to lowest pitch, are called <b>pagunsaran</b>,<b> paantuhan</b>, <b>paumbahan</b>,<b> ahongan</b>,<b> a-gungan</b>,<b> pat-tulos</b>,<b> pa-apos</b>, and <b>bandilan</b>.<b> </b>A melody player strikes the seven higher-pitched gongs with one beater, and a drone player strikes a continuous, even beat on the bandilan. A cylindrical, wooden drum, <b>gib-ba</b>,<b> </b>completes the ensemble. The melody player occasionally leaves the instrument to dance in small steps and with open arms to the rhythm of the drone-gong player. The ensemble is played exclusively for entertainment during large community feasts where the entire village dances to the music of the gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bagobo <b>tagunggo </b>or <b>tagonggo</b>,<b> </b>with its 9-11 gongs, is also played by a melody and a drone player. The ensemble may be complemented with one or two drums. The Tagakaolo tagunggo utilizes six gongs: five melody gongs and one drone gong called <b>patawaganan</b>. Drone and melody, with their diverse and subtle permutations, also underlie gong music in the northern Philippines. In the Kalinga flat-gong ensemble, the drone is played with the <b>pokpok </b>and ornamented with improvisatory rhythms on the <i>anungos</i><b> </b>while the <i>balbal</i>,<b> </b><i>salbat</i>,<b> </b><i>katlo</i>,<b> </b>and <i>kapat</i><b> </b>gongs provide a melody of staggered but uniform rhythmic patterns. In the kulintang ensemble of the Maguindanao, melody is produced by the kulintang, and various drones with different timbral colors played on the dabakan, gandingan, and babandir.<b> </b>The steady, unchanging pattern on the dabakan and babandir mingle with the stopped and freely vibrating colors of the agung and gandingan. Drone and melody are also manifest in the Subanon tagunggo or hanging-gong ensembles, as well as in smaller ensembles where the drone is known as <b>dlabu</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An infinite variety of timbral colors is created by the gongs&rsquo; size, shape, and more importantly, the manner in which they are played. Ringing, stopped, shrill, pitched, and unpitched sounds are juxtaposed to create a rich dynamic texture.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

It normally has frets along the fingerboard, six strings, and a wooden resonating chamber with sidewalls curving inward, and a flat back. At the center of its face or table (the front part) is a hole from which sound produced within the resonating chamber is projected. Underneath the table are several pieces of spruce supports called struts, which contribute greatly to the quality of the guitar&rsquo;s sound. The strings are connected from one end by a bridge (usually of rosewood) to the tuning pegs at the upper end of the neck. Nineteen frets of silver or nickle mark the guitar&rsquo;s total range of three-and-a-half octaves. The classical guitar&rsquo;s strings are a combination of nylon strands with fine metal spun around it. The modern-day folk guitar makes use of metal for all strings. The guitar is tuned according to the country standard, starting from the lowest to the highest: E, A, D, G, B, and E.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The guitar is among the most popular instruments in the Philippines. Introduced by the Spanish colonizers, the guitar is usually used to accompany a singer and is often heard at most social gatherings, neighborhood hangouts, and even in remote barrios where music making is the main form of leisure. The guitar is also prominent in the <b>rondalla</b>, providing chordal and rhythmic accompaniment. The center of today&rsquo;s guitar-making industry are in Guagua, Pampanga, and Lapu-Lapu City, Mactan Island in Cebu where entry-level guitars to &ldquo;export quality&rdquo; concert guitars are made with various kinds of imported woods, such as rosewood, cedar, and spruce, as well as local wood like <i>manga</i>, almon, almaciga, <i>lanete</i>, kalantas, <i>kamagong</i>, acacia, and lauan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most famous guitar makers in Metro Manila is Armando Derecho. He is known for his concert-level guitars made with European spruce and Indian rosewood. There are also quality classical guitars made by <b>luthiers</b> from Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, and in Dipolog City, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> del Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Variants include the <b>buktot</b>, a small guitar with four strings, its resonator made of coconut shell to which the neck is attached. The circular soundboard has a semicircular hole in the center. <b>Miniature guitars</b> are also called <b>ukelele</b>, which have four strings and five frets. Those whose bodies are made of one, two, or even three coconut shells are also called <b>cocolele</b>. Although most Filipinos learn to play the guitar informally, some learn classical guitar with private teachers, or in schools of music. Early music schools flourished at the beginning of the 20th century, although only voice, piano, violin, and cello, aside from the usual music theory subjects, were offered. Then in 1916, the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music started instruction in classical guitar, with writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\"><strong>Fernando Canon</strong></a> as the first instructor. Other guitarists who developed classical guitar music and playing in the Philippines were Jose Valdez, Pacifico Pelaez, Pedro Concepcion, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a>, Jose Pellicer, Michael Dadap, Billy Guerrero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3971\"><strong>Lester Demetillo</strong></a>, and Ruben Reyes. In addition, current generation of guitarists include Ramoncito Carpio, Franco Maigue, Phil Valdez, Benchito Cari&ntilde;o, Alberto Mesa, Solaiman Jamisolamin, and Nathan Manimtim.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Edna Marcil M.

The sound box is a five-sided, semicircular cone on the rear side, with holes at the back to facilitate string changes. The front of the box is enclosed by a vibrating soundboard to which the strings extend. The neck holds either metal or wooden pegs for tuning.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tuning system is based on a seven-note diatonic scale, either in the major or minor modes. Strings are either nylon, metal, or a combination of both. Hardwoods make up the majority of materials used in the harp. Softwoods, like <i>palochina</i> or marine plywood, are sometimes used for the soundboard. Judging by the number of harps used, nangka wood seems to be the ideal material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine harps are believed to have originated from Spanish Renaissance-era harps brought to Latin America, then introduced to the Philippines via the Acapulco-Manila galleon trade in the late 16th century. The Filipino harp was played in many Hispanized areas from northern Luzon to the Visayas. More than one 19th-century author declared the harp to be the <i>instrumento nacional</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Philippine harps have common elements, comparative harp research done in the Ilocos and the Visayas shows differences in structural design and musical repertory. Structural differences tend to be more varied in Visayan harps when compared to Ilocano harps. Visayan harps are generally shorter with fewer strings (80-120 cm at the forepillar and 25-32 strings) than Ilocano harps (130-50 cm and 30-36 strings). Two structural types are observed in the Visayas: the staved, five-board compound body and the hollow bodied type, which is carved from a single wood log, usually nangka. Most Ilocano harps have a staved sound box with wider soundboards (60 cm versus the Visayan&rsquo;s 45 cm) and deeper resonating boxes at the base (approximately 35 cm versus 27 cm). Zoomorphic carvings at the joint where the neck and forepillar meet are noticed on a good percentage of Visayan harp designs. Ilocano harps almost always have either a floral or star pattern in the same area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional repertories are based, for the most part, on dance music and popular folksongs in the dialect of a given region. Three of the most important traditional songs played on harps in the Visayas are the <b>kuratsa</b>,<i> </i><b>kuradang</b>,<i> </i>and, most importantly, the <b>balitaw</b>. Ilocano repertory includes songs in the vernacular, plus the rigodon,<i> pandanggo</i>,<i> </i>jota,<i> </i>various waltzes, polkas, and other traditional European dances. At present, the Filipino harp is an antique rarity on the verge of extinction.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Stephen L.

Manuel Estardante was a noted French horn player; Eliseo Clamos was a noted trumpet player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, the <b>carabao horn</b>, generally called <b>tambuli</b>,<i> </i>is called <b>palluy</b><i> </i>among the Kalinga, <b>tangguyob</b><i> </i>among the Ilocano, and <b>amaryung</b><i> </i>among the Ibanag. The Hanunuo Mangyan <b>badyung</b><i> </i>and the Manobo <b>tambolang</b><i> </i>are made of one internode of bamboo with a blowing hole along the tube length near the closed node. The opposite end of the bamboo tube is open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Conch shells</b> or shell trumpets have a similar function as <b>carabao horns</b>. The Aeta of Zambales use the term <b>tambuyuk</b><i> </i>for both the conch shell and the carabao horn. The Ivatan <b>agulung</b><i> </i>or <b>vadyadung</b>, the<i> </i>Ibanag <b>tangguyong</b>, the<i> </i>Aklanon <b>bodyong</b>, the<i> </i>Batak and Hanunuo Mangyan <b>budyong</b> or<i> </i><b>budyung</b>, the<i> </i>Mandaya <b>longa</b> or<i> </i><b>lungga</b>, the<i> </i>Cuyunon <b>taburi</b>,<i> </i>and the Bukidnon <b>bogayong</b><i> </i>are conch shells. Conch horns are also used by the Waray of Samar and Leyte, and the Bicol of Camarines Sur. The instrument is blown through a hole pierced through the shell. The loud and long sounds produced by the conch shells and carabao horn are used primarily for signaling and calling people to gather for meetings and emergencies.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

Players move their fingers up and down the neck, shortening the strings and producing various pitches. The strings may be plucked with the fingers or with the aid of a plectrum. Lutes that are bowed are classified as <b>fiddles</b>. <b>Plucked lutes</b> come in various sizes and shapes. Important differences include the relative length of the body and neck, the shape of the back, the number of strings, and the presence or absence of frets. Lutes with long necks antedate those with short necks. Sometimes the neck of the lute is an elongation of the body. The shape of the resonating chamber may be rounded or flat. The neck may have frets that guide the performer&rsquo;s fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, indigenous plucked lutes are found at present only in Mindanao and Palawan, and perhaps still in Mindoro highlands, among Islamic and non-Islamic groups. However, up until 18th century CE, historical sources written by Spanish missionaries documented that these were also found partly in the islands of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Panay, and even Luzon (Brandeis). An example is the Visayan <b>buktot</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The two-stringed plucked lute of the Muslim Maranao and Maguindanao is called the <b>kutyapi</b> or <b>kusyapi</b>, which most likely came from the island of Borneo, where it is known among a number of aboriginal peoples there as <b>sapeh</b> (<b>sape</b> or <b>sambe</b>). This type of lute is believed to have originated from Kerala, South India,from where it evolved into another type, a zither, called <b>kaccapa</b> of Continental Southeast Asia. Similar plucked lute instruments are played by non-Muslim groups: the Mansaka <b>binarig</b>, <b>binudyaan</b>; Blaan <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kitara</b>,<b> faglong</b>,<b> faglung</b>,<b> foglong</b>; Tiruray <b>fegarong</b>; Tboli <b>hagolong, hagelong</b>; Bukidnon <b>katyapi</b>; Subanon <b>kotapi</b>, <b>kutapi</b>; Manobo <b>fuglung</b>, <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kudlung</b>, <b>kudyapi</b>, <b>kutyapi</b>,<b> kudyung</b>; Ata <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kuglong</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> <b>kudlong</b>; Mangguangan <b>kudlong</b>; Mandaya <b>kudlong</b>; Mansaka <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kudlung</b>; and Higaonon <b>piyapi</b>. Among these non-Muslim groups, plucked lutes are often paired with bamboo polychordal zither in marriage negotiations, which explains why the term &ldquo;kudlung&rdquo; or its variant &ldquo;fuglung,&rdquo; in some groups, would alternate with the term &ldquo;kutyapi&rdquo; (two-stringed lute).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kutyapi of the Maranao and Maguindanao are longer than the inland lutes. The kudyapi is favored by community elders on formal occasions; theinstrument may be heard at informal gatherings as well. The Maguindanao kutyapi, made of light wood, has a boat-shaped resonating chamber. Two metal strings attached to a common <b>ngilung</b> (string holder) run the length of the instrument. The <b>sumayog </b>(drone string) vibrates freely. The <b>tamusan </b>(melody string) can be stopped at any of the 12 <b>dumalon</b> (frets) glued to the body of the lute. A <b>sungkol </b>(bridge) raises the melody string above the highest fret.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kutyapi is held in the performer&rsquo;s lap like a guitar. The left hand slides back and forth along the neck of the instrument while the fingers stop the melody string between the frets. The middle finger of the right hand plucks both the melody and drone strings with a rattan <b>kubit</b> (plectrum).<b> </b>The tapping of the right thumb on the body of the instrument provides an accompanying rhythm to the melody and drone as a special effect displaying the player&rsquo;s dexterity. Kutyapi music often has subtle metaphorical meanings concerning love. It is not generally played during festive occasions, for its music is easily drowned out by the noise and general merrymaking; it is more appropriate for courting and other more intimate occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Maranao kutyapi has florid and ornate designs on its body. Intricate carvings decorate the neck end and belly end of the instrument. In Ditsan, Lanao del Sur, the nine frets are called <b>damaran</b>.<b> </b>The pegs by which the strings are tightened or loosened are called <b>kaliug</b>.<b> </b>The bridge that raises the strings above the frets is the <b>tomokod</b>.<b> </b>The drone string or <b>hugong </b>plays the rhythm, and the second string plays the melody. The instrument is played solo or in ensemble. Solo music includes abstract pieces and those derived from vocal music. <b>Kapumalitubug</b>,<b> </b>for example, imitates the flow of the Malitubug River that runs between Lanao and Bukidnon, while <b>kapemunda </b>describes the separation of lovers. The kutyapi is joined by the <b>serong aganding </b>(parallel-stringed lute), <b>kubing </b>(mouth harp), and <b>insi </b>(ring flute) to form the serenading <b>kapanirong </b>ensemble. The musicians are not suitors, but act in behalf of their lovestruck relative or friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lutes of the inland communities are smaller. The distinction of this subtype of lute from the long and slim two-stringed lutes of groups within the orbit of Muslim influence is confirmed by surviving examples of small lutes preserved in Spanish museums and by the instrument called <b>buktot</b> that Norberto Romualdez had documented in his 1932 book. This subtype has a coconut shell for its resonator that is attached to the underside of the board with a large opening for capturing the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>katyapi </b>of Lantacan, Bukidnon, played mostly by men, is shaped like a crocodile or a bird, and its 11 frets are<b> </b>glued on with beeswax. Its melodies express different sentiments: a man seeking a tryst with his loved one, a woman&rsquo;s response to a man&rsquo;s offer of love, a man bidding farewell on the eve of his departure for a faraway place. Sometimes the katyapi imitates sounds from nature, like the chirping of the <i>irol-irol</i><b> </b>bird at dusk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon kutapi is long necked, its body comprising a third of its total length of about one meter. It is carved out of a softwood log&mdash;the <i>thawan</i><b> </b>(light colored) or <i>mananggula</i><b> </b>(dark colored). The resonating chamber is fitted with a <b>thalap </b>(cover).<b> </b>At the top of the neck, the <b>dluwang </b>(two holes)<b> </b>accomodate <b>dleyonan </b>(pegs).<b> </b>A single wire string is attached to the left peg and then stretched from atop the body to the bottom end and returned to the top of the neck and attached to the right peg. The <b>panuso </b>(four frets) are glued onto the neck of the instrument with beeswax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lute is held upright, the neck slightly slanted to the right of the player. The bottom of the lute sits on the player&rsquo;s lap, wedged between the thighs. The left string acts as a drone and is plucked by the thumb. The melody string is played by the finger. The third and fourth finger holding a small piece of wood called <b>gulothok </b>or<b> sambulan</b>,<b> </b>occasionally thump the body of the lute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are two ways of tuning the Subanon lute. Both strings are tuned to the same pitch for dances, such as the <i>shoten</i>, <i>dumandeng matagandaw</i>, and <i>anderetendem</i>. The <i>thalak</i><b> </b>dance for weddings and festive gatherings is accompanied by the lute, whose drone string is tuned higher than the melody string. The Subanon kutapi is played by both men and women for courtship, self-entertainment, or to accompany dances. When not accompanying dances, melodies are derived from <b>abuyuk </b>(familiar love songs)<b> </b>and bear titles taken from the verses. The <i>pangalay</i><b> </b>dance is accompanied by a piece called <b>dumanding</b>;<b> </b>the <i>saot</i><b> </b>dance of shield-bearing boys is accompanied by the <b>sawten</b>.<b> </b>In Sindangan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> del Norte, the kutapi is sometimes played by two men: one playing the drone and melody strings, the second striking one of the strings with two small sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In South Cotabato, the Tboli dye their hagelong black. Intricate designs of various geometric shapes are etched out, exposing the natural light color of the wood; red ornamentation may be added. The drone and melody strings are made of abaca or, more recently, wire. A bamboo plectrum is used to pluck the strings and tap an accompanying rhythm on the body of the lute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Mandaya kudlong has eight frets or <b>bangun</b>, which can be moved to alter the tuning. Both strings are tuned to the same pitch and plucked with a plectrum tied to the performer&rsquo;s middle finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Mansaka tune the kudlong in two ways: when tuned with four or five frets, the lute is called the <b>binarig</b>;<b> </b>when tuned with eight frets, it is called the <b>binudya</b>.<b> </b>The strings are tuned in fifths. The performer squats with the side of the kudlong resting on his thighs. The left hand stops the strings, the right hand plucks them. The Mansaka play the kudlong for entertainment, solo or to accompany a song. Sometimes it is played in ensemble with a <b>takol</b> (five-stringed zither).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Blaan two-stringed lute is played for courtship, marriage, death, or to accompany dancing. Sometimes, two fuglung are played in ensemble with the <b>sluray </b>(zither). The Ata kudlong is played by a man who dances with the instrument, while following the footsteps of a dancing woman playing the <b>saluray </b>(polychordal zither).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Palawan <b>kusjapiq </b>is considered a man&rsquo;s instrument, and the names of its parts correspond to those of the male anatomy: <b>ulu </b>(head), <b>dabdab </b>(chest), <b>duru</b> (breasts or frets), <b>utin </b>(penis), <b>balibang </b>(hips), and <b>ipus </b>(tail). The long neck is the <b>tawil</b>,<b> </b>the resonating chamber the <b>ruwang</b>.<b> </b>The drone string is called <b>lambagan</b>.<b> </b>The melody string, <b>saningan</b>,<b> </b>is stretched over six frets, which can be arranged to play two scales, <b>bagit </b>or <b>kulilal</b>.<b> </b>When played as a solo instrument, the kusjapiq pieces bear descriptive or narrative titles. It plays in ensemble with one or two <b>pagang </b>(zither) or with another lute accompanied by the alternate improvised singing between men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Southern Philippine lutes are generally boat-shaped and long-necked, with a drone and melody string. They are all fretted, but distanced differently. The Maguindanao and Maranao lutes have frets glued to the body or resonating chamber. Other lutes, like the Subanon kutapi, are fretted on the neck. Generally, the frets can be moved to change the tuning or scale, and are glued with beeswax. In some lutes, both strings are tuned to the same pitch, while others are tuned differently. All lutes are played similarly: one hand plucks the strings with a plectrum, the other stops the strings. Performers commonly tap rhythms on the lute&rsquo;s body to intensify the music. Some groups play the lute while dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lute is played solo or to accompany singing or dancing. It is also played in ensemble with another lute, a zither, or other instruments. Both men and women play the lute on various occasions: self-entertainment, courtship, marriage festivities, mourning, or lulling a child to sleep. When accompanying a dance, the music often takes on the name of the dance. Pieces are named after the source of inspiration&mdash;a song or a line from a song. Often, the music imitates nature: animal and bird sounds, as well as flowing waters or whispering winds.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

The mandolin is a plucked stringed instrument of Italian origin belonging to the lute family. Its pear-shaped body is deeply vaulted, its back a deep convex, and its belly slightly bent. An open sound hole lies below the root of the neck. Earlier mandolins had circular sound holes, while later ones featured oblong sound holes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The low wooden bridge has ivory or bone facing. A plate of tortoise shell or hardwood above the bridge protects the body from being scratched by the plectrum with which the mandolin is played. The instrument has a short neck with a fingerboard furnished with 14-17 fixed frets of metal or ivory, and spaced in semitones. The peg holder is flat and bent slightly backward. There are eight strings arranged in double courses. The tonal range is two octaves and one note, from G to A. Tuning is in fifths: G, D, A, E. At the lower end of the instrument is a cap with metal plates or ivory buttons to which the strings are fastened. The strings can be plucked in two styles: the <b>tremolando</b> style characterized by rapid plucking of a string, and stroking as on a guitar. The mandolin is one of the instruments in the <b>rondalla</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almost every 19th-century youth in Manila played the mandolin. Unlike the Italian mandolin, the local version has a flat belly and back. The sound hole is usually oblong shaped and the protective shell plate is placed almost completely around the sound hole. In Sep 2014, the University of the Philippines College of Music presented a mandolin concert featuring mandolin players <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3971\"><strong>Lester Demetillo</strong></a>, Armando Derecho, David Guadalupe, and Ferdinand Medina. Moreover, luthier Armando Derecho started to build mandolin using imported woods, such as spruce and rosewood.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Jeanna B.

The instrument ranges in length from about 37 cm to big hunting bows 5 ft long. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> bows are known as <b>timawa</b><i> </i>among the Agta of Cagayan; <b>busog</b> among the Dumagat in Palanan, Isabela; <b>gitaha</b><i> </i>and<i> </i><b>palat</b><i> </i>among the Dumagat of Casiguran, Quezon; <b>bayi</b> among the Aeta of Pinatubo, Zambales; and <b>gurimbaw</b><i> </i>among the Aeta of Tayabas, Quezon. Some Cordillera groups&mdash;notably, the Kalinga in the Buwaya region, the Tinguian of Abra, and the Bugkalot (Ilongot) of Nueva Vizcaya&mdash;play this instrument. The stories about Aeta slaves in epic songs of the Buwaya Kalinga indicate that the Cordillera peoples adopted the instrument through their interaction with the Aeta roaming the same mountain ranges. Similarly, the presence of the musical bow called <b>butting</b><i> </i>among the Yogad of Isabela may be linked to Aeta groups, like the Dumagat who reside in the same area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Musical bows often utilize resonators. The gitaha rests on top of a tin can, which is laid on the musician&rsquo;s chest. The gitaha player can also place one end of the bow in the mouth, which acts as a resonator. By changing the shape of the mouth and lightly pressing on the strings at the opposite end, the player can produce varying pitches and tone colors. The timawa,<i> </i><b>giwong di malong-ag</b>,<i> </i><b>tabangkaw</b>,<i> </i>and <b>gulimed</b><i> </i>are examples of this type of bow. The huge hunting bow-type busog and palat use an overturned coconut shell and winnower as resonators. The string may be plucked, as with the busog, or struck with two sticks, as with the palat. Other materials and objects, including porcelain plates, inflated plastic bags, or a pig&rsquo;s bladder, are used to touch the vibrating string to alter its tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical bow is used for evening entertainment among the Buwaya Kalinga or for accompanying songs and dances among the Dumagat. The Agta play the timawa to express their sadness and cheer themselves up.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

This musical instrument is modeled after the Spanish guitar and is a regular part of the Philippine <b>rondalla</b>. It looks like a small guitar, with a round hole in the middle. It is tuned in the same manner as the <b>bandurria</b> but tuned an octave lower like the <b>laud</b>. Its pitches, starting from the highest, are G, D, A, E, B, and F#. What the tenor voice is to the choir, the octavina is to the rondalla. It frequently plays the melodic counterparts or fills in the harmonies by playing the lower notes in accompaniment or in unison with the bass.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Edna Marcil M.

The largest and most complex of musical instruments, it has keys that control valves that release air from a wind-chest into the pipes. The many sets of pipes are controlled from two or more keyboards called manuals, and a pedal keyboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dating back to pre-Christian times, the organ probably descended from the <b>panpipe</b>, a type of syrinx. The invention of the <b>hydraulis</b>, or <b>water organ</b>, is attributed to a Greek engineer, Ktesibios, who lived in Alexandria around the third century BC. The hydraulis was a powerful instrument, with wind pressure supplied by a water compressor while the various pipes were sounded by the manipulation of slide valves. It was used by the Greeks and Romans at festivals and games, and during the rites of the mystery cults. During the early Christian centuries, bellows that pumped air into the pipes replaced the water compressors, and the size and number of pipes greatly increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the mid-fifth century, the organ was used in churches in Spain for high festivals. By the 11th century, large organs were in general use in Europe, but it was not until the 13th century that the capacity, compass, and mechanism began to be developed. Keys gradually replaced the awkward slides, enlarging pitch and tonal ranges. Pedals were invented in the 14th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During that period, a miniature portable organ, called <b>portative organ</b>, and a small stationary organ, the <b>positive</b>, were used extensively. In the portative or <b>organetto</b>, the player provided his own air supply, using the right hand for the keyboard and the left for the bellows. It was monophonic, suited to playing a solo dance tune. There were usually two rows of pipes with a range of up to two octaves. The positive, on the other hand, required two or three sets of bellows and someone else to operate them so that the player could use both hands on the keyboard. Although not portable, the positive could be easily moved, and smaller versions were often placed on a table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of organ building and organ music began around 1600 and continued well into the 19th century. The organ of this period was distinguished by great brilliance and variety of tones, and its extreme clarity provided a perfect medium for the performance of polyphonic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 19th-century Romantic movement, with its emphasis on expressive orchestral sound, brought with it a decline in organ building and organ music. Builders attempted unsuccessfully to create a one-person orchestra. However, the later 19th and 20th centuries saw the introduction of a vast number of new tonal effects and great advances in mechanical construction. In Paris in 1867, electricity was first used to activate the keys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of pipe organs exist throughout the Philippines, usually German, Dutch, or Spanish manufactured. The largest is the four-manual organ in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, followed by the three-manual organ in the Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint John. Two manual organs can be found in the churches of San Agustin, San Sebastian, University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music, San Beda, St. Scholastica, Christ the King Church in Green Meadows, Christ the King Chapel at the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) Seminary, Lourdes, St. Stephen, Paco, and Santo Domingo, all in Metro Manila. Outside of Metro Manila, pipe organs were built in the churches of Tayabas, Quezon, in the early 1900; Argao, ca 1816, Dalaguete, ca 1880, Boljoon, ca 1880, all in Cebu; Bacong, Negros Oriental, 1894; Baclayon, 1824, Dimiao, 1830-50, Garcia Hernandez, 1894, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>y, 1830-50, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\"><strong>Lobo</strong></a>c, 1830-50, Loon, 1830-50, and Maribojoc, ca 1890, all in Bohol; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/447\"><strong>Dapit</strong></a>an, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> del Norte, 1892; and Jimenez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>mis Oriental, 1894. Other current installations include the German organ at the EDSA Shrine, Pasig, Metro Manila, and the pipe organ at the University of the Philippines College of Music. Prominent Filipino pipe organists include Armando Salarza, Eric Dimson, Jun <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, and Alejandro Consolacion II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most unique and historically most important pipe organ is the <b>bamboo organ</b> of Las Pi&ntilde;as. It was built from 1816 to 1824 by Spanish Augustinian Recollect Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a> (1762-1832), who also constructed the Las Pi&ntilde;as Church from 1797 to 1819. In 1880, the organ and the church were severely damaged by three earthquakes. The organ was disassembled and the pipes kept in the old sacristy. In 1882, a strong typhoon tore up the church roof and the wind-chest of the organ was damaged further. The church was rebuilt in 1888, but the organ remained unplayable for the next several decades. It was only in 1973 that the entire instrument was shipped to Bonn, Germany, for restoration. Repair work was done in a room in which the temperature and humidity of Las Pi&ntilde;as were simulated. On 13 Mar 1975, the completely restored organ was flown back to the Philippines, and on 9 May of the same year was inaugurated in a concert by German organist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\"><strong>Wolfgang</strong></a> Oehms. Every year since then, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Organ Festival has become an important music event featuring local and foreign performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two scholars from the St. Joseph Parish in Las Pi&ntilde;as, Cealwyn Tagle and Edgar Montiano, underwent three years of intensive on-the-job training for pipe organ construction and maintenance in Austria. Upon their return in the early 1990s, their first assignment was to construct a pipe organ at the St. Joseph&rsquo;s Academy Auditorium, adjacent to the church where the bamboo organ is located. The organ was inaugurated in 1994, and from then on, they have constructed new pipe organs and restored existing ones in the older churches under the company Diego Cera Builders Inc. They constructed pipe organs for the Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in Novaliches, Union Church of Makati, Lamoiyan Corporation in Para&ntilde;aque, Cathedral of Cebu, Immaculate Conception Church Parish in Pasig, Conservatory of Music in UST, Lipa Cathedral, San Carlos Seminary in Makati, San Sebastian Cathedral in Lipa, and Our Lady of Loreto Church in Sampaloc, Manila. They also restored the pipe organs of the San Agustin Church and the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, allowing the two historical churches to celebrate an annual music festival featuring pipe organ music as the main focus. The San Agustin International Music Festival was inaugurated in 1998, while the Manila Cathedral Pipe Organ Festival began in 2006. They have also renovated the pipe organs of Espiritu Santo in Tayuman, San Fernando de Dilao in Paco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> in Quezon City, Santisimo Rosario Church inside the UST Campus, and the Palo Cathedral in Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>electric organ</b> was invented in 1935 by American Laurens Hammond to overcome the three main problems of pipe organs: high cost, large size, and the need for regular tuning. The commercial success of the Hammond Organ paved the way for other manufacturers of similar electronic instruments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Today, the electronic organ, like the synthesizer, makes use of the latest electronic and computer technology and is capable of recreating not only the sounds of traditional orchestral instruments with amazing accuracy but also a host of sound effects so useful in pop music. In the Philippines, the electronic organ has been highly popular for over two decades, and can be found throughout the country in homes, churches, and places of entertainment. Yamaha is the leading brand, and the company held an annual competition from the 1970s until the late 1990s and sent representatives to the Southeast Asian Electone Festival, the winner of which advanced to the International Yamaha Electone Concours in Japan.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

The sticks are approximately 35 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter, with some sides flattened to produce different tones. Striking the sticks together and rotating them produce different pitches. Percussionsticks are known as <b>kalutang</b> among the Hanunuo and Batangan Mangyan of Mindoro, and among the Tagalog of Marinduque. The Hanunuo play the instruments in ensemble as they hike in the mountains, producing harmonies of seconds, thirds, and fourths. In Marinduque, it is used during Holy Week in the Moriones street play. A more recent development is the kalutang ensemble consisting of diatonically tuned percussion sticks that can play a repertoire of folk songs for cultural programs and festive occasions. The sizes of the kalutang in this ensemble vary greatly, with some pairs as short as 20 cm and others almost a meter long.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

Unlike the earlier <b>harpsichords</b> and <b>clavichords</b>, louder and softer sounds could be produced at will on the newly invented piano, using greater or less force on the keys. Only three of Cristofori&rsquo;s instruments still remain: one dated 1720 is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, another dated 1722 is in Rome, and one dated 1726 is in Leipzig. They are surviving ancestors of an instrument that has spread all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano came into being out of necessity. In the early 1700s, the domestic keyboard instruments were the clavichord, which had expressive dynamic qualities but was very faint in tone, and the harpsichord, which was louder and more brilliant but was incapable of dynamic gradations. The natural desire seems to have grown for a keyboard instrument combining the clavichord&rsquo;s capability of accentuation, <b>crescendo</b>, <b>diminuendo</b>, and <b>cantabile</b>, with the force and brilliance of the harpsichord. It remained only for Cristofori to figure out the escapement&mdash;a device for releasing the hammer after it has struck the string&mdash;and the piano was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the player strikes a key, a felt hammer is thrown at a string or group of strings, and a felt damper is lifted so that the string is allowed to vibrate freely, thus producing the sound. Resonance and amplification are provided by a wooden sounding board, usually of spruce, under the strings. An escapement allows the hammer to fall back even though the key is being held down. The wedge-shaped damper remains off the strings until the key is released, at which time it clamps down on the strings and cuts off the sound. Both the escapement and dampers were inventions of Cristofori. The tone of the piano can be varied in intensity, or loudness, by varying the amount of force used in the keys. Thus, a concert pianist can produce many levels of shadings between his or her loudest and softest tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Grand pianos have three pedals while uprights usually have two. The pedal to the right is the sustaining pedal, often improperly called the <b>loud pedal</b>. When pressed down it lifts all the dampers, allowing the strings to continue sounding until the pedal is released. The use of this pedal requires the utmost care and precision&mdash;faulty pedaling can make the music messy and blurred. The pedal on the left is the <b>soft pedal</b>. When pressed down, it moves the hammers to the right, and hits only one or two strings instead of three. On an upright piano, the whole set of hammers is brought nearer to the strings for a less powerful blow. The middle pedal, the <b>sostenuto</b>, is found on most grand pianos but not on all uprights. This operates an apparatus, which catches only dampers in their raised position until the pedal is released. This allows the player to sustain a note or a chord that will not be blurred by the addition of other tones played after the pedal is pressed down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano keyboard usually consists of 88 keys making up a compass or range of seven and a quarter octaves. The earliest pianos of Cristofori had a compass of 4&frac12; octaves. This compass was gradually increased. The concert grand piano of Mozart, on exhibit at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, has five octaves. In 1790 the English piano maker Broadwood made the first piano with six octaves. In 1824 Liszt was still playing in Paris on a piano with six octaves. The works of Schumann and Chopin require beyond six and a quarter octaves, although Bosendorfer of Austria makes pianos with eight octaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modern grand pianos range in size from the 2.74 m <b>concert grand</b> down to 1.57 m <b>baby grands</b>. These sizes are normal&mdash;there are instruments as long as 3.35 m and shorter than 1.5 m. Large upright pianos more than 1.2 m high have been largely superseded by lower instruments: the studio upright (about 1.16 m high), the console (about 1 m high), and the spinet (about .91 m high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of the piano after the perfection of its lever system is largely concerned with the development of the metal bracing that could withstand the ever increasing tension imposed by the thicker strings required for increased loudness and brilliance. The greatest single advance was the invention of the one-piece cast-iron frame by Alpheus Babcock in 1825. He was also the first to conceive of <b>cross-stringing </b>or<b> overstringing</b>, an arrangement in which the strings of treble and middle registers fan at a higher level. These two features were given what is essentially their present form<i> </i>in the grand piano exhibited in 1855 by Steinway and Sons of New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano has the greatest number of compositions written for it. Its versatility has made it even more popular in homes and concert halls. Its range of seven and quarter octaves is greater than any other traditional instrument, with the exception of the large pipe organ. It is capable of an extremely wide range of dynamics, from the softest pianissimo to the loudest fortissimo. It can be played solo or serve as accompaniment to other instruments. It is at home with any style of music&mdash;from classical to jazz to rock. Any style of playing is possible: full chords, rapid arpeggios, fast scale passages, several melodies at the same time, etc. Many orchestral and operatic works have been transcribed so that they can be played on the piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, pianos from Europe, such as those produced by the Swiss maker C. Rondorf &amp; Co., were being imported during the Spanish colonial period. In 1879, Pio Trinidad established his own piano tuning and repair shop on Calle Alcala, now known as Raon Street in the Quiapo district of Manila. Later, he learned to manufacture his own, and by 1896 he had assembled his first piano, with both case and frame made of acle wood, the bridge of the instrument made of dungon, and the sounding board made of kalantas. This first piano was later donated to President Emilio Aguinaldo in Malolos. In 1903, Trinidad established Pio Trinidad &amp; Co., a piano manufacturing and repair shop along Calle Ronquillo. For exhibition at the 1904 Saint Louis Exposition, he built a special piano made of 17 kinds of wood, which eventually won an award, together with the violin he designed for the same occasion. His piano factory was able to turn out more than a hundred pianos by 1905. Trinidad continued with his piano shop until 1921 when he sold it to Rafael and Luis Echegoyen, the owners of La Lira Music Store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other companies that imported pianos before World War II include Estrella del Norte, Echegoyen, Felipe Yupangco, Lyric Music House, Getz Brothers, and Jacinto. The manufacture of pianos in the Philippines began in the 1950s with P. E. Domingo, F. Yupangco, and Jacinto. They substituted the local almaciga wood in place of the costly imported spruce for the sounding boards. The cast-iron frame, pin block, and wood case began to be made locally. The most critical parts, however, continued to be imported: the action or lever system, keyboard, felt hammerheads, and strings. Soon, other local manufacturers followed: Trebel, Lyric, Weinstein, and Javincello. Available imported brands include Yamaha, Kawai, Sammick, Royale, Daewoo, and Steinway &amp; Sons.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

In the Philippines, the instrument is found only among three ethnolinguistic groups in Southeastern Mindanao whose names for the instrument indicate that the groups must have had enduring cultural contacts in the past: Blaan <b>odel</b>, Tagakaolo <b>edel</b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>gan <b>edel</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Plank drum is coffin-like in shape. On the edge of each side of a wide and long board of wood, a shallow cavity is carved. It is covered with a thin plank of wood that is suspended, by means of a rope, across the hallowed cavity, which serves as the resonating chamber when the plank is struck with two non-sonorous sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two people play the instrument in an interlocking manner: one with a pair of short thick sticks and the other, with a long thin stick. The player with a pair of short sticks is in a kneeling position and produces a fast unvarying rhythmic ostinato. The other, holding the long thin stick, is in standing position, pounding out varied rhythms, which complement as a figuration to the ground rhythm of the pair of short sticks. Plank drum is played with dance, adding a visual layer to the sound ostinato. The dancer represents gestures that are mimetic of objects from nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditionally among the Blaan, the plank drum was an indispensable part of celebration that welcomed home the victorious warriors from a war. At present, the instrument is played at funeral or burial services, symbolically enacting the severing of ties with the soul of the dead person. It is also played in a religious ritual to drive away harmful spirits of nature.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Mihyun Oh</strong> </em><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251677696\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"></v:shape></p>\r\n"

The end held in the hand has a closed node; from the opposite end, the tube is sliced away up to a third of its length, and the edges are tapered, giving it a quill shape. The tube measures from 30 to 60 cm and is around 6 cm in diameter. A thumbhole along the side of the handle is closed or left open to vary the pitch and the timbre produced. The instrument is played in an ensemble and is known as the Kalinga <b>dongadong</b>, <b>patangguk</b>, <b>patang-ug</b>, <b>taggitag</b>; the Agta <b>pata-gong</b>; and the Tinguian <b>patanggok</b> and <b>patanggo</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Kalinga, the tapered tongue of the instrument is struck against a short tube of bamboo or piece of hardwood. An ensemble is made up of six or more men who play interlocking patterns. The northern Kalinga play them during peace-pact celebrations and big curing rituals. Before each performance, a new set of instruments of graduated sizes is made from freshly cut green bamboo. The Southern Kalinga, on the other hand, use dried mature bamboo for their <b>patangguk</b> as they simulate the music of the flat-gong ensemble. The Agta of Cagayan play the <b>pata-gong</b>, a set of three tubes, in combination with stamping tubes and flat gongs. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> performer plays all three tubes by using one tube held by the right hand to strike the other two held by the left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In southern Philippines, the Maguindanao have a pair of quill-shaped tubes made from a harder variety of bamboo. These substitute for the <b>agong</b>, large hanging gongs with wide rims,<i> </i>and are thus called <b>agong a tamlang</b><i> </i>(bamboo gong). A pair of agong a tamlang corresponds to two agong<i> </i>of different pitches used in the kulintang<b> </b>ensemble. The lower-pitched agong a tamlang rests on the seated player&rsquo;s feet set slightly apart to accommodate the length of the tube. The higher-pitched agong a tamlang is held in the left hand close to the other so that the pair can be struck alternately with a rounded stick in different rhythmic patterns. The Maguindanao agong a tamlang differs from the quill-shaped tubes of northern Philippines in the type of bamboo that is used, and the manner of playing&mdash;a rounded stick is used to strike it, and it has no thumbhole.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

The reeds are normally made of a thin piece of cane or metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike flutes, which are widespread all over the Philippines, reed pipes are uncommon. The Tausug <b>saunay</b>, <b>saunai,</b> or <b>sawnay</b> is a free reed aerophone. The reed or <b>dila</b> is cut from a small portion of the node end of a piece of <b>lahi</b> bamboo. The reed is then attached to a short piece of very thin bamboo called the <b>baran</b> (body) or <b>enah</b> (mother). Sometimes the reed is cut from the body of the baran itself. The baran has a diameter of about 1.5-2.0 cm and is as long as a man&rsquo;s extended hand measured from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the third finger. Six equidistant holes are bored into the pipe. At the end of the pipe is a <b>libud</b> (bell) made of coconut or nipa leaves wound into a cone. A square <b>sampung</b> (mouth guard) fashioned from metal or coconut shell is placed on the reed end. The saunay is played only by men. It is used as an accompaniment to singers or as purely instrumental music for entertainment called <b>ta-ta</b>, which may be improvisatory or renditions of familiar melodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> <b>hupeep</b> or <b>hupip</b> is an idioglot single reed pipe. The reed is formed by cutting and raising a tongue from the bamboo tube itself. Three equidistant holes are bored into the tube, which is about 23 cm long and 0.8 cm in diameter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are other reed instruments: the Subanon <b>bhuntot</b> or <b>ghuntok</b>; the Blaan Koronadal <b>feo</b>, <b>feu</b>, or <b>feolenebed</b>; the Blaan and Tagakaolo <b>kulatet</b> or <b>kulatut</b>; the Kalinga <b>patotot</b>; and the Blaan <b>otot</b>. These are made from rice stalks or coconut leaves, which, pressed against each other, act as reeds. Quickly made, they are just as quickly destroyed. During rice harvest time, children accompanying their parents to the rice fields entertain themselves with these instruments. The Subanon ghuntok or bhuntot is played by older siblings to entertain the young ones while their parents attend to the harvest. Children communicate with each other from different corners of the rice field using special prearranged rhythmic codes. The Blaan feu uses two rice stalks, one with three holes. The first stalk acts as a drone playing a continuous rhythmic single tone. The second stalk (with the holes) plays a two- or three-toned tune. The Blaan otot is a toy reed instrument made of coconut leaves.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

There are two types of scrapers in the Philippines. The most common type, to which belong the Maranao <b>tagutok</b> or <b>garakot</b> and the Maguindanao <b>kagul</b>, is a bamboo internode about 50 cm long with shallow notches on one side of the tube. It is played with one or two sticks, which scrape over the notches and tap the body of the instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another scraper features a cogwheel (a small toothed wooden wheel) inserted and attached within a bamboo tube so that its teeth press against a flexible tongue. This tongue is usually fashioned from the bamboo tube by slicing a narrow section that can be partially lifted away from the body while still remaining attached. The tongue scrapes over the teeth of the cogwheel as the instrument is spun when the cogwheel&rsquo;s axle, which serves as a handle, is extended. Rapid successive sounds are produced as the spinning action rotates the tongue and makes it scrape over the cogwheel. Cog rattles are used during Holy Week, particularly on Good Friday, when bells are not rung. Samples of these are the Ivatan <b>kareten</b> <b>ririt</b>, the Yogad <b>karalat</b>,<i> </i>and the Cuyunon <b>patraka</b>.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written byFelicidad A.

Although it functions like a drum, the musical instrument is not a true drum because it does not have a vibrating membrane or animal skin that is struck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine slitdrums are mostly made of one internode of bamboo with a one to two-centimeter opening along two-thirds of its length. It is known by various names, like <b>barimbaw</b> (Hanunuo Mangyan), <b>batungtung</b> (Cuyunon), <b>buntala</b> (Higaonon), <b>bantula</b> (Bukidnon), <b>bagtoe</b> (Aklanon), <b>agong</b> <b>a bentong</b> (Maranao), <b>kagii</b> (Agusanon Manobo), <b>koratong</b> and <b>deratong</b> (Mansaka), and <b>tagutuk</b> (Yakan). It is also found in the Visayas by the name <b>karatong</b>, as well as in Camiguin Island. Slit drums are struck with one or two sticks and are used for calling people or sending signals. However, the Maranao use their agong a bentong as a substitute for the metal <b>agong</b>. It takes on the musical function of the hanging wide-rimmed gong called <b>agons</b>, and is played in an ensemble with other instruments, like the bamboo xylophone and cylindrical drum. Among the Aklanon, slit drums are popularly used as percussion instruments for the festive celebration of the <i>Ati-Atihan</i> during which people blacken their exposed skin like the Aeta, and dance and make merry in the streets in Mardi Gras fashion.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

The size of the bamboo tube varies from 6 to 10 cm in diameter and 35 to 60 cm in length. The instrument comes in sets of two to six tubes, usually made from the same bamboo pole.

The tubes are played by striking the base of the instrument against a hard surface, like a stone, cement flooring, or wood, to produce hollow sounds. The Kalinga instrument has a thumbhole on the lower portion of the tube, which is left open or closed in alternation to produce different pitches, while the top end of the tube is covered with the hand, causing the pitch to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Kalinga, as many as six bamboo tubes of graduated lengths comprise an ensemble.

Originally developed for use by composers of <b>electronic music</b>, the synthesizer has become extremely popular because of its widespread use in popular, jazz, and rock music. Because the synthesizer is an extremely versatile apparatus, which can duplicate the sound of conventional musical instruments as well as novelty sounds, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that there were early electronic instruments whose technological innovations contributed to the development of the present-day synthesizers. The most important of these early electronic instruments were the <b>telharmonium</b>, <b>theremin</b>, <b>spherophone</b>, <b>partiturophone</b>, <b>ondes martenot</b>, and<b> trautonium</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<b> </b>telharmonium was invented by Thaddeus Cahill (1867-1934). It weighed 200 tons and was exhibited in New York in 1906. This machine disappeared before World War II. The theremin, built before 1920 by Leon Theremin, consisted of a small box with two antennae, and was manipulated by a performer standing in front of it and moving his hands up and down through the air. It was widely demonstrated in the 1920s and several composers wrote for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The spherophone was a kind of primitive electronic organ first built in 1923 by Jorge Mager (1880-1929). After two prototypes, Mager constructed a larger and more sophisticated machine, the partiturophone, which had many manuals and special effects such as vibrato. These machines were lost in World War II. The ondes martenot, constructed by Maurice Martenot in 1928, has a keyboard and a number of other manual controls with two separate loud speakers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of its special features was the capability to slide between pitches. The trautonium was invented by Friedrich Trautwein in 1930. It was an instrument operated by means of a wire touched by the finger, the pressure of touch determining loudness and the location of the finger determining pitch. Composers continued to use the trautonium until the mid-1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1950s, Herbert Belar and Harry Olsen constructed the Mark II RCA Music Synthesizer, which was later donated to the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. This machine, of which only a model was made, was the most advanced electronic music apparatus of its time, giving the composer a large measure of control over the aspects of the sounds synthesized. However, even with such equipment available, electronic music composers still had to put a piece of music together. Even rudimentary phrasing, articulation or change of timbre could involve many grueling hours for the production of mere seconds of music. The two most natural vocal or instrumental means of musical expression, <b>crescendo</b> and <b>diminuendo</b>, required the most calculated and laborious manipulation of volume controls and filters. The musician was unable to hear, much less modify, a sound as it was being produced. It proved to be a time-consuming process since everything had to be recorded on tape, which was later spliced into small sections to &ldquo;construct&rdquo; the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1965 Robert A. Moog in New York originated the <b>modern synthesizer </b>in a commercial package. The invention revolutionized electronic composition by speeding up the laborious process of doing away with the drudgery of assembling small sections on tape. Donald Buchla in California and Paul Ketoff in Rome also independently constructed synthesizers for commercial use, employing the newer transistor technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The synthesizer has controls that establish the time of attack, sustain, delay, and end of a sound. Other properties, such as pitch, amplitude, timbre, reverberation, and modulation, are controlled automatically, usually from a keyboard. Keyboards are the most important manual control devices within synthesizers. Although they are often modeled on the black-and-white semitonal keyboards of conventional instruments, many other designs are in use&mdash;black-and-white keys do not always indicate semitonal intervals, though the pitches are normally separated by equal pitch distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Synthesizer keyboards have a number of special features: the keys may be pressure-sensitive, allowing a new means for the control of some property of the sound, and there may be buttons or switches to transpose the keyboard. Prior to 1976, most synthesizers could perform only one note at a time. Since 1976, polyphonic synthesizers have become an important part of pop-music making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of <b>digital synthesizers</b> in the late 1970s paved the way for music produced solely from digital sounds, and it instigated the fabrication of smaller and less expensive keyboard instruments. By 1988, the <b>workstation synthesizer</b> was introduced, with a feature that allowed for the sequencing of entire songs through the use of separate tracks for recording individual parts. At the turn of the 21st century, software synthesizers were developed, which simplified the creation of music using only personal computers or laptops, through the aid of a software that generates digital sounds without the need for conventional keyboard instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before World War II, Busoni enthusiastically prophesied the importance of electronic music. The synthesizer presented composers not only with a complete spectrum of new sounds but with a remarkable variety of sounds that could be made to play by itself, repeatedly or as required. Because of the astonishingand imitative qualities of the synthesizers, its use has been commercialized and has been mainstreamed as a performance instrument, combinedwith modern computer/digital technology.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

The body is divided into three precisely proportioned sections, the middle, being the narrowest, looks like a waistline. The back is slightly concave. And the sidewalls separate it from the frontal soundboard, which bulges like the back and is similarly depressed near the edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The edges of both the back and the soundboard protrude slightly over the sidewalls. Two F-shaped sound holes are cut into about the middle of the soundboard. Connected to the body is the neck with a fingerboard made of ebony, which projects over the soundboard on the lower end. At the top end of the neck is the nut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Four strings tuned to G, D1, A1, and E2 run from the upper end of the tailpiece, over the bridge, through the fingerboard, and to the nut, and these strings are secured by the ebony pegs in the peg box. The tailpiece is fastened by a heavy piece of gut running over the ebony saddle and is secured by the end pin. Connected to the tailpiece is also a fine-tuning device for the E-string. Meanwhile, perched on the bridge is the mute, a comb-shaped rider that stifles some of the vibrations of the bridge and, consequently, of the body, resulting in a thinner timbre. Over the peg box is the scroll. By tuning the pegs, the tension of the strings may be adjusted to their proper pitches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The chin rest, attached to the soundboard on the left side of the tailpiece, was invented in 1829 by violinist Ludwig Spohr (1724-1859), some 300 years after the first violins were handcrafted by the celebrated Italian string-instrument makers of Brescia (Gasparo de Salo, Maggini), Cremona (Amati, Stradivari, Guarneri, etc.), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a> (Testore, Guaadangini) in the 1550s. The bow was perfected only in 1875 by Francis Tourte (1747-1835) in Paris. Made of horsehair strung on both ends of a wooden stick, the bow is lubricated by rubbing the horsehair with rosin. The tension of the hair can be regulated with an adjustable nut attached to one end of the stick. The stick tapers toward the point, the end farthest from hand, and is slightly bent toward the hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, the Augustinian friars of the convent of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guadalupe organized an orchestra in 1601. The Augustinian Juan Bolivar, said to be an expert on the violin as well as on a number of other Western instruments, arrived from Madrid in 1739. He took charge of the musical activities and instruction at the San Agustin Monastery in Manila. Many other priests before, during, and after Bolivar&rsquo;s time also influenced the musical training of their respective parishioners. In the mid-18th century, Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples de la Santa Iglesia Catedral, the forerunner of conservatories, was founded as a teaching appendage of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> mainly for the benefit of its boys&rsquo; choir. Violin lessons, among others, were given. Orchestras proliferated from the mid-19th century onward, attesting to the increasing interest in bowed string instruments, including the violin&rsquo;s closest relatives&mdash;the viola, the cello, and the contrabass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although Filipino composers have written many large works for the violin (e.g., Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Konzertst&uuml;k for Violin and Orchestra</i></b><i> </i>and the violin concertos by EliseoM.Pajaro and Alfredo S.Buenaventura), it is the shorter pieces&mdash;the bons mots&mdash;that have won the Filipinos&rsquo; heart.

Since ManuelLuna first acquired the title &ldquo;Professor de Violino&rdquo; from the Conservatory of Madrid (circa 1879), violinists have elicited raves as performers or teachers or have become outstanding conductors. Among the famous violinists were Ramon Valdez and Bibiano<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es. The pre-World War II violin department at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music saw the emergence of CayetanoJacobe, BonifacioAbdon, Ramon Corpus, and Ramon Mendoza. RamonTapales received his training in Europe and came back to serve as director of the UP Conservatory of Music and conductor of several symphony orchestras. ErnestoVallejo blazed the trail for the subsequent rise of such virtuosos as GilopezKabayao, OscarYatco, CarmencitaLozada, Divinagracia Montalban, and JulianQuirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Violinists and noted pedagogues LuisValencia, Vicente Sales, SergioZ.EsmillaJr, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\"><strong>Basilio Manalo</strong></a> were also the founding conductors of the Filipino Youth Symphony Orchestra, the Pasaknungan, the PhilippineYouthOrchestra, and the Philippine Research for Developing Instrumental Soloist Chamber Orchestra, respectively.

It consists of bamboo keys of graduated lengths mounted on a trapezoidal resonance box. The number of plates varies among the different groups. The Yakan have from three to nine, five being the most common; the Tausug from 14 to 22, 17 being the most common; and the Palawan have 17. Keys are struck with two mallets, each with a strip of rubber fastened to its underside. In the past, the padding was made of hemp or strips of cloth. The bamboo xylophone is known by various names: the Yakan <b>agung gabang</b><i> </i>and <b>kwintangan batakan</b>;<i> </i>the Palawan, Sama, Tausug, and Yakan <b>gabbang</b>;<i> </i>and the Sama <b>gambang</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Found in the northern part of the country is the leg xylophone, a set of bamboo blades in graduated sizes and with tapered ends. The instrument is usually mounted on the player&rsquo;s upper thighs or from knees down to the ankles. Among the Tinguian of Abra, a set of leg xylophones called <b>patpattong </b>consists of five bamboo blades played with two sticks by a male performer who sits on the ground while simulating the music of the flat-gong ensemble. Among the Kalinga, leg xylophones are called <b>patatag</b> or <b>patteteg</b>, which are usually played in an ensemble of five of more persons each assigned a xylophone blade. The blades are sounded by striking the instrument with one or two sticks, producing accented and dampened sounds. In Kalinga, the use of one stick on the patteteg imitates flat-gong playing with stick called <b>gangsa pattung</b> while that of two sticks simulates flat-gong playing by hand called <b>gangsa topayya</b>. Leg xylophones are used by the Kalinga and the Tinguian children as toys as well as substitutes for the flat gongs.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Felicidad A.

The body acts as the resonator and comes in a variety of sizes and shapes. Zithers in the Philippines are of the <b>tube</b>, <b>half-tube</b>, and <b>board </b>variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tube zithers are found in pockets scattered throughout the three regions in the country: northern Luzon Cordillera highlands, Mindoro and Palawan, and Mindanao. According to Curt Sachs in his 1940 book <b><i>The History of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Instruments</i></b>, this type of diffusion of music material culture would indicate that tube zithers are very old Austronesian instruments, like the <b>notch flute</b>, which is also found across the regions of the archipelago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are two types of tube zithers: the <b>polychordal</b> and <b>parallel-stringed zither</b>. The former is capable of playing a melody made up of interlocking pitches, while the latter is principally an idiophone that produces dance rhythms. Except for board zithers, these tube zithers are made of bamboo and are idiochords, which means that the strings are made of sheaths stripped from but attached to both ends of the bamboo&rsquo;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Polychordal zithers are found among the Bontok, Kalinga, Bugkalot (Ilongot), Isneg, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, and Ibaloy in the north; and among the Manobo, Subanon, Blaan, Tagakaolo, Tboli, Mansaka, Tiruray, Palawan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, and Maguindanao in the south. The instruments consist of a bamboo tube about 12 cm in diameter, closed at both ends by nodes, but partially opened for better resonance. Strings are etched out of the bamboo body and remain attached at both ends about seven centimeters from each node, and are kept in place by rattan or woven bamboo rings. The strings are raised and given tension by inserting small bamboo or wooden frets beneath each string near the ends. The number and placement of the etched-out strings vary from 3 to 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalinga <b>kulibet </b>or <b>kolitong </b>has six, occasionally 10, strings. In the six-stringed kulibet, two strings are etched out on one side of the tube, and four on the opposite side. The player holds the instrument with both hands, one end of the instrument resting against his lower waist. The two front strings are plucked with the thumbs, and the four dorsal strings are plucked with the middle and index fingers. Alternate fingers of both hands produce a continuous melody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Isneg <b>ohitang </b>or <b>uritang </b>is played by women for self-entertainment and relaxation. It has five strings: the two front strings are plucked with both thumbs, the three dorsal strings by the other fingers. The five- or six-stringed <b>kollesing </b>of the Bugkalot is held by a man while a woman strikes the strings with small bamboo sticks. The Ifugao sometimes play their zithers in an ensemble called <b>lube</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The polychordal zither has many names: <b>kolitong</b>,<b> kollitong</b>,<b> kuletong</b>,<b> kullitong </b>(Bontok and Kalinga); <b>kulesin</b>,<b> kulising </b>(Bugkalot); <b>kolliteng</b>,<b> kulitteng </b>(Isneg); <b>salorai</b>,<b> saluray</b>,<b> saluroy</b>,<b> saw-ray </b>(Manobo and Ata); <b>sigitan </b>(Subanon); <b>sloroy</b>,<b> senday</b>,<b> sluray</b>,<b> sludoy </b>(Blaan, Tagakaolo, Tboli); <b>takul </b>(Mansaka); <b>tangkew </b>(Agusanon Manobo); <b>tangke </b>(Tiruray); <b>tangko</b>,<b> tangku </b>(Mangguangan and Dibabawon); <b>togo</b>, <b>tugo </b>(Manobo and Tiruray, Maguindanao); and <b>pagang </b>(Palawan). The Palawan eight- or nine-stringed pagang may be played solo or with the <b>kusjapiq </b>(lute) in duets, trios, or quartets accompanied by <b>karang </b>and <b>kulilal </b>songs alternately sung by men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon sigitan has five strings. It is played by two people: one plucks the strings while another strikes the side of the tube with bamboo sticks called <b>glapikal</b>.<b> </b>The sigitan plays a tune called <b>da-endit </b>to accompany a dance. Other pieces express love, sorrow, sadness, or joy. The Tiruray eight-stringed tangke is played with a plectrum by two women, one plucking the drone, the other the melody. The Blaan, Ata Matigsalug, and Tboli polychordal zithers are often played with the two-stringed lute. Both the Blaan sluray and the Tboli sludoy are five stringed. Blaan women play the sluray for self-entertainment or to express love or sorrow. Played in ensemble with two <b>fuglong </b>(lutes), it accompanies festive dancing, especially at weddings. The Bagobo tugo has seven strings, while the Bukidnon Matigsalug saluray has six strings. In one courting dance, the female plays and dances with her saluray as the male, playing his <b>kudlong </b>(lute) and singing, follows the woman in small mincing steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The parallel-stringed tube zither is found in northern Luzon, Zambales, Mindoro, Mindanao, and Palawan. In the Cordillera highlands, it is called <b>bambam</b>, <b>pas-ing </b>by the Isneg, and <b>tambi </b>by the Kalinga. It is made of heavy bamboo about 40 cm long, closed at both ends with a node. Two bamboo strands about two inches apart are etched out of the body. Small wooden bridges near both ends lift the strings and give them tension. Beneath the strings, at midpoint, a small bamboo plate clipped to the strings covers a hole. The strings are struck with a bamboo stick. The Pinatubo Aeta play a similar instrument called <b>tabengbeng </b>mainly to help pass the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Hanunuo <b>kudlong</b> or <b>tabungbung </b>is made from a closed internode of bamboo, with two strings etched out of the tube and raised by small bamboo frets. For better resonance the tube is split from one end and kept slightly open by a small bamboo sliver. Children play the kudlong by plucking one string at a time with a plectrum. The Hanunuo <b>batiwtiw </b>is similarly constructed as the kudlong but is closed only on one end. It has a single string etched out of the body and raised by a stick laid across the tube. When the stick is struck by a plectrum it produces a buzzing sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Palawan, the two-stringed <b>patigunggung </b>is played by men for entertainment. It is constructed like the Isneg <b>bamban</b>.<b> </b>The bamboo piece covering the middle hole, <b>lubu</b>,<b> </b>is called <b>letep</b>.<b> </b>The frets under the strings, <b>kwerdas</b>,<b> </b>are called <b>basikal</b>.<b> </b>The performer sits on the floor with legs outstretched. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> end of the patigunggung rests against his stomach leaning slightly toward his left hand, which holds the tube. The right-hand fingers pluck the strings. In Lanao del Sur, the Maranao <b>serong aganding </b>is played solo or together with the <b>kutyapi </b>(lute), <b>insi</b> (ring flute), or <b>kubing </b>(mouthharp). Like the other parallel-stringed zithers, the serong aganding has two strings. The performer sits, grasping the tube with three or four of his left-hand fingers while the thumb plucks one of the strings. The right palm raises and drops the cover on the middle hole, dampening and varying the sounds caused by the plucked strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon <b>thambabok </b>is used to send messages of love during courtship, though more often it is used for self-entertainment and relaxation. When accompanying dances, it imitates the rhythmic patterns played on the <b>gagung </b>(bossed gong). Using one hand, the player strikes the strings with light, bouncing strokes. The other hand opens and closes the upper node, which is cut open, varying the sound quality of the vibrating strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bukidnon play their <b>takumbo </b>to scare off insects in the corn fields. It is played while dancing&mdash;the left and right foot alternately match the rhythms struck on the bamboo strings by one hand, as the other hand busily opens and closes the cut upper node of the tube. Other zithers are the <b>katimbok </b>(Manobo, Tagakaolo) and <b>tabobo </b>(Manobo). The Ifugao have the <b>tadcheng</b>,<b> tedcheng</b>,<b> gacheng</b>, which has two to four strings etched from the bamboo half-tube body. Depending on the style of playing, the strings may be plucked or struck with small bamboo sticks, often simulating gong rhythms. It is played by boys and men for entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No longer played today in Ifugao, but preserved in museums, are the single-stringed half-tube zither, split-single-stringed tube zither, and heterochord strip-board zither. A variation of the half-tube zither is the board zither, whose body is made of a wooden board, also called tadcheng by the Ifugao. Four metal strings&mdash;three melody, one drone&mdash;are used in the Ibaloy <b>kaltsang</b>,<b> </b>which is played exclusively by women.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.
