The main headquarters of ABS-CBN are located on Sergeant Esguerra Ave corner Mother Ignacia Ave in South Triangle, Quezon City. It has 13 studios. Studio 1, now named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> Theater, is the oldest.

On 24 Sept 1956, CBN began its radio broadcasts on CBN-DZXL Radio. Its studio and transmitter were located at the CBN Building on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a> St in Intramuros, Manila. On 24 Feb 1957, Lopez Sr bought Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), formerly Bolinao Electronics Corporation, from Antonio Quirino and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4883\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4883\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4883\"><strong>James Lindenberg</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, which operated the radio station DZAQ and Channel 3, the country&rsquo;s first TV station. This purchase made Lopez the biggest investor in the broadcast industry in the Philippines. For four years, ABS radio and television stations were operated separately from CBN stations, their common ownership notwithstanding. In 1958, ABS Channel 3 transferred its facilities from Santa Cruz in Manila and San Juan, Rizal, to its new studio and transmitter site on Roxas Blvd in Pasay City. In the same year, on 19 Apr, CBN began its television broadcasts on CBN-DZXL-TV Channel 9 using its facilities in Intramuros. CBN 9&rsquo;s first programs included the daily noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> and the singing talent search program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage). Other programs included <b><i>Chelsea Dancetime</i></b>, <b><i>Pacosta Hit Parade</i></b>, <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b>, <b><i>Tia Dely </i></b>(Aunt Dely), <b><i>United American Tiki-Tiki</i></b>, and <b><i>Operetang Sampay Bakod</i></b> (Rag Tag Operetta). In 1961, ABS and CBN stations began using the name ABS-CBN. At the same time, on 14 Jun 1961, ABS-CBN opened its television station Channel 3 in Cebu City, which aired four hours a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lopez Sr and son Lopez Jr, aka Geny or Kapitan, were mainly responsible for the rise of ABS-CBN as the country&rsquo;s biggest network. The network got the rights to cover and air the 1962 and 1966 ASEAN Games. In 1963, ABS-CBN tested the first color television transmission in the Philippines using technology imported from the USA. In 1966, the network started telecasting color programs and introduced the <i>sarimanok</i> (mythical bird with a fish in its beak) logo. On 12 Feb 1967, the network launched its iconic logo, which features an aerial transmitter and three concentric rings symbolizing broadcast waves, in the primary colors of red, green, and blue, and the letters ABS on top of the graphic and the letters CBN below it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 18 Dec 1968, ABS-CBN moved its radio and studio facilities to its new headquarters called Broadcast Plaza, located along Bohol Ave (now Sergeant Esguerra Ave) in Diliman, Quezon City. It had the most advanced broadcasting center in Asia during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1969, the government assigned Channels 3 and 9 as Channels 2 and 4, respectively. With its two other provincial stations in Bacolod and Dagupan, ABS-CBN was operating with two national and three regional TV stations: Channel 3 Cebu, Channel 4 Bacolod, and Channel 10 Baguio. It also owned 20 radio stations in areas like Bacolod, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Iligan, Iloilo, Laoag, Legaspi, Lucena, Naga, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>; six of these radio stations were in Manila. By 1972, ABS-CBN was considered the most powerful radio-television network in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pre-martial law ABS-CBN produced a series of hits.

On 24 Sept 1956, CBN began its radio broadcasts on CBN-DZXL Radio. Its studio and transmitter were located at the CBN Building on <a href=\"/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a> St in Intramuros, Manila.

This purchase made Lopez the biggest investor in the broadcast industry in the Philippines. For four years, ABS radio and television stations were operated separately from CBN stations, their common ownership notwithstanding. In 1958, ABS Channel 3 transferred its facilities from Santa Cruz in Manila and San Juan, Rizal, to its new studio and transmitter site on Roxas Blvd in Pasay City.

He was born in&nbsp;Borongan, Samar on 29 Oct 1955.&nbsp;He is one of the two children of Eugenio Arago Abunda Sr, a politician, and Licerna Romerica Abunda, a retired public school teacher. He has been in a 30-year relationship with partner Elmer &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Boydon Quintana. He finished his elementary education at Borongan Pilot Elementary School, now Eugenio Daza Elementary School, in 1971 and high school at Seminario de Jesus Nazareno High School in 1975. He started studying business management at Ateneo de Manila in 1976, but the untimely death of his father in 1977, plus his distaste for math and the government-required Reserved Officers&rsquo; Training Corps or ROTC, forced Abunda to leave school in 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He worked at a variety of odd jobs to support himself, such as selling shampoos and encyclopedias, until he settled down in theater as assistant stage manager, eventually acting on stage. Later in his career, Abunda went back to school, finished a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in communication arts under the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program of the Commission on Higher Education in 2009, and earned a master of arts in communication arts in 2011, both at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, where he later taught radio and television production. He has since then started working on his doctorate in social development at the same university. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts invited him to serve as its ambassador for the Philippine International Arts Festival in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982, he became an assistant to Conchita &ldquo;Tita Conching&rdquo; Sunico, the executive director of the Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> where he learned the rudiments of public relations.

		"text": "<p><strong>Apeng Daldal</strong> <b> </b>(<b>Serafin Maniego Gabriel</b>) was a stage, film and television actor, comedian, singer, dancer, and scriptwriter. He was born in San Luis, Pampanga on 12 October 1928. He died on 9 February 1992. He was the son of Moises Gabriel and Mauricia Maniego. He was married to Elma Modesto with whom he had eight children. It is believed that his moniker was based on his set of big teeth (<i>apen</i> in his native Kapampangan) and his being a fast talker (<i>daldal</i>), although the nickname Apeng is also a diminutive of the first name Serafin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apeng Daldal began his career dancing in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a> in his Tondo, Manila neighborhood, where he was a favorite dancing partner of cross-dressers. In the late 1940s to 1950s, his performances in comedy skits at the Manila Opera House with Mar Lopez and Bebing Santos, who formed the trio Top Three, were a crowd drawer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, actor Johnny Wilson discovered him for television and put him in <b><i>The Big Show</i></b> with Cris de Vera, later becoming a mainstay in the sitcoms <b><i>Tindahan sa Nayon </i></b>(Village Store) and <b><i>Trio los Bobos </i></b>(The Three Idiots) in the 1970s and <b><i>Cafeteria Aroma </i></b>and <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b> in the 1980s. At the same time, Apeng Daldal began to make movies, mostly in supporting roles. In 1964, he appeared with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\">Susan Roces</a><strong> </strong> in <b><i>Libis ng Baryo</i></b> (Barrio Edge). His major movie roles were in <b><i>Magic Bilao </i></b>(Magic Winnowing Basket) and <b><i>Walis ni Tenteng </i></b>(Tenteng&rsquo;s Broom), both in 1965. His first starring role was in <b><i>Maskulado </i></b>(Muscular), also in 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apeng wrote scripts for several TV shows in the 1970s, including <b><i>Ayos Lang, Pare Ko </i></b>(It&rsquo;s Okay, My Friend) and <b><i>The Nida-Lita Show </i></b>on Channel 9, and <b><i>Barok-an Subdivision </i></b>on Channel 13. He was also on radio in the afternoon and evening timeslots. He wrote several songs, the most well-known of which were <b><i>Hoy, <strong>Mama</strong> ng Kaminero </i></b>(Hey, Mr Street Sweeper) and <b><i><strong> <strong>Pandanggo</strong> </strong> ng Aswang </i></b>(Fandango of the Viscera Sucker), both released in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though lacking in recognition from award-giving bodies, Apeng Daldal won praise from critics for his dramatic role in an episode of the TV drama series <b><i>Eliza</i></b>, 1970-72, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a><strong><strong> </strong> </strong> (Channel 9), deviating from his comic stereotype.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the movies Apeng Daldal appeared in were from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>, including <b><i>Alias Golden Boy</i></b>, 1963; <b><i>Babaing Kidlat</i></b> (Lightning Woman), <b><i>Mga Daliring Ginto</i></b> (Golden Fingers), <b><i>Show Business</i></b>, <b><i>Bandong Pugante</i></b> (Bando the Escapee), and <b><i>Simbangis ng Tigre</i></b> (Ferocious as a Tiger), 1964; <b><i>Tatlong Mabilis</i></b> (The Three Fast Ones), <b><i>Magic Bilao</i></b> (Magic Winnowing Basket), <b><i>Maskulado</i></b> (Muscular), <b><i>Tatlong Mabilis sa Hong Kong</i></b> (The Three Fast Ones in Hong Kong), and <b><i>Walis ni Tenteng</i></b> (Tenteng&rsquo;s Broom), 1965; <b><i>Mistico Meets Mamaw</i></b> and <b><i>Pitong James Bonds </i></b>(Seven James Bonds), 1966; <b><i>The Son of Dyango Meets Dorango Kid</i></b>, <b><i>Langit Pa Rin Kita</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Still My Heaven), and <b><i>The Pogi Dozen</i></b> (The Handsome Dozen), 1967; <b><i>Yolindina</i></b>, <b><i>Concentration Camp No. 5</i></b>, and <b><i>Ang Inyong Lingkod, <strong><strong> <strong>Matutina</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> (At Your Service, Matutina), 1975; <b><i>Habang Pinipigil, Lalong Nanggigigil</i></b> (The More You Try to Control, the More the Desire Gets Stronger), and <b><i>Wow, Sikat!

He was born in San Luis, Pampanga on 12 October 1928. He died on 9 February 1992. He was the son of Moises Gabriel and Mauricia Maniego. He was married to Elma Modesto with whom he had eight children. It is believed that his moniker was based on his set of big teeth (<i>apen</i> in his native Kapampangan) and his being a fast talker (<i>daldal</i>), although the nickname Apeng is also a diminutive of the first name Serafin."

		"text": "<p><strong>Lupita Aquino-Kashiwahara</strong> (<b>Guadalupe Lampa Aquino-Kashiwahara</b>), also known as Lupita Aquino-Concio, is a television and film director. She was born in Concepcion, Tarlac on 28 May 1934. She is one of the children of Aurora Lampa and Benigno Quiambao Aquino Sr, a former congressman, 1919-25, senator, 1928, secretary of agriculture under Commonwealth president Manuel L. Quezon, 1937, and Speaker of the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic, 1943-45. Her siblings are Maria Aurora Aquino-Lichauco, former senator Benigno Simeon Jr aka Ninoy, Maria Gerarda, Paul, former senator Agapito aka Butz, and former senator Maria Teresa Aquino-Oreta aka Tessie. Her brother Butz was a film and television actor. She is the aunt of TV host Kris Aquino and former president Benigno &ldquo;Noynoy&rdquo; Aquino III. She married her first husband Cesar Rafael Concio Jr in 1961, with whom she has six children, one of whom is Mia Concio, a screenwriter and former chair of the government station National Broadcasting Network Channel 4, formerly People&rsquo;s Television. Concio Jr was a recipient of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in the field of technology in 1966. After their separation and divorce, she married Emmy Award-winning Japanese journalist Ken Kashiwahara, who was then working as ABC&rsquo;s San Francisco bureau chief, in the early 1980s. She took up liberal arts, major in social studies and minor in journalism, at Maryknoll College (now Miriam College). She obtained a master of arts in communication, major in television, from the American University in Washington, DC, in the late 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she returned to the Philippines, she directed TV programs on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, beginning in the early 1960s, such as the children&rsquo;s program <b><i>Magnolia Sunday Party</i></b>; the instructional show <b><i>Education on TV</i></b>; the live 30-minute drama program <b><i>Family Theater</i></b> by Fr James Reuter, SJ, which usually featured adaptations of American plays; and <b><i>Northern Motors&rsquo; Filipinesques</i></b>, a music program that featured a 24-piece orchestra playing Filipino compositions. From 1963 to 1967, she worked with the Educational TV Project of Ateneo de Manila University under the leadership of Fr Leo Larkin. When she returned to television, she directed the pre-martial law drama anthologies on ABC 5: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1411\"><b><i>Balintataw</i></b></a> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), 1967-72, and <b><i><strong>Malikmata</strong> </i></b> (Illusion), 1972, the first TV horror-suspense-psychological drama in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her decision to go to filmmaking moved one critic to say that &ldquo;TV&rsquo;s loss was moviedom&rsquo;s gain&rdquo; (Nograles 1976, 7). She directed only a few films, but they are all memorable productions. Her first film directorial work was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere Productions</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i>Alkitrang Dugo</i></b> (Blood Tar), 1975, for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>&rsquo;s NV Productions. The movie was inspired by the English novel <b><i>Lord of the Flies</i></b> by William Golding. This was followed by Premiere Productions&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i>Magandang Gabi sa Inyong Lahat</i></b> (Good Evening Everyone), 1976, starring Aunor and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1237\"><b><i>Minsa&rsquo;y Isang Gamu-gamo</i></b></a> (<b><i>Once a Moth</i></b>), also in 1976, starring Aunor, a film critical of the Philippine-American relations, specifically the maintenance of US bases in the country. She also made Filmmaster&rsquo;s <b><i>Ibalik Mo ang Araw sa Mundong Makasalanan</i></b> (Bring Back the Sun to a Sinful World), 1978, which is based on a true occurrence: the theft of the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o to which religious folk attributed several calamities that befell them in Tondo. For <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>, she directed <b><i>Hati Tayo sa Magdamag</i></b> (Let&rsquo;s Split the Night between Us), 1988, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4531\">Edu Manzano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4487\">Jaclyn Jose</a>, and Tetchie Agbayani, and co-directed <b><i>Dear Diary</i></b>, 1989, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"> Lea Salonga</a>; and for Premiere, she made <b><i>Babae</i></b> (Woman), 1997, starring Aunor and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\">Judy Ann Santos</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While doing films, she continued directing the long-running TV music program <b><i>Superstar</i></b>, 1971-89, and <b><i>Ang</i></b> <b><i>Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b> (The Colorful World of Nora), 1970s-1980s, both on RPN 9. On top of these two shows, there was a time in the 1970s that she directed several shows a week&mdash;namely, <b><i>Sulyap sa Kalinangan</i></b> (A Look at Culture) with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3359\">Joy Virata</a><strong> </strong> on Fridays; <b><i>From the Mouths of Babes</i></b> and <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b>, both on Saturdays; and <b><i>Musika ng Lahi</i></b> (Music of the Race) and <b><i>Premyo sa Palaro</i></b> (Prize in Games), both on Sundays. She also directed the interview program <b><i>Celebrity Hour</i></b>, with Leila Benitez as host.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the fall of the Marcos administration, she continued directing TV programs, such as the drama series <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1417\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Bisperas</strong> ng Kasaysayan</strong> </i></b></a> (Eve of History), 1994, RPN 9; the single-airing drama <b><i>Evelio</i></b>, 1986, PTV 4, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4253\">Gina Alajar</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4706\">Joel Torre</a>; other dramas like <b><i>Higpitan Mo ang Yakap Mo</i></b> (Embrace Tight) and <b><i>Umaandap na Ningas</i></b> (Flickering Light); and the documentaries <b><i>Kataksilan sa Bayan</i></b> (Betrayal to the Nation) and <b><i>Sabwatan sa Kataksilan</i></b> (Conspiracy to Treachery), both in 2006, of RTV Malaca&ntilde;ang, which tackled the failed coup attempts against the Arroyo administration on 24 Feb 2006. She worked as a project consultant for the musical film <b><i>Emir</i></b>, 2010, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4650\">Chito Ro&ntilde;o</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, Aquino-Kashiwahara worked for the presidential election campaign of PresGloria Macapagal Arroyo and came to be known as the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;personal director.&rdquo; She personally oversaw the technical and production aspects of the president&rsquo;s activities, media appearances, photo opportunities, speeches, and press releases. Aquino-Kashiwahara works as a consultant with Digna Santiago in the Philippine Film Export Services Office of the Film Development Council of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She received the Patnubay ng Kalinangan Award from the city government of Manila, 1970, in connection with the Araw ng Maynila celebrations for &ldquo;her contribution to the development of Filipino drama on TV and helping to focus public interest in Philippine culture&rdquo; (Nograles 1976, 6). She and the programs and the artists she had directed won the Citizens&rsquo; Award for Television several times: Outstanding TV Director for <b><i>Balintataw</i></b>, 1967; Best Educational TV Program for <b><i>Education on TV</i></b>, 1966; Best News Interview Program for <b><i>J.

		"text": "<p><b>Dely Atay-Atayan&nbsp;</b>(<b>Adelaida Marquez Fernando-Cruz</b>) was a radio, television, and stage actor, and a singer. She was born in Tayabas, Tondo, Manila on 17 Mar&nbsp;1914. She died in Para&ntilde;aque on 30 Aug&nbsp;2004. She studied at Rizal Elementary School, Torres High School, and Philippine Normal School up to the second year. Her father Amado Fernando was a painter and composer, mother Carmen Marquez, a singer, and brother Fernando aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4831\">Ading Fernando</a> was an actor, scriptwriter, and director. When first spouse Alejandro Villegas, aka Andoy Balunbalunan, died, she married Catalino Cruz, aka Jockey Tenoy. Her only child with Villegas, Alfonso, is a dancer, while Alfonso&rsquo;s three daughters, Ann, Armi, and Aida, are actors. Her great-grandson, Manuel Villegas Quizon II, also the grandson of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, is an actor and singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atay-atayan was 15 when she first joined amateur singing contests in Binondo, where her family lived. She then landed a stint as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><i>kundiman</i></a> singer at the Palace Theater, touring the country as a member of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a> troupe from 1930 to 1934. It was also during this period when she began to sing on KZIB with her brother Ading. She also performed at the Clover Theater with comedians Dolphy, Aruray, the duo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, Casmot, Balot, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>. When she married Villegas in 1934, they became partners in Radio Variety Revue Company performing on stage and on the air. Radio programming manager G. S. Fernandez gave her the moniker Dely Atay-atayan while Matty Torres gave her husband the nickname Andoy Balunbalunan. Their nicknames (<i>atay</i> is Tagalog for liver while <i>balunbalunan</i> is chicken gizzard) led to their theme song &ldquo;Awit ng Manok&rdquo; (Song of the Chicken). Producing the most popular blocktime programs, the couple was the biggest earner among prewar radio blocktimers, making over one thousand pesos a month, a fabulous sum when top-level government employees earned 30 to 35 pesos a month. Some of their songs, interspersed with comic routines, were critical of the colonial condition at the time, such as &ldquo;Alila&rdquo; (Slave). Moreover, the husband-and-wife team sang radio commercials, the most popular being <b><i>Kiko Baterya</i></b> (Kiko Battery) and <b><i>Alviz Tailoring</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was tagged as &ldquo;queen of laughs,&rdquo; &ldquo;sweetheart of the airlanes,&rdquo; and Gracie Allen of the Philippines (referencing the American comedienne, half of the <b><i>George Burns and Gracie Allen Show</i></b>). She was outstanding in such radio shows as <b><i>Tang-tarang-tang</i></b> (Daddy-O), <b><i>Gabi ng Shell </i></b>(Night of Shell Company), and <b><i>Ay, Neneng</i></b> (Oh, Neneng). She formed a quartet called the Ancient Fox with Pugak, Lopito, and Doro de los Ojos. Even during the war, she continued performing comedy at the Life Theater and at the Manila Grand Opera House under the direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her first movie was <b><i>Lakambini</i></b> (Muse), 1940, opposite Balunbalunan. She made some five dozen films, including the popular movies of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere Productions</a>, like <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b> <b><i>at Paru-Paro</i></b> (Flower and Butterfly) and <b><i>Kumander Sundang</i></b> (Commander Dagger), 1948; <b><i>Padre Burgos</i></b> (Father Burgos), 1949; <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b> (Comic), 1950; <b><i>Mr. and Mrs.</i></b>, 1956; <b><i>Pitong Gatang</i></b> (Seven Gantas), 1959; <b><i>Nobody&rsquo;s Child</i></b>, 1970; <b><i>Mahiwagang Kris</i></b> (The Fantastic Kris), 1975; and <b><i>Buhay Misis</i></b> (Life of a Housewife), 1983. Her other films include <b><i>I Won, I Won: Ang Swerte Nga Naman</i></b> (I Won, I Won: How Lucky of Me), 1985; <b><i>Si Baleleng at ang Gintong Sirena</i></b> (Baleleng and the Golden Mermaid), 1988; <b><i>Everlasting Love</i></b>, 1989; and <b><i>Chickboys</i></b>, 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1970s to the 1980s, she concentrated on TV, appearing as the moralizing mother-in-law in the long-running comedy series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\">John en Marsha</a> </i></b>(John and Marsha),<b><i> </i></b>1973-1990, with Dolphy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>.

She died in Para&#xF1;aque on 30 Aug&#xA0;2004. She studied at Rizal Elementary School, Torres High School, and Philippine Normal School up to the second year. Her father Amado Fernando was a painter and composer, mother Carmen Marquez, a singer, and brother Fernando aka <a href=\"/8/69/4831\">Ading Fernando</a> was an actor, scriptwriter, and director. When first spouse Alejandro Villegas, aka Andoy Balunbalunan, died, she married Catalino Cruz, aka Jockey Tenoy. Her only child with Villegas, Alfonso, is a dancer, while Alfonso&#x2019;s three daughters, Ann, Armi, and Aida, are actors. Her great-grandson, Manuel Villegas Quizon II, also the grandson of <a href=\"/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, is an actor and singer."

It was also during this period when she began to sing on KZIB with her brother Ading. She also performed at the Clover Theater with comedians Dolphy, Aruray, the duo <a href=\"/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, Casmot, Balot, <a href=\"/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a>, and <a href=\"/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>. When she married Villegas in 1934, they became partners in Radio Variety Revue Company performing on stage and on the air. Radio programming manager G. S. Fernandez gave her the moniker Dely Atay-atayan while Matty Torres gave her husband the nickname Andoy Balunbalunan. Their nicknames (<i>atay</i> is Tagalog for liver while <i>balunbalunan</i> is chicken gizzard) led to their theme song &#x201C;Awit ng Manok&#x201D; (Song of the Chicken). Producing the most popular blocktime programs, the couple was the biggest earner among prewar radio blocktimers, making over one thousand pesos a month, a fabulous sum when top-level government employees earned 30 to 35 pesos a month. Some of their songs, interspersed with comic routines, were critical of the colonial condition at the time, such as &#x201C;Alila&#x201D; (Slave). Moreover, the husband-and-wife team sang radio commercials, the most popular being <b><i>Kiko Baterya</i></b> (Kiko Battery) and <b><i>Alviz Tailoring</i></b>."

		"text": "<p>The <strong>Catholic Mass Media Awards</strong> was established in 1978 under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Manila, through Archbishop Jaime Lachica Cardinal Sin. The awards are given in observance of International Social Communications Day to stress the importance of the mass media in the people&rsquo;s lives and to instill in communicators a sense of responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outstanding men and women and their works in mass media are chosen by a body of more than 50 jurors appointed by the archbishop of Manila. The jurors include academicians, civic and religious leaders, and the clergy. The awards are for 40 categories. The awards body stipulates that to be considered, works must be local productions produced and exhibited in the Archdiocese of Manila at any time during the year in consideration and must promote basic human values for total human development. These values include love for God, respect for the environment, positive Filipino values, and love for life. Over the years, CMMA has recognized works that reflect sensitivity to human rights and the integrity of creation; contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic growth; promote equity and accountability in the use of public resources and performance of public duties; portray nationalism and values of <i>pagkakaisa</i> (unity), <i>pagsasarili</i> (independence), <i>pakikipagkapwa-tao</i> (human relations), <i>pagkabayani</i> (heroism), and <i>pagiging makabuhay </i>(pro-life); and provide access to and participation by people, especially the poor. Awardees need not be Christian or Catholic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Winners are awarded a trophy called The Rock, a one-kilogram stone held on a wooden base with the staff of Saint Peter, a bronze banner, and an inscription: &ldquo;A tribute to the men and women who are serving God through media &ndash; Cardinal Sin.&rdquo; The trophy is composed of several symbolic figures: the rock, which underscores the role of the Catholic Church as the foundation of Filipino values in media; the mirror, which represents the Church&rsquo;s desire to reflect Catholic standards that bring about transformative changes in society; the curved figure with an upward movement, which represents a transformed Philippine society through the responsible use of mass media; and the two figures, which symbolize the harmonious mother-and-child relationship. Cesario &ldquo;Jhundy&rdquo; P. de Lina Jr designed in 2000 the current CMMA trophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CMMA has seven categories for media, one category for student works, and four special awards. Media categories include print, television, radio, film, advertising, music, and the Internet. Initially, the CMMA recognized communicators only in print, television, radio, and film in Manila. It added advertising in 1979 and music in 1980. In 1984, it began including entries from all over the country for assessment. In 2001, it added the category for the Internet, in response to the increased usage and distribution of content in new media platforms. On 7 Feb 2001, it instituted the Student CMMA, which recognizes the role of the youth in raising social consciousness through the media. In 2004, it began recognizing institutions and individuals with the Serviam Awards, primarily as a tribute to its founder, Cardinal Sin. The Pope John Paul Awards are given to a group or a person that creatively utilizes the mass media in evangelical service. The Hall of Fame Award is conferred on a mass media work that has won the CMMA for the same category for five times, though not necessarily in consecutive years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant year in the history of the CMMA was 1981, when Pope John Paul II personally handed out the trophies at the Radio Veritas auditorium. In 1986, after the EDSA Revolt, communicators who served the resistance against the Marcos dictatorship, including foreign media persons, were all given recognition. The body of jurors also began to include members of the academe, civil society, and public service. CMMA took a hiatus from 1998 to 1999. Following its return in 2000, it expanded from being just an award-giving body and organized in 2001 the first CMMA Media Fair. In 2013, social networks were featured as &ldquo;new spaces for evangelization.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first awardee for print in 1978 was Herky del Aguila&rsquo;s &ldquo;Service and Struggle in the Mountainsides,&rdquo; which was awarded Best Feature Article.

The jurors include academicians, civic and religious leaders, and the clergy. The awards are for 40 categories. The awards body stipulates that to be considered, works must be local productions produced and exhibited in the Archdiocese of Manila at any time during the year in consideration and must promote basic human values for total human development. These values include love for God, respect for the environment, positive Filipino values, and love for life. Over the years, CMMA has recognized works that reflect sensitivity to human rights and the integrity of creation; contribute to the country&#x2019;s economic growth; promote equity and accountability in the use of public resources and performance of public duties; portray nationalism and values of <i>pagkakaisa</i> (unity), <i>pagsasarili</i> (independence), <i>pakikipagkapwa-tao</i> (human relations), <i>pagkabayani</i> (heroism), and <i>pagiging makabuhay </i>(pro-life); and provide access to and participation by people, especially the poor.

Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong> <strong><strong>Ballet</strong> Philippines</strong> </strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\"><strong>Bayanihan Philippine National</strong><strong>FolkDance</strong>  <strong>Company</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\"><strong>Tanghalang Pilipino</strong></a></strong>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a></strong>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\"><strong>Cecile Licad</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Lea Salonga</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea O. Veneracion</strong></a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\"><strong>Antonio Maigue</strong></a></strong>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong> <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </strong></a>&rsquo;s novel, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\"><strong>Felipe Padilla de Leon</strong></a> and libretto by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a></strong>. De Leon and Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> </a>(Touch Me Not), first staged at the FEU Auditorium in 1957, was also restaged at the CCP in 1974, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3956\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Don David</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a> as Ibarra,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4158\"><strong>Ruby Salazar</strong></a></strong> as Maria Clara, Jimmy Melendres as Padre Damaso, and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\"><strong>Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</strong></a></strong> as Sisa. In 1984, the CCP and Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines commissioned  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a></strong> to create the three-act opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a></i></b> (The Black She-wolf), with libretto by Cuyugan-Asensio. In 1987, the CCP partnered with Music Theater Foundation in another restaging of <b><i>Noli&hellip;</i></b> this time with  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3920\"><strong>Nolyn Cabahug</strong></a></strong> as Ibarra,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3982\"><strong>Andion Fernandez</strong></a></strong> as Maria Clara, and Cuyugan-Asensio as Sisa (alternating with Luz Morete). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\"><strong>Rolando Tinio</strong></a>&rsquo;s Philippine adaptation of <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> were also produced by and staged at the CCP in 1991 and 1992, respectively.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos.

After a few years, then station manager Charlie Filamor tried her on the air by making her read commercials, spin records, and give time checks. When a program emcee lost her voice, Custodio filled in for her. This break led to her first regular programs where she emceed the amateur singing contest <b><i>Search for Superwheel Singing Star</i></b>, the singing contest for the elderly <b><i>Diri Pa Kami Laos</i></b> (We Are Not Yet Has-Beens), and the counterpart for children <b><i>Wee Wee Jamboree</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She then became part of the public service program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tion Bulig</i></b> (Operation Help), which led her to news and commentary programs. In 1984, she became part of management when she was appointed operations manager. While serving as the station&rsquo;s newscaster, Custodio was appointed station manager of DYVL&rsquo;s sister station on the FM band, DYMS. In 1994, MBC appointed her DYVL station manager. She then expanded the station&rsquo;s public service programs by creating <b><i>Kasayuran ha Balaud</i></b> (Knowledge of the Law) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>at Po, Doktor</i></b> (Thank You, Doctor).

Manila 14 Oct 1946. Television host, movie actor, comedian, composer, writer, visual artist. He is the son of Jose Seoane de Leon and Emma Manahan Ramos. He has two children with actor and former wife Daria Ramirez: Joseph Joachim &ldquo;Keempee&rdquo; de Leon and Jacinda Myrtle &ldquo;Cheenee&rdquo; de Leon, who are also actors. He is married to Eileen Macapagal with whom he has three children. He grew up in Sampaloc, Manila, studied at Juan Sumulong High School, and proceeded to study business administration at the University of the East and, later, architecture at National University, both of which he did not finish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe started working at age 15. He worked as hauler of tissue paper, mall salesman, Commission on Elections fieldman, technician at the National Institute of Science and Technology, and promotions boy of a broadcasting company. De Leon believes that his quirky humor and popular appeal were formed by his early life as a poor member of a rich clan and his experiences in the odd jobs he took on.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His career as a broadcast artist began in the 1960s when he served as a disc jockey for half a decade in a dozen FM radio stations, mostly owned by pre-martial law <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>. A break came with a hosting job in the gag show <b><i>Ok Lang</i></b> (It&rsquo;s Okay) on IBC 13, 1973, where he first worked with the Sotto brothers (Tito, Vic, and Val), Ricky Manalo, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>. Tito and Vic became his co-hosts in a new GMA musical show, <b><i>Discorama</i></b>, 1975, and the trio did comedy newscast segments that featured hilarious interpretations of Top 40 hit songs using farcical lyrics written by Joey. The three later became hosts of GMA&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b>, 1976. Their comedic group became popular in the IBC 13 sitcom <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b> (School Bumps), 1977, where they spoofed a bunch of lazy, ambition-less students making fun of people around them. The trio formed in 1979 the noontime variety show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!), now the longest-running TV program in the country. His humor spoofs advertisements, situations, and characters, especially movie king <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Jr. The language of his spoofs usually conveys double meanings and sexual insinuations.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Leon appeared in 54 television shows as either a host or a cast member.

He acted in leading roles in the RPN 9 comedy sitcom <b><i>Joey and Son</i></b>, 1980, with Ian Veneracion and the IBC 13 gag show <b><i>T.O.D.A.S.</i></b>, 1978-88, in which he played Helen Bola and Indoy Badidoy, imitations of broadcaster <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a> and entertainment talk show host Inday Badiday, respectively. Among his notable TV programs are the prank show <b><i>Wow Mali </i></b>(Oh No, It&rsquo;s a Mistake) on ABC/TV5, 1996, and revived as <b><i>Wow Mali Pa Rin </i></b>(Oh No, It&rsquo;s a Mistake Again) after a few years of break; <b><i>Nuts Entertainment</i></b> on GMA, 2003-8; <b><i>Mel &amp; Joey </i></b>on GMA, 2004-11; and <b><i>Takeshi&rsquo;s Castle </i></b>on Q Network / GMA, 2006-9.

He mounted his back-to-back exhibit <b><i>Fish and Chips</i></b>, with Igan D&rsquo;Bayan at the Crucible Gallery in 2009.

Its call letters stand for its brand name, Radio Veritas (Truth Radio). Broadcasting 24 hours daily from its studios in Veritas Tower on 162 West Ave corner EDSA, Quezon City, DZRV&rsquo;s programming includes news, commentary, public affairs programs, and talk shows on health and other issues. Being a religious station, its slogans are &ldquo;<i>Makinig</i>&rdquo; (Listen), &ldquo;<i>Sumainyo ang katotohanan</i>&rdquo; (May the truth be with you), and &ldquo;<i>Kapanalig</i>&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> in faith).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of Radio Veritas began in 1950 when the University of Santo Tomas established DZST (for Santo Tomas) as an instrument to spread the gospel. In 1961, DZST was transferred to the Philippine Radio Educational and Information Center Inc (PREIC), which was organized to manage Radio Veritas, and its call letters were changed to DZRV. PREIC, chaired by Rufino Cardinal Santos, was established as a Catholic Asian broadcasting system, with support from the Federal Republic of Germany and Australian bishops, among others. However, the station took several years to go on air due to delays in the arrival of new equipment from Germany. It finally went on test broadcast in 1968, and was inaugurated on 11 Apr 1969 with some Asian bishops in attendance, including Antonio Cardinal Samore who represented Pope Paul VI. The programming on this day included a broadcast transmission from Radio Vatican, relaying the message of Pope Paul VI. When the pope visited the Philippines the following year, he blessed DZRV&rsquo;s studios, then located in Pope Pius XII Center along United Nations Ave. It broadcast both on the AM band and on shortwave for overseas broadcast. Its studios later moved to Fairview Park, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1973, following the death of Cardinal Santos, the station suffered financial difficulties, which forced it to reduce programming hours. The new archbishop of Manila, Jaime Cardinal Sin, then changed its management, acquired new equipment, recruited a new staff, and developed a new format. The station recovered and in 1975 it was back on air for 18 hours a day. It also changed its call letters to DWRV. It shed off its image as an elite station and assumed a mass-oriented personality, with programs appealing to the poor, rural listeners, and laborers. Without abandoning classical music, it began to air Filipino music. Trying to combine religion and education that appealed to the masses, the station enlisted famous cinema, radio, and television stars such as Tiya <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a>-Roa, Bert &ldquo;Tawa&rdquo; Marcelo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4900\"><strong>Matutina</strong></a>, and Nova Villa. Veteran commercial radio broadcaster Orly Punzalan was hired as program consultant to restructure the station. Soap operas then became part of programming, conveying religious and social messages, such as <b><i>Serviam </i></b>(Latin for &ldquo;I will serve,&rdquo; the motto of Cardinal Sin), <b><i>Nasaan</i></b> (Where), <b><i>Buhay Pa si Pilato </i></b>(Pilate Is Still Alive), and <b><i>Mariang Eba</i></b> (Mary Eve).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio Veritas is best remembered by the public for its key role in major political events in the 1980s. The assassination of Sen Benigno Aquino Jr on 21 Aug 1983 signaled the station to take a critical stance toward the martial rule of Pres Ferdinand Marcos. Radio Veritas was the only broadcast station that covered the entire 12-hour funeral procession that brought Aquino&rsquo;s body from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> in Quezon City to the Manila Memorial Park in Para&ntilde;aque, with an estimated two million people in the procession and lining the streets. Radio stations, including Radio Veritas, then became bolder in their political commentary in the following months. However, it was only Radio Veritas that, at first, covered the tabulations made by the National Citizens&rsquo; Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) when Marcos called for a snap presidential election on 7 Feb 1986. Namfrel&rsquo;s count challenged that of the Commission on Elections. The latter proclaimed Marcos reelected. This meant Aquino&rsquo;s widow, Corazon, was defeated, which the public doubted. Because of reports of alleged fraud, Cebu Archbishop Ricardo Cardinal Vidal issued a statement on behalf of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines condemning the elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two weeks later, on Saturday, 22 Feb 1986, the historic EDSA Revolt began. Defense MinisterJuan Ponce Enrileand Armed Forces of the Philippines Vice Chief of Staff and Philippine Constabulary Chief Fidel V. Ramos announced in a press conference their withdrawal of support from Marcos. Enrile asked Radio Veritas to cover the announcement as he holed himself up in Camp Aguinaldo across Camp Crame on EDSA. The public then heard Cardinal Sin calling people on the air via Radio Veritas to go to EDSA to protect Enrile and Ramos. The effect was almost immediate; people began to go to EDSA that afternoon and by nightfall a siege was underway. Only Radio Veritas was covering the event live. Not one of the other television and radio stations broke regular programming to announce the unfolding revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The following day, Sunday, 23 Feb 1986, the station&rsquo;s transmitter was bombed, presumably by Marcos partisans.

DZRH, which had just aired Marcos&rsquo;s press conference where he declared that he was in control of the situation, declined. After considering DZFE in Bulacan, Reuter and Keithley went to DZRJ on Santa Mesa, Manila, just a few blocks from Malaca&ntilde;an. DZRJ, then off the air as it was shut down by the military years earlier, was the perfect choice. DZRV&rsquo;s frequency of 810 kHz on the AM band was next to DZRV&rsquo;s 846 kHz. Enrile&rsquo;s staff, Col Ruben Ciron, a broadcaster, shifted the DZRJ frequency to 840 kHz, as close as possible to the DZRV frequency, so people would find it on the dial more easily. Keithley then called children&rsquo;s television show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot</i></b> (Small but Strong) executive producer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4771\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4772\"><strong>Lyca Benitez-Brown</strong></a></strong></a> for help.

Hundreds of Assumption nuns, who were the only ones not yet on EDSA, came and sat on the steps leading to the radio studio at the top floor of the eight-story J&amp;T Building to protect the broadcast. With Keithley as anchor, the volunteers handled the telephones and two-way radios and verified and wrote stories that came in. Without disclosing the station&rsquo;s location, Radyo Bandido broadcast updates on the developments on EDSA and called on people to keep coming to the site, appealed for food and water for the people keeping vigil on EDSA, and transmitted military orders from rebel officers to rebel soldiers in the field. The four-day demonstration swelled up to an estimated three million people, who blocked the movement of army tanks still loyal to Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Defections from Marcos to the rebels followed.

In 1961, DZST was transferred to the Philippine Radio Educational and Information Center Inc (PREIC), which was organized to manage Radio Veritas, and its call letters were changed to DZRV. PREIC, chaired by Rufino Cardinal Santos, was established as a Catholic Asian broadcasting system, with support from the Federal Republic of Germany and Australian bishops, among others. However, the station took several years to go on air due to delays in the arrival of new equipment from Germany. It finally went on test broadcast in 1968, and was inaugurated on 11 Apr 1969 with some Asian bishops in attendance, including Antonio Cardinal Samore who represented Pope Paul VI. The programming on this day included a broadcast transmission from Radio Vatican, relaying the message of Pope Paul VI. When the pope visited the Philippines the following year, he blessed DZRV&#x2019;s studios, then located in Pope Pius XII Center along United Nations Ave. It broadcast both on the AM band and on shortwave for overseas broadcast. Its studios later moved to Fairview Park, Quezon City."

The station recovered and in 1975 it was back on air for 18 hours a day. It also changed its call letters to DWRV. It shed off its image as an elite station and assumed a mass-oriented personality, with programs appealing to the poor, rural listeners, and laborers. Without abandoning classical music, it began to air Filipino music. Trying to combine religion and education that appealed to the masses, the station enlisted famous cinema, radio, and television stars such as Tiya <a href=\"/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a>-Roa, Bert &#x201C;Tawa&#x201D; Marcelo, <a href=\"/8/69/4900\"><strong>Matutina</strong></a>, and Nova Villa.

Founded on 17 Jun 1967, it operates from its own building complex on 25 Central Ave, Diliman, Quezon City. On 26 Apr 1968, its first radio station, DZEC, went on the air at 1062 kHz on the AM band, from its first studio in Delta Building on the corner of Quezon Blvd and West Ave. With Tagalog as its language medium, it had a format of news, public affairs, and music. In 1971, it acquired a second AM station, DZBU. However, it was short-lived. When all media outfits closed by the government upon the declaration of martial law by Pres Ferdinand Marcos reopened, DZBU remained off the air while DZEC resumed broadcast. EBC then moved its studios to Maligaya Building on 882 EDSA, Quezon City. With signals originating from Manila, DZEC&rsquo;s programs are relayed throughout the country through DWIN 1080 kHz in Dagupan, DZEL 1260 kHz in Lucena, DYFX 1332 kHz in Cebu, and DXED 1224 kHz in Davao, all branded as Radyo Agila (Eagle Radio).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, with a new Philippine Constitution following the ouster of Marcos in 1986, the government gave EBC a franchise to run a second station, DWDM at 95.5 MHz on the FM band. The station ceased broadcast in 2007 for an equipment upgrade, then returned in 2011 with the brand Pinas FM 95.5. Its format is devoted to original music from Filipino artists and talents. Like DZEC, it streams live online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1990s, the network laid the groundwork for television broadcasting. On 23 Apr 2000, EBC launched station Net 25 on the UHF television band, with a powerful 120-kilowatt transmitter and state-of-the-art television technology. Its programs include imported canned shows on technology and science as well as news and lifestyle and entertainment shows. Apart from Net 25 in Manila, the station airs nationwide through Channel 46 in Baguio, Channel 41 in Cebu, and Channel 39 in Davao. While webstreaming, it is also transmitted via cable throughout the country and via satellite around the world, with partner agencies in the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and Northeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2013, EBC launched the web-based Eagle News Service, with correspondents in different parts of the world, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Canada, United States, Japan, and Dubai, filing news stories in audio and video formats. Accessible at eaglenews.ph, the site also streams the signals of the network&rsquo;s stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Though run commercially, EBC reflects the doctrine and beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo, its owners being members of the said church. Net 25&rsquo;s programming includes the religious program <b><i>Ang Tamang Daan</i></b> (The Right Path) and other INC-produced evangelical programs. The INC&rsquo;s political inclinations are also apparent on EBC. In Apr 2001, Net 25 was the only television station that covered live the pro-Estrada rallies of support for ousted president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>, whom the INC backed. This coverage was followed by the airing of news and public affairs programs <b><i>Agila Reports</i></b> (Eagle Reports) and <b><i>Liwanagin Natin</i></b> (Let Us Explain). It also then tried but later abandoned the <b>teleradyo</b> (television-radio) format with DZEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DZEC received the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)</strong></a> Golden Dove Award for Best Children&rsquo;s Program for <b><i>EC Ka Lang Bata</i></b> (Take It Easy Kid) in 1996 and Best Comedy Program for <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock Na</i></b> (It&rsquo;s Already Six O&rsquo;Clock) in 1996. The 2011 KBP Golden Dove Award for Best Culture and Arts Program was given to Net 25&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1458\"><strong>Landmarks</strong></a></i></b> and to Janice de Belen as Best Magazine Program Host.

Founded on 17 Jun 1967, it operates from its own building complex on 25 Central Ave, Diliman, Quezon City. On 26 Apr 1968, its first radio station, DZEC, went on the air at 1062 kHz on the AM band, from its first studio in Delta Building on the corner of Quezon Blvd and West Ave. With Tagalog as its language medium, it had a format of news, public affairs, and music. In 1971, it acquired a second AM station, DZBU. However, it was short-lived. When all media outfits closed by the government upon the declaration of martial law by Pres Ferdinand Marcos reopened, DZBU remained off the air while DZEC resumed broadcast. EBC then moved its studios to Maligaya Building on 882 EDSA, Quezon City. With signals originating from Manila, DZEC&#x2019;s programs are relayed throughout the country through DWIN 1080 kHz in Dagupan, DZEL 1260 kHz in Lucena, DYFX 1332 kHz in Cebu, and DXED 1224 kHz in Davao, all branded as Radyo Agila (Eagle Radio)."

The station ceased broadcast in 2007 for an equipment upgrade, then returned in 2011 with the brand Pinas FM 95.5. Its format is devoted to original music from Filipino artists and talents.

Its programs include imported canned shows on technology and science as well as news and lifestyle and entertainment shows. Apart from Net 25 in Manila, the station airs nationwide through Channel 46 in Baguio, Channel 41 in Cebu, and Channel 39 in Davao. While webstreaming, it is also transmitted via cable throughout the country and via satellite around the world, with partner agencies in the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and Northeast Asia."

The INC&#x2019;s political inclinations are also apparent on EBC. In Apr 2001, Net 25 was the only television station that covered live the pro-Estrada rallies of support for ousted president <a href=\"/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>, whom the INC backed. This coverage was followed by the airing of news and public affairs programs <b><i>Agila Reports</i></b> (Eagle Reports) and <b><i>Liwanagin Natin</i></b> (Let Us Explain). It also then tried but later abandoned the <b>teleradyo</b> (television-radio) format with DZEC."

Caloocan, Rizal 6 Oct 1914. d. 11 Feb 1976. Radio soap scriptwriter, voice talent, singer, film actor, columnist, bilingual fictionist, biographer, lyricist, cartoonist, teacher. Her parents were Fernando Flores, a poet and journalist in Spanish and Tagalog, and Silvina Chanco, a sister of the well-known novelist and translator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5172\"><strong>Gerardo Chanco</strong></a>. Her brother Virgilio &ldquo;Beer&rdquo; Flores was a television scriptwriter while sister Loida is a radio voice actor and a writer of radio, television, and film scripts. She was married to Francisco &ldquo;Koko&rdquo; Trinidad, one of the pioneers of Philippine broadcasting. Among their four children are comedian <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></strong> and editorial cartoonist and comic strip artist Francisco &ldquo;Corky&rdquo; Flores Trinidad Jr. She attended Rizal Elementary School, Manila North School (now Arellano High School), and Malabon Normal School (now Saint James Academy) where she completed secondary education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Barely out of high school in the early 1930s, Flor hosted a morning program on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a> with her distant cousin Ding Yalong, who just won the title Bing Crosby of the Philippines. In 1934, she transferred to KZRM where she sang in the morning program <b><i>Sunrise Club</i></b> with Cecilio Lloyd, aka The Mystery Singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\"><strong>Cecil Lloyd</strong></a>, and in the evening program <b><i>Klim Dancing Party</i></b> with the Three Ramons&mdash;Ramon Escudero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>, and Ramon Alberto. In 1935, while carrying the nickname Little Lark, Flor won the title Miss Radio KZRM. At around the same time, she started writing her first magazine column, the first column on radio, Ye Music Lovers&rsquo; Nook, for <b><i>Graphic</i></b>, which featured letters from radio fans; radio talents such as Ramon Escudero, Ramon Navales, Luz Mat. Castro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\"><strong>Carmen Rosales</strong></a>, and Francisco &ldquo;Koko&rdquo; Trinidad; and news about the radio industry. Soon, she also became KZRM&rsquo;s publicity manager. Then, she shortened her radio name from Carolina Flores to <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her first in a series of landmark radio programs was the pre-World War II radio show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1506\"><strong>Si Aling Juanang Mapag-impok</strong></a></i></b> (The Thrifty Madam Juana), which she wrote and hosted as the character Aling Juana from 1938 to 1940 on KZRM. The show included short dramas, advice to listeners who wrote letters seeking guidance, and discussions on domestic matters and proper behavior.

He is the seventh of nine children of a Philippine Navy dental surgeon and a schoolteacher. He entered the College of Business Administration of theUniversity of the Philippines in the late 1950s but quit school on his third year. He is married to Gloria Dominguez with whom he has four children. He served as vice president for radio, then executive vice president for television, and later general manager of GMA, 1974-86. He was president of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> Corporation, 1997-2003, from being its chief operating officer after the EDSA Revolt in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first brush with the television industry was when he sold spots for MBC Channel 11 in the early 1960s, while at the same time selling cars, which he had learned to do while he was in college. He then sold spots for CBN Channel 9 in the late 1960s, eventually becoming its sales manager.

The present headquarters of GMA are on EDSA corner Timog Ave in Diliman, Quezon City. Its 777-foot transmitter, called Tower of Power and erected on 7 Nov 1988, is located in Tandang Sora, Barangay Culiat, Quezon City. Its pre-martial law transmitter, with a triangular base, was right beside its building on EDSA, with each side of the transmitter bearing the number 7, but its numbers were destroyed by Typhoon Yoling in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popularly known as Channel 7, GMA traces its roots to Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; La Rue Stewart, an American war correspondent of the Mutual Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> who arrived in the Philippines with the liberation forces of General Douglas MacArthur in 1944. When World War II ended, Stewart remained in the country and married a Filipina, Loreto Feliciano. On 14 Jun 1950, the couple&rsquo;s corporation, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, ventured into broadcasting through DZBB Radio. It operated from the fourth floor of the Calvo Building on the Escolta in Manila. The couple expanded their operations in 1955 to include DZXX, an AM-band station with a music format. It was the first popular music radio station in the country. In 1957, DZBB and DZXX moved their operations from the Escolta to a new site on EDSA. Also in 1957, the network opened its radio stations DYSS in Cebu and DYOO in Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 29 Oct 1961, Stewart started the operations of its television station, DZBB TV Channel 7, using very minimal equipment: two old cameras, a surplus transmitter, and no lighting equipment. It was the third television station in the Philippines to be established after World War II. The network opened its second station, DYSS Channel 7 Cebu, in 1963. By 1972, it had established radio stations in Dagupan, Laoag, Legazpi, and Roxas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The network changed its name several times: Republic Broadcasting Corporation (RBS) in 1963, Greater Manila Area (GMA)&ndash;Radio Television Arts on 28 May 1974 and operating under the slogan &ldquo;Where You Belong,&rdquo; GMA <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/985\"><strong>Rainbow</strong></a> Satellite Network or Rainbow Network on 30 Apr 1992, and GMA Network Incorporated in 1996, with GMA now standing for Global Media Arts, under the banner &ldquo;Kapuso&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> at Heart) beginning on 27 Oct 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stewart enjoyed substantial investments from the American Broadcasting Company of the USA. He was mainly responsible for the programming of DZBB during its early years, doing most of the promotional announcements himself. The first programs aired on radio included the satire <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), the radio drama <b><i>Camay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a> Theater</i></b>, the variety show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage), and the newscast <b><i>Newscoop</i></b>. The news was a major component of the station&rsquo;s programming. The news highlights for radio included live news coverage of social and political events, such as the congressional and senate sessions, the 1953 presidential elections, detailed accounts of the crash of Ramon Magsaysay&rsquo;s plane in Mount Manunggal highlighted by live telephone interviews, which was rarely done during the period, and the 1951 eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok. Entertainment and educational programs were aired live. Some of the radio programs migrated to television when Channel 7 was opened in 1961, with Stewart anchoring <b><i>The News with Uncle Bob</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Channel 7&rsquo;s pre-martial law programming consisted of canned shows from the USA and the United Kingdom, such as <b><i>Mission Impossible</i></b>, <b><i>The Untouchables</i></b>, <b><i>77 Sunset Strip</i></b>, <b><i>Combat</i></b>, and <b><i>Ben Casey</i></b>. In the 1960s, it launched the first TV show for children, <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b>, the dance variety program <b><i>Dancetime with Chito</i></b>, the children game and singing competition show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\"><strong>Eskuwelahan</strong></a>g Munti</i></b> (Little Schoolhouse), the counseling program <b><i>Father Bob and His Telephone</i></b>, and the horror show <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> (Night of Terror).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">GMA was closed down when martial law was imposed in 1972. When the 1973 Constitution took effect, which prohibited foreigners like Stewart from owning mass media in the Philippines, Marcos presidential aide Gilberto M. Duavit Sr, Stewart legal counsel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4845\"><strong>Felipe L. Gozon</strong></a>, and lawyer-businessman <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4858\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4860\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Menardo R. Jimenez</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> bought the controlling interest in RBS-DZBB. The station reopened two years after the declaration of martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On radio, DZBB, which focused on news, public affairs, and entertainment during its early broadcast in 1955, shifted to music and personality-oriented programs during the martial law period. Noted radio personalities of DZBB were news commentators Rafael &ldquo;Paeng&rdquo; Yabut and counseling program hosts <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a>; the latter two would also have their own television programs later. A radio program that caught the curiosity of many was the daily program of Johnny Midnight from midnight to 2:00 am, which featured a water therapy session called &ldquo;toning&rdquo; and pyramid healing. In 1976, DZXX was relaunched as DWLS in the FM band, with LS standing for Loreto Stewart, the wife of owner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4964\"><strong>Bob Stewart</strong></a>; it played oldies and pop music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">GMA earned the moniker &ldquo;The Popeye Station&rdquo; during this period because of its excessively rerun syndicated show, the cartoon program <b><i>Popeye</i></b>. GMA&rsquo;s financial stability during the martial law period was maintained partly because of the station&rsquo;s imported canned shows, such as <b><i>Charlie&rsquo;s Angels</i></b>, <b><i>Love Boat</i></b>, <b><i>Three&rsquo;s Company</i></b>, <b><i>CHiPS</i></b>, <b><i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i></b>, <b><i>Dance Fever</i></b>, <b><i>The 700 Club</i></b>, and the highly popular Japanese cartoon program <b><i>Voltes V</i></b>. The pre-martial law <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> talk program, <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b> reappeared on Channel 4, then moved to GMA. Among popular Channel 7 programs of the period were the noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b>, 1975-86; the drama soap <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, 1980-86; the drama-counseling programs <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday), 1976-86, and <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>, 1980-96; the drama program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4942\"><strong>Coney Reyes</strong></a>-Mumar Drama Studio</i></b>, 1977-81; the magazine talk show <b><i>Ms. Ellaneous</i></b>, 1976-81; the showbiz-oriented talk program <b><i>See-True</i></b>, 1979-87; the sitcoms <b><i>Baltic &amp; Co.</i></b>, 1974-76, <b><i>Prinsipe Abante</i></b> (Prince Abante), 1979, and <b><i>Cafeteria Aroma</i></b>, 1982; the public service program <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko</i></b> (I Love My Fellowman), which premiered in 1974 and continued on air after martial law; and the dance shows <b><i>Discorama</i></b>, mid-1970s, and <b><i>Penthouse 7</i></b>, 1982-87, which featured the segment of the irreverent &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Buding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the station&rsquo;s programs tested the boundaries of censorship, particularly after the assassination of Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr. <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b> featured and interviewed activists and opposition leaders in some of its episodes; it also featured a 15-minute tribute to Ninoy Aquino, including footage of his funeral. GMA was daring enough to devote a limited time of its primetime news to the funeral procession; testimonies claim the on-air coverage ran for only eight seconds. Tina Monzon Palma&rsquo;s outfit of black or yellow, the symbols of the opposition, <b><i>on News at Seven</i></b>, or the expressions on her face revealed her distrust of the news stories she was reading. Channel 7&rsquo;s news reporters or anchorpersons would roll their eyes as they talked about the accomplishments of the dictator. Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno Jr interviewed newly widowed Cory Aquino on his talk program <b><i>Viewpoint</i></b> in 1984, during which Aquino announced her decision to run for the presidency. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a> came out with a GMA exclusive on the Marcos hidden wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, GMA reoriented its radio programming to news, relaunching DZBB-AM as Radyo Bisig Bayan (Radio with the People) in 1989, then recast it as Super Radyo (Super Radio). &ldquo;The Giant&rdquo; DWLS 97.1 FM followed an easy listening format, playing mellow standards, but eventually adopted mass-based programming in the 1990s to reach the <i>masa </i>(masses), rebranding its FM station as DWLS 97.1 &ldquo;Barangay LS.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">GMA was one of the targets of two major coup attempts during the post-EDSA period. The 28-29 Aug 1987 coup, one of the most serious destabilizing attempts by the military, led by then lieutenant colonel Gregorio Honasan, to overthrow the Corazon Aquino government, attacked Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, seized portions of Camp Aguinaldo, and took GMA, together with ABS-CBN and the government-owned PTV 4, under siege; 40 GMA employees were held hostage by Col Oscar Canlas. GMA was again one of the targets of another bloody military coup attempt in Dec 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">GMA went to broadcasting on UHF or ultra-high frequency. It launched DWDB-TV Channel 27 on 27 Aug 1995. Popularly known as CityNet Television from 1995 to 1999, Entertainment Music Channel (EMC) from 1999 to 2001, and resumed as CityTV in 2005, it was GMA&rsquo;s main outlet for imported programs, freeing up slots in GMA&rsquo;s programming for more domestic productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 14 Feb 2004, GMA Network launched its first international channel, GMA Pinoy TV, available in key cities in the USA, the Middle East, Australia, and some parts of Asia and Europe. The network went into media-related ventures, such as GMA Films in 1998.

IBC Channel 13 has headquarters in Broadcast City at Capitol Hills in Diliman, Quezon City. Its transmitters are on Roosevelt Ave in San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was first known as Inter-island Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) DZTV Channel 13 when it was founded in 1960, then as Radio Mindanao Network (RMN)&ndash;IBC TV 13 in 1962 and as Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation when it was acquired by the Benedicto Group of Companies in 1975. It was given E13 as its new name in 1987, was renamed back to Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation in 1989, carried the name Islands TV 13 from 1990 to 1992, and finally back to Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation beginning in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">IBC was first owned by American businessman Dick Baldwin. It made its first broadcast on 1 Mar 1960. In 1962, businessman Andres Soriano Sr, who had investments in A. Soriano Corporation, also known as Anscor, and the food and manufacturing giant San Miguel Corporation, bought IBC-TV 13 from Baldwin. Soriano also bought the controlling interest in RMN, which operated radio and television stations, from brothers Henry and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4779\"><strong>Reuben Canoy</strong></a> of Cagayan de Oro. Soriano was at that time also the owner of the daily newspaper <b><i>The Philippines Herald</i></b>. Also in 1962, Soriano merged his radio and television acquisitions into one entity&mdash;RMN-IBC. The radio and television station operated at the old ABS transmitter site, acquired by Soriano from the Lopezes, in Little Baguio in San Juan, which was then part of Rizal Province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Soriano passed away in 1964, his son Andres Soriano Jr took over IBC. The proclamation of martial law in Sep 1972 led to the temporary closure of RMN-IBC, which became operational again before the end of 1972 since Marcos did not consider Soriano a threat to national security. Martial law also stopped the publication of <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b>, which never resumed publication even after the ouster of Marcos in 1986. The Canoy brothers bought back RMN during the martial law period while Soriano sold IBC to Marcos ally Roberto Benedicto, who was by then operating two television stations&mdash;Banahaw Broadcasting System (BBC) Channel 2 and RPN Channel 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1975, IBC started operating DWKB-FM 89.1, a pop music-format station. By 1977, IBC operated 12 TV and 18 radio stations. In 1976, IBC 13 moved to its new site at Broadcast City in Old Balara, together with BBC 2 and KBS-RPN 9. When it was sequestered by the Aquino government in 1986, IBC 13 had 20 television stations nationwide. After the EDSA Revolt in 1986, BBC Channel 2 handed over to IBC 13 the radio station DWWA, renamed DWAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pre-martial law programming on IBC 13 consisted mostly of foreign shows from Columbia Broadcasting System of the USA. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> popular local show was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4780\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\"><strong>Joe Cantada</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Fistorama</i></b>, which featured local boxing matches.

IBC 13 hardly had any public information show before 1986, except for its news programs, but it came out with a series of socially relevant documentaries, which included <b><i>People Power: The Philippine Experience</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Ceasefire</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Keithley Report: The U.S. Bases</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Ramut: The Roots of Revolution in the Cordillera</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Tiempo Muerto: Crisis and Poverty in Negros</i></b> (Down Time: Crisis and Poverty in Negros), 1986; <b><i>Autonomy: No Shortcut to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></i></b>, 1987; and <b><i>Hamon sa Pamahalaan, Hamon sa Taumbayan</i></b> (Challenge to the Government, Challenge for the People), 1987.

From 1996 to 2002, the station&rsquo;s income heavily relied on its airing of the games of the Philippine Basketball Association. The station&rsquo;s programming and facilities continued to deteriorate beginning in the mid-1990s. It continues to air programs produced by blocktimers, amidst talks of selling and privatizing the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some programs of IBC 13 won the Citizens Awards for Television, the Gawad <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> para sa Radyo at Telebisyon, the Catholic Mass Media Awards, the Star Awards for Television of the Philippine Movie Press Club, and the Golden Dove Awards of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas.

IBC 13 hardly had any public information show before 1986, except for its news programs, but it came out with a series of socially relevant documentaries, which included <b><i>People Power: The Philippine Experience</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Ceasefire</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Keithley Report: The U.S. Bases</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Ramut: The Roots of Revolution in the Cordillera</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Tiempo Muerto: Crisis and Poverty in Negros</i></b> (Down Time: Crisis and Poverty in Negros), 1986; <b><i>Autonomy: No Shortcut to <a href=\"/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></i></b>, 1987; and <b><i>Hamon sa Pamahalaan, Hamon sa Taumbayan</i></b> (Challenge to the Government, Challenge for the People), 1987. All these were produced under the management of IBC 13 president Noel Tolentino and public affairs manager Teresita G. Maceda."

It ventured into television in Nov 1969, launching KBS 9 in Manila and KBS 12 in Baguio City. The station changed its name to Radio Philippines Network in 1975. During the martial law period, RPN 9 operated in Broadcast City at Old Balara in Quezon City, together with broadcast stations Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) Channel 13 and Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Channel 2, all under Benedicto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KBS/RPN 9, under the management of Benedicto&rsquo;s daughter Kitchie, was the dominant media network during the height of the martial law period in the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s before its TV and radio stations were taken over by the post-1986 EDSA administration. It has undergone several rebranding since then: New Vision 9 in 1989, back to RPN 9 in 1994, C/S9 in 2008 when it entered into a partnership with Solar Entertainment Corporation, Solar TV in 1999 when it expanded its ventures with Solar, as Entertainment Central (ETC) in 2011 when the government started privatizing the network&rsquo;s assets, Solar News Channel in 2013 and 9TV in 2014 when ownership of majority shares to the station changed rapidly from one corporation to another, and finally CNN Philippines on 16 Mar 2015, becoming the third CNN affiliate in Asia; the other two are in Indonesia and India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KBS/RPN 9 was the first station to go on full color broadcast. The network&rsquo;s launch in 1969 carried the identification tag &ldquo;Accucolor 9.&rdquo; Accucolor was the color technology used by the station. The station was also the first to employ an outside broadcast (OB) van in its news operations, having acquired in 1970 a color-ready OB van for the remote broadcasts of major news events and sports coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KBS/RPN 9 was the first Philippine network to go on full satellite broadcast daily. The Benedicto group, having drawn loans from the government-owned Philippine National Bank, expanded the operation of the station to 12 regions of the country. On 21 Sep 1977, the fifth anniversary of the declaration of martial law, Benedicto inaugurated domestic satellite communications or DOMSAT, with RPN 9 serving as its transmitting network of 11 satellite earth stations nationwide and for all special broadcasts from the Office of the President. RPN 9 also served as the relay station of IBC&rsquo;s 12 TV and 18 radio stations, as well as those of BBC and the government broadcast station GTV Channel 4. DOMSAT went full blast in its operation in Jan 1980 in preparation for the provincial and municipal elections during the same year, which made possible the national coverage of candidates under Marcos&rsquo;s political party, the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan. It also made possible the influx into the network of many foreign entertainment programs and specials. Through DOMSAT, the daily noontime variety program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) of RPN 9 was able to expand its viewership, enabling the program to dislodge from the top spot its rival program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> of RBS-GMA 7. RPN 9 also attracted top transnational corporations for its advertisements&mdash;namely, Unilever&rsquo;s Philippine Refining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Consolidated Foods Corporation, Nestle&rsquo;s Filipro, San Miguel Corporation, Pepsi Corporation, Radiowealth, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The lone fully domestic corporation advertiser it had was Banco Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RPN 9 also enjoyed other benefits from the Marcos administration. In 1978, Marcos gave control of the television industry to RPN 9 by overturning a law that encouraged domestic production of TV receivers and, through Letter of Instruction 640, gave Nivico, a Japanese-Benedicto joint TV manufacturing venture, sole tax- and duty-free component import rights. Nivico&rsquo;s principal foreign partner was the Japanese transnational conglomerate Marubeni, a television manufacturer, which became the major supplier of RPN 9 and DOMSAT. Other major television manufacturers protested the decree, but nothing came out of the protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1976, RPN 9 was the highest earner among broadcast stations of the period. It had a total TV sales recorded at 67.4 million pesos. In 1977, RPN enjoyed a whopping 50 percent audience market share. By 1978, RPN had 13 TV stations and at least 31 radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RPN 9 was the network where Marcos declared the imposition of martial law in Sep 1972. The station absorbed some programs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> during the martial law period, under new titles. Examples were <b><i>Si Tatang Kasi</i></b> (Blame It on Father), which became <b><i>Naku Po, Tatang</i></b><i> </i>(Oh No, Father), and <b><i>Mrs. Milyonarya</i></b> (Mrs Millionaire), which was given the title <b><i>Ginang Milyonarya</i></b> (Madam Millionaire). RPN 9 produced some of the most highly rated programs of the martial law period until the early years of the post-EDSA administration, such as the weekly music variety show <b><i>Superstar</i></b>, 1971-89; the comedy series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a></i></b> (John and Marsha), 1973-90, <b><i>Cafeteria Aroma</i></b>, 1979, <b><i>Duplex</i></b>, 1982-84, and <b><i>Buddy en Sol</i></b>, 1990-95; the gag show <b><i>Champoy</i></b>, 1981-85; the daily soap operas <b><i>Mga Kuwento ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Love), 1977, <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, 1979-84, <b><i>Heredero</i></b> (Heir), 1984-87, and <b><i>Agila</i></b> (Eagle), 1987-89; the drama anthologies <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b> (The Colorful World of Nora), 1974-79, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4942\"><strong>Coney Reyes</strong></a>-Mumar <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> Studio</i></b>, 1984-89, and <b><i>Hilda Drama Specials</i></b>, 1989; the children&rsquo;s programs <b><i>Clubhouse 9</i></b>, 1977-78, and <b><i>Kaluskos</i> <i>Musmos</i> </b>(Kiddie Noise), 1979-89, produced by presidential daughter Imee Marcos; the game show <b><i>Spin-a-Win</i></b>, 1975-85; and the talk show <b><i>Tell the People</i></b>, 1981-97. RPN 9 aired <b><i>Malayo Pa ang Umaga</i></b>, 1979, based on the novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1829\"><strong>Without Seeing the Dawn</strong></a></i></b>, 1947, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5400\"><strong>Stevan Javellana</strong></a> and produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>, which could be considered the first miniseries on Philippine television, later to be billed telenovela in the 2000s. A two-hour special was the animation version of the Iluko epic <b><i>Biag ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a> </i></b>(Life of Lam-ang), which aired on 21 Sep 1979. It was an unusual project because animation was rarely pursued in Philippine television, particularly during this period. RPN 9 was the original home of the noontime variety show <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b><i> </i>from 1979 to 1989 before the show moved to ABS-CBN, 1989-94, and finally settled on GMA beginning in 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The station innovated on news programs, such as having two editions of the daily English newscast <b><i>NewsWatch</i></b>: the evening edition at 7:00 pm and the final edition at 10:00 pm, hosted in pair and alternately by Harry Gasser, Caloy Prieto, Ernie Fresnido, Pat Lazaro, Cielo Villaluna, Cathy Santillan, and Eric Eloriaga. <b><i>NewsWatch</i></b> was the first ever live TV newscast aired nationwide via satellite. <b><i>NewsWatch</i> </b>added in its programming the weekly <b><i>NewsWatch: Junior Edition</i></b>, 1976-93, with children, like Janice de Belen and Cathy Babao, reading the news or talking about the issues of the day in a freewheeling discussion portion presided over by producer Agnes Caballa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RPN could be considered one of the early networks that ushered in the concept of live global satellite programming in local television. Important global events it covered live included the 1972 Munich Olympics, the early Muhammad Ali fights, the <b><i>Aloha from Hawaii</i></b> concert of Elvis Presley in 1973, and the 1974 Miss Universe pageant in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the days of the EDSA Revolt, RPN 9 covered a parallel presidential inauguration of Marcos, the same network where he announced the declaration of martial law in 1972, and then the last media outlet still in the control of the Marcos government in 1986. The coverage of the inauguration was interrupted. Rebel forces had taken over RPN. The Corazon Aquino administration sequestered RPN in the aftermath of the EDSA Revolt, but it was allowed to continue its operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The station managed to bounce back a bit in 1996 when it offered the daily Mexican telenovela <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, dubbed in Filipino. The program became a monster hit, which dislodged the newscast <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> of ABS-CBN from its number one ranking in the ratings game. The program significantly altered the landscape of the late afternoon and evening primetime programming. The success of <b><i>Marimar</i></b> provided the impetus for broadcast networks to produce daily drama serials in the early evening primetime programming. By the late 1990s, the daily drama serials, either locally produced or imported, had started to flood the airwaves, with Latin American telenovelas dominating the evening programming. With the phenomenal popularity of <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, RPN offered more Mexican telenovelas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RPN 9, however, continued to suffer from complicated legal tussles, conflicts in the switching ownership of shares from one private interest to another, and the intensely competitive field of commercial broadcasting. CNN took over the station in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many top TV network executives, entertainers, and media professionals in the post-1986 broadcast and media industries, particularly in the GMA, ABS-CBN, and ABC 5 networks, trained and honed their creative, technical, journalistic, and managerial talents at KBS/RPN 9. They included June Rufino, Salvii Casino, Mel Tiangco, Wilma Galvante, Marivin Arayata, Redgie Acu&ntilde;a, Vic Vianzon, Bobby Barreiro, Linggit Tan, Cory Valenzuela, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a>, Kiko Evangelista, Johnny de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4569\"><strong>Rod Navarro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\"><strong>Peque Gallaga</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4595\"><strong>Butch Perez</strong></a>, Bert de Leon, Argel Joseph, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4907\"><strong>Maria Montelibano</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\"><strong>Nonoy Marcelo</strong></a>, and Joe Taruc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RPN 9 programs and its artists and broadcasters dominated the three years of the Sinag Awards given by the Philippine Academy of Television Arts and Sciences from 1975 to 1978.

The program became a monster hit, which dislodged the newscast <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> of ABS-CBN from its number one ranking in the ratings game. The program significantly altered the landscape of the late afternoon and evening primetime programming. The success of <b><i>Marimar</i></b> provided the impetus for broadcast networks to produce daily drama serials in the early evening primetime programming. By the late 1990s, the daily drama serials, either locally produced or imported, had started to flood the airwaves, with Latin American telenovelas dominating the evening programming. With the phenomenal popularity of <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, RPN offered more Mexican telenovelas."

Romeo Jalosjos figured prominently in its creation and the organization&rsquo;s subsequent concept of self-regulation. Then connected with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4964\"><strong>Bob Stewart</strong></a>&rsquo;s Republic Broadcasting System, the precursor company of GMA 7, Jalosjos rallied several media owners to commit themselves to an organization that would serve as the voice of the industry to government. Media owners were apprehensive of full government control of the broadcast industry under martial law, which suppressed the basic freedom of expression and endangered broadcast media owners&rsquo; business interests. Thus, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster <i>sa </i>Pilipinas (Association of Broadcasters <i>in</i> the Philippines) was born, renamed after the EDSA Revolt as Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster <i>ng </i>Pilipinas (Association of Broadcasters <i>of</i> the Philippines).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first general membership meeting and the election of the board took place on the day of its formation.

Choa of the Visayan Broadcasting Corporation as executive vice-president and vice-president (VP) for the Visayas; Romeo Jalosjos of RPN as VP for Greater Manila; Antonio C. Barreiro of NB as VP for Luzon; Abelardo L. Yabut Sr of NBC as VP for Mindanao; Jose D. Hinlo of the AFP as treasurer; Don Lee of IBS as board secretary; and Hernadez Baldo of HBC, Roberto V. Gozum of FBN, Emilio Tuazon of TRBC, and Antonio Ilustre as directors. Except for Tuazon and Ilustre, nine were part of the original 15 incorporators of the association. The other six original incorporators were Andre Khan of TRBC, Wilfredo Camomot of RMN, Arcadio Carandang of MBS, Rebueno Hodreal of UBN, Guillermo Torres Sr of UMBN, and Jose Borromeo of PBS/BBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another media personality who figured prominently in the life of the KBP was newspaper columnist Teodoro Valencia who at that time had the ears of President Marcos.In Jun 1974, he was elected president of KBP. Valencia led KBP board members in convincing Marcos that the broadcast industry, now united under one umbrella, was ready to professionalize and regulate its ranks. The government then was mainly overseeing sizeable concerns of telecommunications and media, through the Department of Public Information, the Media Advisory Committee (MAC), the Bureau of Standards for Mass Media (BSMM), the Telecommunications Control Bureau, and the Board of Communications. A devolution of media regulation was seen as advantageous to the broadcast industry. The mission proved successful. On 8 Nov 1974, one-and-a-half years after KBP was formed, Marcos signed Presidential Decree (PD) 576 abolishing the MAC and the BSMM, and creating the Broadcast Media Council (BMC) and the Print Media Council (PMC). Before the end of 1974, KBP officers were appointed as members of the BMC, a move that laid the foundation for the self-regulatory nature of the Philippine broadcast industry, which is expressed in one of the provisions of PD 576: &ldquo;the various sectors of mass media have shown capability for self-regulation and internal discipline within its ranks and have demonstrated responsibility for maintaining standards for professional conduct and excellence &hellip; and the prevailing national situation has become appropriate for taking a further step toward removal of government participation in policy determination and news dissemination activities of mass media.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When martial law was lifted in Jan 1981, the BMC and the PMC were abolished through PD 1784, which gave the broadcast and print media the power to establish other self-regulatory bodies of their own. The role of the BMC to set industry standards and discipline broadcasters was subsequently given to the KBP, which ultimately formed its own enforcement body, the KBP Standards Authority, thereby strengthening broadcast self-regulation in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The policymaking body of KBP is an 11-member Board of Trustees elected by the general membership during the annual Top Level Management Conference. The board is composed of a chair, a vice chair, president, an executive vice president, a vice president each for television and radio, a secretary, a treasurer, and three directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Membership in the KBP is open to any natural or juridical grantee of a congressional franchise or a permit or license to operate given by the National Telecommunications Commission. There are three membership classifications: charter member, an original KBP member at the time of the approval of the association&rsquo;s by-laws; regular member, any natural or juridical person who represents a grantee of a franchise or a permit or certificate to operate, holds the position of chair, president or its equivalent in the network, and has the authority to bind the regular member he or she represents in the KBP; and associate member, any radio or TV station operated by a regular member as represented by its station manager. Only charter and regular members have the right to vote and be elected to office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From an original 29 member networks, the KBP, as of Oct 2014, had 128 member networks. Under each member network are several individual radio and TV stations. As of 2014, KBP&rsquo;s membership covers 775 broadcast stations nationwide: 415 FM radio stations, 248 AM radio stations, and 112 TV stations. This represents about 90 percent of the total number of radio and television stations nationwide. As of Jan 2015, KBP has 35 active local chapters nationwide, which initiate and manage local projects, coordinate national-initiated programs, monitor broadcasters, and hear and solve cases filed against practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The activities, projects, and daily operations of the KBP are coordinated and managed by a national secretariat headed by an executive director who oversees four departments: projects and administrative, credit and collection, finance and accounting, and standards authority. It holds office on the sixth floor of the LTA Building in Legaspi Village, Makati City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KBP has made its mark in the industry. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of its major accomplishments was its designation, by Republic Act 9369, to receive a copy of the electronically transmitted election returns from the Commission on Elections (Comelec) in the automated elections in 2003. The act enabled KBP member stations to have immediate and direct access to election returns. In 2014, with KBP as one of the petitioners against a revised Comelec ruling, the Supreme Court decided on the allowable number of political advertising load in all broadcast media. Instead of the aggregate number of 120 minutes for all TV and 180 minutes for all radio political advertisements per candidate, the Supreme Court upheld Comelec&rsquo;s original ruling of 120 minutes per individual TV station and 180 minutes per individual radio station for every candidate for national offices. This decision was favorable to KBP members&rsquo; business interests. KBP also got the court&rsquo;s approval for broadcast networks to cover high-profile cases, which normally media would have been banned to cover, which included the live coverage of Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>&rsquo;s plunder case in 2001 and the Ampatuan massacre trial in 2011. KBP has protected its members from advertisers who reneged on their financial obligations to member stations. It has implemented self-discipline among its members, banning broadcasters found committing unethical practices from going on the air. It made major revisions in its Broadcast Code, particularly on the coverage of crime, crisis situations, and children, resulting from incidents such as the Rizal Park hostage-taking by a policeman of several Chinese tourists on 23 Aug 2010 and the Janjan macho dance controversy on TV5&rsquo;s program <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b> on 12 Mar 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A new challenge confronts KBP now. With new media platforms, specifically the Internet, competing with the broadcast industry, the KBP has to reinvent itself anew to sustain its authority and credibility in the field and continue its role to guide and serve its members and, more importantly, its multiple publics. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosa Maria T.

It has implemented self-discipline among its members, banning broadcasters found committing unethical practices from going on the air. It made major revisions in its Broadcast Code, particularly on the coverage of crime, crisis situations, and children, resulting from incidents such as the Rizal Park hostage-taking by a policeman of several Chinese tourists on 23 Aug 2010 and the Janjan macho dance controversy on TV5&#x2019;s program <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b> on 12 Mar 2011."

Manila 10 Mar 1947. d. Quezon City 24 Nov 2013. Actor, program host, comedian, producer, broadcast journalist. She was the daughter of a Filipino mother and an American father. She was married to Angelo Castro Jr, an actor and broadcast journalist. Their son Diego is also an actor and broadcaster. She attended St Paul College where she met Jesuit priest James Reuter, who became her lifelong confessor, mentor, and friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning in college, Keithley acted and sang in Reuter&rsquo;s theater productions, such as <b><i>The Sound of Music</i></b>, where she took on the lead role of Maria, and <b><i>Man of La Mancha</i></b>. Her exposure to a wider public began in 1969 when she joined the cast of the comedy-gag show <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>. The show lasted until martial law was declared in 1972. She then hosted several short-lived television programs: <b><i>Lollipop Party</i></b>, a children&rsquo;s show, and the talk shows <b><i>Changes</i></b> and <b><i>Total Woman</i></b>, later renamed <b><i>Over the Saya.</i></b> In 1976-78, she produced and hosted the weekly evening talk show <b><i>The Late Hour with June and Johnny</i></b> on Channel 7. She also acted in films, including <b><i>Durog</i></b> (Crushed), 1971; <b><i>Blood Compact</i></b>, 1972; and <b><i>Lunes, Martes, Miyerkoles, Huwebes, Biyernes, Sabado, Linggo</i></b> (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Keithley transformed from an entertainment media personality into a news and public affairs broadcaster when she played a significant part in the popular bloodless revolt that ousted President Marcos in 1986, variously called the EDSA Revolt and People Power Revolution, a demonstration of an estimated three million people on EDSA. She was then in the announcing staff of DZRV Radio Veritas, which had taken a critical stance toward Marcos following the assassination of Marcos&rsquo;s political rival Sen Benigno Aquino Jr on 21 Aug 1983, allegedly by military men. When Marcos called for snap elections for president, which took place on 7 Feb 1986, the opposition party fielded Aquino&rsquo;s widow Corazon. DZRV stood out as the media organization that most closely followed the progress of the polling. The Commission on Elections declared Marcos winner based on its tabulation, which did not tally with the count of the National Citizens Movement for Free Elections. Namfrel&rsquo;s count indicated Aquino won the election. Popular sentiment believed this, proven by the ensuing massive rallies called by Aquino, calling for civil disobedience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos&rsquo;s hold on power broke when two weeks later Defense MinisterJuan Ponce Enrileand Armed Forces of the Philippines Vice Chief of Staff and Philippine Constabulary Chief Fidel V. Ramos announced in a press conference in Camp Aguinaldo on EDSA their withdrawal of support from Marcos. Enrile made sure DZRV was among the media organizations around to cover the announcement. He and Ramos blockaded themselves with their men and requested the public to surround them to press Marcos to yield power to Aquino. Archbishop of Manila Jaime Cardinal Sin responded to his request by calling people on the air via DZRV to go to EDSA to protect Enrile and Ramos. The mammoth demonstration that grew in number over the next four days quickly followed. When the transmitter of DZRV, the only broadcast station covering the event live, was bombed allegedly by Marcos loyalists, Reuter and Keithley moved the broadcast to DZRJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was a risky clandestine operation, with DZRJ&rsquo;s studios just a few blocks from Malaca&ntilde;an. Keithley called for reinforcements from her friends and colleagues in media. Among the dozens who came was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot</i></b> (Small but Strong) executive producer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4771\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4772\"><strong>Lyca Benitez-Brown</strong></a></strong></a>, who gave the station the name Radyo Bandido, and who asked her mother to organize hundreds of nuns to surround the station to protect the broadcast. For 14 straight hours, Keithley was on the air broadcasting updates on the developments on EDSA and calling on people to keep coming to the site, appealing for food and water for the people keeping vigil on EDSA, and transmitting military orders from Ramos and other rebel officers to rebel soldiers in the field. The day after the rebel forces captured government television station Channel 4, and following Marcos&rsquo;s departure from the country and Aquino&rsquo;s proclamation as new president, Keithley closed the Radyo Bandido broadcast and joined the provisional anchor panel on Channel 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the historic broadcast, Keithley pursued both political and religious stories, several of which she produced as television documentaries. As a journalist, she was the first to scale the Cordillera Mountains to interview Cordillera People&rsquo;s Liberation Army leader Conrado Balweg. (Balweg subsequently entered into peace negotiations with Aquino.) In 1990, she produced and narrated the religious documentary <b><i>The Woman Clothed with the Sun</i></b>, about Marian apparitions in Lipa,<b><i> </i></b>for the EWTN Global Catholic Network. In 2011, she produced the documentary <b><i>EDSA 25: Sulyap ng Kasaysayan</i></b> (EDSA 25: A Glance at History) for ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Keithley was honored by the Catholic Mass Media Awards in 1986 for her reporting on EDSA. She was conferred the Legion of Honor by Pres Corazon Aquino in 1986, making her a reservist in the Armed Forces of the Philippines with the rank of general. In 1991, the Gawad CCP para sa Telebisyon named her documentary <b><i>The Woman Clothed with the Sun</i></b> Best Special. In 2013, Pres Benigno Simeon Aquino III gave her and Reuter the Spirit of EDSA Award at the 27th year commemoration of the revolt. She was given full military honors when she was laid to rest on 29 Nov 2013.<em><strong> Written byElizabeth L.

When Gen Douglas MacArthur landed in Leyte on 20 Oct 1944, he went on the air using a portable transmitter to announce to the Filipinos that he had returned. He called the station the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4989\"><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></a>, after the resistance station that aired from Corregidor from Jan to May 1942 as the combined Filipino and American forces fought to fend off the Japanese at the beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. The new Voice of Freedom was later given the call letters WVLC, whose transmitter was one of 10 MacArthur brought back to blanket the Philippines with news about the end of World War II and with American programming. The transmitters were scattered throughout the Philippines to operate as temporary radio stations. Five months later, WVLC and its transmitter were sent to Manila. On 26 Mar 1945, it began broadcasting from a radio ship named <b><i>Apache</i></b>, which was moored in the Pasig River near Jones Bridge. Another transmitter, which was set up as station WVTM operating in Polo, Bulacan, was also moved to Manila at around the same time. It broadcast from the sixth floor of what remained of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\"><strong>Insular Life Building</strong></a> in downtown Manila. Shortly thereafter, MacArthur sent most of the transmitters, including that of WVLC, to Japan together with the American forces that invaded Japan. The transmitters that remained were consolidated into one station with the call letters KZFM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KZFM was named after Frederic Marquardt, an American newsman in the prewar <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b> and a close friend of MacArthur. He was with MacArthur&rsquo;s forces that landed in Leyte to retake the Philippines from the Japanese. KZFM was first operated by the US Department of National Defense Office of War Information, and then turned over to the United States Information Service (USIS) at the end of the war. On 4 Jul 1946, KZFM, together with newly opened radio stations KZRH and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4872\"><strong>KZPI</strong></a>, covered live the declaration of Philippine independence from the Unites States and the inauguration of the Second Republic of the Philippines, with Manuel Roxas as president. Three months later, the USIS turned the station over to the Philippine government on 20 Oct 1946, exactly two years after the Leyte landing. At first it was supervised by the office of Vice Pres and foreign affairs secretary Elpidio Quirino. Pres Roxas initiated a fund of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>,000 US dollars for its operation, and then moved the station under his supervision in 1947. KZFM became the nucleus of a network of government radio stations established under the Philippine Broadcasting System (PBS). On 1 Jan 1949, call letters in the Philippines shifted from K to D; thus, KZFM became DZFM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the first KZFM staff were Bill Sanford and Abigail Jacobs. Jacobs later established a radio station for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a> in Dumaguete. Francisco &ldquo;Koko&rdquo; Trinidad joined KZFM&rsquo;s staff almost from its beginning, then became its manager once it was turned over to the Philippine government. Among the Filipinos he recruited to join the production and announcing staff were Johnny Arville, Jess Fernandez, Gene Ildefonso, Mon Ylanan, Eddie Avelino, Gabby Tabu&ntilde;ar, and Gumsy Alba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KZFM relayed signals from the Voice of America, the newly organized radio system operated by the US government. As DZFM, the station was affiliated with American networks in the beginning, and thus had access to popular American programs. The local programs in the 1950s included news, music, and variety shows. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> program, the <b><i>Radio Newsreel</i></b>, was about the news, presented using the drama format. Trinidad and his announcers as well as voice actors simulated the voices of world leaders and other newsmakers. The station&rsquo;s most popular program was the variety show <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> (Edong the Dreamer), with Eddie San Jose, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a>, Tugo, Joan Page, and Eddie Avelino, written by Beer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>. <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> became the model of variety shows in rival stations, such as <b><i>Tuloy ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b> (On with the Fun), which in turn inspired later variety shows on television. The sitcom <b><i>Pitong Pasikat</i></b> (Seven Braggarts) featured Lopito and Lopita and real-life brothers Ferdie and Corky Trinidad. Another popular show was the music program <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/898\"><strong>Harana</strong></a></strong> ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a></i></b> (Ruben Tagalog&rsquo;s Serenade), with guitarist Ruben Torres and bass player cum comic <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Fernando</strong>. <b><i>The Big Top</i></b>, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>, Joan Page, Ben Rubio, and Pugo, was another variety show that often had film stars as guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Pres Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, PBS was abolished.

At first it was supervised by the office of Vice Pres and foreign affairs secretary Elpidio Quirino. Pres Roxas initiated a fund of <a href=\"/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>,000 US dollars for its operation, and then moved the station under his supervision in 1947. KZFM became the nucleus of a network of government radio stations established under the Philippine Broadcasting System (PBS). On 1 Jan 1949, call letters in the Philippines shifted from K to D; thus, KZFM became DZFM."

As DZFM, the station was affiliated with American networks in the beginning, and thus had access to popular American programs. The local programs in the 1950s included news, music, and variety shows. <a href=\"/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> program, the <b><i>Radio Newsreel</i></b>, was about the news, presented using the drama format. Trinidad and his announcers as well as voice actors simulated the voices of world leaders and other newsmakers. The station&#x2019;s most popular program was the variety show <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> (Edong the Dreamer), with Eddie San Jose, <a href=\"/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a>, Tugo, Joan Page, and Eddie Avelino, written by Beer <a href=\"/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>. <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> became the model of variety shows in rival stations, such as <b><i>Tuloy ang <a href=\"/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b> (On with the Fun), which in turn inspired later variety shows on television. The sitcom <b><i>Pitong Pasikat</i></b> (Seven Braggarts) featured Lopito and Lopita and real-life brothers Ferdie and Corky Trinidad. Another popular show was the music program <b><i><strong><a href=\"/5/40/898\"><strong>Harana</strong></a></strong> ni <a href=\"/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a></i></b> (Ruben Tagalog&#x2019;s Serenade), with guitarist Ruben Torres and bass player cum comic <strong><a href=\"/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Fernando</strong>. <b><i>The Big Top</i></b>, with <a href=\"/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>, Joan Page, Ben Rubio, and Pugo, was another variety show that often had film stars as guests."

Quezon registered the station with the International Union of the Telegraph in Switzerland, KZND first went on the air on 30 Apr 1941, seven months before Japan attacked and subsequently invaded the Philippines. <a href=\"/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>ted by the Office of Publicity and Propaganda of the Civil Emergency Administration (CEA), KZND&#x2019;s last two call letters stood for &#x201C;national defense.&#x201D; Broadcasting on shortwave at 3790 kilocycles, it prepared people for the war by conducting emergency drills and instructing people on how to behave during air raids, and updated listeners on the progress of the war already raging in Europe."

Lindenberg</b>) b. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA 21 Dec 1921. d. 28 Apr 2009. Soldier, engineer, businessman, broadcast media owner, and Philippine television pioneer. He was married to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> S. Lindenberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lindenberg was the first to acquire a Philippine franchise to operate a television station for his Bolinao Electronics <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (BEC). A US Air Force officer who was part of the American troops who fought the Japanese and ended the war in the Philippines in 1945, he established the BEC in 1946 upon discharge from the US military and after marrying Soledad S. Lindenberg of Bolinao, Pangasinan. With his wife, Patrocinio Hennings, John Hennings, and Jose Calado, he first set up a local radio transmitter manufacturing operation using surplus war communications equipment. In 1949, he applied for a television franchise, which Congress granted on 14 Jun 1951. Unable to import equipment necessary to go on the air due to import restrictions at the time, he shifted to radio and established DZBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1952, Judge Antonio Quirino bought the majority shares of BEC and renamed it Alto Broadcasting System (ABS). His goal was to use television to help campaign for his brother Elpidio, who was seeking reelection to the Philippine presidency. With help from the Radio Corporation of America, the new company sent Arcadio Carandang, Romualdo Carballo, Harry Chaney, and Jose Navarro to the United States for technical training and import equipment to put the first Philippine television station on air on 23 Oct 1953. Lindenberg remained part-owner, executive vice president, and chief operating officer of ABS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Elpidio Quirino was not reelected. ABS then suffered from financial difficulties due to the high cost of production of local programs and weak advertiser support given the low number of households with television sets. The station relied mostly on imported canned shows. In 1957, Eugenio Lopez and his brother Fernando acquired ABS from Lindenberg and Quirino. The Lopezes then already owned Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). In 1961, the Lopezes combined the two companies and called it <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lindenberg is often called the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Television,&rdquo; but the same honor is also accorded Antonio Quirino. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Gian Carlo C.

All these enabled E&ntilde;ing to mobilize resources, acquire interests in a series of interlocking businesses, and keep their resources and power intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wealthy Jalandoni-Lopez line had interests in the sugar industry and regional politics as early as the 19th century. Iloilo was then the sugar bowl of the Philippines. When E&ntilde;ing&rsquo;s father Benito, a reelected governor of Iloilo, was gunned down by his political opponents in 1908, young E&ntilde;ing and brother Fernando inherited and ran their family&rsquo;s share of the sugar plantation Hacienda Calasagan, a printing press that published <b><i>El Tiempo</i></b>, and other properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The brothers revived the Spanish-language daily <b><i>El Tiempo</i></b>, the first issue of which came out on 1 Jun 1929. The newspaper waged a crusade against <i>jueteng</i>, an illegal numbers game, that implicated then Iloilo governor Mariano Arroyo and resulted in the governor&rsquo;s removal from office in 1930. They also founded the English-language daily <b><i>Iloilo Times</i></b>, the first issue of which came out on 1 Mar 1932. E&ntilde;ing&rsquo;s entry into the press industry established him as a force to reckon with in Iloilo politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">E&ntilde;ing&rsquo;s and Fernando&rsquo;s concerns expanded to businesses in land, sea, and air transport beginning in the 1930s, dominating the provincial, regional, and national transport. Their investments included the bus and taxi company Iloilo Transportation <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, the regional ferry service Iloilo Shipping, both in 1931, and the first Filipino airline, the Iloilo-Negros Air Express Company (INAEC), in 1932. The brothers bought out the Panay Autobus Company, a major competitor of their bus company that they purchased at 80,000 pesos, way below the original owners&rsquo; investment capital of 300,000 pesos, in 1938.The brothers also invested in real estate in Baguio and acquired the Philippine Portland Cement Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Lopez businesses were devastated during the Japanese occupation. INAEC&rsquo;s planes were destroyed by the Japanese on an air raid in 1941. <b><i>El Tiempo</i></b> was taken over and renamed <b><i>Panay Shu-ho</i></b> by the Japanese in 1942, which the occupying forces used for propaganda. Panay Autobus&rsquo;s 300 buses were commandeered by the Japanese also in the same year. Eugenio and his family moved to Baguio in 1943, and funneled funds to support the guerrillas while playing cordial politics with the Japanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Business and politics intertwined like siblings during this crucial period and onward. Eugenio moved to Manila after World War II. The brothers resumed their transport business, foremost of which was their commercial aviation operation of the Far Eastern Air Transport Inc (FEATI) in 1945, which established itself as the country&rsquo;s first international airline that had its first flight service to San Francisco, California, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a>, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and India. E&ntilde;ing, however, was forced to sell FEATI to its rival Philippine Airlines in 1947, which was well supported by government funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fernando entered politics as Iloilo mayor in 1945, a time of postwar reconstruction. A close alliance with then president Sergio Osme&ntilde;a was advantageous to E&ntilde;ing&rsquo;s business interests. Fernando became senator in 1947, then secretary of agriculture, which made easier the granting of special privileges to the businesses led by his brother. During this time, local politicians who desired power needed the capital of the elite. Fernando&rsquo;s position as vice president of Quirino in the 1940s and later Marcos in the 1960s entrenched the influence of the Lopez family, who likewise provided funds for the political campaigns of their political allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A significant move by E&ntilde;ing was when he moved to public utilities like communication and power generation, beginning with the acquisition of the news daily <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b> in 1947, which ran in 1949 a series of expos&eacute;s on Senate president Jose Avelino. He, together with either brother Fernando or other partners, embarked on a series of buyouts and acquisitions beginning in the 1950s, mainly in the sugar industry, such as substantial shares to control the country&rsquo;s and Asia&rsquo;s largest sugar mill, Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company (Biscom), in 1951; the New York-based Sugar Brokers Inc in 1956, which handled the sale of Biscom sugar to the US market; and the Pampanga Sugar Mills Inc (Pasumil), also in 1956. They withdrew from the sugar industry when they sold Biscom and Pasumil to Trans-Philippine Investment Corporation in 1962, which proved to be a wise move when the industry started showing signs of a decline. E&ntilde;ing and allies also put up the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank in 1959, earning a third spot among the biggest banks in the country in a span of one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">E&ntilde;ing acquired the Manila Electric Company (Meralco), through the Meralco Securities Corporation (MSC), from General Public Utilities of New York in 1961, which became the centerpiece of the Lopez Group. Meralco&rsquo;s power plant construction and pipeline projects in 1967 were propelled in 1964 by its selling of eight million US dollars worth of Meralco bonds, the first time a private Filipino corporation sold bonds to the US market way before government did so. Its building in Pasig was inaugurated on 14 Mar 1969. Meralco was named best managed firm in 1996 by <b><i>Asiamoney</i></b>. The MSC created the Philippine Petroleum Corporation, the pioneer producer of lubricating oils for industry, and the Philippine Engineering and Construction Company, which designs and builds power plants, power lines, substations, and pipelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">E&ntilde;ing started his venture into the broadcast industry when he established the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1956, which began airing on Channel 9 in 1958, featuring the daily noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> and the singing talent search program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a> </i></b>(Call of the Stage).

He consolidated the broadcast companies on 1 Feb 1967 into what would be known as ABS-CBN, and bought a 44,027 square meter lot on Bohol Ave in Quezon City, which became its home when it was inaugurated on 18 Dec 1968. ABS-CBN became the first media conglomerate and biggest broadcasting network in the country, with the most advanced broadcasting center in Asia during the period.

Under pressure and with the promise of his son&rsquo;s release, E&ntilde;ing ceded control of ABS-CBN, which was taken over by Roberto Benedicto, a Marcos crony. He also handed over the control of Meralco, MSC, and PCI Bank to the Marcoses through the Meralco Foundation, brokered by Benjamin &ldquo;Kokoy&rdquo; Romualdez, First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos&rsquo;s brother, on 9 Nov 1973. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1974 while in exile in the United States. He requested Marcos to allow him to make a final visit to his son, and he was summoned to the Philippines but was denied his request. In spite of his physical condition, he made final visits to relatives in Manila, a few public appearances in Iloilo where he dedicated a hospital to his father&rsquo;s memory, and returned to the United States. Realizing that the promise of his son&rsquo;s release was a way for Marcos to blackmail him, he gave several interviews to the press in the United States, the most important of which was with <b><i>Parade Magazine</i></b>, in which he said: &ldquo;I, Eugenio Lopez Sr, an old man, now appeal to public opinion. I have no other source to help me regain my son.&rdquo; E&ntilde;ing died in 1975 in San Francisco, California, with his son Geny still in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">E&ntilde;ing was elected president of the Iloilo Chamber of Commerce in 1939, and received the Pro Patria Award from Pres Ferdinand Marcos in 1969 and a Distinguished Service Award from Harvard University in 1972. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLaya Boquiren and Eulalio R.

Realizing that the promise of his son&#x2019;s release was a way for Marcos to blackmail him, he gave several interviews to the press in the United States, the most important of which was with <b><i>Parade Magazine</i></b>, in which he said: &#x201C;I, Eugenio Lopez Sr, an old man, now appeal to public opinion. I have no other source to help me regain my son.&#x201D; E&#xF1;ing died in 1975 in San Francisco, California, with his son Geny still in prison."

Iloilo City 4 Nov 1928. d. Hillsborough, California, USA 29 Jun 1999. He was the eldest child of Eugenio &ldquo;E&ntilde;ing&rdquo; Lopez Sr and Pacita Moreno. He married Conchita &ldquo;Chita&rdquo; La&rsquo;O, with whom he had seven children: Eugenio &ldquo;Gabby&rdquo; Lopez III, who inherited from him the management of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>; Regina Paz, who put up ABS-CBN Foundation; Ernesto; Rosario; Ramon; Roberta; and Rafael. His loving companion for 10 years until his death was former fashion model and Camay girl Susan Reyes. Geny completed his elementary school at San Beda College in 1942, and high school at Ateneo de Manila in 1946. He attended Ateneo de Manila for a year in 1947, but transferred to Virginia Military Institute in the United States in 1948, where he completed a bachelor of arts degree in 1950. He pursued graduate studies in Madrid in 1950, then went back to the United States for a master in business administration from Harvard Business School, which he completed in 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Geny was assigned by his father E&ntilde;ing to run the family-owned newspaper <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b> in 1953. He was responsible for the merger in 1957 of Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), which his father bought from Antonio Quirino in 1956, and the Lopez-owned radio station Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN), which E&ntilde;ing established in 1956, into ABS-CBN Channel 3. Quirino&rsquo;s ABS, formerly Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC), had DZAQ TV Channel 3, the first television network in the country that began operating in 1953. ABS subsidiary Bolinao Broadcasting System had radio stations DZBC in San Juan, Rizal, DZRI in Dagupan, Pangasinan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4821\"><strong>DZRB</strong></a> in Naga, Camarines Sur. The Lopezes incorporated the media conglomerate under the name BEC Channel 3, officially changed it to ABS-CBN Channel 3 in 1963, then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967. The call sign &ldquo;Channel 2&rdquo; was first introduced into the network&rsquo;s logo in 1986 after the Lopezes regained possession of the station, which was shut down by Marcos when he declared martial law in 1972, with its facilities seized and taken over by Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Geny propelled ABS-CBN to being the Philippines&rsquo; largest network. In 1961, he got the rights for ABS-CBN to cover and air the 1962 and 1966 ASEAN Games. In 1966, the network started telecasting color programs and introduced the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong>Sarimanok</strong></a> logo. In 1967, its programs <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b> (Actor&rsquo;s Life), 1964, <b><i>Wild, Wild West</i></b>, 1965, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></a></i></b>, 1965, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage), 1958, and <b><i>Your Evening with Pilita</i></b>, 1965, were on top of the ratings charts. In 1968, he and his father built the most technologically advanced broadcast center in Asia on Bohol Ave in Quezon City, and established Nuvue Cablevision, the country&rsquo;s first cable company. In 1969, ABS-CBN covered Apollo 11&rsquo;s historic landing on the moon, the country&rsquo;s first telecast of an event via satellite. By 1972, ABS-CBN was a giant network, with television Channels 2 and 4, seven radio stations in Metro Manila, three provincial TV stations, 14 radio stations, and three radio affiliate stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Geny was among those detained in a maximum security prison in Fort Bonifacio during martial law. In Nov 1972, the military arrested him &ldquo;on trumped-up charges of conspiring to assassinate the dictator&rdquo; (Rodrigo 2006, 4). The price of Geny&rsquo;s freedom was &ldquo;his family&rsquo;s handing over to Marcos the major Lopez companies&rdquo; (Rodrigo et al. 2008, 38). On 24 Jan 1975, he was asked to sign a letter agreeing to the confiscation of their properties, admitting their involvement in the alleged plot to assassinate Marcos, and endorsing martial law. He refused to sign, and the negotiations with Marcos collapsed. He and fellow detainee Sergio Osme&ntilde;a III, whose father was a Marcos political rival, staged a hunger strike inside their prison cell in 1974 to call attention to their plight. In 1977, the two escaped from their detention cell by crawling beneath barbed wires, beyond the fenced-in perimeter of Fort Bonifacio, and off via a chartered aircraft to the United States where they sought political asylum. He returned to the Philippines on 28 Feb 1986, two days after the fall of the dictator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The post-EDSA conditions worked to the advantage of the Lopezes. Through Augusto Almeda Lopez and intermediaries in the administration of newly installed president Corazon Aquino, he recovered the Lopez companies commandeered by Marcos&rsquo;s cronies, including the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, Meralco, First Holdings, PCIBank, and ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Channel 2 and two radio stations. The Lopezes filed a case against Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto, who took over their network during martial law. With help from brothers Oscar and Manuel, Geny revived and rebuilt ABS-CBN Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Geny enlisted experts who formed the executive body of the network, which steered the station to its growth and expansion. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of them was Federico Garcia, who was into sales for the second Lopez-owned station Channel 9 before martial law. Garcia&rsquo;s marketing strategies propelled the post-martial law ABS-CBN from the bottom five in the ratings to the number one position in a span of only one year and a half. Geny tapped the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a>-Concio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, and Salvii Casino to strengthen the station&rsquo;s productions and programming. He invested in the latest communications technology and infrastructure, such as state-of-the-art electronic news gathering vans.

On 24 Jan 1975, he was asked to sign a letter agreeing to the confiscation of their properties, admitting their involvement in the alleged plot to assassinate Marcos, and endorsing martial law. He refused to sign, and the negotiations with Marcos collapsed. He and fellow detainee Sergio Osme&#xF1;a III, whose father was a Marcos political rival, staged a hunger strike inside their prison cell in 1974 to call attention to their plight. In 1977, the two escaped from their detention cell by crawling beneath barbed wires, beyond the fenced-in perimeter of Fort Bonifacio, and off via a chartered aircraft to the United States where they sought political asylum.

It is owned by the FJE Group of Companies, with headquarters on Sotto St, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Complex, Pasay City. Several networks, some fully owned while others partly owned by MBC, actually comprise the larger MBC network under several brands. The most well-known of these is DZRH Nationwide, composed of an originating station in Manila and 20 relay stations throughout the country, all broadcasting on AM but connected to the Manila station via satellite. DZRH&rsquo;s programming is mainly news, public affairs, and soaps. MBC&rsquo;s other brand, Love Radio, is a network of 28 stations on FM, with a programming of popular music and entertainment talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">MBC&rsquo;s subsidiaries, which own its other networks, are Cebu Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (CBC), Pacific Broadcasting Systems (PBS), and Radyo Natin Network (RNN). CBC&rsquo;s nine stations, all on FM, air soft rock music. PBS has 10 stations on AM, with the brand name Aksyon Radyo (Action Radio), and 11 stations on FM, with the brand name Yes FM. Aksyon Radyo&rsquo;s programming is similar to that of DZRH, with news, talk, and drama, but in regional Filipino languages. It has an Internet-based Aksyon Radyo station originating from Garden Grove, California, USA. The programming of Yes FM, on the other hand, includes entertainment news and features and popular music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RNN (&ldquo;Radyo Natin&rdquo; translates to Our Radio) has under its wing 52 stations on FM, with the brand Hot FM, whose programming is similar to those of Love Radio and Yes FM. Its morning programming, however, begins with a feed of news programs from DZRH. In addition, RNN has 130 stations, also on FM, broadcasting at a low transmitting power of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>-500 watts. Like Hot FM, these low-powered stations relay the early morning national news program from DZRH, which they receive via satellite, but shift to local news and talk the rest of the morning using the regional languages. The stations simulcast music programs in the afternoon, back to local programs in the early evening, and then end with a simulcast of a late evening entertainment program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">MBC is also on television via the 24-hour cable news channel DZRH News Television. Using the format of <b>teleradyo</b> (portmanteau of television and radio), it televises the news and talk programs of DZRH delivered by its announcers inside the radio booth. Both DZRH and DZRH News Television, as well as MBC&rsquo;s other stations, livestream online with live chat rooms that allow listeners and viewers to participate in discussions on the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">MBC&rsquo;s history may be traced to prewar KZRH, which first aired on 14 Jul 1939 from the Heacock&rsquo;s Department Store on Escolta, Binondo, Manila. KZRH (RH for Radio Heacock) brought to four the number of stations in Manila in the 1930s when the Philippines was still under American colonial rule and radio broadcasting in the country was in its infancy. It was owned by American Samuel Gaches, who a few months later bought KZRC in Cebu from its former owners, the Erlanger &amp; Galinger Department Store. Station manager Bertrand Harold Silen and program director John Harris tagged the stations the Voice of the Philippines, with their signals reaching most of the archipelago. However, the programs, all in English, were meant to give the Americans a strong voice in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The coming of World War II to Philippine shores disrupted commercial broadcasting. Gen Douglas MacArthur, commander of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), ordered the destruction of all radio equipment just before the end of 1941 as the USAFFE forces retreated from Manila to Bataan and Corregidor. This move was meant to prevent the Japanese forces, who marched into Manila on the eve of the new year, from using radio broadcasting for propaganda. However, Silen and his chief technician Simeon Cheng salvaged some equipment to bring to Corregidor, while other pieces of equipment were stored in the basement of the Jai-Alai Building on Taft Ave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Corregidor was thus able to address Filipinos via radio beginning 5 Jan 1942 until early May 1942 to urge them to remain loyal to the Americans. MacArthur named the station the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4989\"><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></a>. In the meantime, the Japanese found the equipment hidden in the Jai-Alai Building, which they used to begin broadcasting their own propaganda on 14 Jan 1942. They used the call letters KZRH until 14 Oct 1943 when they changed the call letters to PIAM. Both stations used salvaged equipment from prewar KZRH, which is why DZRH today traces its lineage to both stations, and further back to prewar KZRH. KZRC, meanwhile, relayed the signal of the Voice of Freedom to Visayas and Mindanao and broadcast its own anti-Japanese propaganda until the Japanese forces reached Cebu in early May and closed it down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At war&rsquo;s end in 1945, a new station, KZFM, the first of the government-owned network, the Philippine Broadcasting Service, went on the air, built from equipment MacArthur brought upon his return to the archipelago. The commercial stations, including KZRH, did not reopen until the following year, in Jul 1946. Silen sought new investors when Gaches appeared uninterested in reopening the station. He found them in the businessmen brothers Joaquin Miguel Elizalde and Manuel Elizalde, who bought the station from Gaches. Silen set up the new KZRH studios at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\"><strong>Insular Life Building</strong></a> in Plaza Moraga, Manila. The Elizaldes called their new business venture the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4895\"><strong>Manila Broadcasting Company (MBC)</strong></a>.

MBC then acquired a franchise for another station in Manila, KZMB. PBC, on the other hand, put up KZOK in addition to KZPI. Not long after the inaugural broadcast of KZOK, the Elizaldes acquired PBC and its three stations from Araneta. On 1 Jan 1949, following a conference of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Atlantic City in New Jersey, USA, in 1947, all Philippine stations shifted to a new set of call letters&mdash;DZ&mdash;from the American KZ. Later, DZ and DW were assigned to Luzon-based radio stations, DY for Visayas, and DX for Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">MBC stations, as with the other stations that began to go on air after the war, resumed the prewar programming of music and variety shows while the language was again English. However, news and commentary enjoyed more airtime, and a new program genre captivated audiences, the soap opera, and in the process shifted the broadcasting language of many stations, including DZRH, to Tagalog.

Like the other television stations already on air at the time, Channel 11 aired films but mostly local programs. It suffered from technical problems so it tried to solve the problem by moving its studios to J. P. Rizal St in the Project 4 district of Quezon City in early 1972. However, the operation in the new studio was short-lived as Pres Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law within a few months.

This trend continued beyond Marcos&rsquo;s ouster in 1986, and until the present, with talk shows not only on politics but also on health, the law, the environment, arts, and entertainment. In the 1990s, MBC began expanding aggressively into the vast network it is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">MBC, its programs, and its broadcasters have received numerous awards, including the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)</strong></a> Golden Dove Awards for Best AM station in Manila for DZRH in 1992 and 1993; Best FM Station in Manila for DZMB in 1993, 1995, and 1997; 2007 Ka Doroy Broadcaster of the Year for veteran DZRH news director and station manager Joe Taruc; Posthumous KBP Lifetime Achievement Award for former MBC vice president Eduardo Montilla in 2011; and Best FM Station in the provincial category for RNN in 2012, 2013, and 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byElizabeth L.

It was owned by American Samuel Gaches, who a few months later bought KZRC in Cebu from its former owners, the Erlanger &amp; Galinger Department Store. Station manager Bertrand Harold Silen and program director John Harris tagged the stations the Voice of the Philippines, with their signals reaching most of the archipelago.

This move was meant to prevent the Japanese forces, who marched into Manila on the eve of the new year, from using radio broadcasting for propaganda. However, Silen and his chief technician Simeon Cheng salvaged some equipment to bring to Corregidor, while other pieces of equipment were stored in the basement of the Jai-Alai Building on Taft Ave."

Manila 17 Oct 1947. Broadcast director, producer. She is the daughter of Eduardo Yulo Vargas of Negros Occidental and Erlinda Aquino of Tarlac, who was an elder sister of Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr. When Maria&rsquo;s father died, her mother married Emilio Martinez of Bulacan. Maria is married to Jose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4907\"><strong>Maria Montelibano</strong></a>, aka Boy, a corporate executive turned social activist and commentator and who also writes the regular column Glimpses in <b><i>Inq7</i></b>. She attended grade school at Assumption Convent, 1954-60, and high school at St. Paul College in Quezon City, 1960-64. She was the first and only graduate of bachelor of arts in broadcast communication at the Institute of Mass Communication of the University of the Philippines (UP) in Diliman in 1968. While at UP, she co-founded with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4770\"><strong>Kitchie Benedicto</strong></a> the UP Broadcasting Association in 1968. She pursued special studies in Spanish culture at the Universidad Central de Madrid in Spain, 1968-69. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She served as executive director of the presidential broadcast staff of Radio-Television Malaca&ntilde;ang (RTVM) during the presidency of Corazon Aquino, 1986-92. She was support team head for the presidential campaign of Fidel V. Ramos in 1992, media director for the senatorial campaign of Sergio Osme&ntilde;a in 2001, and communications director for the presidential campaign of nephew Benigno &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1251\"><strong>Noy</strong></a>noy&rdquo; S. Aquino III in 2010. Since 2010, she has been the executive director of the EDSA People Power Commission, the director for national events under the Presidential Communications <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tions Office, and the head of corporate communications and media of Gawad Kalinga, a nongovernment organization engaged in building homes and providing environment-friendly social entrepreneurship projects in poor settlements (EPPC 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her first broadcast work was in 1967 as a live promo girl, together with society girls Josie Perlas Mayo and Emma Ruth Yulo, for products endorsed in programs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>. She eventually did the directing of these live promo spots. She then became one of the network&rsquo;s stable of creative people. She was in the pool of directors of the daily noontime music variety show <b><i>Stop, Look, and Listen</i></b>, 1968-72, with other notable directors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4986\"><strong>Mitos Villareal</strong></a>, Raul Silos, and Heidi Sison, hosted by Joey Lardizabal, with a cast that included big stars like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4467\"><strong>Eddie Gutierrez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a>, Jeanne Young, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4516\"><strong>Liza Lorena</strong></a>, Ricky Belmonte, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4928\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4929\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, Bert Leroy, and Blanca Gomez. It was an expensive show, which was ABS-CBN&rsquo;s response to the hit <b><i>Tayo&rsquo;y Maghapi-hapi</i></b> (Let&rsquo;s Enjoy) of MBC Channel 11, which it eventually toppled in the ratings game (Rodrigo 2006). The pre-martial law shows she directed on ABS-CBN included <b><i>Swing In</i></b>, a music show with Joey Lardizabal; <b><i>In Focus</i></b>, a 30-minute experimental show that mixed film footage to complement the repertoire of the program&rsquo;s stars, Six Halves; <b><i>Marilen</i></b>, a music variety show that launched singer Marilen Martinez; and <b><i>L&rsquo;vira</i></b>, the late evening talk show of Elvira Manahan. She directed <b><i>5/17</i></b> in 1976, a one-hour star-studded show that put into song and dance the problems, accomplishments, and aspirations of the Department of Natural Resources, and <b><i>Tawag Pansin&ndash;60 Minutes</i></b> (To Call Attention&ndash;60 Minutes), 1982, BBC 2, created by Jake Maderazo and anchored by Bobby Guanzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was during martial law that she produced and directed what would be her four most famous shows: <b><i>Ariel con Tina</i></b>, 1972, IBC 13, then 1972-74, GMA, a noontime show hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4979\"><strong>Ariel Ureta</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4941\"><strong>Tina Revilla</strong></a>, written by Lyca Benitez; <b><i>Ms. Ellaneous</i></b>, 1977-81, GMA, an intelligent talk magazine show hosted by Maan Hontiveros, Yogi Dominguez, and Tina Revilla, three young, modern, urban Filipinas, an uncommon image of the Filipino woman during the period; the revived late-night talk show <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>, 1979-86, also on GMA, with hosts Elvira Manahan and Nestor Torre Jr; and the talk program <b><i>Tell the People</i></b>, which she handled from 1981 to 1987, KBS 9, hosted by Jullie Yap Daza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Montelibano&rsquo;s team in <b><i>Ms. Ellaneous</i></b> used 16 mm films while going out to places around the Philippines. It was a very expensive show at that time as it was experimental, intended to prove to people that it could be done. It was the first show to have a telephone call as part of the program that allowed audience participation and activities, such as bidding on an item whose proceeds once sold went to charity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Ninoy Aquino was assassinated in 1983, she was one of those at GMA who pushed for more politically oriented shows. <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b> featured and interviewed activists and opposition leaders in some of its episodes, which prompted the Board of Censors under Maria <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w Katigbak to make moves, although unsuccessfully, to require the program to tape all their episodes so it could cut out the parts that it deemed radical, incendiary, and unfit for TV. The program was also brave enough to feature a 15-minute tribute to the slain hero, including an eight-second run of the footage of Ninoy&rsquo;s funeral, a big political wager during that period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the EDSA Revolt, she produced significant documentaries, like <b><i>People-Powered Presidency</i></b>, 1987, which traced the roots of the EDSA Revolt that catapulted Corazon Aquino to power; <b><i>The Challenge of EDSA</i></b>, 1988, an assessment of the Aquino administration; and <b><i>Ang Puso at Diwa ni Ninoy </i></b>(The Heart and Soul of Ninoy), 1988, about the slain hero&rsquo;s life and principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She won outstanding director in a TV drama series for <b><i>Likha</i></b> (Creation) and in a variety show for <b><i>Ms. Ellaneous</i></b> from the Philippine Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, both in 1978. She was recognized as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines and one of the Outstanding Women in the Nation&rsquo;s Service, both in 1986. Her documentary <b><i>People-Powered Presidency</i></b> won Best TV Special at the 1st Gawad CCP para sa Radyo at Telebisyon, 1987. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEulalio R.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <strong>Movie and Television Review and&nbsp;Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong> is a government body that reviews, classifies, and approves or disapproves for public exhibition films, television programs, home videos, and related or similar materials. At the moment, it does not rate video games, nor does it rate literature. Its name in Filipino is Lupon sa Pagrerepaso at Pag-uuri ng Sine at Telebisyon. The president of the Philippines appoints its chair, vice chair, and 30 board members for a renewable term of one year. At least 15 of the board members must represent the movie and television industries while at least five must be lawyers. It has been customary in the last several decades to have other sectoral representatives in the board, such as from religious groups and the field of education. Lawyer Eugenio H. Villareal was the MRTCB chair from Dec 2012 to 2017. The board conducts business at its building at 18 Timog Ave, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 2011, the MTRCB has been applying the classifications G (General Patronage), PG (<i>Patnubay at Gabay</i>, or Parental Guidance), and X (Disapproved for Airing) to television programs. In 2012, the SPG (<i>Striktong Patnubay at Gabay</i>, or Strict Parental Guidance) was added. A pictogram advisory with full-screen written and voice advisory precedes every program and advises the audience of its classification. The G rating signifies that the material is rated suitable for all ages. The PG rating means that, in the judgment of the MTRCB, the program &ldquo;may contain some adult material that may be permissible for children to watch but only under the guidance and supervision of a parent or adult.&rdquo; This is the case in such programs as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) and <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b> (formerly <b><i>Showtime</i></b>). The SPG rating is applied when, in the judgment of the MTRCB, the program &ldquo;may contain more serious topic and themes, which may not be advisable for children to watch except under the very vigilant guidance and presence of a parent or adult.&rdquo; An X rating is given a program if, &ldquo;in the judgment of the Board applying contemporary Filipino cultural values as standard, it is objectionable for being immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Republic of the Philippines or its people, or with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence, or of a wrong, or crime&rdquo; (MTRCB 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For movie classification, there are six ratings as per the MTRCB. G rating is for viewers of all ages; PG rating requires adult supervision for viewers under 13 years of age; R-13 requires viewers to be 13 years old and over; R-16 requires viewers to be 16 years old and over; R-18 requires viewers to be 18 years old and over; and X rating is given to films that are not suitable for public viewing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In classifying television programs and films, the MTRCB considers the theme of the show, its language, and the presence of nudity, sex, violence, horror scenes, and drugs. It reviews and classifies all programs shown by the television channels, except news and current affairs programs. However, newscasts such as <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, <b><i>Bandila</i></b> (Flag), <b><i>Unang Hirit</i></b> (First Blow), <b><i>Aksyon sa Umaga</i></b> (Action in the Morning), and <b><i>News+</i></b> as well as regional news programs may use a PG or SPG warning depending on the content of the news stories. Moreover, in the case of live television programs where the MTRCB cannot exercise prior restraint, a violation is meted a suspension of the program or its host or both. On the other hand, while the MTRCB may suspend, reject, or cancel programs, it cannot revoke broadcast licenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All films, local and foreign, are classified prior to exhibition. Among the most controversial decisions of the MTRCB in recent decades was its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1076\">censorship</a> in 1989 of the film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1255\"><strong>Orapronobis</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Fight for Us</i></b>), written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a> and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>. Depicting human rights violations, its banning provoked accusations that the popular EDSA Revolt in 1986 did not restore democracy. The 1994 foreign film <b><i>Schindler&rsquo;s List</i></b>, directed by Steven Spielberg, was initially banned for sexually explicit content until then president Fidel V. Ramos intervened following protests, and allowed the movie to be shown with an R-16 rating. In 2006, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines objected to the exhibition of the foreign movie <b><i>Da Vinci Code</i></b>, based on the novel by Dan Brown, which claimed that Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced a family. The MTRCB allowed the showing of the film with an R-18 rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When MTRCB&rsquo;s earliest predecessor was created in 1929, film was its sole object of inspection as television was not to come until 24 years later. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1342\">Philippine television was born in 1953</a>, but it was only eight years later, in 1961, that the government censors body began to put it within its scope, and only in terms of movies previously exhibited in cinema houses, that were aired on television. It took another three decades before television program producers began to feel MTRCB&rsquo;s weight, although Pres Ferdinand Marcos created other agencies to handle the control of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1343\">television during the martial law years</a>. Since the mid-1990s, the MTRCB has been classifying television programs to advise parents to supervise their children&rsquo;s viewing of certain programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1929, during the American colonial period, the Board of Censorship for Moving Pictures (BCMP) was created by the Philippine Legislature, reportedly in reaction to a protest by the Spanish community against <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4526\">Julian Manansala</a>&rsquo;s film <b><i>Patria Amore</i></b> (Beloved Country), which was perceived to fan anti-Spanish sentiments. While the BCMP did not ban the movie, it began to examine all films&mdash;spoken or silent, local or foreign&mdash;and prohibit the screening of those the board deemed immoral or contrary to law and good customs or injurious to the prestige of the government and the people. In 1930, its first year of operation, it approved the exhibition of 1,249 films, with cuts in only six. Two other films were banned. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5419\">Teodoro M. </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\">Kalaw</a>&nbsp;served as president of the BCMP, with Lawrence Benton as secretary and 23 others, mostly American, as members, all appointed by the American governor-general Dwight Davis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1938, the First National Assembly under the Commonwealth government changed the board&rsquo;s name to Board of Review for Moving Pictures (BRMP) and expanded its coverage to locally produced films distributed abroad. Kalaw remained as president until 1940, when Jorge Bocobo took his place. More Filipinos were appointed to the board as its membership was reduced to 17. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1341\">During the first two years of the Japanese occupation</a>, there was no censors board, but the Japanese Military Administration&rsquo;s propaganda corps, called the Hodobu, strictly monitored and controlled radio, stage shows, and printed media, in addition to film. Censorable materials were those considered by the Hodobu to be anti-Japanese and tended to advocate democracy, alienate the Axis powers from one another, repudiate war, oppose the educational reforms designed by the Japanese, and expose alleged improper conduct of the Japanese military administration. In 1944, the Japanese reconstituted the BRMP under its watch, with Gabriel L. Ma&ntilde;alac as president. Marciano Roque served briefly as president in 1946 following the war&rsquo;s end, but Ma&ntilde;alac was reappointed in 1947 until 1950, again succeeded by Roque until 1953, Enriqueta Benavides until 1954, Teodoro F. Valencia until 1957, and Alfredo Lozano until 1960. The BRMP&rsquo;s prewar function and premises were restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the following decades, crime, violence, and sex became a recurring concern in film content. In 1961, with the new name Board of Censors of Motion Pictures (BCMP), the 25-member body&rsquo;s jurisdiction was expanded to include movies for television, whether in film or videotape. However, other television shows were not covered by the BCMP&rsquo;s powers. It also had Lumen Aspillera as new head, a position now called chairman (henceforth, chair). Aspillera was succeeded by Jose L. Guevara until 1965, Feliciano J. Ledesma until 1966, then by Guevara again until 1968. The following year, Marcos appointed Guillermo de Vega chair of BCMP. He served in this capacity while also serving as assistant to Marcos, positions he kept as Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Following de Vega&rsquo;s assassination in 1975, Marcos appointed his widow, Ma. Rocio de Vega, chair of the BCMP. She resigned in 1976, unable to endure the pressures from the military and other self-appointed guardians of morality and national security, who were close to Marcos and First Lady Imelda. From then until 1981, an ad interim BCMP was run mostly by military personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the meantime, Marcos contained the media through various agencies. Television and radio were controlled by, among other agencies, the purportedly self-regulatory body Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas beginning in 1974. (This body would operate independently of government after Marcos&rsquo;s ouster in 1986.) It was Marcos himself, however, who stopped the showing of the Japanese anime <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> on television, due to its violent and supposedly rebellion-inciting content, and also due to pressure from the Catholic Women&rsquo;s League.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, Marcos reorganized the board and renamed it Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television (BRMPT). He expanded its composition to 32, including a chair and a vice chair, at least 15 of whom represented the movie and television industries and at least five lawyers, all appointed by the president of the Philippines for a renewable term of one year. The BRMPT covered all television programs, videos, and similar media, in addition to film. He appointed Teodoro M. Kalaw&rsquo;s daughter, Maria Kalaw Katigbak, its chair. Until the end of her term in 1985 on the eve of the EDSA Revolt that ousted Marcos, Katigbak was in the middle of controversial censorship of movies that were either considered too sexually suggestive, and thus supposedly undermining morals, or too subversive, thus threatening national security, or, more accurately, threatening to Marcos and his martial rule. At least one case, the banning of the movie <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><strong><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></strong>: Kapit sa Patalim</a> </i></b>(<em><strong>My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge</strong></em>), reached the Supreme Court and created a legal impasse. Given the public mood that was increasingly anti-Marcos, the movie was shown. Marcos then changed the BRMPT to the MTRCB in late 1985. But it took place on the eve of the revolt that would end his regime and install Corazon Cojuangco Aquino as president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aquino appointed Manuel Morato chair of the MTRCB in 1986. Her successor president Fidel V. Ramos then appointed Etta Mendez to succeed Morato in 1992. The two are considered among the most conservative and stringent of the board of censors&rsquo; chiefs, but television, deemed not yet controversial, escaped their stern guidelines. It was Mendez&rsquo;s successor, Jesus C. Sison, whom Ramos appointed in 1995, who required that all television programs aired between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm have to achieve a rating of general patronage (GP) or suited for all ages; programs classified PG could only be shown from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am. The PG rating was meant to encourage parents to supervise their children while watching television. Programs were then submitted to the MTRCB for rating. In 1998, newly inaugurated president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> appointed veteran movie and television actor-singer-producer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\">Armida Siguion-Reyna</a> chair of MTRCB. Like her predecessors, she faced controversy. A review committee disapproved <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>&rsquo;s Dec 2000 television special <b><i>A Christmas Prayer</i></b>, which was critical of Estrada. She was accused of having a hand in the decision. She then set up a second review committee, which allowed the airing of the special with a PG rating. When Estrada left <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> in Jan 2001 following massive demonstrations against him, Siguion-Reyna submitted her resignation to the next president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arroyo then appointed on 12 Feb 2001 theater and film scholar <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a> the next chair of the MTRCB. His was the shortest term, exactly 37 days. Tiongson resigned on 21 Mar 2001 following pressure from Malaca&ntilde;an and conservative elements of religious groups for MTRCB to stop and ban the showing of the film <b><i>Live Show</i></b>, which depicted the struggles of dirt-poor live sex performers in night clubs. The movie, which received an R-18 rating from both the MTRCB and the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines CINEMA (Catholic Initiative for Enlightened Movie Appreciation) Education Committee, angered moral conservatives of the Catholic Church, the Jesus Is Lord congregation, and other religious groups, so Arroyo ordered its recall. Tiongson argued that he could not recall the permit for the movie to be shown without cuts given by Siguion-Reyna&rsquo;s board, because the movie had not violated any of the MTRCB&rsquo;s implementing rules and regulations. Failing reason on the part of the Archdiocese of Manila and Malaca&ntilde;an, Tiongson resigned. Arroyo appointed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5653\">Alejandro R. Roces</a>, who towed the moral conservative&rsquo;s line. He resigned in 2002, followed by the brief stints of Marilen Dinglasan and Dennis G. Manicad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Feb 2003, Arroyo appointed Consoliza Laguardia MTRCB chair. Hers was one of the longest terms, which lasted until Oct 2010. She was also the first to pay much more attention to television, implementing strict guidelines and reprimanding several television performers and suspending some. For instance, in 2004, the daily show <b><i>Ang Dating Daan</i></b> (The Former Path) was suspended for 20 days for the offensive language used by its host, televangelist Eli Soriano. A wardrobe malfunction in the daily noontime show <b><i>Wowowee</i></b> earned the show a three-day suspension in 2007. Another daily noontime show, <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>, was suspended for a month in 2010 for the inappropriate comment of one of its judges to Filipino teachers. Laguardia received mixed reviews of her performance. Critics argue that some of her projects were not consistent with the mandate of the board, such as the MTRCB Awards for TV and Film. However, she is credited for some lasting benefits to the MTRCB, such as the construction of the board&rsquo;s permanent home on Timog Ave in Quezon City, for introducing the R-13 film classification, and for strengthening provincial monitoring of film and television through local regulatory councils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 23 Oct 2010, Pres Benigno Simeon Aquino III appointed Mary Grace Poe-Llamanzares MTRCB chair and veteran film director and longtime board member Emmanuel Borlaza vice chair. Poe-Llamanzares reformed the MTRCB ratings system by developing one that is applicable to both movies and television, which are still in effect today, guided by age-appropriate classification. She also introduced the concept of &ldquo;intelligent media viewership&rdquo; by holding the first MTRCB Children&rsquo;s Summit in 2011, which discussed and planned improvements in television programming for children and the treatment of child actors and entertainers and their families. She struck an agreement with bus franchises and interisland ships to show only GP and PG materials. She institutionalized media literacy forums and &ldquo;Matalinong Panonood&rdquo; (Intelligent Viewership) seminars in universities and local communities to disseminate information on the MTRCB classification system. It was during her watch when Willie Revillame, host of the daily noontime show <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b>, was suspended for a month for making a young boy perform the sexually suggestive &ldquo;macho dance&rdquo; while the boy was weeping and appeared to be in distress. In 2012, Poe-Llamanzares left the board to run for the Senate, upon Aquino&rsquo;s urging.

				"value": "The <strong>Movie and Television Review and&#xA0;Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong> is a government body that reviews, classifies, and approves or disapproves for public exhibition films, television programs, home videos, and related or similar materials. At the moment, it does not rate video games, nor does it rate literature. Its name in Filipino is Lupon sa Pagrerepaso at Pag-uuri ng Sine at Telebisyon. The president of the Philippines appoints its chair, vice chair, and 30 board members for a renewable term of one year. At least 15 of the board members must represent the movie and television industries while at least five must be lawyers. It has been customary in the last several decades to have other sectoral representatives in the board, such as from religious groups and the field of education. Lawyer Eugenio H. Villareal was the MRTCB chair from Dec 2012 to 2017. The board conducts business at its building at 18 Timog Ave, Quezon City."

In 2012, the SPG (<i>Striktong Patnubay at Gabay</i>, or Strict Parental Guidance) was added. A pictogram advisory with full-screen written and voice advisory precedes every program and advises the audience of its classification. The G rating signifies that the material is rated suitable for all ages. The PG rating means that, in the judgment of the MTRCB, the program &#x201C;may contain some adult material that may be permissible for children to watch but only under the guidance and supervision of a parent or adult.&#x201D; This is the case in such programs as <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) and <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i></b> (formerly <b><i>Showtime</i></b>). The SPG rating is applied when, in the judgment of the MTRCB, the program &#x201C;may contain more serious topic and themes, which may not be advisable for children to watch except under the very vigilant guidance and presence of a parent or adult.&#x201D; An X rating is given a program if, &#x201C;in the judgment of the Board applying contemporary Filipino cultural values as standard, it is objectionable for being immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Republic of the Philippines or its people, or with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence, or of a wrong, or crime&#x201D; (MTRCB 2004)."

G rating is for viewers of all ages; PG rating requires adult supervision for viewers under 13 years of age; R-13 requires viewers to be 13 years old and over; R-16 requires viewers to be 16 years old and over; R-18 requires viewers to be 18 years old and over; and X rating is given to films that are not suitable for public viewing."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In classifying television programs and films, the MTRCB considers the theme of the show, its language, and the presence of nudity, sex, violence, horror scenes, and drugs. It reviews and classifies all programs shown by the television channels, except news and current affairs programs. However, newscasts such as <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, <b><i>Bandila</i></b> (Flag), <b><i>Unang Hirit</i></b> (First Blow), <b><i>Aksyon sa Umaga</i></b> (Action in the Morning), and <b><i>News+</i></b> as well as regional news programs may use a PG or SPG warning depending on the content of the news stories. Moreover, in the case of live television programs where the MTRCB cannot exercise prior restraint, a violation is meted a suspension of the program or its host or both. On the other hand, while the MTRCB may suspend, reject, or cancel programs, it cannot revoke broadcast licenses."

Among the most controversial decisions of the MTRCB in recent decades was its <a href=\"/4/22/1076\">censorship</a> in 1989 of the film <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1255\"><strong>Orapronobis</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Fight for Us</i></b>), written by <a href=\"/9/9/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a> and directed by <a href=\"/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>. Depicting human rights violations, its banning provoked accusations that the popular EDSA Revolt in 1986 did not restore democracy. The 1994 foreign film <b><i>Schindler&#x2019;s List</i></b>, directed by Steven Spielberg, was initially banned for sexually explicit content until then president Fidel V. Ramos intervened following protests, and allowed the movie to be shown with an R-16 rating. In 2006, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines objected to the exhibition of the foreign movie <b><i>Da Vinci Code</i></b>, based on the novel by Dan Brown, which claimed that Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced a family. The MTRCB allowed the showing of the film with an R-18 rating."

It took another three decades before television program producers began to feel MTRCB&#x2019;s weight, although Pres Ferdinand Marcos created other agencies to handle the control of <a href=\"/8/63/1343\">television during the martial law years</a>. Since the mid-1990s, the MTRCB has been classifying television programs to advise parents to supervise their children&#x2019;s viewing of certain programs."

While the BCMP did not ban the movie, it began to examine all films&#x2014;spoken or silent, local or foreign&#x2014;and prohibit the screening of those the board deemed immoral or contrary to law and good customs or injurious to the prestige of the government and the people. In 1930, its first year of operation, it approved the exhibition of 1,249 films, with cuts in only six. Two other films were banned. <a href=\"/9/80/5419\">Teodoro M. </a><a href=\"/5/42/4027\">Kalaw</a>&#xA0;served as president of the BCMP, with Lawrence Benton as secretary and 23 others, mostly American, as members, all appointed by the American governor-general Dwight Davis."

Kalaw remained as president until 1940, when Jorge Bocobo took his place. More Filipinos were appointed to the board as its membership was reduced to 17. <a href=\"/8/63/1341\">During the first two years of the Japanese occupation</a>, there was no censors board, but the Japanese Military Administration&#x2019;s propaganda corps, called the Hodobu, strictly monitored and controlled radio, stage shows, and printed media, in addition to film. Censorable materials were those considered by the Hodobu to be anti-Japanese and tended to advocate democracy, alienate the Axis powers from one another, repudiate war, oppose the educational reforms designed by the Japanese, and expose alleged improper conduct of the Japanese military administration. In 1944, the Japanese reconstituted the BRMP under its watch, with Gabriel L. Ma&#xF1;alac as president. Marciano Roque served briefly as president in 1946 following the war&#x2019;s end, but Ma&#xF1;alac was reappointed in 1947 until 1950, again succeeded by Roque until 1953, Enriqueta Benavides until 1954, Teodoro F. Valencia until 1957, and Alfredo Lozano until 1960. The BRMP&#x2019;s prewar function and premises were restored."

In 1961, with the new name Board of Censors of Motion Pictures (BCMP), the 25-member body&#x2019;s jurisdiction was expanded to include movies for television, whether in film or videotape. However, other television shows were not covered by the BCMP&#x2019;s powers. It also had Lumen Aspillera as new head, a position now called chairman (henceforth, chair). Aspillera was succeeded by Jose L. Guevara until 1965, Feliciano J. Ledesma until 1966, then by Guevara again until 1968. The following year, Marcos appointed Guillermo de Vega chair of BCMP. He served in this capacity while also serving as assistant to Marcos, positions he kept as Marcos declared martial law in 1972. Following de Vega&#x2019;s assassination in 1975, Marcos appointed his widow, Ma. Rocio de Vega, chair of the BCMP. She resigned in 1976, unable to endure the pressures from the military and other self-appointed guardians of morality and national security, who were close to Marcos and First Lady Imelda. From then until 1981, an ad interim BCMP was run mostly by military personnel."

Television and radio were controlled by, among other agencies, the purportedly self-regulatory body Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas beginning in 1974. (This body would operate independently of government after Marcos&#x2019;s ouster in 1986.) It was Marcos himself, however, who stopped the showing of the Japanese anime <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> on television, due to its violent and supposedly rebellion-inciting content, and also due to pressure from the Catholic Women&#x2019;s League."

He expanded its composition to 32, including a chair and a vice chair, at least 15 of whom represented the movie and television industries and at least five lawyers, all appointed by the president of the Philippines for a renewable term of one year. The BRMPT covered all television programs, videos, and similar media, in addition to film. He appointed Teodoro M. Kalaw&#x2019;s daughter, Maria Kalaw Katigbak, its chair. Until the end of her term in 1985 on the eve of the EDSA Revolt that ousted Marcos, Katigbak was in the middle of controversial censorship of movies that were either considered too sexually suggestive, and thus supposedly undermining morals, or too subversive, thus threatening national security, or, more accurately, threatening to Marcos and his martial rule. At least one case, the banning of the movie <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1119\"><strong><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></strong>: Kapit sa Patalim</a> </i></b>(<em><strong>My Country: Gripping the Knife&#x2019;s Edge</strong></em>), reached the Supreme Court and created a legal impasse. Given the public mood that was increasingly anti-Marcos, the movie was shown. Marcos then changed the BRMPT to the MTRCB in late 1985. But it took place on the eve of the revolt that would end his regime and install Corazon Cojuangco Aquino as president."

				"value": "Aquino appointed Manuel Morato chair of the MTRCB in 1986. Her successor president Fidel V. Ramos then appointed Etta Mendez to succeed Morato in 1992. The two are considered among the most conservative and stringent of the board of censors&#x2019; chiefs, but television, deemed not yet controversial, escaped their stern guidelines. It was Mendez&#x2019;s successor, Jesus C. Sison, whom Ramos appointed in 1995, who required that all television programs aired between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm have to achieve a rating of general patronage (GP) or suited for all ages; programs classified PG could only be shown from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am. The PG rating was meant to encourage parents to supervise their children while watching television. Programs were then submitted to the MTRCB for rating. In 1998, newly inaugurated president <a href=\"/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> appointed veteran movie and television actor-singer-producer <a href=\"/5/42/4169\">Armida Siguion-Reyna</a> chair of MTRCB. Like her predecessors, she faced controversy. A review committee disapproved <a href=\"/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>&#x2019;s Dec 2000 television special <b><i>A Christmas Prayer</i></b>, which was critical of Estrada. She was accused of having a hand in the decision. She then set up a second review committee, which allowed the airing of the special with a PG rating. When Estrada left <a href=\"/2/8/330\">Malaca&#xF1;an</a> in Jan 2001 following massive demonstrations against him, Siguion-Reyna submitted her resignation to the next president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo."

Tiongson resigned on 21 Mar 2001 following pressure from Malaca&#xF1;an and conservative elements of religious groups for MTRCB to stop and ban the showing of the film <b><i>Live Show</i></b>, which depicted the struggles of dirt-poor live sex performers in night clubs. The movie, which received an R-18 rating from both the MTRCB and the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines CINEMA (Catholic Initiative for Enlightened Movie Appreciation) Education Committee, angered moral conservatives of the Catholic Church, the Jesus Is Lord congregation, and other religious groups, so Arroyo ordered its recall. Tiongson argued that he could not recall the permit for the movie to be shown without cuts given by Siguion-Reyna&#x2019;s board, because the movie had not violated any of the MTRCB&#x2019;s implementing rules and regulations. Failing reason on the part of the Archdiocese of Manila and Malaca&#xF1;an, Tiongson resigned. Arroyo appointed <a href=\"/9/80/5653\">Alejandro R. Roces</a>, who towed the moral conservative&#x2019;s line. He resigned in 2002, followed by the brief stints of Marilen Dinglasan and Dennis G. Manicad."

				"value": "In Feb 2003, Arroyo appointed Consoliza Laguardia MTRCB chair. Hers was one of the longest terms, which lasted until Oct 2010. She was also the first to pay much more attention to television, implementing strict guidelines and reprimanding several television performers and suspending some. For instance, in 2004, the daily show <b><i>Ang Dating Daan</i></b> (The Former Path) was suspended for 20 days for the offensive language used by its host, televangelist Eli Soriano. A wardrobe malfunction in the daily noontime show <b><i>Wowowee</i></b> earned the show a three-day suspension in 2007. Another daily noontime show, <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i></b>, was suspended for a month in 2010 for the inappropriate comment of one of its judges to Filipino teachers. Laguardia received mixed reviews of her performance. Critics argue that some of her projects were not consistent with the mandate of the board, such as the MTRCB Awards for TV and Film. However, she is credited for some lasting benefits to the MTRCB, such as the construction of the board&#x2019;s permanent home on Timog Ave in Quezon City, for introducing the R-13 film classification, and for strengthening provincial monitoring of film and television through local regulatory councils."

Poe-Llamanzares reformed the MTRCB ratings system by developing one that is applicable to both movies and television, which are still in effect today, guided by age-appropriate classification. She also introduced the concept of &#x201C;intelligent media viewership&#x201D; by holding the first MTRCB Children&#x2019;s Summit in 2011, which discussed and planned improvements in television programming for children and the treatment of child actors and entertainers and their families. She struck an agreement with bus franchises and interisland ships to show only GP and PG materials. She institutionalized media literacy forums and &#x201C;Matalinong Panonood&#x201D; (Intelligent Viewership) seminars in universities and local communities to disseminate information on the MTRCB classification system. It was during her watch when Willie Revillame, host of the daily noontime show <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b>, was suspended for a month for making a young boy perform the sexually suggestive &#x201C;macho dance&#x201D; while the boy was weeping and appeared to be in distress.

It is under the administrative supervision of the Office of the President. NTC&rsquo;s decisions are appealable only directly to the Supreme Court of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The official creation of the NTC was during the martial law period. Pres Ferdinand Marcos created the agency through Executive Order (EO) 546 promulgated on 23 Jul 1979. EO 546 integrated the functions of two government bodies, the Board of Communications (BOC) and the Telecommunications Control Bureau (TCB). The BOC was created in 1972 under the Integrated Reorganization Law. It was the first quasi-judicial body with adjudicatory powers on matters involving telecommunications services. The TCB, created in 1974, was the former Radio Control Office (RCO), the government unit that regulated, among others, the establishment, use, and operation of all radio stations and all forms of communications and transmissions within the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The BOC and the TCB, however, trace their roots to laws that established regulatory bodies as early as the American colonial period. On 5 Dec 1927, the Ship Radio Station Law or Act 3396 established the first radio regulatory office, the Radio Construction and Maintenance Section, under the Telegraph Division of the Bureau of Posts. On 11 Nov 1931, the Radio Control Law or Act 3846 created the Radio Control Division (RCD) of the Bureau of Posts, under the secretary of commerce and communications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The law provided for &ldquo;the regulation of public and radio communications in the Philippines and for other purposes.&rdquo; On 1 Nov 1939, the RCD was transferred to the Department of National Defense, which was established through Executive Order 330. On 1 Jul 1947, however, the Department of Commerce and Industry took over the jurisdiction of the RCD. On 1 Jan 1951, the RCD, by then under the Radio Control Board, was transferred to the Department of Public Works and Communications (DPWC). On 15 Jun 1956, Republic Act 1476 abolished the Radio Control Board, but retained the RCD, still under the DPWC. On 23 Aug 1962, DPWC Order 51 changed the name of the Radio Control Division to Radio Control Office. Three days after the declaration of martial law, on 24 Sep 1972, Marcos, through Presidential Decree No. 1, retained the RCO, this time under the Board of Communications (BOC), the first quasi-judicial body with adjudicatory powers on matters involving telecommunication services. The BOC was administratively still under the DPWC. On 1 Jul 1974, RCO was renamed Telecommunications Control Bureau, until Marcos integrated it with the BOC in 1979 to finally form the NTC under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the post-EDSA period, Pres Corazon Aquino issued Executive Order (EO) 125-A, attaching the NTC to the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). Pres Gloria Macapagal Arroyo changed the jurisdiction of the NTC a couple of times: she transferred the NTC to the Commission on Information and Communications Technology (CICT), which was created through EO 269, in 2004, but returned it to the DOTC in 2005, only to be transferred back to the CICT in 2008. Pres Benigno S. Aquino III brought the NTC under the Office of the President through EO 47 on 23 Jun 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The NTC is headed by a commissioner appointed by the president. The first NTC commissioner was Ceferino C. Carreon from 1979 to 1986. The first commissioner immediately after the ouster of Marcos was Tomas C. Reyes, who held office only from 14 Mar to 1 Apr 1986. The first commissioner when NTC was finally reorganized during the post-EDSA period was Jose Luis A. Alcuaz from 1987 to 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Various units of the NTC attend to the different needs of the public and private sectors involved in broadcasting and transmission. The Planning, Finance, and Management Branch organizes the strategic planning for and systematic execution of the development of medium-term plans of NTC. The Industry Planning and Research Division looks into the status, trends, and developments in the broadcast, telecommunications, and information technology industries. The Industry Planning and Management Branch undertakes broadcast and public telecommunications industry planning. The Special Licensing Branch acts on all non-decentralized broadcast licensing functions pursuant to local and international rules and regulations, conventions, and treaties to which the Philippines is a party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Regulation Branch formulates rules and regulations in the supervision and operation of all public telecommunications entities. The Radio Spectrum Planning Division (RSPD) and the Broadcast Services Division (BSD) review and assign frequencies of broadcast stations and auxiliary broadcast facilities based on the sub-allocated band plans of the commission, but the RSPD specifically recommends solutions to harmful radio frequency interference, while the BSD acts on applications for the issuance of permits and licenses for broadcast TV and AM-FM radio stations. The Adjudication Division (AD) conducts formal hearings on applications for the operation of communications utilities and services, wire or wireless telephone or telegraph systems, radio and television broadcasting systems, and other similar public utilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AD also investigates complaints and prosecutes infractions of Philippine laws and regulations on telecommunications and public service; it also represents the NTC in tribunals or in court litigations, in coordination with the Office of the Solicitor General. The Consumer Welfare and Protection Division acts on all consumer complaints related to public telecommunications entities, broadcast and CATV companies, radio and telecommunications equipment suppliers, including radio dealers and mobile phone suppliers. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEulalio R.

In 1967, he became production manager, but the following year he left the government station and joined the commercial broadcast network Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS), the forerunner of Radio Philippines Network, where he was first program director of DZRR and DZAX, then rose to assume positions that put him in charge of operations, programming, sales, engineering, and administration of both television Channel 9 and KBS radio stations throughout the country until 1997. During this period, he continued to host public affairs programs."

PTNI has 32 provincial stations, while PBS-RB has 30 stations and 16 affiliate stations all over the country. PBS also owns DZRP Radyo Pilipinas, aka Voice of the Philippines, which has been airing since 1965 on both AM and short-wave radio and was under the National Media Production Center (NMPC) during martial law.

Quezon on 3 Sept 1937 to nationalize radio stations in the colony, an idea that was not well received by the Americans, especially those invested in radio. Quezon was smarting from newspaper criticisms, so he wanted to use and control radio to counter newspaper articles unfavorable to him. He was not able to do this, anyway, due to a number of factors, such as financial requirement to acquire the stations, his failing health, and the coming of World War II. RB was abolished in 1942 by the Japanese imperial forces. Meanwhile, Gen Douglas MacArthur, as commander of the United States Army Forces in the Far East, brought several radio transmitters when he took the country back from the Japanese. He used the transmitters to let Filipinos know of his return. Toward the end of the war, he sent several of the transmitters to Japan, then integrated the remaining few radio stations&rsquo; transmitters in Manila into one network: a radio station with the call letters KZFM, first managed by the US Department of National Defense Office of War Information, then turned over to the newly organized United States Information Service (USIS) under the US State Department. On 20 Oct 1946, the second anniversary of MacArthur&rsquo;s landing on Leyte, the USIS turned over KZFM to the new Philippine government&rsquo;s Department of Foreign Affairs. In Aug 1947, KZFM was moved to the Philippine Broadcasting Service, which was a newly created unit under the Office of the President. PBS then grew into a nationwide network of government broadcast stations. On 1 Jan 1949, KZFM&rsquo;s call letters were changed to DZFM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">PTNI, on the other hand, began operations in 1974. Its first name was Government Television Channel 4 (GTV 4). When NMPC gained full control of the station, GTV 4 was renamed Maharlika Broadcasting System (MBS), with a new programming on 1 Jan 1980. MBS was given the name People&rsquo;s Television Channel 4 (PTV 4) in 1986 upon the assumption into office of Pres Corazon Aquino after the EDSA Revolt, then rebranded as National Broadcasting Network in 2001, and finally as PTNI in 2010 but retaining its more popular brand PTV as its secondary name during Pres Benigno Aquino III&rsquo;s term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, DZFM aired mainly news and public affairs programs, with some entertainment-cultural shows, which included <b><i>PBS Final Newscast</i></b>, <b><i>PBS News Bulletin</i></b>, <b><i>Alam Ba Ninyo?</i></b> (Did You Know?), <b><i>Nacida Program</i></b>, <b><i>SEATO Calling</i></b>, <b><i>UNESCO Features</i></b>, <b><i>Midday Jamboree</i></b>, and <b><i>Rondalla <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a></i></b>.

Beginning in 1974, the Marcos government started operating GTV 4, the airtime of which was shared by NMPC, the Bureau of Broadcast (BB, under then Ministry of Public Information, which dissolved DZFM), which was the former PBS, and Roberto Benedicto&rsquo;s Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS, later RPN). Thus, the station had a rather split personality. There was also rivalry between NMPC, then headed by Gregorio Cenda&ntilde;a and identified with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos, and BB, then controlled by Public Information Minister Francisco &ldquo;Kit&rdquo; Tatad and identified with Ferdinand Marcos. Because there were three sharing the airtime of Channel 4, there were also three studios&mdash;NMPC in Intramuros, BB in its former offices on Arroceros, and KBS in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> facilities&mdash;at what was then called Broadcast Plaza in Quezon City.

During the post-EDSA period, both the NMPC and BB were reorganized, and their combined network was put under the administrative roof of the Office of Media Affairs, created by Pres Corazon Aquino during the early years of the post-EDSA period. This process, which resulted in the present-day PTNI and Bureau of Broadcast Services (BBS)&ndash;PBS, took several years and beyond the Cory administration. The name PBS was resurrected and attached to BBS. Also during the post-EDSA period, DZFM&rsquo;s call letters became DZRB, for Radyo ng Bayan, created under the BBS-PBS.

In spite of this image, however, GTV 4 during the martial law period produced some of the best shows, such as the public service program <b><i>Damayan </i></b>(In Sympathy With), revived in 1976, with film actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4651\"><strong>Rosa Rosal</strong></a> calling on various organizations to help alleviate the plight of indigent people going to the program to seek help; <b><i>The Morning Show</i></b>, which was a pioneer of daily morning talk-magazine programs; the music programs <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1482\"><strong>Paco Park Presents</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Rondalla sa Telebisyon</i></b>, and <b><i>Return Engagement</i></b>; the comedy program <b><i>Juan Tamad</i></b> (Lazy Juan), revived in 1979, starring now National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>; <b><i>Ang Mamimili</i></b> (The Consumer), 1979, about consumer rights; development communication programs <b><i>Ating Alamin</i></b> (Let Us Know) and <b><i>Tele-aralan ng Kakayahan</i></b> (Knowledge Educational TV); sports programs <b><i>Chess Today</i></b> and <b><i>Blow by Blow</i></b>; and the drama anthologies <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>no </i></b>(Shadow), 1974, <b><i>Huwaran </i></b>(Model), 1974-80, <b><i>Brocka Presents</i></b>, 1977-80, <b><i>Tipanan</i></b> (Rendezvous), 1979, and <b><i>Neneng Magtanggol</i></b>, 1979. The evening talk show <b><i>Face the Nation</i></b> committed a huge error for President Marcos; it interviewed presidential aspirant Benigno Aquino Jr while incarcerated in Fort Bonifacio on 10 Mar 1978, and for the first time, someone openly criticized Marcos and his martial law regime on live television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Noteworthy productions of DZRB Radyo ng Bayan during the post-EDSA period were the programs <b><i>Daigdig ng mga Bata</i></b> (World of Children) and <b><i>Kulay at Anyo</i></b> (Color and Form), which were both about local culture.

He was born on 12 Jul 1910. He died on 12 Dec 1978. Considered the &ldquo;Original King of Philippine Comedy,&rdquo; he began acting on stage as one-half of the comedy team <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a> (also spelled Tugo, real name Andres Solomon) in the 1930s. Before World War II, they appeared in a dozen movies including <b><i>Ang Lihim ng Lumang <strong>Simbahan</strong></i></b> (The Secret of the Old Church), 1940, and <b><i>Binibiro Lamang Kita</i></b> (I Was Only Joking), 1941. During the war, when Japan occupied the Philippines, the duo had to change their names to Puging and Tuging because of the similarity of the name Togo to Tojo, the Japanese prime minister. They performed a comedy sketch on stage imitating Japanese soldiers who wore several wristwatches at the same time. As a result, they were reportedly brought into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> for questioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war Pugo and Togo resumed their film career, appearing together in several movies until Togo&rsquo;s death in 1952. Without a partner, Pugo&rsquo;s movie roles were as sidekick to other actors such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> or as father to Lou Salvador Jr and Luz Valdez. Moviegoers, however, did not appreciate his comedy routines as much as when he was with Togo until he met the actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\">Bentot</a> in the late 1950s, whose standard role for the rest of his career was as Pugo&rsquo;s overgrown dim-witted son. Pugo and Bentot became the new comedy duo. The two then ventured into radio and later into television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pugo and Bentot were first cast in the DZRH <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1361\">sitcom</a>&nbsp;<b><i>Sebya, Mahal Kita</i></b> (Sebya, I Love You) with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a> in the title role, Eddie San Jose, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4251\">Rosa Aguirre</a>. The popular radio program, where Pugo played the role of Sebya&rsquo;s father, Don Mariano Batekabesa, was made into a film with the same title in 1957. The film version had Pugo and Bentot as supporting actors to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a> and de Villa. The original radio cast was then used in the movie <b><i>My Little Kuwan</i></b><i> </i>(My Little Something), 1958, with the same storyline. Following the success of <b><i>Sebya</i></b>, DZRH produced the sequel <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, 1961-74, where Pugo played the central character of Don Mariano. The show was also produced for television in 1963, airing on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> Channel 3. A later offshoot was <b><i>Si Tatang Kasi </i></b>(Blame It on Father), 1974, which again starred Pugo in the title character, this time with the character name of Mang Nano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pugo&#39;s other sitcoms were <b><i>Wanted: Boarders</i></b>,<b><i> Alright, Okay</i></b>, and<b><i> My Son, My Son</i></b>. He also hosted the amateur radio and television singing contest<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i> </b>in the 1960s with comedian Patsy after the demise of Patsy&rsquo;s co-host Lopito. In 1962, he directed &quot;Sepulturero&quot; (Gravedigger), a segment in the comedy-horror movie <em><strong>Kababalaghan o Kabulastugan?</strong></em> (Mystery or Mischief?). Pugo appeared in at least 30 more movies after Togo&rsquo;s death, including the film versions of his popular sitcoms, but it was through his radio and television shows that audiences heard and watched him regularly.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Gian Carlo C.

Without a partner, Pugo&#x2019;s movie roles were as sidekick to other actors such as <a href=\"/4/4/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> or as father to Lou Salvador Jr and Luz Valdez. Moviegoers, however, did not appreciate his comedy routines as much as when he was with Togo until he met the actor <a href=\"/4/26/4294\">Bentot</a> in the late 1950s, whose standard role for the rest of his career was as Pugo&#x2019;s overgrown dim-witted son. Pugo and Bentot became the new comedy duo. The two then ventured into radio and later into television."

The popular radio program, where Pugo played the role of Sebya&#x2019;s father, Don Mariano Batekabesa, was made into a film with the same title in 1957. The film version had Pugo and Bentot as supporting actors to <a href=\"/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a> and de Villa. The original radio cast was then used in the movie <b><i>My Little Kuwan</i></b><i> </i>(My Little Something), 1958, with the same storyline. Following the success of <b><i>Sebya</i></b>, DZRH produced the sequel <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, 1961-74, where Pugo played the central character of Don Mariano. The show was also produced for television in 1963, airing on <a href=\"/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> Channel 3. A later offshoot was <b><i>Si Tatang Kasi </i></b>(Blame It on Father), 1974, which again starred Pugo in the title character, this time with the character name of Mang Nano."

Broadcasting on the FM band at 104.7 MHz, it airs programs that support the concept <i>ipeyas nan amay</i>, or &ldquo;working for the common good&rdquo; in Kankanaey, the ethnic group and language of Sagada, through programs that spread public awareness of issues that affect health, agriculture, climate change, human rights, indigenous people&rsquo;s rights, women, and culture. Resting on the high ranges of the Cordilleras, the station is managed by indigenous groups of the Cordilleras. It relies on community volunteer work but accepts advertising to help support operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radyo Sagada is the brainchild of Mary Carling, now its station manager, and Bianca Miglioretto of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters, an international nongovernment organization that supports community radio, who conducted seminars and workshops on radio production in 2009 in Sagada. The following year, a community assembly gave birth to the Sagada Community Media Network Inc, later recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission as the owner of Radyo Sagada. After months of test broadcast in 2011, it went on the air, its signals covering Sagada as well as Benguet, Baguio, Kalinga, and the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and Ilocos Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Radyo Sagada&rsquo;s programs are <b><i>Pinagpagan</i></b> (Woven Blanket), which tackles women&rsquo;s rights, <b><i>Health Hour</i></b>, <b><i>Farming School On-Air</i></b>, and programs of indigenous music such as<b><i> Cordillera Liwliwa</i></b> (Cordilleran <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>ed Love Songs) and <b><i>La-ing di Ganduyan</i></b> (Good about Ganduyan [former name of Sagada]). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEarl John M.

Resting on the high ranges of the Cordilleras, the station is managed by indigenous groups of the Cordilleras.

Phoenix, Arizona, USA 6 Apr 2006. News correspondent, television and radio network founder, program host. He was married to Filipina Loreto Feliciano-de Hemedes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stewart was an American war correspondent sent by the United Press International to the Philippines in 1943 to cover World War II. After the war, he settled in the country and married Feliciano in 1948. He then established the Republic Broadcasting System (RBS) on 1 Mar 1950 with the first of its radio-television network, station DZBB, with studios at Calvo Building, Escolta, Manila. Stewart aired the company&rsquo;s first newscast on the same day. In 1951, he and the station covered extensively the Mount Hibok-Hibok eruption and, in 1953, the presidential elections. DZBB was the first station to use telephone patch for live interviews. In 1955, he launched RBS&rsquo;s second radio station, DZXX, the first in the country to devote its broadcast to popular music. It was followed in 1957 by DYSS Cebu and DYOO Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 29 Oct 1961, Stewart expanded to television with RBS Channel 7. The following day, on 30 Oct 1961, he went on air to deliver the news in <b><i>The News with Uncle Bob</i></b>, which lasted until 1972. Low ratings led RBS to the brink of bankruptcy in its first few years, with only the show <b><i>Dancetime with Chito </i></b>helping the company stay afloat. Then ratings picked up when he began airing canned American programs, including <b><i>Combat!</i></b>,<b><i> The Flying Nun</i></b>,<b><i> Mission: Impossible</i></b>,<b><i> 77 Sunset Strip</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>The Untouchables</i></b>, as well as cartoons such as <b><i>Popeye </i></b>and <b><i>Gumby</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stewart is best remembered for the children&rsquo;s show <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b>, which he produced and hosted until 1984. Children joined him in the studio as participants and as audience, interacting with the puppets Spanky the Elephant and Pancho. In 1961, the Diosdado Macapagal administration accused RBS of supporting presidential rival <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong></a> in the 1960 elections and threatened Stewart with deportation. Children and their parents rallied behind Stewart until the government backed down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1974, two years after Marcos declared martial law, a new law restricted ownership of media to Filipino citizens and corporations. Stewart and the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which owned 25 percent of RBS, sold the company to Marcos ally Gilberto M. Duavit, lawyer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4845\"><strong>Felipe L. Gozon</strong></a>, then Stewart&rsquo;s legal adviser, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4858\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4860\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Menardo R. Jimenez</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>. RBS then became GMA Radio-Television Arts. However, the company name was not changed to GMA Inc until 1996. GMA at first stood for Greater Manila Area, Channel 7&rsquo;s initial coverage area. Today it stands for Global Media Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even when he no longer owned the network, Stewart continued to host <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b> until 1984 and a late-night musical show, <b><i>The Maestro and Uncle Bob</i></b>, 1978-79, with Spanish-Filipino pianist, composer, and conductor Federico Elizalde on the piano. When Elizalde died in 1979, the show was renamed <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4964\"><strong>Bob Stewart</strong></a> Show</i></b>, then <b><i>Uncle Bob and Friends</i></b>, 1979-86, with pianist Joselito Pascual. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Gian Carlo C.

Stewart aired the company&#x2019;s first newscast on the same day. In 1951, he and the station covered extensively the Mount Hibok-Hibok eruption and, in 1953, the presidential elections. DZBB was the first station to use telephone patch for live interviews. In 1955, he launched RBS&#x2019;s second radio station, DZXX, the first in the country to devote its broadcast to popular music. It was followed in 1957 by DYSS Cebu and DYOO Iloilo."

La Paz, Tarlac 16 Apr 1935. d. San Juan City, Metro Manila 24 Mar 2018. Radio, television, and film actor, writer, sound editor, and line producer. She was the daughter of Gabriel Bate Tagasa and Francisca Antonio Palomo. Her daughter Gina is a film and television writer for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> while her Chicago-based daughter Melanie &ldquo;Lani&rdquo; Tagasa Montreal-Bermudez was a writer for the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b> and is also a playwright.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe attended La Paz Elementary School in Tarlac until grade 4, then finished primary schooling at Regina Regente Elementary School in Santa Cruz, Manila, when her family moved to the city. She finished High School at Bethel Girls High School in Lope de Vega along Avenida Rizal. She took up journalism as a freshman in the University of Santo Tomas, but shifted course to education when she transferred to the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University a year later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tagasa was 16 when she auditioned for a role in the DZBC soap <b><i>Katarungan ng Isang Ina</i></b> (Justice for a Mother) in 1952, where she played the role as a <i>kontrabida</i> (antagonist) waitress for three months. The show&rsquo;s writer-producer cast her without pay for the soap and other DZBC dramas. Producer-directors Artemio Marquez and Jose Miranda Cruz then put her in DZBC&rsquo;s top-rated dramas of the time, <b><i>Mahal Kita Inay</i></b> (I Love You Mother) and <b><i>Sepulturero sa Lumang Libingan</i></b> (Undertaker in the Old Cemetery), this time with pay. She was then top-billed in the highly popular primetime DZBC drama <b><i>Panata ng Puso</i></b> (The Heart&rsquo;s Promise). The show&rsquo;s success led to a role in a program <b><i>Aklat ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Book of Love) on DZRH, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\"><strong>Genoveva Edroza-Matute</strong></a> and sponsored by the Philippine Manufacturing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (PMC), now Procter and Gamble. When it ended, she moved to DZRH where she was cast this time with pay of 120 pesos a month in one of her rare roles as a kindhearted woman in <b><i>Aklat ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Book of Love) written by Genoveva Edroza-Matute. By this time, the mid-1950s, radio dramas were sweeping the nation. She was also in DZAQ&rsquo;s blockbuster <b><i>Hanggang Wakas</i></b> (Until The End) written by Jose Miranda Cruz, where she played the role of harsh Do&ntilde;a Claudia opposite actor Ben David.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her most memorable television role is as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> Gawgaw Tapia&rdquo; or &ldquo;Miss Tapia,&rdquo; the professor of Wanbol University in the sitcom <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b> (School Bumps) on IBC Channel 13, 1977-90. Unbeknownst to many, Miss Tapia was the name of Tagasa&rsquo;s character in her first television program <b><i>Baltic &amp; Co.</i></b>, a workplace situation comedy directed by Ricky Manalo and aired on GMA 7 from 1974 to 1976, which was based on the cartoon serial on <b><i>Bulletin Today</i></b> (now <b><i>Manila Bulletin</i></b>) created by Roni Santiago. &ldquo;Miss Tapia&rdquo; in <b><i>Baltic &amp; Co.</i></b> was a cashier, but her iconic strictly no-nonsense character was so popular that it was reprised in <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b>, but this time as a schoolmarm.

At the height of the anti-Marcos sentiment, Tomas created her most famous and lasting character in <b><i>Meldita</i></b>, 1986, directed by Kokoy Jimenez.

His innovation in dramatizing radio news by impersonating voices of political personalities in the 1930s was considered groundbreaking at the time. He was also the first Filipino to be appointed manager of a radio station when broadcasting in the Philippines was dominated by Americans during the American colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Trinidad&rsquo;s broadcasting career started at the Far East Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> where he served as singer, announcer, program arranger, and production coordinator in 1932-41. When Japan occupied the Philippines during World War II, he refused to work in the Japanese-controlled radio station PIAM. Instead, he and Lamberto Avellana produced and directed stage presentations at the Avenue, Lyric, and Strand theaters in 1941-45. After the war, he returned to radio and worked as producer-announcer on KZFM under the US Office of War Information in Manila beginning in 1945.

Manila 8 Jun 1939. Director, actor, comedian, producer, writer. He is the eldest of the seven children of Manuel Urbano Sr and Julita Salazar. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4978\"><strong>Jun Urbano</strong></a> married Victoria Sublay with whom he has four children. His father Manuel Sr, aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>, a popular director, actor, and producer during his time, was proclaimed National Artist in 2014. He considers his father one of his influences as well as another iconic director, Gerardo de Leon. He took up bachelor of science in journalism at Ateneo de Manila where he graduated in 1961. He unconsciously learned his father&rsquo;s trade when he took him along during the shooting, editing, and scoring of film and TV projects. He wrote scripts for his father&rsquo;s <b><i>Under the Guava Tree with Juan Tamad</i></b>, 1962, which aired 48 episodes on IBC 13. He got news stories from the week and wrote comedy skits based on these. In spite of his exposure to the media industry, he resisted joining it and worked on the police beat of the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b> as a fresh college graduate. He also tried selling insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He entered the advertising industry as a copywriter and then as a production assistant in video film but he did not prosper in both capacities.His first break came in the 1970s, directing a 15-seconder ad for Nescafe. After that he became one of the most productive young directors of Image Films, one of the era&rsquo;s busiest production companies. From there, he started a satellite production company called Filmex, which was the advertising industry&rsquo;s perennial winner of the Advertising Production House of the Year of the period. He spent 35 years in the advertising industry as a television commercial director. In the 1980s, he was one of the most sought-after television commercial directors with a number of award-winning TV commercials credited to him. The advertising Pilak Awards, which is the roster of the country&rsquo;s best ads of the last 20 years, lists down some of his iconic ads: San Miguel Beer&rsquo;s <b><i>Isang Platitong Mani </i></b>(A Saucer of Peanuts), Pepsi&rsquo;s <b><i>Have a Pepsi Day</i></b>, and Chiclet&rsquo;s <b><i>Chiclet-in Mo, Baby </i></b>(Chew It with a Chicklet, Baby). Other popular San Miguel TV commercials he made were <b><i>Isa Pa Nga </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> More, Please), <b><i>Ito ang Beer </i></b>(This Is the Beer), and <b><i>Iba ang May Pinagsamahan </i></b>(Nothing Beats Friendship). His roster of work in the advertising industry earned him an Advertising Hall of Fame Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When he turned 50, he decided to turn his attention to TV appearances as the popular character Mr Shooli of the TV show <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>, 1990-91, on IBC 13, and 1993-95, on RPN 9. Mr Shooli, a fictional character inspired by his father&rsquo;s movie characters in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>, 1952, critically comments on various social issues. Urbano envisioned Shooli as a vehicle for social and political change through entertainment. Mr Shooli&rsquo;s sidekick is Kuhol, played by Philip Supnet. <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue </i></b>became so popular it gave birth to two movies: <b><i>Juan Tamad at Mister Shooli sa Mongolian Barbecue: The Movie </i></b>(Lazy Juan and Mister Shooli in Mongolian Barbecue: The Movie), 1991, and <b><i>Ang M.O.N.A.Y. (Misteyks Obda Neysyon Adres Yata) ni Mr. Shooli</i></b><i> </i>(Maybe Mistakes of the Nation Address of Mr Shooli), 2007. The original television version won as one of the 10 best TV programs at the Gawad CCP para sa Telebisyon in 1990 and 1991, and garnered three awards at the Catholic Mass Media Awards in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent years, Urbano has been spending most of his time in the speaker&rsquo;s circuit as Mr Shooli. He finds joy in tickling his audience to take notice and mull over what is happening in the country. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Irma Mutuc</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:inter-ideograph\">Sources: <b><i>Bukisa</i></b> 2014; <b><i>Pelikula Atbp. </i></b>2008; Urbano 2013; <b><i>Wikipedia </i></b>2013f.</span></p>\r\n",

He wrote scripts for his father&#x2019;s <b><i>Under the Guava Tree with Juan Tamad</i></b>, 1962, which aired 48 episodes on IBC 13. He got news stories from the week and wrote comedy skits based on these. In spite of his exposure to the media industry, he resisted joining it and worked on the police beat of the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b> as a fresh college graduate. He also tried selling insurance."

He spent 35 years in the advertising industry as a television commercial director. In the 1980s, he was one of the most sought-after television commercial directors with a number of award-winning TV commercials credited to him. The advertising Pilak Awards, which is the roster of the country&#x2019;s best ads of the last 20 years, lists down some of his iconic ads: San Miguel Beer&#x2019;s <b><i>Isang Platitong Mani </i></b>(A Saucer of Peanuts), Pepsi&#x2019;s <b><i>Have a Pepsi Day</i></b>, and Chiclet&#x2019;s <b><i>Chiclet-in Mo, Baby </i></b>(Chew It with a Chicklet, Baby).

Mr Shooli, a fictional character inspired by his father&#x2019;s movie characters in <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>, 1952, critically comments on various social issues.

Ureta hosted <b><i>Metro Magazine</i></b>, mid-1970s until early 1980s, with co-host <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4427\"><strong>Jaime Fabregas</strong></a>, produced by the Metro Manila Commission, an excellent magazine that combined talk, travelogue, and mini-documentaries. An episode was broadcast daily, each on a different day and time on each of all the five Metro Manila TV channels. A show he hosted that became very popular was the daily early evening music variety talk show <b><i>Ariel &amp; Co. After Six</i></b>, premiered in 1975, BBC 2, with child superstar Ni&ntilde;o Muhlach who was then barely three years old, and with alternating women hosts like Gloria Diaz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4600\"><strong>Pilar Pilapil</strong></a>, Chiqui Brosas, Maureen Ava Vieira, Guada Sanchez, Lotis Key, Carmen Pate&ntilde;a, Gina Pare&ntilde;o, and Eva Reyes. The show was written by Lyca Benitez and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>. During the show&rsquo;s first year anniversary, it handed out the &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Gift to Television Awards,&rdquo; which honored the people who have accomplished dubious achievements in television. The trophies, designed and crafted by Manahan, were crude tin cups on a base made of scrap materials. In the 1970s until the 1980s, Ureta hosted many live shows, including televised beauty pageants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During martial law, Ureta reportedly uttered the quote &ldquo;Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, bisikleta ang kailangan&rdquo; (For the country to progress, bicycle is necessary), a mockery of the New Society slogan &ldquo;Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan&rdquo; (For the country to progress, discipline is necessary). He was allegedly arrested, taken to Camp Crame, and made to ride a bicycle around the camp while shouting the correct slogan. Ureta has denied, only in recent years, having made that quip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the EDSA Revolt, Ureta worked again at the reopened ABS-CBN as production manager and creative director, together with newscaster Frankie Evangelista, under programming head Jimmy Navarro. Ureta left ABS-CBN in 1987 for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\"><strong>Viva Films</strong></a> when Freddie M. Garcia moved back from GMA to ABS-CBN. He continued to do TV hosting in the music variety show <b><i>RSVP</i></b>, 1991-94, GMA, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4748\"><strong>Dawn Zulueta</strong></a> and Ai-Ai de las Alas; the late-night talk program <b><i>My Favorite Show</i></b>, 2005-6, ABS-CBN News Channel; and the game show <b><i>Go for It</i></b>, ABC/TV5.

As a humorist, he is fond of transliterations and spoofed everything and anything that was fashionable. &ldquo;He is at home both in &lsquo;kanto&rsquo; (pedestrian corner) humor and subtle double entendres. He can mimic a little boy lost, looking at the world with unsettling naivete. Or be the adult-innocent doing double takes. Or the smart aleck trying not to laugh at someone else&rsquo;s boo-boo&rdquo; (Ledesma-Aguirre 1976a, 8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He won the Star Awards given by the Philippine Movie Press Club for Best Male TV Host for <b><i>RSVP</i></b> in 1992 and he and the entire cast of <b><i>Umagang kay Ganda</i></b> were awarded Best Morning Show Hosts in 2012 and 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEulalio R.

She returned to the Philippines in 1958 to be at her sick father&rsquo;s bedside. She directed the game show <b><i>Guess My Living</i></b>, 1958, DZAQ-TV Channel 5, but retired immediately from TV when she found the local TV scene not challenging enough. She ran a music lounge called Embers Club, where she also occasionally sang. She returned to TV when she was offered to direct the music variety show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1437\"><strong>An Evening with Pilita</strong></a></i></b>, later changed to <b><i>Your Evening with Pilita</i></b>, 1964-71, ABS Channel 3, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>. At the heart of this program was Corrales&rsquo;s performance with the singing group Lemons Three, composed of Nikki Ross, Angie Yoingco, and director Villareal herself, who performed serious and comedy songs in the show. The Lemons Three would be known as the Wing Duo when Villareal left the group to focus on her TV directing. She directed other popular music variety shows on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> Channel 3, including <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></a></i></b>, 1965-72, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a> and Nestor de Villa; episodes of <b><i>Stop, Look, and Listen</i></b>, 1968-70, featuring Jeanne Young, alternating with directors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4907\"><strong>Maria Montelibano</strong></a>, Raul Silos, and Heidi Sison; <b><i>That Young Image</i></b>, late 1960s, also with Young, and production design by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4743\"><strong>Fiel Zabat</strong></a>; and<b><i> This Girl Pilar</i></b>, 1970, featuring then newly crowned Miss Philippines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4600\"><strong>Pilar Pilapil</strong></a>.

ABS-CBN acquired <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1505\"><strong>Salamisim</strong></a> </i></b>(Reflections) from ABC 5 and renamed it <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1483\"><strong>Panagimpan</strong></a></i></b> (Dream), which started airing on ABS Channel 3 on Oct 1968 and ran until 1972.

In <b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b>, she experimented on editing with the split-screen image of the &ldquo;Three Pilitas&rdquo;&mdash;a Visayan Pilita, an English Pilita, and a Spanish Pilita&mdash;each speaking to one another, an editing technique first seen on local television. When color TV was introduced in 1969, she was one of the first to meticulously play with the color schemes of the design of the studio and the wardrobe and makeup of the artists in her programs (Rodrigo 2006). In <b><i>That Young Image</i></b>, she extensively played with the then newly introduced electronic image imposition device called the chroma key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The minimalist and sometimes lavish sets, novel lighting, surprising editing techniques, Villareal&rsquo;s music variety programs on television became synonymous with elegance &ldquo;in which the music and the songs were the stars&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 132).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1973 until the late 1990s, Villareal continued to direct television shows of different genres: the revived music variety program <b><i>Fantastik Jeanne in Motion</i></b>, later retitled <b><i>The Jeanne Young Show</i></b>, RPN 9, again with Jeanne Young; the drama anthology <b><i>Dulambuhay ni Rosa Vilma </i></b>(Life Story of Rosa Vilma), BBC 2, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>; the limited-run drama anthology <b><i>Phillip</i></b>, BBC 2, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4667\"><strong>Phillip Salvador</strong></a>; the dance program <b><i>Discorama</i></b>, GMA, with Bobby Ledesma and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>, which introduced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4882\"><strong>Loren Legarda</strong></a> and the comedy trio Tito, Vic, and Joey; the cooking show <b><i>Cooking It Up with Nora</i></b>, GMA, with Nora Daza; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1400\"><strong>Aawitan Kita</strong></a></i></b> (I Shall Sing for You), RPN 9, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>; a few beauty pageants; and live coverage of special events of then president Ferdinand Marcos as part of a contract she had with the government-owned National Media Production Center. Villareal directed again <b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b> as a one-airing special on 7 Oct 1977 on GMA.

Some of the more popular songs they recorded were &ldquo;Cadete&rdquo; (Cadet) and &ldquo;Alila&rdquo; (Slave). &ldquo;Cadete&rdquo; is a novelty song with comic banter estimated to have been recorded circa 1940 or earlier as it mentioned the Second Sino-Japanese War, which lasted from 1937 to 1945. &ldquo;Alila&rdquo; is a metaphor for the country&rsquo;s condition under colonial rule.

The song begins with a comic exchange between Villegas and Fernando and ends with a Tagalog <i>kundiman </i>(love song) finale delivered by Fernando."

It served as the main propaganda medium of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), which retreated to Bataan and Corregidor at the end of 1941 under the command of Gen Douglas MacArthur as the Japanese forces aggressively advanced toward Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The station was built out of equipment that MacArthur ordered commandeered from KZRH before leaving Manila even as he ordered the USAFFE to blow up all private and commercial radio broadcast equipment rather than let the Japanese lay their hands on what was believed a critical propaganda medium. Ironically, the Japanese found more remnants of KZRH equipment, which formed the backbone of the Japanese-controlled station KZRH, later PIAM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prewar KZRH announcer and chief engineer Ted Ince and KZRH technician Cheng Sian Yok, a Chinese national who adopted the name Simeon Cheng upon his naturalization as Filipino after the war, built the station&rsquo;s studio inside the Malinta Tunnel in Corregidor. Christened Voice of Freedom by MacArthur, the station aired from 5 Jan 1942 until Corregidor was captured by the Japanese on 6 May 1942. It played American popular music and occasionally carried the signal of US Army station KGEI in San Francisco, California. A program also titled <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b> broadcast nightly, opening with the American anthem &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner<i>.</i>&rdquo;<i> </i>Its announcer, newspaperman <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\"><strong>Carlos P. Romulo</strong></a>, who was also general manager of prewar Far East Broadcasting Corporation, updated listeners on the effort to repel the Japanese forces closing in on Bataan. Following the program was its Tagalog version, the <b><i>Tinig ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan</i></b>&mdash;Tagalog for Voice of Freedom&mdash;with translator and announcer Philippine Army lieutenant Francisco Isidoro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Romulo, Leon Ma. Guerrero, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\"><strong>Salvador P. Lopez</strong></a></strong></a> took turns writing the script of the evening broadcast in English, while the English announcing staff included Romulo, Guerrero, and prewar KZRM announcer Normando Ildefonso Reyes, better known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4944\"><strong>Norman Reyes</strong></a>. When Romulo was evacuated to Australia before the Japanese capture of Bataan on 9 Apr 1942, Reyes took over the program <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b>. It was Reyes who dramatically read Lopez&rsquo;s now-classic piece, &ldquo;Bataan Has Fallen,&rdquo; which chronicled a critical loss to the Japanese forces but also attempted to raise the spirits of the remaining USAFFE forces in Corregidor and the Filipinos who were tuned in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the stations in Manila fell silent at the end of Dec 1941, KZRC in Cebu continued broadcasting freely, carrying the signal of the <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b> until the Fall of Bataan, and then subsequently airing its own resistance broadcast until the Japanese overran the province in May 1942. The <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b> fell silent upon surrender of the Filipino and American soldiers in Corregidor to the Japanese army. Knowing the impact of broadcasting Japanese victory on the Filipino audience, the Japanese made Maj Gen Jonathan Wainwright&mdash;who commanded the resistance in Bataan and Corregidor following the evacuation to Australia of Gen Douglas MacArthur&mdash;announce the surrender on the air on 7 May 1942 over the Japanese-controlled KZRH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon MacArthur&rsquo;s landing on Palo Beach, Leyte, on 20 Oct 1944, a new Voice of Freedom went on the air as he announced his return to the Philippines on the naval radio station VLC-6, one of the stations Filipino guerrillas monitored on shortwave while it was in the high seas, now a land station called WVLC. The announcement, long awaited by the Filipinos, flooded the country and signaled the beginning of the end of the war. WVLC transmitted from equipment set up on a weapons carrier parked on the beach of Palo. With American soldiers as news writers, announcers, and engineers, it relocated to a Tacloban schoolhouse before moving to Manila. It broadcast American music and other shows. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byElizabeth L.

Christened Voice of Freedom by MacArthur, the station aired from 5 Jan 1942 until Corregidor was captured by the Japanese on 6 May 1942. It played American popular music and occasionally carried the signal of US Army station KGEI in San Francisco, California.

The <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b> fell silent upon surrender of the Filipino and American soldiers in Corregidor to the Japanese army. Knowing the impact of broadcasting Japanese victory on the Filipino audience, the Japanese made Maj Gen Jonathan Wainwright&#x2014;who commanded the resistance in Bataan and Corregidor following the evacuation to Australia of Gen Douglas MacArthur&#x2014;announce the surrender on the air on 7 May 1942 over the Japanese-controlled KZRH."

The announcement, long awaited by the Filipinos, flooded the country and signaled the beginning of the end of the war. WVLC transmitted from equipment set up on a weapons carrier parked on the beach of Palo. With American soldiers as news writers, announcers, and engineers, it relocated to a Tacloban schoolhouse before moving to Manila.

DZRH disapproved of his political involvements and suspended him from his program and terminated his other radio shows: <b><i>Ruleta Musikal </i></b>(<a href=\"/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Roulette), <b><i>Tatlo Lamang </i></b>(Only Three), and <b><i>Gumising sa Pagsikat ng Araw </i></b>(Wake Up at Sunrise). His feisty commentaries earned him supporters as well as enemies. On 23 Feb 1968, a gunman ambushed him along San Marcelino St following his on-air tirades against the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes. He survived the attack. Upon recovery, he joined the government station DZFM, but by then his listenership and popularity had waned. He briefly hosted <b><i>The <a href=\"/8/69/4991\"><strong>Rafael Yabut</strong></a> Show</i></b> on Channel 7 before the declaration of martial law in 1972. After the EDSA Revolt in 1986, he joined DZBB where he was assigned to the graveyard shift."

He obtained a bachelor of arts in philosophy from Ateneo de Manila University. In high school, he took the female lead in most of the plays he joined. Fr James Reuter, SJ, got him to play Queen Elizabeth I. He completed his master of arts in film and television production at the University of California in Los Angeles, early 1960s, where he trained under cinema luminaries John Frankenheimer, Sam Austen, and Francis Ford Coppola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ynfante directed numerous weekly music programs, variety shows, beauty pageant shows, and commercials. His works were always a party, marked by extravagance that draws inspiration from Broadway and the world of big musicals. Ynfante calls his directing style choreography. His shots and editing are always rhythmic, and his actors&rsquo; movements always go with the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He did production and directing work for J. Walter Thompson in the mid-1960s, which included the famous <b><i>Shell Zoom-Zoom </i></b>TV commercial before Mel Panlasigue, an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> executive, invited him to join the director and be part of the network&rsquo;s pool of directors of musicals like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4986\"><strong>Mitos Villareal</strong></a> and Freddie Cochrane. His first pre-martial law TV show was a fashion musical for cosmetics product Pond&rsquo;s Cream in the mid-1960s, followed by a series of musicals on ABC 5. During the early years of the martial law period, he directed two TV drama anthologies, <b><i>Tatluhan</i></b> (Trilogy), BBC 2, a weekly one-hour program that featured three stories, each directed by a different director, and <b><i>Roco</i></b>, GMA, starring then young actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4640\"><strong>Bembol Roco</strong></a>. He got into trouble with the Board of Censors, which during the period required pretaped programs to be submitted to the body for screening prior to airing, when one episode of <b><i>Roco</i></b> featured incestuous love between a man and his sister who went to Manila to become a sex worker. The censors&rsquo; body eventually allowed the episode to be shown on evening primetime, but pieces of conversation from the dialogue of the drama were blipped off the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He went back to musicals after this brief experience with drama. From the 1970s to the 1980s, he directed the TV specials <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a> Specials</i></b>, <b><i>Rico Puno: If My Friends Could See Me Now</i></b>, and <b><i>Victor Wood Alive</i></b>. He directed one of Philippine TV&rsquo;s most popular dance programs, <b><i>Penthouse 7</i></b>, 1974-81, later renamed <b><i>Penthouse Live</i></b>, 1982-87, both on GMA, produced by Freddie M. Garcia, and hosted by Archie Lacson. The show popularized dance steps such as the Robot, the Bump, the Jacksons, the LA Walk, the New York Hustle, Pop-Locking, and Locking. It had an instructional portion where performers taught viewers how to do these steps. Some mainstays included Marlyn Feliciano, RayAn Fuentes, Rosie Garchitorena-Gan, Anna Garcia, Tito Garcia, Sandy Hontiveros, Pipo Liboro, Mike Monserrat, Nini Morato, Susan Payawal, Poncy Quirino, Ronnie Henares and wife Ida Ramos, Gina Valenciano-Martinez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4856\"><strong>Nanette Inventor</strong></a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the show&rsquo;s most popular segments was the stand-up comedy of Do&ntilde;a Buding, a character created by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\"><strong>Jose Javier Reyes</strong></a> and played by Nanette Inventor. The comedy sketch was a social satire that ridiculed the manners, sensibilities, illusions, and delusions of the rich. It was also on <b><i>Penthouse Live</i></b> that viewers witnessed the unfolding of the love story between popular singing stars <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3984\"><strong>Pops Fernandez</strong></a>, who co-hosted the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ynfante reincarnated the 1968 Caronia commercial in the 1980s, choreographed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2545\"><strong>Douglas Nierras</strong></a>, using the same jingle but with more contemporary lyrics, with four models in fuchsia and electric blue mini-dresses dancing in front of life-sized Caronia nail polish bottles. He brought this brand of hilarity in some episodes he directed in the TV music variety show <b><i>NaKUH &hellip; EtonAPO Sila</i></b><i> </i>(Oh, Kuh &hellip; The APO Is Here). In its 11 Jun 1986 episode, for example, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>, composed of Buboy Garrovillo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\"><strong>Jim Paredes</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4022\"><strong>Danny Javier</strong></a>, donned rubber mermaid tails for a lampoon of the popular Hollywood movie<b><i>Splash</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A significant contribution of Ynfante as a director of the TV musical is <b><i>At Long Last, Celeste!</i></b>, 1975, GMA, produced by Circus Band member Richard Tan. The musical, starring singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a>, revolves around the story of a new star on her concert night.

Composer, lyricist, singer, and radio entertainer. He was the son of Jesus Zubiri, a Spaniard, and Sergia Dacayana, a Cebuana who taught Ben to play the guitar at an early age. In Bohol he met and later married Luz Butalid, with whom he had five children. He studied at San Nicolas Elementary School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zubiri was a pioneering radio entertainer, a prolific music composer, and a popular stage and movie actor. He began his radio, music, and acting career in the 1930s by winning amateur singing contests on the first radio station in Cebu, KZRC, often singing his original compositions, and acting in the theater groups of Greg Bacua, a well-known Cebuano writer and dramatic actor, and Toting Villarino. In 1938, he played the lead role in the first Cebuano talking film written and directed by Piux Kabahar, <b><i>Bertoldo ug Baludoy </i></b>(Bertoldo and Baludoy), produced by Virgilio Gonzales of Pampanga for Hispano-Filipino Productions. The film was a hit in the Visayas and Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zubiri was known for the songs &ldquo;Karon Ulahi Na&rdquo; (Now It&rsquo;s Too Late) and &ldquo;Ang Palad Nagbuot&rdquo; (Destiny Decides). The genesis of these songs can be traced back to prewar Cebu when a beautiful girl who admired Zubiri caught his heart. Their closeness was interrupted by Zubiri&rsquo;s sojourn in Manila to represent Cebu in the national finals of the radio singing contest <b><i>Amateur Hour</i></b> and also to record his songs with Victor Recording Studios. When World War II broke out, he went home to Cebu on the <i>Corregidor</i>, a passenger ship bound for the Visayas. The boat sank but Zubiri made it to Cebu together with other famous radio personalities like Antolin Alcudia, Suix Cabase, George Nator, and Maning Villareal. However, by the time he returned, the girl he loved was married, thus the titles of the songs above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During World War II, Zubiri joined the guerrillas under Colonel Cushing. While with the resistance movement, Zubiri wrote the well-loved Cebuano song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/942\"><strong>Matud Nila</strong></a>&rdquo; (They Say), and &ldquo;Ngano Bang Mipakita Ka&rdquo; (Why Did You Come) and &ldquo;Pukawon Ko Ikaw&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll Wake You Up). Well loved too were his &ldquo;Ikaduhang Bathala&rdquo; (Second God), &ldquo;Katulog na Inday&rdquo; (Sleep, Inday), &ldquo;Tuhoi&rdquo; (Believe), &ldquo;Pasayawa Ko, Day&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Dance, Day), &ldquo;Mito-o Ako&rdquo; (I Believe), &ldquo;Bisan Hain Ka Karon&rdquo; (No Matter Where You Are), &ldquo;Ikaw Na Lamang&rdquo; (Only You), &ldquo;Pangandoy Ko Ikaw&rdquo; (You Are My Dream), &ldquo;Pangutan-A ang Langit&rdquo; (Ask Heavens), and &ldquo;Gugmang Gibati Ko&rdquo; (The Love I Feel).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biobodytext\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war, Zubiri returned to KZRC (later DYRC) where he sang once more. He also became the director of musical programs such as <b><i>Haranista</i></b> (Serenader) and <b><i>Gabii sa Tirana</i></b> (Night of the Love Song). He also became the director of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>. From 1950, Zubiri managed the radio dramas of the Philippine Manufacturing Corporation (PMC) starting with <b><i>Ligid sa Kapalaran</i></b> (Wheel of Life), a daily morning serial drama on radio and <b><i>Asa Ka Inday?</i></b> (Where Are You, Inday?), which aired in the evenings. He also had other morning programs like <b><i>Sinugatan sa Bag-ong Adlaw</i></b> (Presents of a New Day) and <b><i>Mugrazu Time</i></b>. From 1951, Zubiri managed the long-running and record-breaking <b><i>PMC Amateur Hour</i></b> in Cebu, a one-hour weekly musical-variety show. Zubiri&rsquo;s management of the <b><i>PMC Amateur Hour</i></b>, under the pseudonym Iyo Karpo, made him an immediate household name. People crowded to hear his programs which were played in the plaza because the studio was too small to hold the audience.

He began his radio, music, and acting career in the 1930s by winning amateur singing contests on the first radio station in Cebu, KZRC, often singing his original compositions, and acting in the theater groups of Greg Bacua, a well-known Cebuano writer and dramatic actor, and Toting Villarino. In 1938, he played the lead role in the first Cebuano talking film written and directed by Piux Kabahar, <b><i>Bertoldo ug Baludoy </i></b>(Bertoldo and Baludoy), produced by Virgilio Gonzales of Pampanga for Hispano-Filipino Productions. The film was a hit in the Visayas and Mindanao."

The genesis of these songs can be traced back to prewar Cebu when a beautiful girl who admired Zubiri caught his heart. Their closeness was interrupted by Zubiri&#x2019;s sojourn in Manila to represent Cebu in the national finals of the radio singing contest <b><i>Amateur Hour</i></b> and also to record his songs with Victor Recording Studios. When World War II broke out, he went home to Cebu on the <i>Corregidor</i>, a passenger ship bound for the Visayas. The boat sank but Zubiri made it to Cebu together with other famous radio personalities like Antolin Alcudia, Suix Cabase, George Nator, and Maning Villareal. However, by the time he returned, the girl he loved was married, thus the titles of the songs above."

Zubiri&#x2019;s management of the <b><i>PMC Amateur Hour</i></b>, under the pseudonym Iyo Karpo, made him an immediate household name. People crowded to hear his programs which were played in the plaza because the studio was too small to hold the audience. Zubiri&#x2019;s jokes entertained his listeners, and his program also helped to find radio talent."
