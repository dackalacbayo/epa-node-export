First, it has functioned as a potent tool for economic convenience and political interests. Philippine broadcasting has always been intricately linked with politics and commerce, with both government and business interests always intervening in the governance, operations, and directions of the industry. It has often been at the mercy of capital and the state, for which it has often been criticized as the &ldquo;lapdog&rdquo; of the dominant. Politics and economics became intensely intertwined with broadcasting as it became not only a profitable investment but also an arena for political power matches. The value of broadcast for political and business interests has also rested on the fact that broadcasting in the Philippines has not only been national in impact but transnational in varying features and contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Second, broadcasting has served as an agent of social change at crucial moments of history. With such close links between politics and business, broadcasting has made its presence profoundly felt in crucial and important historical watersheds that significantly shaped the terrain and directions of the life of the nation. At such crucial moments, its presence often served to subvert the dominant order, ushering change that can be dramatic and radical. The irony is two-fold, however. The resistances are subtler and sometimes unintended, but the consequences nonetheless may subvert the cultural designs of the dominant, undermining its political agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In serving private stakes, government interests, and the public good, broadcasting is always at the intersection of contradicting and contrary claims, assertions, negotiations, and appropriations about the nation. Indeed, it constantly creates the art of the everyday: malleable, yet firm when the democratic foundations of our country are threatened; raw, yet able to represent everything about society with fastidious care; mundane, yet capable of imagining possibilities. Broadcasting constantly feels the stirrings of daily life, and is always embedded in the constantly moving agitations of the everyday making of the nation, uniting the people in the midst of differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"beginnings\" name=\"beginnings\"></a>The Colonial Beginnings of Radio Broadcasting (1922-41)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Politics, Commerce, and Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>The introduction in 1922 of radio to the Philippines by the American government was simultaneous with its colonial project of convincing Filipinos of the goodness and desirability of American culture, progress, and modernity. Apart from being a product to sell, radio became a promising new medium for advertising the myriad merchandise the Americans brought into the Philippines, such as typewriters, safes, bicycles, automobiles, phonographs, phonograph records, radio sets, fountain pens, firearms, electric ice boxes, office equipment, neckties, evening gowns, insurance, cigars, toothpastes, detergents, and soaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The colonial administration subsidized radio broadcasting in its first several years, but advertising was a critical support to bankroll operations. Businesses that previously advertised only in newspapers and magazines began buying radio airtime. The first to set up radio broadcasting facilities to support the primary business of retailing were Henry Herman, Isaac Beck, and William H. Anderson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Government Regulation and Intervention</b>.<b> </b>Philippine radio broadcasting, being a product of wireless telegraphy and part of the mail system, was first regulated by the Bureau of Posts, which granted permits for the operation of broadcast stations until 1931. Federal law in the United States regarding radio, however, did not apply to the colony. The policies that developed on radio broadcasting in the Philippines reflected the stance of the United States, articulated in 1928 by then US president Calvin Coolidge in an executive order, that the development of privately owned and operated radio facilities should be encouraged, but that these facilities should be available for national defense in time of war or any similar national emergency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The colonial Philippine legislature passed Act 3846 in 1931, or the Radio Control Law, which transferred the regulation of the industry from the Bureau of Posts to the newly-created Radio Control Board. The board was put under the supervision of the secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry, while the public works and communications secretary approved the construction of radio facilities and transmitting stations. One of the major provisions of the law was on broadcast licensing and ownership. The law provided that licenses could be granted or transferred only to citizens of the United States or of the Philippines, or to firms or companies that were incorporated under the laws of the Philippines or of any US state or territory. The law also provided that the US president or the governor-general of the Philippines, in time of war, public peril, calamity, or disaster, could order the closing of any radio station in the Philippines or authorize the temporary use or possession of any radio station by any department of the government upon just compensation to the owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1932, Gov-Gen Theodore Roosevelt Jr ordered the purchase of radio receiving sets and their installation in public squares where communities may listen to broadcasts from Manila. In 1936, Pres Manuel L. Quezon attempted to nationalize broadcasting and use it against his critics, but he failed to expropriate the radio stations from private ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With war looming on the horizon in the late 1930s, radio became an indispensable propaganda device for both the Allies and the Axis powers in fighting a global war. The American colonial administration kept under surveillance radio station owners and staff, both Americans and Filipinos, to check their loyalty in light of the ominous events in Europe and China. Quezon issued emergency rules through the National Emergency Administration in 1941, which included new regulations governing electrical communication and radio installations, the sale or repair of radio sets or radio parts, which should all be registered with the government, and the surveillance of unlicensed radio transmitter installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1941, the government established <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4871\">KZND</a> (with ND standing for national defense), which used a confiscated one-kilowatt transmitter, for its own broadcast voice. However, it ceased broadcast as the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), the combined Filipino and American forces under Gen Douglas MacArthur&rsquo;s command, retreated to Bataan and Corregidor while Japanese invasion forces pushed toward Manila around the end of Dec 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Transnational Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>During the early years of Philippine radio, broadcasting signals from the Philippines crossed the oceans and foreign lands by shortwave, a wireless technology that transmitted signals over very long distances. The few stations of the period mainly used long wave, which sent signals over relatively short distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as 1925, Isaac Beck, who put up <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\">KZIB</a> on the air, experimented on using shortwave. Henry Herman&rsquo;s Radio Corporation of the Philippines (RCP), which by then had merged with Far Eastern Radio Inc (FERI), conducted shortwave experiments in 1927. In 1929, RCP&rsquo;s KZRM broadcast to the world and received reports of good reception from distant countries and ships in the high seas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It must be noted, however, that some of the islands within the archipelago were already electronically connected to each other and to other countries even before the Americans came. Cable telegraph lines linked Manila to Corregidor in 1867, then to Hong Kong in 1879, and soon to Cebu, Bacolod, Capiz, and Iloilo. In 1890, the first telephone system was put in place. In the 1920s, wireless telegraphy was the main means of long-distance communication. Voice was transmitted through the dozens of radio stations from ship to shore and back, including those of the US military and the government. However, these were principally for point-to-point communication rather than for broadcasting. Historians of broadcast technology understand its development as an offshoot of these earlier means of electronic communication over long distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Having shortwave transmitting capacity also meant having receiving capacity. In 1930, KZRM began carrying American and other foreign programs. On the other hand, the American network National Broadcasting Company (NBC) also carried Manila programs in the United States, occasionally to a nationwide audience. This went on throughout the 1930s until the eve of World War II. With the war underway in Europe at the close of the 1930s, NBC rival Columbia Broadcasting System or CBS, with a network of 110 stations, put Commonwealth president Manuel L. Quezon on the air from Malaca&ntilde;an a number of times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With broadcast stations invested in shortwave transmitters, Philippine broadcasting was able to air transnationally, enabling Manila programs to be heard not only in some continents but also on ships at sea. Radio personalities received fan mail from all over Asia and the United States. When KZRH went on the air, it covered the entire Philippines and also reached much of Asia, the United States, and Europe through shortwave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the introduction to the market of radio sets with shortwave-receiving capacity, an average of 15 hours of foreign broadcast programs were heard in the Philippines every day in 1930. Moreover, the dozens of shortwave stations from all over Asia, North and South America, and Europe that were heard in the Philippines exposed the Filipinos as well as foreigners in the Philippines to a transnational range of program material.<b><a id=\"prog\" name=\"prog\"></a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a name=\"prog\">Programming and Program For</a>mats</b>.<b> </b>The program formats were a takeoff from American radio. Mostly entertainment, many programs combined music and readings of English poetry, prose, and drama, while others took off from the vaudeville style of mixing music with comedy skits or comic repartees. Though with less airtime, also broadcast were news and the occasional live coverage of events, as well as live annotations of sports events, children&rsquo;s programs, educational and instructional programs, religious programs, and various kinds of talk shows. The announcement of the correct time was integrated into the programs, while bulletins about the weather, road and traffic reports, foreign exchange rates, and even the search for missing persons were regularly heard. Notices to mariners, distress signals or SOS, and police information for purposes of keeping peace and order and for safeguarding sea voyages were also heard on radio in the 1920s and the 1930s due to the less distinct functions of broadcasting and point-to-point communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recorded music from the United States and Europe was aired, but most of the music heard on the air were live performances by a mostly Filipino host of musicians and singers. Stations invested not only in recorded music but also in the training of musical talent for live performances on the air. Filipino artists who performed jazz and movie music on the air were popular. Among the first composer-arrangers whose music went on the air were Miguel Velarde Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\">Ariston Avelino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\">Restituto Umali</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4274\">Tito Arevalo</a>. Popular radio talents of the vaudeville-type of music and comic skits were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\">Pugo</a> and Togo, German San Jose and Leonora Reyes, Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan, and Vicente Ocampo and Diana Toy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fans inside the studio provided live laughter and applause. They organized themselves into clubs, with some radio celebrities having several fan clubs competing for attention. Many considered radio stars brighter than movie stars as the movie industry then produced at most a few dozen movies a year, while radio turned out program after program on a daily basis. Thus radio had more newspaper publicity, which may explain why many movie stars also kept a presence on the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertisers courted public tastes and preferences through radio, which were evident in the titles of the shows they supported, with the product name carrying the title of the program. These sponsors were the first blocktimers in Philippine broadcasting. Blocktiming is the network practice of selling airtime to individuals or groups. On KZRM, some examples include the variety quiz and contest show <b><i>Chevrolet Jamboree</i></b> by the Chevrolet automobile; the amateur singing contest <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1459\"><strong>Listerine Amateur Hour</strong></a></i></b> by a toothpaste company; the music program<i> <b>Saturday Night Klim Party</b></i> by a powdered milk brand; and the newscasts <b><i>El Conde de Guell</i></b><i> </i>and<i> <b>Sunkist News</b> </i>by brands of cigars and juice drink, respectively. On KZIB, examples were the music program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1429\"><strong>Crystal Arcade</strong></a></i></b>, sponsored by a shopping mall; the featured dramatizations of excerpts from movies on <b><i>Lux Toilet Soap Theatre of the Air</i></b>, sponsored by a brand of bath soap; and<i> </i>the variety show <b><i>Purico Troubadors</i></b> by a cooking lard brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Appropriations and Nation Building</b>.<b> </b>Radio broadcasting was one ideological tool that imported America into the Philippines. Words and music in the language and accent of the colonizers won the Filipinos over to acceptance of American rule far more effectively than the use of weapons had. The very same medium of colonial radio that the Americans employed as one of the tools to reshape Filipino consciousness, however, was appropriated by Filipino broadcasters who played Filipino music and used Philippine languages on the air. The immense popularity of such programs forced the American investors in the business of radio to respond favorably to the demands of the Filipino audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of these songs suggested criticism of American colonization, such as Dely Atay-atayan&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Alila&rdquo; (Slave), clearly referring to the Philippines&rsquo; subjugation to American rule. The comedy acts that accompanied the performance of this and other such songs detracted from the rebellious tone, but others were straightforward in expressing nationalism and distress over the colonization of the Philippines: <i>kundiman </i>(love song) pieces such as &ldquo;Hibik ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (Lament of the Philippines),<i> </i>&ldquo;Ibong Sawi&rdquo; (Broken-Hearted Bird), and &ldquo;Kantahin ng Ulila&rdquo;<i> </i>(Song of the Orphan). Through radio, the Filipino language undeniably began to reach the farthest parts of the archipelago, slowly fashioning what would become a lingua franca of all regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine broadcasting business toward the end of the 1940s was on its way to becoming an industry. It was exciting, glamorous, and merry, and the audience size was growing exponentially. Regarded primarily as a commercial activity, it enjoyed relative freedom from the control of government, in spite of Quezon&rsquo;s threat to take over it. In 1941, however, the political, economic, and cultural conditions in the Philippines drastically changed as the Americans lost control of the country to Japanese military forces. Radio broadcasting took on various roles as the contending ideologies and worldviews of the Americans and yet another invader exploited radio for the realization of their respective global expansion designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"radio\" name=\"radio\"></a>Radio Broadcasting in World War II (1941-45)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Government Regulation and Intervention</b>.<b> </b>During World War II, the Japanese attempted to reengineer Filipino consciousness through a restructuring of the educational system, the teaching of the Japanese language, and even the reorientation of religious activities. The invading forces set aside the business aspect of broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese controlled broadcasting by rigging radio sets to suppress broadcast signals from the enemy, and severely punished those caught clandestinely listening to such signals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese had a propaganda corps, called the Sendenhan, which included broadcasters. It was later renamed Hodobu&mdash;the Department of Information&mdash;to avoid the negative connotation of the name Sendenhan. Beginning in 1942, KZRH and the dailies <b><i><strong>Tribu</strong>ne</i> </b>and <b><i>Taliba</i></b>, which the Hodobu also took over, became the principal propaganda outlets of the invaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1942, radio receiving sets had to be registered with the Customs Office. In 1943, the Japanese Military Administration ordered the &ldquo;reconditioning&rdquo; of all shortwave receivers, except those permitted by the Japanese army. &ldquo;Reconditioning&rdquo; meant that sets were converted or refit so that their shortwave tuners could receive only broadcasts made by the Japanese military or those originating from Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the end of the war in 1945, the US Congress passed legislation empowering Philippine Commonwealth president Sergio Osme&ntilde;a to grant temporary operating permits to private citizens and groups who wanted to go into the radio business to encourage the revival of commercial radio broadcasting. Two commercial stations almost immediately were granted permits: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4895\">Manila Broadcasting Company (MBC)</a>, which bought KZRH from H. E. Heacock Co, and the Philippine Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), which was the new name of the old Far East Broadcasting Corporation, owner of the prewar KZRM and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\">KZRF</a>. The following year, on the occasion of the declaration of Philippine independence from the United States and the inauguration of Manuel Roxas as president on 4 Jul 1946, MBC&rsquo;s KZRH and PBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4872\">KZPI</a> went on the air and resumed commercial broadcasting in the country. Also, the US Information Service (USIS) of the US State Department took over KZFM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Transnational Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>The technology of broadcasting through shortwave and the principle of relay broadcasting, where a transmitter picks up signals from a broadcast source and rebroadcasts the same signal to another area, continued the transnationalization of radio broadcasting from the Philippines during World War II. The signals of the resistance radios <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4989\"><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></a> </em>and<em> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4990\"><strong>Voice of Juan de la Cruz</strong></a></em> were picked up by KGEI in San Francisco, California, a private shortwave station taken over by the US Army during the war. When the Japanese revived KZRH and later changed its call letters to PIAM, which stood for Philippine Islands A Manila, its signals were beamed abroad, particularly across the Pacific Ocean toward the United States, via PIRN, which stood for Philippine Islands Radio Nippon. Filipinos were banned from receiving signals from foreign radio stations except those from Tokyo and Japanese-controlled Taiwan. The Japanese Military Administration implemented this by requiring all radio sets to be submitted to authorities to disable their shortwave receivers. However, many risked lives by restoring the shortwave function of their radio sets in order to listen to programs from KGEI, the BBC in England, and other stations supporting the Allied powers of the United States and Great Britain. KGEI aired programs in several Philippine languages aimed specifically at Filipino audiences in Japan-occupied Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Programming and Program Formats</b>. Radio under the Japanese deprived Filipinos of the vibrant music and the lively talk of American-style programming, and imposed on them what was perceived as overt propaganda through endless lectures, political speeches, and Japanese marches. The local radio&rsquo;s programming was strictly controlled to air only approved material. The programs were broadcast mostly in Tagalog but also in Nihongo, Spanish, English, Ilonggo, and Cebuano. Newscasts in English, Tagalog, and Spanish of 15 minutes each were aired three times a day. Eventually, the news was also regularly read in Nihongo. Documentaries on Japanese history and culture, and language lessons on Nihongo were frequently heard. Church services, lectures aimed at women and children, and literary readings in Japanese were allotted airtime, as well as Tagalog comedy skits. Filipino music, as well as Western classical music, was played on the air. Since Japan did not have recorded music yet, Japanese songs and music were performed live with the guidance of music sheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A Japanese pianist, Filipino pianist Jose V. Carreon, and Filipino musicians and singers provided the live music. Fidela Magpayo, better known to postwar radio fans as Tiya Dely, became the most popular radio singer during the period. She sang mostly Filipino songs, but she and Polish-Filipina Nellie Bialovlovsky, known as Ginger on the air, also sang Japanese songs repeatedly on the air. KZRH, later PIAM, broadcasters included Leon Ma. Guerrero III, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4944\">Norman Reyes</a>, Clodualdo del Mundo, Alfredo Saulo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3686\">Hernando Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5481\">I.

News programs gained prominence during the war not only on Japanese-controlled radio but on banned shortwave stations. There was hunger for credible news that was so critical for Filipinos, as well as for the foreigners in the country, to know about the progress of the war in the Philippines and around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Subversions and Resistance</b>.<b> </b>World War II was as much a contest of might as it was a battle of ideologies, and radio broadcasting was a critical combat zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the beginning of the Japanese occupation, the resistance radio Voice of Freedom valiantly rallied Filipinos to continue resisting the Japanese, until the moment of defeat. Filipinos in Cebu and nearby provinces monitored the war in Luzon by listening to the Voice of Freedom, whose signals were picked up and relayed by KZRC. The Voice of Freedom silenced, another went on the air, the Voice of Juan de la Cruz, whose broadcasters braved the doom that awaited them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around the world, the Allies and the Axis powers used radio for coded communication and espionage, and radio broadcasting for propaganda. In the Philippines, Filipinos listened to Japanese-controlled radio&mdash;the only broadcasting sanctioned during the period&mdash;but also monitored underground signals emanating from resistance groups broadcasting within and outside the country. No matter the intent of the Japanese in promoting Tagalog and Filipino music, the strategy may have aided the growth of Tagalog and other Filipino languages on radio after the war, as well as the increased airtime devoted to Filipino music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The only officially permitted radio signals came from PIAM, which the people listened to, as it paid to know the enemy propaganda, but at the same time they maligned. PIAM, to some, stood for &ldquo;<i>Putang Ina Ang Maniwala!</i>,&rdquo; which roughly translates to &ldquo;He who believes [the radio propaganda] is a son of a bitch!&rdquo; (Ampil 1986; Malay 1984).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many prewar broadcasters avoided recruitment by PIAM, among them Koko Trinidad and Lamberto Avellana, who acted as couriers for guerrillas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">KGEI was a critical source of news from the United States. Its programs were intended specifically for the Filipino audience. Particularly popular was the program of Carmen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a>, who was KGEI&rsquo;s answer to NHK&rsquo;s Tokyo Rose. Guerrilla groups in the rural areas as well as individuals in the cities who had access to shortwave radio clandestinely transcribed KGEI broadcasts for underground circulation. Those who were found out by the Japanese and their Filipino agents paid with their lives or suffered torture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American military forces under Gen Douglas MacArthur were the first to operate several radio facilities in the Philippines toward the end of World War II following the silence of the Japanese-controlled PIAM at the close of 1944. MacArthur integrated the remaining few into one station in Manila with the call letters KZFM, first managed by the Office of War Information of the US Department of National Defense, then turned over to the newly organized USIS under the US State Department. Later that year, several other American military broadcast stations began operating, among them WVLC, WVTM, and the US Armed Forces Radio Service, signaling to Filipinos that the Americans were back by airing familiar American music and other programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"third\" name=\"third\"></a>The Period of the Third Republic (1945-72)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Politics, Commerce, and Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>The years following World War II witnessed politics and economics bonding together again to highly influence the direction of Philippine broadcasting. Businessmen brothers Joaquin Miguel Elizalde and Manuel Elizalde were the first to operate a radio station in early 1946. They purchased Samuel Gaches&rsquo;s H. E. Heacock Co, which owned the KZRH of the American period, and called their new enterprise the Manila Broadcasting Company. Another station, KZPI (PI for Philippine Islands), also acquired a permit to go on test broadcast in early 1946. It was operated by the Philippine Broadcasting Corporation, the new name of the prewar Far East Broadcasting Corporation (FEBC), which used to run KZRM and KZRF. J. Amado Araneta, who owned FEBC before the war, took on new partners Leo Prieto, Jose Avelino, Jack Preysler, and Andres Soriano, and formed PBC. Also in 1946, during the second anniversary of MacArthur&rsquo;s landing on Leyte on 20 Oct, the USIS turned over KZFM to the new Philippine government&rsquo;s Department of Foreign Affairs, the secretary of which was Elpidio Quirino. In 1947, Roxas moved the station to the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS), which he created as a unit under the Office of the President. PBS then grew into a nationwide network of government broadcast stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon after putting KZRH on the air, MBC acquired a franchise for another station, KZMB. PBC, on the other hand, put up KZOK in addition to KZPI. Not long after the inaugural broadcast of KZOK, the Elizaldes acquired PBC, which had KZPI and KZOK in Manila, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4866\"><strong>KZBU</strong></a> in Cebu, and became the most powerful broadcast operators from the late 1940s until television came in 1953. Araneta bowed out of broadcasting. Isaac Beck revived KZIB but it folded up after just a few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many radio stations, owned by religious groups, educational institutions, and new industry players, mushroomed during the period. Cebu was again the site of the first radio stations outside Manila. In 1947, KZRC, operated by MBC affiliate Cebu Broadcasting Company (CBC), went on the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television in the country was born in 1953, just eight years into the new Republic. Americans, as well as Filipinos, invested in the rising broadcast industry. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4883\"><strong>James Lindenberg</strong></a>, an American entrepreneur who operated in Manila, established in 1946 the Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC), a company that manufactured radio transmitters and similar electronic devices. His franchise to operate a radio and television station was granted by Congress in 1950, but he focused on radio because of strict import controls that made it difficult to operate a television facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period saw a noticeable increase in the number of Filipinos staking their claim on the operation of radio and television. Former trial court judge Antonio Quirino established the first television station in the Philippines. He bought 70 percent of BEC from Lindenberg, renamed BEC as Alto Broadcasting Company (ABS) with call letters DZAQ, which was finally given a permit&nbsp;to import equipment to transmit television signals on Channel 3 in 1952. The television station went on the air in 1953, mainly as a major political machinery to support the presidential reelection bid of Antonio&rsquo;s brother, President Elpidio, who, however, lost in the Nov 1953 national elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The business elites, some of whom were also into print journalism, established the major television networks during the period. The Canoy brothers founded Radio Mindanao Network (RMN) in Cagayan de Oro City in 1952. American businessman Dick Baldwin started operating the Inter-island Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) TV Channel 13 in 1960. The Elizaldes expanded to television, putting up MBC-TV Channel 11 in 1962. Businessman Andres Soriano Sr, who also owned the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>, bought both IBC-TV 13 from Baldwin as well as the controlling interest in RMN in 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Eugenio Lopez Sr of Iloilo City, who owned the daily newspaper <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, obtained a franchise to operate the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1955, began the broadcast of its radio station CBN-DZXL in 1956, bought ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg in 1957, and merged their radio and television stations to establish <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> in 1961. Like the Quirinos, the Lopezes had very powerful political connections. Eugenio Sr&rsquo;s brother, Fernando, was a member of the Senate at the time they were establishing their broadcasting network and was vice president of the Philippines in 1965, under Ferdinand Marcos as president, both of whom were under the Nacionalista Party (NP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Roces family, which published the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b>, the leading newspaper of the country in the two decades prior to the martial law period, began their family&rsquo;s television enterprise under the Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1960, using the call letters DZMT and the Channel 5 slot. Joaquin &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Roces, the helmsman of the daily and the television station, would become a staunch critic of the Marcos administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">American war correspondent Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Stewart established DZBB Radio in 1950, DZXX in 1955, and DZBB-TV Channel 7 in 1961. The broadcast network changed its name to Republic Broadcasting System (RBS) in 1963, then to Greater Manila Area (GMA) Channel 7 during the martial law period. Stewart was seen as a supporter of reelectionist president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong></a> of the NP in the Nov 1961 elections. It may be noted that DZBB-TV obtained its franchise under the Garcia administration. When Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party defeated Garcia in the 1961 presidential elections, Malaca&ntilde;an took steps to have Stewart deported from the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Roberto S. Benedicto, who owned the <b><i>Philippine Daily Express</i></b> and had substantial investments in the sugar industry in Negros Occidental and in the Traders Commercial Bank, put station DZKB on the air under the Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS) in 1960 and KBS TV Channel 9 in 1969. Benedicto enjoyed the full trust and confidence of Ferdinand Marcos, a close friend in law school and college fraternity brother in the University of the Philippines (UP), who in 1965 was elected president of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Government Regulation and Intervention</b>.<b> </b>Major shifts unfolded after the war. The call letters of broadcast stations changed soon after the inauguration of the Third Philippine Republic in 1946. Having been declared independent, the Philippines was given call letters, replacing the American call letters &ldquo;KZ.&rdquo; The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in New Jersey, USA, took a punitive stance against &ldquo;KZ&rdquo; for Nazi Germany&rsquo;s misuse of radio during the war. The Union then distributed the call letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; to several newly independent countries, including the Philippines, removing from Germany the exclusive use of the call letter. Thus, KZFM became DZFM, KZRH became DZRH, and so on. Later the Philippine government assigned secondary letters based on location&mdash;DZ for stations based in Luzon, DY in the Visayas, and DX in Mindanao. DW was later given to FM stations in Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many prewar laws were restored, including Act 3846, or the Radio Control Act of 1931, which regulated radio stations and radio communications in the Philippines. The law was also applied to television stations. The law required radio stations to obtain a legislative franchise as a prerequisite to operation, thus effectively shifting the power to grant broadcast franchises from the Office of the President back to the legislature. The law permitted ownership of media businesses not only by Filipinos but also Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Programming and Program Formats</b>.<b> </b>Postwar broadcasting in the Philippines bore a strong imprint of American colonial broadcasting. American music and talk, as well as the new format of soap opera, fueled by advertising, filled the air. News and news commentary increased in significance as Filipinos continued to hunger for credible news that was in short supply during the war. English returned as the dominant language of broadcasting, while Tagalog maintained a clear and growing presence. Other Filipino languages also flourished on the air as new radio stations began to operate outside Manila, mindful of the audience expecting broadcasters to speak their tongue. This trend extended to music played on radio and later on television as the Philippine recording industry was born and began to press records of local talent singing traditional Filipino songs and more recent local compositions as well as covers of foreign songs. The first successful commercial FM station in the country, DZFX of the Makati Broadcasting Network, broadcast mood music, film soundtracks, and period pieces with high fidelity stereophonic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Audiences multiplied as the number of radio stations grew phenomenally, including noncommercial stations operated by government and religious organizations. The popularity of radio was bolstered by the introduction and eventual increase in the production and distribution of transistor radios, which became a regular household item all over the country, in both urban and rural areas. By the 1950s, the era called &ldquo;golden years of radio&rdquo; was underway, which lasted until the unspeakable era of martial law began in 1972. With radio and television becoming widely accepted by audiences, the period saw the rise of radio and television personalities as national celebrities, gaining the stature of public figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Program formats became varied. The attractiveness of musical programs to Filipino audiences bred the amateur singing contest format, which includes <b><i>Purico Troubadours</i></b>, <b><i>Purico </i></b><b><i>Show</i></b>, <b><i>Purico Amateur Hour</i></b>, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage). A program type that emerged after the war was the personality platter show in which an announcer, later called disc jockey or the DJ, played selected music records and engaged the listeners in a light chat. The Philippine Broadcasting System began airing educational programs in the 1950s, mostly about agriculture, but it was in the 1960s that the program type gained popularity and became part of regular programming of several AM stations. Radio dramas, called soaps or soap operas, came in several formats: the melodrama, the situational comedy or sitcom, the sitcom cum satire, horror or fantasy and science fiction narratives, and the occasional detective drama. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (Light of the Home), written by Liwayway Arceo, was the first postwar soap, which began airing on DZRH in 1949. DZRH later produced the highly popular drama series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate) by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>. Among the most remarkable drama anthologies on television were ABC Channel 5&rsquo;s <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), <b><i><strong>Salam</strong>isim</i></b> (Reflections), and <b><i>Santa Zita and Mary Rose</i></b>. The first horror program on television was <b><i>Hiwaga sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>Bahay na Bato</strong></a></i></b> (Mystery in the House of Stone). The action-detective format was best exemplified by <b><i>Kwatro Bidas</i></b> (Four Heroes). The sitcom was best represented by <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>. A new format of the counseling genre, in English, went on the air in 1957; this was <b><i>Father Bob and His Telephone</i></b> hosted by Bob Garon. The variety show, a m&eacute;lange of musical performances, comic skits, and light banter among hosts and guests, was a popular genre on radio and later on television. Popular examples of the variety program were the daily noontime program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> on DZXL-TV Channel 9 and the weekly variety show <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b> (Actor&rsquo;s Life) on Channel 3. Derivatives of the variety show genre, programs with music and dance, were popular, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1437\"><strong>An Evening with Pilita</strong></a></i></b> on Channel 3. A pioneer of the daily morning talk show was the news-magazine program <b><i>The Morning Show</i></b>. The most popular of the game shows in the 1960s was <b><i>Kuarta o Kahon</i></b> (Cash or Box) on ABS-CBN. There were also children&rsquo;s educational and entertainment programs, such as <b><i><strong>Eskuwelahan</strong>g Munti</i></b><i> </i>(Little Schoolhouse) on RBS Channel 7. News and news commentary increased in significance, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4991\"><strong>Rafael Yabut</strong></a> as one of the most well-remembered radio commentators and ABS-CBN&rsquo;s DZAQ and <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> (Patrol Radio) as one of the highly rated news programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News commentators on television were likewise critical of the administration, including Luis Beltran on Channel 11 and Jose Ma. Velez on Channel 5. Television stations also showed imported canned programs, some of which were animated. Local and foreign movies were also shown on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period witnessed the initial recognition of broadcasting as an art through the establishment of the first awards for meritorious works, given from 1965 to 1972 by the Citizens Awards for Television or CAT of the Citizens&rsquo; Council for Mass Media, formerly called the Citizens&rsquo; Council for Better Motion Pictures Television Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the crucial roles played by broadcasting during the period was its use in politics. Until the simultaneous declaration of Philippine independence from the United States and the inauguration of Pres Manuel Roxas in 1946, radio coverage of political events focused only on similar ceremonial political occasions and on war reporting in connection with World War II. Radio became a powerful tool by the government in its campaign against the communist Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB), a peasant organization established in 1950. The HMB, with a strong foothold in Central Luzon, sprang from the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon or Hukbalahap movement during the Japanese occupation. In 1953, the use of broadcasting for partisan politics began when radio, as well as the newly inaugurated DZAQ Channel 3, was mobilized for the election campaign for the presidency. This set a pattern for subsequent political contests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<b>Criticality and Protest</b>.<b> </b>While program content in general was tacitly supportive of the status quo, broadcasting, along with newspapers and magazines, served as media of critical social and political commentary through news and public affairs programs and even entertainment programs like dramas and sitcoms. For example, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), which first aired in 1938 before the war and went on until the 1960s, interrupted only by the Japanese occupation, combined satire with comedy-drama and spoofed Filipino manners, politics, customs, and government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The press freedom of the period, sometimes criticized as licentious, was practiced more openly in news and news commentary, which helped heighten the audience&rsquo;s sense of vigilance and interest in local as well as global politics and economics. Broadcast media, which chronicled, analyzed, and critiqued political events in the country, intensely played its role as the so-called watchdog of those who ran the government and others in power. This was not to last, however, with the imposition of martial law in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"fourth\" name=\"fourth\"></a>The Period of the Fourth Republic (1972-86)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Government Regulation and Intervention</b>.<b> </b>A major step in the execution of martial law was the closure of the media companies, with the exception of the <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i> </b>and the KBS (later RPN) broadcast facilities, that was specified in Letter of Instruction 1, which directed the secretaries of the Department of National Defense and the Department of Public Information to take over and control all media in the country. The Philippine Constabulary carried out their directives. Also in 1972, Pres Marcos issued Presidential Decree (PD) 36, which canceled all legislative franchises issued by Congress to radio and television stations prior to the proclamation of martial law, with the Mass Media Council (MMC) serving as a clearing house. Marcos also made it unconstitutional for foreigners to own and operate the media, including broadcast networks, effectively Filipinizing ownership of Philippine media for the first time. In Jan 1973, Marcos announced that the 1973 Constitution was approved by the people. To erase the impression that the military was in charge of the regulation of the media under martial law, the president issued PD 191, which replaced the MMC with the Mass Media Advisory Council (MMAC), this time composed of more civilian members. MMAC, however, was later abolished and its powers were transferred to two distinct bodies&mdash;namely, the Philippine Council for Print Media (PCPM) and the Broadcast Media Council (BMC). The technical aspects of broadcast media operations, such as transmitter strength and frequency assignments, were regulated by the Radio Control Office, replaced in 1974 by the Telecommunications Control Bureau. Marcos issued Executive Order (EO) 546 in 1979, vesting in the National Telecommunications Commission regulatory powers regarding technical matters over the broadcast media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important development was the creation in 1973 of an association of broadcast media owners, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP), which served as a self-regulatory body of the industry. Broadcast news, accountable to Marcos, was monitored and censored by the Office of Civil Affairs. As expected, they were not allowed to criticize the Marcos administration. All broadcast programs were monitored by the government&rsquo;s Board of Censors, which did not allow programs or parts of programs that were considered politically or morally unfit for broadcast. The Lumauig Bill threatened to limit the free expression of artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lifting of martial law by the president in 1981 carried with it the abolition of the PCPM and the BMC, which, however, did not automatically mean full freedom for the broadcast media. Any broadcaster who created trouble could be charged with subversion and detained indefinitely. Marcos already had his cronies running the media, and other similar repressive laws remained in place, such as the Arrest, Search and Seizure Order, the National Security Act, and the Public Order Act, all of which deal with people who undermined the objectives of Marcos&rsquo;s New Society, specifically those deemed by the government as obscene, rebellious, and seditious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main form of regulation in the broadcast media (and the film industry) was by censorship, which was mainly a function of the Board of Censors for Motion Pictures, created through Republic Act 3060 in 1961, later renamed Board of Review for Motion Pictures, Television and Live Entertainment through EO 868 in 1983, then finally to Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television (BRMPT) through EO 876, also in 1983. The banning for public exhibition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a> film <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong>: Kapit sa Patalim </i></b>(My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge) by the BRMPT in 1984 sent the message to media practitioners, especially those in the broadcasting industry, that the Marcos dictatorship, in spite of the growing protest movement following the assassination of oppositionist Benigno Aquino Jr in 1983, still had full control of what it can allow to be shown to the public. From censorship, the move proceeded to classification, which applied to all broadcast materials. The BRMPT was abolished with the creation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\"><strong>Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong></a>, created through Presidential Decree 1986 in 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Transnational Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>During the martial law period, the broadcast media industry, as part of the bigger telecommunications industry, functioned as a conduit of transnational advertising and capital operating under Marcos&rsquo;s crony capitalism. The telecommunications industry became one of the most concentrated areas of business ownership and one of the primary generators of foreign investments in the country. Crony companies had to tie up with foreign conglomerates because of the capital-intensive building of mass media and telecommunications infrastructures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Major players in the telecommunications industry had close ties with Marcos. Media mogul Roberto S. Benedicto expanded the nationwide reach of his television network, RPN, through domestic satellite communications or DOMSAT, which was supplied mainly by Marubeni, a Japanese television manufacturer. RPN eventually attracted transnational corporations for its advertisements. Benedicto was also one of the principal partners of Eastern Telecommunications Philippines (ETPI), which was granted by the Marcos government the exclusive rights to the communications market of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ETPI&rsquo;s top user was the US military. Ramon Cojuangco, the pro-Marcos wing of the landed Cojuangco family, owned the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), which had million-dollar contracts with General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) Corporation of the United States and Siemens&#39; Corporation of the Federal Republic of Germany for electronic switching equipment. PLDT&rsquo;s principal international toll users were hotels and foreign oil companies. Both Benedicto and Cojuangco, together with Marcos defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile, were principal partners in the Philippine Communications Satellite (Philcomsat), which had the US military as its largest and single-end user. Another major player was Philippine Communications Corporation (Philcom) of Radio Corporation of America (RCA), nominally headed by former ambassador to the United States Ernesto V. Lagdameo, with Enrile and energy minister Geronimo Z. Velasco among its major stockholders. Among Philcom&rsquo;s largest wideband users were the US military, Pan Am, and IBM, while its narrowband users were US and Japanese transnational corporations. The family of Zobel de Ayala was a major business partner in the International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) Corporation of Globe-Mackay Radio Corporation. ITT operated several telephone and communications systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The telecommunications industry linked the so-called offshore operations that foreign investments established in the Philippines into the centers of these operations in industrialized countries. The industry, with interlocking local and global interests, made it possible for these investments to market their products and services under the full protection and support of the Marcos government. The expansion of international capital informed the transnationalization of the broadcast media, which, in turn, fed into the strategic development goals of the Marcos government that favored the concentration of capital among friendly members of the elite, which would later be termed as crony capitalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television specials hosted by the Philippine government that had simultaneous international broadcasts were the <b><i>23rd Miss Universe Pageant</i></b> in 1974 and <b><i>Thrilla in Manila</i></b>, the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1975, both of which were broadcast live by RPN 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Programming and Program Formats</b>.<b> </b>Radio AM programming during the period was predominantly entertainment, consisting of soaps, personality programs, and music, which was mainly foreign. The AM band catered primarily to audiences of the lower socioeconomic class. Top AM music stations during the period were DWBL, DWKW, and DZRJ-AM in Metro Manila, and DYRC, DYHP, DYGB, DYFM, DYBU, and DYLA in the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FM radio stations with a music orientation began to flourish during the martial law period. Among different sectors of the broadcast industry, FM radio was the least affected by the political situation of the country mainly because it concentrated on music programming that aired politically safe music pieces. Various program formats began to emerge: adult contemporary; easy listening, middle-of-the-road, pop music programming; contemporary hit radio or the Top 40 format; and album-oriented programming. During the end of the martial law period, niche programming became the prevailing pattern, with FM radio stations targeting specific audiences. With DWRT 99.5 trailblazing the trend, a number of other format-oriented radio stations soon followed suit and eventually made a mark in Philippine FM radio history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The KBP and the Broadcast Media Council issued a regulation requiring all radio stations to play on the air what were called original Pilipino music (OPM), which referred to a song or piece composed by a Filipino, or any song or piece performed by a Filipino, or a song or piece composed by a Filipino but performed by a foreigner. Before martial law, popular Filipino music referred primarily to folk songs and the kundiman. OPM during martial law took on a more distinctively younger sound, incorporating elements of Filipino culture with pop, jazz, folk, and rock music. This paved the way for the birth of &ldquo;The Manila Sound.&rdquo; The move challenged the dominance of foreign music and talents. Beginning with one song per program hour in 1975, the requirement was brought up to four in 1982. From the mid-1970s until the middle of the 1980s, local composers, singers, and musicians enjoyed unprecedented exposure on radio and achieved a measure of maturity in their craft. As a result of that broadcasting rule, the local recording industry enjoyed tremendous growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Development communication was stressed during the martial law years. Educational programs were produced to push the concept of development communication, such as <b><i>Ating Alamin</i></b> (Let Us Find Out) and <b><i>Tele-Aralan ng Kakayahan</i></b> (Knowledge Educational TV). The concept of development communication extended to the government&rsquo;s effort to usher in what it termed as renaissance programming in Philippine broadcasting, which meant bringing &ldquo;culture&rdquo; closer to the people by airing educational and cultural programs during prime time. The idea of renaissance television, unfortunately, was not commercially viable and it was soon forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On news programming, BBC went on the air in 1973 and introduced <b><i>BBC Balita </i></b>(BBC News), the first primetime news program in Filipino after the declaration of martial law; it would later be given a new title, <b><i>Balita Ngayon </i></b>(News Today), which would become the only news program in Filipino until the launch of <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> on ABS-CBN in 1987 following the ouster of Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Public affairs news programs followed two tracks. Government-produced talk shows, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1493\"><strong>Pulong-Pulong sa Kaunlaran</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Public Forum for Development) and <b><i>Face the Nation</i></b>, spoke positively about the government and its officials. Critically mild public affairs talk programs came out, such as Jullie Yap Daza&rsquo;s <b><i>Tell the People</i></b> on RPN 9 and Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Viewpoint</i> </b>on GMA 7. Charity shows were the trend in many public service programs, such as <b><i>Damayan</i></b> (Helping One Another) and <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko </i></b>(I Love My Fellowman). On radio, DZRH launched the after-midnight program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tion Tulong </i></b>(Operation Assistance). These shows assisted those in need of all kinds of help, mainly medical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Variety programs were plentiful during the martial law period, which were a mix of musical numbers and interviews with personalities; some had segments on games or contests usually promoted by commercial sponsors. On television, <b><i>Student Canteen </i></b>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) dominated the noontime programming, while <b><i>Ariel con Tina</i></b> (Ariel with Tina) was a favorite in the early evening time slot. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a> thrilled her fans with the weekly musical show <b><i>Superstar</i></b>, Joe Quirino hosted the musical variety-talk show <b><i>Seeing Stars with JQ</i></b>, and star builder <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4912\"><strong>German Moreno</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> started his series of entertainment programs, like <b><i>Germside</i></b>, later retitled <b><i>Germspesyal</i></b>,<b> </b>then <b><i>GMA Supershow</i></b>. Prominent, but often maligned, television entertainment programs were Inday Badiday&rsquo;s <b><i>Nothing but the Truth</i></b>, <b><i>Would You Believe?</i></b>, and <b><i>See-True</i></b>. Late-night talk magazine programs include <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>, <b><i>Ms. Ellaneous</i></b>, <b><i>Tell the People</i></b>, and <b><i>Something with Pilita</i></b>. Excellent magazine programs were the morning show <b><i>Good Morning, Manila</i></b>, which featured personalities, the weather, sports, and other cultural facts, but less on news, and <b><i>Metro Magazine</i></b>, a combination of talk, travelogue, and mini-documentaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Comedy shows that became extremely popular during the period were the sitcoms<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a>, and <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i> </b>(School Bumps)<b> </b>of the triumvirate of Tito, Vic, and Joey. The show that attracted the higher end of TV audiences was the social commentary-cum-gag show <b><i>Champoy</i></b> of <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4849\"><strong>Subas Herrero</strong></a>, Gary Lising, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4969\"><strong>Tessie Tomas</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4210\"><strong>Mitch Valdes</strong></a>. Socially relevant sitcoms <b><i>Baltic &amp; Co.</i></b>, <b><i>Juan Tamad </i></b>(Lazy Juan), and <b><i>Prinsipe Abante</i></b> (Prince Abante) went on the air, but did not enjoy the popularity of most family sitcoms. A relevant comedy that became highly popular was &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Buding,&rdquo; a stand-up gag segment of the live weekly music variety program <b><i>Penthouse Live</i></b>. An interesting socially satirical sitcom produced during the waning years of the Marcos administration until the early years of the post-EDSA period was <b><i>U.F.O.: Urbana, Felisa, and Others</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine drama programs on television during the martial law period were weekly one-hour melodrama anthologies, followed later on by daily serials. Some weekly television drama anthologies that followed the social realist tradition started by the pre-martial law <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> were those produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1468\"><strong>Maskara</strong></a> </i></b>(Mask), <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/649\"><strong>Rosas</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Rose), and <b><i>Ilaw ng Tahanan </i></b>(Light of the Home). Siguion-Reyna also produced <b><i>Malayo Pa ang Umaga</i></b> (The Morn Is Yet So Far) in 1979, aired weekly on RPN 9. The drama could be considered the first miniseries on Philippine television, later to be billed telenovela in the 2000s. Other noteworthy drama anthologies include <b><i>Lino Brocka Presents</i></b>, <b><i>Panata </i></b>(Oath), <b><i>Tipanan </i></b>(Rendezvous), <b><i>Alindog </i></b>(Allure), <b><i>Katha </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a>), <b><i>Hiyas </i></b>(Gem), <b><i>Mga Kuwento ng Pag-ibig </i></b>(Stories of Love), <b><i>Tanghalan </i></b>(Stage), and <b><i>Dahong Ginto </i></b>(Golden Leaf). The daily serialized drama on television was introduced in 1977 via <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b>, reincarnated from the daily radio soap of the same title created by writer Lina Flor that aired on DZRH during the postwar period. The period also witnessed the stiff competition of two daily late afternoon soaps that each featured children: <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> on RPN 9 and <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b> on GMA 7. Weekly drama anthologies during the period relied less on good narrative than on the audience-drawing power of stars. <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b> (The Colorful World of Nora) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4942\"><strong>Coney Reyes</strong></a>-Mumar <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> Studio</i></b> showed gems in some of their episodes. Many weekly television drama programs featured real-life stories of viewers who sent in their narratives to popular counseling programs, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>.

Noteworthy directors of musical variety programs were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4986\"><strong>Mitos Villareal</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4993\"><strong>Fritz Ynfante</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Al Quinn</strong></a></strong>. Local children&rsquo;s shows were more entertainment in orientation, and the themes revolved around discipline, cooperation, and the nationalism of the New Society. Examples were <b><i>Kaluskos Musmos </i></b>(Kiddie Noise), <b><i>Kulit Bulilit </i></b>(Curious Children), and <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b>. A pioneer of culinary shows was <b><i>Cooking It Up with Nora</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Canned programs, usually dramas, comedies, action, religious, musicals, children&rsquo;s educational, and animation came from the United States and the United Kingdom; dramas, action, and musicals from China; and, later, animation from Japan. All these programs were well-received by Filipino audiences. Notable were the educational program <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b> and the animated program <b><i>Voltes V</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Subversions, Protest, and the Revival of Democracy</b>.<b> </b>When Marcos imposed martial law in 1972, the first institution he emasculated was the media, closing down all broadcast and print facilities except those of his allies, and allowing their reopening only under strict control and monitoring. This was the state of the media until resistance and protest began to build up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the height of martial law in the 1970s, mainstream media, controlled by those with economic and political power, was either lying about the conditions of the country or reluctant to report events that run counter to the stance of government. During the waning years of the Marcos dictatorship beginning in the early 1980s, mainstream commercial and government media continued to lie or limit the expanse of truth. During this period, the technology of orality and the alternatives proffered by progressive groups became more reliable than the technology of &ldquo;hard&rdquo; electronic equipment for people in areas with limited or no access to mainstream media. These various forms of &ldquo;narrowcasting&rdquo; by the underprivileged and the politically marginalized served as a parallel form of broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marginalized and socially underprivileged groups, such as peasants, indigenous peoples, and workers, relied on traditional folk media to &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; news and analyses about their locality. Folk communication and literary forms were revitalized, infused with liberative messages. Progressive artists produced video and film documentaries that exposed human rights violations, poverty, and the corruption of the Marcos regime and the role of the United States in the political affairs of the country. Foremost among these artists were those who formed in 1982 the alternative video group Asia Visions. Protest theater on the stage and on the streets became the more reliable outlet than broadcast media for the discussion of contemporary social issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Marcos oppositionist leader Ninoy Aquino was gunned down at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport in 1983, local commercial media, especially the broadcast networks, were not considered the site of reliable news. The search for the truth was played out elsewhere, this time mainly on Betamax units at home and in offices. Betamax tapes recorded mainly by people abroad enabled the Filipinos to view Aquino&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While only Radio Veritas gave complete coverage of Aquino&rsquo;s fateful arrival, other networks found the courage to present some news and commentary about the murdered man on whom so many Filipinos had pinned their hopes. Though GMA 7 dared only show eight seconds of Aquino&rsquo;s 10-hour funeral rites, with millions paying tribute, on its primetime news, the network&rsquo;s <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b> devoted 15 minutes to a special honoring Aquino and showed more scenes from his funeral. On the same channel, Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno&rsquo;s talk program <b><i>Viewpoint</i></b> carried an interview with newly widowed Corazon Aquino. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a> produced and hosted a GMA exclusive on the Marcos hidden wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Inspired by Veritas, other radio stations in both Manila and the provinces grew more daring in expressing opposition to the regime. Before long, Philippine broadcasting&rsquo;s huge potential to tilt the balance of political power saw its transformation into an actual movement for social change in the years leading to the EDSA Revolt in 1986. This was instigated by widespread belief of cheating in the 1986 elections, in which Marcos and his vice-presidential running mate were announced to have won. The people openly protested, and Juan Ponce Enrile and Gen Fidel Ramos of the military turned against Marcos. People responded to the plea of Jaime Cardinal Sin on Radio Veritas to show support for these men by gathering on EDSA. Broadcast, movie, and theater personalities, one of whom was <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>June Keithley</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>, rallied the people to join the military mutineers through Radio Veritas and then on DZRJ, dubbed Radyo Bandido, when the former&rsquo;s facilities were destroyed by the military. The EDSA Revolt, while beginning as a shooting battle between military coup plotters and state defenders, was principally a battle over airwaves, ultimately won by achieving freedom to broadcast to the people. The Marcos regime was brought to an end by the EDSA Revolt mobilized by radio messages. And broadcast media regained its freedom along with the Filipino people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"fifth\" name=\"fifth\"></a>The Period of the Fifth Republic (1986 Onward)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Politics, Commerce, and Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>Three important developments contributed to the growth of Philippine broadcasting beginning in the 1990s. These were the move toward decentralization, resulting in the growth of provincial media, the rapid revolution in communication technology, and the liberalization and deregulation of the telecommunications sector. These developments coincided with the return and expansion of the democratic space after the EDSA Revolt, and the promotion and protection of the free enterprise system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the first acts of Corazon Aquino as president of what was called a &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; government was to sequester broadcast networks RPN 9, IBC 13, and BBC 2, media outlets believed to have been illegally acquired by Marcos cronies and relatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of the capital-intensive nature of media and the low return on investment of newspapers and broadcast networks, media ownership remained in the hands of individuals and families engaged in diverse business interests. The Elizaldes continued the broadcast of their radio network, the Manila Broadcasting Company. The Lopezes recovered and relaunched ABS-CBN in 1986. RBS was later changed to Greater Manila Area (GMA) Radio Television Arts by its triumvirate owners Gilberto M. Duavit Sr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4845\"><strong>Felipe L. Gozon</strong></a>, and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Menardo R. Jimenez</strong></a></strong></strong>. Both ABS-CBN and GMA would lord over the ratings game, which defined the character of commercial broadcasting of the post-EDSA period. Telecommunications mogul Manuel &ldquo;MVP&rdquo; Pangilinan bought TV5 of the Associated Broadcasting Company. The early years of the post-EDSA period saw the rise of the big conglomerates, with broadcast networks, some of which were already into energy production and public utilities, expanding to other ventures, such as movie production, music recording, publications, cable television, and global telecommunications. Later, those involved in other interests, such as mining, would also get involved in broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Government Regulation and Intervention</b>.<b> </b>The adoption of the 1987 Philippine Constitution was the most significant development during the Aquino administration. It institutionalized the Filipinization of mass media, mainly in terms of media ownership, retaining the provision on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> percent ownership of mass media by Filipinos, one of the legacies of Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Executive Order 205, issued in 1987, governs the regulation of cable antenna television or CATV and requires a network to obtain a certificate of authority to operate for not more than 15 years, which can be renewed for a similar period. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)</strong></a> continued to regulate the broadcast industry, but since membership was no longer compulsory, its regulation applied only to its members. Individual networks and stations have started to internally regulate themselves, but only ABS-CBN and GMA and the online platform Rappler have full-time ombudspersons in charge of monitoring and regulating their programs, journalists, and staff. Two important state agencies continued to regulate broadcast media content: the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), which screens and classifies TV programs, commercials, and publicity materials according to audiences; and the Presidential Appeals Board, which addresses issues raised by parties pertaining to decisions made by the MTRCB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Remnants of Marcos&rsquo;s censorship continued to haunt the regulation of the broadcast media. The MTRCB under Manoling Morato banned the 55-minute TV documentary <b><i>Dear Sam &hellip; Sumasaiyo, Juan</i></b> (Dear Sam &hellip; Yours, Juan), 1989, for its resolute anti-US bases position. The prohibition raised multisectoral protests. The issue became the subject of a Senate investigation, which ruled in favor of airing the TV special. It also gave a two-week suspension to television documentary <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1447\"><strong>i-Witness</strong></a></i></b> in 2006 after it showed an episode titled &ldquo;Lukayo: Hindi Ito Bastos&rdquo; (Lukayo: This Is Not Vulgar), on <i>lukayo</i>, a wedding practice in a town in Laguna wherein carvings of phalluses are used by old ladies in performing a dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Transnational Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>The post-EDSA period saw a different turn in the transnationalization of Philippine broadcasting. With the diaspora becoming a significant phenomenon for Filipinos, local media networks responded to the transnational presence and diasporic experiences of Filipino audiences in various parts of the globe. ABS-CBN&rsquo;s The Filipino Channel, formed in 1994, was the Lopez company&rsquo;s response to the ever-growing demand of overseas Filipinos for news on the Philippines and Filipino television and film productions. GMA Pinoy TV broadcasts GMA shows to North America, East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Its most lucrative market is Southeast Asia where Filipino TV drama productions are avidly followed. TV5 Network Inc has formed Kapatid TV5 to distribute Kapatid TV and Aksyon TV shows to its clients in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Guam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino TV productions became popular with foreign audiences. When broadcast in other countries, shows were given subtitles and not dubbed, unlike Latin and Asian telenovelas that were brought into the Philippines. The soap opera <b><i>Pangako Sa &rsquo;Yo</i></b> (<b><i>The Promise</i></b>) was exported to Southeast Asia and East Africa, where it was a hit. The longest-running daily noontime show <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> has been franchised by a leading television network in Indonesia, to which it exports all its contents and segments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Programming and Program Formats</b>.<b> </b>AM radio stations after the 1986 EDSA Revolt continued to be providers mainly of news and information. Most AM stations either strengthened their news programming or completely shifted from entertainment to news and public affairs. These stations created their respective news departments. They enhanced their newscasts with more voice clips, spot reports, and live or phone-patched interviews. The format, however, remained mainly news and talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FM radio continued to be oriented toward music and entertainment. The Top 40 format, also known as contemporary hit radio, which was a major trend in the 1970s, began to lose its appeal to radio audiences during the post-EDSA period, mainly due to the innovations in programming introduced by many stations that preferred niche programming, a type of programming that targets specific audience groups. English remained the main language used in most FM radio stations, but there was a rise in the number of bilingual FM stations, appealing to a broader market. By the mid-1990s, talk-oriented programs slowly crept into the FM programming scene, caused primarily by the need to get more listeners, particularly the so-called <i>masa</i> (mass) group composed of the C, D, and E economic classes, which comprise the bulk of the radio-listening public. The A and B markets began shifting to more high-end electronic equipment, downloading music onto their new mobile devices without the need for an FM radio station. A milestone in the history of Philippine FM radio was the entry of Media Quest Holdings Inc, led by telecommunications mogul Manuel &ldquo;MVP&rdquo; Pangilinan, into FM radio in 2010 via 92.3 News Radio, aka Radyo Singko (Radio Five), a news and talk-oriented radio component of TV5 of the Associated Broadcasting Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The phenomenal program that significantly altered local television programming was <b><i>Marimar</i></b> which aired in 1996 on RPN 9. The success of <b><i>Marimar</i></b> provided the impetus for broadcast networks to produce daily drama serials in the early evening primetime programming, the first of which were the back-to-back tandem of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s 30-minute drama series <b><i>Mula sa Puso </i></b>(From the Heart) and <b><i>Esperanza</i></b>, both from 1997 to 1999. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1466\"><strong>Mara Clara</strong></a></i></b>, ABS-CBN&rsquo;s popular daily series in the afternoon slot, was also moved to the early evening programming. By the late 1990s, the daily drama serials, either locally produced or imported, started to flood the airwaves, with Latin American telenovelas dominating the evening programming. Telenovelas are limited-run drama serials. Later <b>chinovelas </b>(Chinese telenovelas) from Taiwan, such as <b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b>, and <b>koreanovelas</b> from Korea, such as <b><i>Full House</i></b> and <b><i>Jewel in the Palace</i></b>, flooded the evening primetime programming in the 2000s. All these new imported drama serials, together with Japanese anime programs, were dubbed in Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Entertainment talk and variety programs took the late morning and early afternoon time slots. Documentaries and public affairs programs were relegated to the late evening block, some of which were canceled, moved to weekend programming, or transferred to free UHF channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News programs were especially valued after the 1986 EDSA Revolt as it was believed that people could expect the shows to give them the truth now, unlike in martial law. ABS-CBN was foremost in presenting news in Filipino, reviving their <b><i>Balita Ngayon</i></b>, which was to become <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>. News and public affairs programs, including entertainment news, on VHF adopted a combination of information and entertainment in their format, but were, and continue to be, tabloid in character filled with stories of crime, violence, and mundane celebrity trivia that bordered on sensationalism, all in the rush for scoops. In spite of the trend toward sensationalism, a significant development in news reporting beginning in the late 1990s and the 2000 onward was the war coverage of leading broadcast media companies. It has since become imperative for Philippine broadcast media to achieve coverage of several events happening outside the country, present the geopolitical implications of worldwide developments, and analyze the impact of such events on Filipinos scattered all over the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A significant development during the post-EDSA period was the entry of civil society groups into the broadcast scene, first on radio, then on TV. Commercial networks relied on these blocktimers to fill in the airtime with relevant programs, such as the documentaries <b><i>Dear Sam &hellip; Sumasaiyo, Juan</i></b> (Dear Sam &hellip; Yours, Juan) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1412\"><strong>Batas Militar</strong></a> </i></b>(Martial Law); the drama anthologies <b><i>Direksiyon: Lino Brocka</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> ng PETA </i></b>(An Offering of PETA), <b><i>PETA-bisyon </i></b>(PETA Vision), and <b><i>Dear Teacher</i></b>; the political drama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1470\"><strong>Melinda</strong></a></i></b>; and the talk show <b><i>Woman Watch</i></b>. The experiment with the democratic space opened up for civil society groups by the commercial broadcasting industry was only transitory, however. When the commercial networks had secured and consolidated their resources, alternative programs, often those that criticized government policies and private interests impinging on politics, were either pushed to late-night programming or went off the air involuntarily. These programs were replaced by entertainment shows, which were given priority again by the networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some blocktimers came from other sectors aligned with media, such as Broadcast Marketing of Jun Sison, movie outfits <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a> by Lily Monteverde, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\"><strong>Viva Films</strong></a> by Vic del Rosario, and Loca-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\"><strong>Lobo</strong></a> Productions of Inday Badiday. Television and Production Exponents (TAPE) continued its success in practically all the programs it produced as a blocktimer, especially <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4879\"><strong>Cheche Lazaro</strong></a>&rsquo;s Probe Productions produced intelligent TV programs covering different types of formats: the investigative news magazine <b><i>The Probe Team</i></b>, the children&rsquo;s program <b><i>5 &amp; Up</i></b>, the agricultural-entrepreneurial magazine show <b><i>AgriLink</i></b>, and the sports and leisure program <b><i>Game Plan</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Eat Bulaga! </i></b>continued to dominate noontime programming in spite of serious threats posed by rival programs <b><i>Wowowee</i></b> and <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>. Daily and weekend variety shows were focused on celebrities, mainly young and upcoming stars, especially <b><i>Ang TV</i></b> (The TV), <b><i>That&rsquo;s Entertainment</i></b>, and <b><i>Walang Tulugan with the Master Showman </i></b>(Awake All Night with the Master Showman).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among public affairs talk programs, the game changer was <b><i>Truth Forum</i></b>, hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4800\"><strong>Randy David</strong></a>, the first talk show that used Filipino as a language of serious discussion about current issues of the country. Game changers also include Cheche Lazaro&rsquo;s <b><i>The Probe Team</i></b>, which pioneered investigative broadcast journalism in the country, and the news investigative program <b><i>Magandang Gabi, Bayan </i></b>(Good Evening, Nation), which functioned as the critical fourth estate, but which tended to focus more on Noli de Castro&rsquo;s image as a mediator between the masses and those in power than the ability of the program&rsquo;s <i>masa </i>audience to rely on their own agency to challenge government ineptness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Documentaries on radio also became a common trend, particularly produced by civil society groups and educational institutions. Documentaries, however, saw their full potential on television, the most politically significant of which were those produced by IBC 13 during the early years of the Corazon Aquino administration, such as <b><i>Ramut: The Roots of Revolution in the Cordillera </i></b>and <b><i>Tiempo Muerto: Crisis and Poverty in Negros </i></b>(Down Time: Crisis and Poverty in Negros). Important public affairs documentary programs of the period were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1428\"><strong>The Correspondents</strong></a></i></b> and<b> <i>The Inside Story</i></b> on ABS-CBN; <b><i>i-Witness</i></b> and <b><i>Reporter&rsquo;s Notebook</i></b> on GMA; and<b><i> Investigative Documentaries</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1497\"><strong>Reel Time</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Front Row</i></b> on GMA News TV. Significant magazine documentaries include <b><i>Apple Pie, Patis, P&acirc;t&eacute;, Atbp. </i></b>(Apple Pie, Fish Sauce, P&acirc;t&eacute;, Etc.),<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1512\"><strong>Tatak Pilipino</strong></a> </i></b>(Filipino Trademark), and<i> <b>Pep Talk</b></i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Comedy programs that took on a more critical position were the weekly sitcom <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1401\"><strong>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</strong></a> </i></b>(Watch for the Next Chapter), the gag show <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>, and the spoof <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>. Significant art magazine programs include <b><i>For Art&rsquo;s Sake</i></b>, <b><i>By Design</i></b>, <b><i>Tipong Pinoy </i></b>(Filipino Style), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1406\"><strong>Art Republik</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Pinoy, Eh!</i></b>, and <b><i>Arttalk</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The phenomenal growth in the 1990s was in cable television, where one can get a smorgasbord of international programs: news on CNN, BBC, NHK, ANC, and other networks; shows for the young on Nickelodeon; cartoons on the Cartoon Network; nature documentaries on the National Geographic channel; foreign movies on HBO, Showtime, AXN, and Star Movies; local movies on Cinema One and Pinoy Box Office; sports on ESPN, Star Sports, and Solar Sports; music on MTV and Myx; and many more in various languages from various continents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New broadcast platforms and program formats emerged. Radio and television had to adapt to fast-changing shifts in technology, with the <b>teleradyo</b> (television-radio) as one prime example of simulcasting resulting from these changes in technology. Portable electronic news gathering devices, video phones, and miniature cameras have made it possible to cover events on the spot or brought into the private lairs of suspected notorious individuals. Text messaging through mobile phones and the use of any electronically mediated platform by the viewers and listeners have been utilized for a more interactive broadcasting and livestreaming experience. Websites and other social media platforms began to be used to supplement real-time broadcasting. Audiences, meanwhile, have shown their capacity at &ldquo;produsage,&rdquo; portmanteau of the words &ldquo;production&rdquo; and &ldquo;usage,&rdquo; where users of the medium produce and exhibit their productions, sometimes providing an alternative programming to mainstream media, which, at times, are picked up by the industry and incorporated into their programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Talent search competitions and reality TV programs have served as an entry point for those who wanted to gain entry into the industry and are ready to be exhibited to the public as a spectacle. Also common was the rise of Internet stars, some of whom successfully transitioned into the mainstream media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many game shows and public service programs became a rich source of hope for the helpless, the hapless, and the hopeless. In addition, the networks established their respective foundations, extending all sorts of help to those in need, especially to individuals who require medical attention and communities ravaged by natural and human-induced calamities and tragedies. These foundations were not initially integral to the nature of the broadcasting industry, but have eventually become good vantage points from where to launch the networks&rsquo; programs and stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In spite of the commercialism that has characterized much of broadcast programming, one significant development, although short-lived, was the effort of the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) to recognize broadcast works that exemplified excellence through its Gawad CCP para sa Radyo and Gawad CCP para sa Telebisyon from 1987 until the mid-1990s. The recognition for the best programs on radio and television focused more on the aesthetic contributions and social significance of the programs&mdash;in short, on the integrity of the entire program&mdash;than on individual accomplishments of broadcast celebrities and personalities. Similarly, the Gawad Plaridel of the UP College of Mass Communication, beginning in 2004, has succeeded in recognizing outstanding radio and TV personalities, both national and regional, who have dedicated their lives to the creation and popularization of media programs that are critical, liberative, and liberating for the Filipino people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Resistance and Mobilization</b>.<b> </b>The Corazon Aquino administration and the broadcast media during the tenuous post-martial law period of political transition became easy targets of military coup attempts. Rightist or disgruntled members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, either coming from Marcos loyalists or Gregorio Honasan&rsquo;s Reform the Armed Forces Movement, launched six coup plots to topple the Aquino administration from 1986 to 1989. Three of these coup attempts involved the seizure of broadcast networks, specifically ABS-CBN 2, GMA 7, and PTV 4, to bring down the new government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A remarkable development in the operation of mass media during the period was the coverage of impeachment trials of the country&rsquo;s leaders, most popularly Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a> in 2000-2001 and Chief Justice Renato Corona in 2012, and numerous legislative hearings on the scandalous corruption and violence perpetrated by top government officials. Broadcast networks covered live such procedures, with the viewing public avidly following the progress of those cases. Media have also become an effective and staple vehicle for citizen mobilization during times of emergency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Audiences, however, have not been repositories alone of mediated hopes and aspirations. They have shown that they, too, have the power to find meaning in their everyday interaction with the broadcast media and its content and, at times, resist or subvert their intended and embedded meanings. This resistance can sometimes bring about collective action against the highly commercial leanings of the broadcast industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcasting has served as a reflection and a repository of the hopes, dreams, and struggles of Filipinos. More than witnessing and chronicling both the mundane and significant moments of our history, radio and television have engaged themselves as actors, together with the public, in the creation of a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like the church, the state, the school, and the family&mdash;and perhaps more than these conventional transmitters of culture&mdash;radio and television have served as a platform on which stakeholders circulate, negotiate, appropriate, and mediate cultures. The Filipino language, in particular, is one aspect of culture whose spread throughout the country resulted from the wide reach of radio and television. While broadcast platforms, including the new and emerging ones brought forth by innovations in technology, have largely been responsible for the often degrading and debilitating influences of Western culture and commercial interests, radio and television have remained grounded in the everyday stirrings of the nation, consistently articulating the sense of what it means to be a nation in ways that sometimes escape the rational, and affording their audiences a sense of connection to the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While generally functioning as a potent tool for economic convenience and political interests, the broadcast media, in many instances, have been the object of wagers with uncertain outcomes, particularly in moments of overthrowing a regime and in installing a new set of leaders. The American colonial administration of the Philippines, the Japanese invasion of the country, the reign of the Marcos dictatorship, the 1986 EDSA Revolt, the condemnation of vertiginous political corruption after 1986 that jarred the foundations of the country&rsquo;s political institutions&mdash;these were all shooting battles between colonizers and subjects, between invaders and the subjugated, between the dictatorship and the silenced, between military coup plotters and state defenders, between plunderers and the plundered. These events, however, were foremost a broadcast media war, an all-out battle to control the airwaves, the main resource and recourse of competing sociopolitical forces. In short, radio and television have moved the nation to action when the circumstances demanded them. Radio and television have provided the people during these significant sociopolitical moments with a sense of a larger, common community and the imagination of a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio and television are, indeed, storied sites and, in engaging with the everyday, have helped to create the nation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Eulalio R.

				"value": "Since the 1920s, broadcasting has played many roles in Philippine society. First, it has functioned as a potent tool for economic convenience and political interests. Philippine broadcasting has always been intricately linked with politics and commerce, with both government and business interests always intervening in the governance, operations, and directions of the industry. It has often been at the mercy of capital and the state, for which it has often been criticized as the &#x201C;lapdog&#x201D; of the dominant. Politics and economics became intensely intertwined with broadcasting as it became not only a profitable investment but also an arena for political power matches. The value of broadcast for political and business interests has also rested on the fact that broadcasting in the Philippines has not only been national in impact but transnational in varying features and contexts."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Second, broadcasting has served as an agent of social change at crucial moments of history. With such close links between politics and business, broadcasting has made its presence profoundly felt in crucial and important historical watersheds that significantly shaped the terrain and directions of the life of the nation. At such crucial moments, its presence often served to subvert the dominant order, ushering change that can be dramatic and radical. The irony is two-fold, however. The resistances are subtler and sometimes unintended, but the consequences nonetheless may subvert the cultural designs of the dominant, undermining its political agenda."

These events, however, were foremost a broadcast media war, an all-out battle to control the airwaves, the main resource and recourse of competing sociopolitical forces.

The fierce and deadly resistance waged by Filipino revolutionaries from 1899 against the American military invaders had waned, and the civilian colonial government established in 1901 had been firmly in place. However, rumblings from the ground of genuine independence continued as the local elite, co-opted by the colonizers, gained political and economic advantage. While the United States granted the Philippines free trade status, the export of cash crops, mainly sugar, and the importation of manufactured goods from the United States were encouraged. Hardly any industrialization took place as the economy remained largely agricultural and became dependent on the United States. American interest in the archipelago was notably economic but military as well, the islands being strategically located as a gateway to Asia, a condition crucial to an expanding world power. Several US military bases were established in the islands, securing American control of sea-lanes and air lanes in this part of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was thus critical for the Americans to quell resistance that could be simmering in the colony, to convince Filipinos of the goodness and desirability of American culture and the colonial project, and the progress and modernity they bore. Coming on the heels of the Spaniards whose occupation of the Philippines lasted over three centuries, the new colonizers, far more secular in their strategy, appeared to have succeeded in reshaping Filipino consciousness, perhaps beginning with the hundreds of American teachers who came aboard the <i>USS Thomas</i>&mdash;thus called the Thomasites&mdash;for the newly established compulsory public school system. As in most colonial blueprints, reengineering consciousness comes alongside or takes over from violent annexation. Declared the official language, English took hold. Public health and sanitation systems reduced mortality and controlled disease. The powerful Catholic Church lost its official clout&mdash;though arguably not its sway over the hearts of many Filipinos&mdash;as the principle of separation of Church and State came with some measure of Filipino self-rule, along with the promise of eventual independence. Established by the Americans, a civil service bureaucracy was staffed mostly by Filipinos by the end of the 1910s.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To the advantage of the colonizers, a new tool to seal the ideological conversion of the Filipinos came in 1922&mdash;radio broadcasting, which was as effective, if not more, as the public school system in importing America into the Philippines. Exposed to the English language, American accent, and above all Western music, the Filipino audience fell under the American spell. What the Americans could not do with their guns, they did with radio and their music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"first\" name=\"first\"></a>The First Experiments</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcast experiments began in the Philippines two years after KDKA of the industrial giant Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, aired the first radio advertisement in 1920, marking the beginning of commercial broadcasting. It was an ad for radio sets. The pitch was that radio brought the music theater into the homes of Americans. Radio then became the promising new medium for the advertising of consumer products and services. This was the same model adopted by the first experimenters and peddlers of radio in the Philippines: apart from the radio set being a product to sell, the radio sold other products as well. American businessmen in the colony enthusiastically welcomed the new salesman for the myriad merchandise they brought into the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the islands within the archipelago were already electronically connected to each other and to other countries even before the Americans came. Cable telegraph lines linked Manila to Corregidor in 1867, then to Hong Kong in 1879, and soon to Cebu, Bacolod, Capiz, and Iloilo. In 1890, the first telephone system was put in place. In the 1920s, wireless telegraphy was the main means of long-distance communication. Voice was transmitted through the dozens of radio stations from ship to shore and back, including those of the US military and the government. However, these were principally for point-to-point communication rather than for broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Historians of broadcast technology understand its development as an offshoot of these earlier means of electronic communication over long distances. The term &ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo; was derived from agriculture&mdash;a manner of sowing by scattering seeds by hand over a broad field. Applied to wireless radio, broadcasting meant the transmission of signals to a scattered, unknown audience. In point-to-point communication, this was problematic as anyone can hear the transmission, including those for whom the messages were not intended. However, that many can listen in was perceived as promising by those who were already imagining the exciting potentials of commercial broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Experimentation on radio broadcasting, as differentiated from point-to-point wireless communication, is believed to have begun during this period of robust wireless telegraphy activity in the colony. A Mrs Redgrave, possibly an American woman employed by the United States in the Philippines, broadcast from a military installation, the Nichols Air Base, with a five-watt transmitter in early 1922. Regrettably, no other detail of this experiment is extant today, and judging by the location of the experiment, it was probably not for commercial purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The distinction of having conducted the first commercial radio broadcasting experiment goes to Henry Herman, who began test broadcasts in Jun 1922 from three 50-watt transmitters&mdash;one in Manila, one in Pasay, and one a mobile station&mdash;airing music and news. The last two stations perhaps served as relay to the Manila station as 50 watts could not have gotten the signal farther than a few blocks. A veteran of the Philippine-American war, Herman retired from active duty and, with an incentive pay from the US government, stayed in the colony to help Americanize it. He ran an electrical supply store in Manila, the Electrical Supply <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, where the merchandise included radio sets imported from the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4870\"><strong>KZKZ</strong></a></b>. Two years after Herman&rsquo;s experimental broadcasts, he merged the three stations with a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>-watt transmitter and aired from the Monte de Piedad building on Plaza Santa Cruz across the Santa Cruz Church, then moved the studio shortly to his home in Pasay. With the call letters KZKZ, he nicknamed his station Krazy Krazy. The call letters of radio stations in the Philippines during the period began with KZ, as in Hawaii and all stations west of the Mississippi River in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Within the same year, Herman registered the Radio Corporation of the Philippines (RCP) and moved ownership of KZKZ from the Electrical Supply Company to RCP on 4 Oct 1924. Within two months, he increased the station&rsquo;s transmitting power to 500 watts. Herman wanted to model RCP after the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), a leading broadcasting and telegraph company in the United States, which was the parent corporation of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), today the oldest broadcasting network in the United States. RCP attempted to expand from broadcasting to the lucrative wireless telegraphy business, which from technological and business viewpoints was seen as closely related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the Far Eastern Radio Inc (FERI), already handling wireless telegraph traffic between ships and shore, launched an aggressive takeover of RCP. FERI succeeded; the merger was signed on 3 Sep 1925. Though the name RCP was retained, Herman was bought out. A year later, RCA bought RCP and kept it as a subsidiary. RCA received a franchise to install a high-powered radio station near Manila for wireless telegraph communication with the United States and other countries in Asia. Exactly two years after the merger, RCP, now its subsidiary, killed KZKZ in favor of another broadcast station for which it had a franchise, KZRM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a></b>.<b> </b>While Herman was in a tug-of-war with FERI, another station, KZIB, secured a franchise and went on the air on 9 Nov 1925. The call letters IB stood for Isaac Beck, an American businessman who owned the department store IBeck Escolta on Manila&rsquo;s fashionable Escolta Ave, where he set up his studio. Beck used KZIB to advertise his goods, which included radio sets and phonographs. At first it was a low-power broadcast at 20 watts. The radio advertising worked so well that six years later, Beck increased its transmitting power to a full kilowatt, then moved his store and station to the famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1429\"><strong>Crystal Arcade</strong></a>, at the time the most magnificent piece of modern architecture in the country. Also on Escolta and remembered as the first mall in the Philippines, the building housed the Manila Stock Exchange and elegant stores and restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beck was also the Philippine distributor of Columbia Records, which counted among its recording talents Filipino artists such as the soprano Nati Arellano, also called by her nicknames Nati and Tinay. Arellano performed in vaudeville and radio shows in the United States in the early 1920s. She also recorded for the American recording label Victor, but was pirated by rival Columbia, for which she recorded &ldquo;Paalam sa Pagkadalaga&rdquo; (Farewell to Maidenhood) and &ldquo;Ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/885\"><strong>Dalagang Pilipina</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Filipino Maiden). Her records were a hit among Filipino migrant workers in the United States, as well as with local audiences upon hearing them on KZIB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of the few stations that went on the air during the first 20 years of broadcasting in the Philippines, KZIB appeared to be the most stable. It was untouched by hostile takeovers and sellouts. It also seemed the most appreciative of Filipino talent and music, indicated by extant records of the musicians and announcers that went on the air on KZIB and its programs, some of which Beck himself produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>KZRM and KZRC</b>.<b> </b>As mentioned above, RCP retired KZKZ and in its place KZRM went on the air beginning 3 Sep 1927. With RCA&rsquo;s state-of-the-art studio equipment, KZRM, for Radio Manila, had better sound quality than KZKZ. Through RCP, RCA also released new models of receivers that the listening public found gave clearer signals. Just after a year, on 27 Nov 1928, RCP amped KZRM&rsquo;s transmitting power to two kilowatts, surpassing KZIB in reach and signal strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The following year, RCP also established in 1929 the first radio station outside Manila&mdash;KZRC in Cebu City. It began broadcasting from a small studio on Colon St, then it moved to the Lim Bon Fing Building on Carmelo St, which is now P. Lopez St. RCP intended KZRC to be an experimental station, serving as relay for KZRM in Manila. However, its transmitting power at one kilowatt was strong enough to reach not only Cebu audiences but those of the rest of Southern Visayas. KZRC later built its own programming for the Visayas audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is not clear why RCP bowed out of radio broadcasting in 1931 and sold the stations to the department store Erlanger &amp; Galinger. With the sale came the exclusive distributorship of all RCA products. Soon, in addition to the two stations in Manila and one in Cebu, Erlanger &amp; Galinger founded another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>KZRM and KZRC plus <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4867\"><strong>KZEG</strong></a></b>.<b> </b>The American brothers Simon and Isodore Erlanger started the department store Erlanger &amp; Galinger as a provisions supplier to the American occupying forces during the Philippine-American war. The business grew when relative peace came as they imported from the United States goods required by the growing commercial activities in the colony, such as typewriters and safes, bicycles and automobiles, and even insurance. In 1915, the brothers sold the business to retired army officer and veteran of the Philippine-American war Maj <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> H. Anderson. Keeping the original name of the company, Anderson expanded the range of goods sold at the store by carrying Victor phonographs, radio sets, and phonograph records. The store at one point kept the largest stock of phonograph records in the Philippines, as many as 150,000, with its sales responsible for half of the department store&rsquo;s business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Anderson acquired KZRM and KZRC from RCP in 1931, perhaps to replicate the success Beck had with KZIB, boosting sales of merchandise in his stores and promoting the sales of phonograph records. Like Beck, he produced recordings of famous local opera and <i>sarsuwela</i> singers favored by the local elite, but Beck did this for Columbia Recording Company and Anderson for Victor Records. He also continued operating KZRC, but extant records show that KZRC broadcasts may have discontinued in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A year later, Anderson obtained a franchise for another station, KZEG, in honor of the founders of the department store but also perhaps to generate name recall for the store. KZEG first went on the air on 11 Jul 1932. In 1938, Anderson sold KZRM and KZEG to Far Eastern Broadcasting Corporation (FEBC) owned by Filipino businessman J. Amado Araneta. It appears KZRC was not part of the sale as the Cebu station would resurface later under another ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>KZRF</strong></a> and KZRH</b>.<b> </b>On 1 Jul 1938, KZRM and KZEG began airing under FEBC, but with different call letters for KZEG, now called KZRF for Radio Filipinas. Unlike Herman, Beck, and Anderson, FEBC&rsquo;s Araneta did not own a store. Owners of vast sugar lands in Iloilo and Negros provinces, his family had interests in the <b><i>Debate</i></b>&ndash;<b><i>Mabuhay</i></b>&ndash;<b><i>Herald</i></b>&ndash;<b><i>Monday Mail </i></b>(DMHM) chain of newspapers. The sale marked the beginning of a new model of radio station proprietorship&mdash;combined with newspaper ownership, a trend that had already started in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But the old model persisted. Another big department store in Manila, the Heacock Department Store, which also carried radio sets from the United States, was granted a franchise to operate KZRH, for Radio Heacock. The department store, owned by the H. E. Heacock Co, which American Samuel Gaches acquired from its original owner H. E. Heacock, was one of the biggest at the time, with its own building on Escolta Ave. Bringing the number of radio stations in Manila to four, KZRH first went on the air on 14 Jul 1939. It instantly became the infant broadcast industry&rsquo;s leader by broadcasting at a then staggering power of 10 kilowatts and with the most modern equipment of the time, reaching every point in the Philippines and rivaling the power of KZRM, which, until that time, was the only one of the three stations before KZRH that was heard practically all over the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Furthermore, Gaches acquired KZRC from Erlanger &amp; Galinger in the same year, 1939, with an inaugural broadcast on 2 Mar 1940, transmitting at a power of one kilowatt. There was also a Heacock building housing a branch of its department store on Magallanes St in Cebu City, where KZRC set up its new studio. There was a Heacock department store in Baguio, Cebu, Davao, and Iloilo, and agents nearly everywhere in the colony, selling everything from fountain pens to firearms, electric ice boxes to office equipment, and neckties to evening gowns. Gaches clearly intended to use radio to promote his stores and merchandise. He was in fact anticipating television and believed that broadcast franchises and frequencies would become invaluable assets in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Transnational Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>In 1929, radio broadcasting signals from the Philippines crossed the oceans and foreign lands by shortwave. As early as 1925 when he put KZIB on the air, Beck started experimenting with shortwave, a wireless technology that transmitted signals over very long distances, as opposed to long wave used for regular broadcasting over relatively shorter distances. RCP also conducted shortwave experiments from 1927. In 1929, with RCA&rsquo;s powerful transmitter, RCP&rsquo;s KZRM broadcast to the world and received reports of good reception from distant countries and ships in the high seas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In turn, the following year, in 1930, KZRM began carrying American and other foreign programs. Having shortwave transmitting capacity also meant having receiving capacity. On the other hand, the American network NBC also carried Manila programs in the United States, occasionally to a nationwide audience. This went on throughout the 1930s, until the eve of World War II. With the war underway in Europe at the close of the 1930s, NBC rival Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) put Commonwealth president Manuel L. Quezon on the air from Malaca&ntilde;an a number of times. In one broadcast, Quezon pledged allegiance to the United States. CBS&rsquo;s network of 110 stations was hooked up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcast stations in the 1930s aired on at least two frequencies, at least one on shortwave and at least one on long wave. Stations thus invested in shortwave transmitters, allowing Philippine broadcasting to air transnationally, enabling Manila programs to be heard not only in some continents but also on ships at sea. Radio personalities received fan mail from all over Asia and the United States. When KZRH went on the air, it boasted that it not only covered the entire Philippines; it also reached much of Asia, the United States, and Europe through shortwave, with some listeners reporting clear reception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the introduction to the market of radio sets with shortwave receiving capacity, an average of 15 hours of foreign broadcast programs were heard in the Philippines every day in 1930. Moreover, the dozens of shortwave stations from all over Asia, North and South America, and Europe that were heard in the Philippines exposed the Filipinos as well as foreigners in the Philippines to a transnational range of program material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"colonial\" name=\"colonial\"></a>Colonial Programming</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gaches hired former KZRM announcer and NBC man Bert Silen as station manager of KZRH, with Filipino-American Johnny Harris as program director, and an all-American announcing staff with radio broadcasting experience in the United States. At its inaugural broadcast in 1939, Gaches called the new station the Voice of the Philippines while Silen declared that KZRH will give this voice &ldquo;a genuine American accent.&rdquo; Silen emphasized that &ldquo;the continuous use of proper English over KZRH will be of great assistance to the educational system in the Islands, as it will enable students of English to check their own knowledge in diction and pronunciation&rdquo; (<b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> 1939, 48).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Evidently, the goal was to fashion out of the Voice of the Philippines, the Voice of America, which came into the homes of Filipinos through programming that mimicked that of American radio, highlighting Western music, particularly American jazz, blues, swing, and other danceable tunes, and the idiom of American English. The program formats were also a takeoff from American radio. Mostly entertainment, many programs combined music and readings of English literature (poetry, prose, drama) while others took off from the vaudeville style of mixing music with comedy skits or comic repartees. With less airtime but noticeably part of the programming were news and the occasional live coverage of events as well as live annotations of sports events, children&rsquo;s programs, educational and instructional programs, religious programs, and lectures and various kinds of talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The announcement of the correct time was integrated into the programs, while bulletins about the weather, road and traffic reports, foreign exchange rates, and even the search for missing persons were regularly heard. Notices to mariners, distress signals or SOS, and police information for purposes of keeping peace and order and for safeguarding the safety of sea voyages were also heard on radio in the 1920s and the 1930s due to the less distinct functions of broadcasting and point-to-point communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recorded music from the United States and Europe was aired, but most of the music heard on the air were live performances by a mostly Filipino host of musicians and singers. Stations invested in recorded music but also in the training of musical talent for live performances on the air. KZRH boasted of a &ldquo;great library of classical and popular recordings&rdquo; but also featured on the air live performances of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> and Europe-trained opera singers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4193\"><strong>Isang Tapales</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>, and Jose Mossesgeld Santiago (<b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> 1939, 48). Amateur singing contests served as the winners&rsquo; tickets to a radio and recording career. In addition, Spanish and Latin music, especially tango, rhumba, and conga, as well as marches and concert and opera music from Europe, were popular. While not as much airtime was devoted to it in the beginning, Filipino music invaded the air and gained immense popularity as Filipino talents performed them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino artists who performed jazz and movie music on the air were especially popular. The creative flexibility of jazz suited Filipino musicians and their adaptability influenced the assimilation of elements of Western music in local compositions. Local composers who scored movies adopted the American tone, and their compositions were popularized not only through the movies but more so by broadcasting. Among the first of these composer-arrangers were Miguel Velarde Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\"><strong>Ariston Avelino</strong></a>, Restituto Umali, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4274\"><strong>Tito Arevalo</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Humor and witticisms were part of many musical shows. Programs that wove together lively music and comic skits &agrave; la vaudeville had fans inside the studio to provide live laughter and applause. Copied from US formats, comic partners sang and made fun of each other. While America had Amos and Andy, Abbott and Costello, and George Burns and Gracie Allen, Philippine radio had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a> and Togo, German San Jose and Leonora Reyes, Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan, and Vicente Ocampo and Diana Toy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News was considered an important part of programming even if it did not enjoy as much airtime as entertainment. Locally produced news programs as well as news from American radio delivered via shortwave were heard. Given the colonial connection between the Philippines and the United States, events in the United States were considered news in the Philippines. Occasional stories from other countries, particularly Europe and especially toward the end of the 1930s when war clouds were gathering, were also on the air. Interviews, scripted and rehearsed, were part of news and other programs. While news announcers had been on the air since the beginning of broadcasting in the colony, stations did not hire news reporters until the late 1930s as World War II drew near and airtime devoted to news increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some events were covered live, such as the opening of the sessions of the National Assembly, athletic competitions, and even theater productions like the popular <i>sarsuwela <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></b></i> (No Wounds) when it was staged at the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong> in Manila on 3 Jun 1939. The show was annotated to KZRM audiences by Don Alva and Harry Fenton. KZRH covered live the anniversary celebration of the magazine <b><i>Foto News</i></b>, which Gaches also owned. Radio stars and news personalities performed live at the Heacock Building with a live audience while a radio audience joined the festivities by listening at home. Whitey Smith and His Orchestra and Lolita Carvajal gave the musical numbers, Leon Ma. Guerrero of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>and Ralph Hawkins of the <b><i>Manila Daily Bulletin</i></b> provided news commentary, and Susan Magalona lectured on how society girls like her could perform their civic duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"advertising\" name=\"advertising\"></a>Advertising as Radio Lifeblood</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">The colonial administration subsidized radio broadcasting in its first several years, but advertising was a critical support to bankroll operations. The growing and bustling consumer economy grew ripe not only for local products but especially for imported goods from the United States, partly as an offshoot of aggressive marketing. As radio gained popularity, businesses that previously advertised only in newspapers and magazines began buying radio airtime. Initially, the advertisers were Herman, Beck, and Anderson, who were among the first to set up radio broadcasting to support the business of retailing. In 1932, advertising of products and services by other companies began. Soon radio was dubbed the &ldquo;super salesman&rdquo; of cigars, soaps, toothpastes, and other products.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertisers realized the efficiency with which radio promoted their products and services, so they began courting public tastes and preferences through radio broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising support for programs was nowhere more evident than in the titles of the shows. The practice was to integrate the product name into the program title when entire shows were sponsored, which was the norm. For example, on KZRM, <b><i>Chevrolet Jamboree</i></b> was a variety show of quiz, contest, and music sponsored by the Chevrolet automobile; <b><i>White Horse</i></b> was a musical sponsored by an alcoholic drink; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1459\"><strong>Listerine Amateur Hour</strong></a></i></b> was an amateur singing contest sponsored by a toothpaste; <b><i>Kolynos Hour</i></b> was a live singing performance by the most popular jazz singer of the 1930s, Priscilla, the Kolynos Girl, sponsored by another toothpaste;<i> <b>Saturday Night Klim Party</b></i> was a musical featuring Koko Trinidad sponsored by a powdered milk brand; and <b><i>El Conde de Guell</i></b><i> </i>and<i> <b>Sunkist News</b> </i>were newscasts sponsored by brands of cigars and juice drink, respectively. On KZIB, <b><i>Crystal Arcade</i></b> was a music program sponsored by the shopping mall; <b><i>Lux Toilet Soap Theatre of the Air</i></b> featured dramatizations of excerpts from movies sponsored by a brand of bath soap; and<i> <b>Purico Troubadors</b></i> and <b><i>Purico Radio Show</i></b> were variety shows sponsored by a cooking lard brand. Other examples:<i> <b>Quaker Oats Spelling Bee</b></i> was a spelling contest sponsored by a brand of oatmeal, and<b><i> Palmolive Newsreel of the Air</i></b> was a newscast sponsored by a brand of bath soap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advertising device was clever and efficiently generated brand recall. It was customary for the sponsors to produce the programs themselves or hire producers and artists, and then pay the stations for the airtime. Programs typically lasted 15 minutes each. In 1937, KZRM, which had the highest audience share before the coming of KZRH, charged 42 pesos for every 15 minutes of airtime. There were but a few station-produced programs, sustained by the stations to fill unsponsored airtime until an advertiser came along. It was easy to tell these shows apart because they did not carry brand names, such as <b><i>Air Giggles</i></b>, an amateur singing contest; <b><i>Spelling Bee</i></b>, a spelling contest; <b><i>Newsreel of the Air</i></b>, a dramatic presentation of the news; <b><i>Sunrise Club</i></b>,<i> </i>a musical; and the <b><i>Glossy Merrymakers</i></b>, another musical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The institutionalization of advertising as a critical support of radio programs in the 1930s led to a standard of professionalism in program production. Advertisers demanded polished programs and required hours of rehearsals before a program went on the air. A 15-minute program was typically rehearsed to perfection, for at least three hours. Since all programs were aired live, with very little recorded music, a mistake could not be corrected once it had gone on the air, so the discipline was strict and nothing was left to chance. Everything was scripted thoughtfully and carefully, even short spiels introducing recorded music. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> numbers were selected carefully, with each announcer required to be thoroughly familiar with the station record library. Singers and other performers first passed a rigid auditioning process, even if only to join amateur singing contests. Filipinos working in radio at the time internalized the work ethic enforced in the stations to a point that it made them indispensable to the running of the rising broadcast industry in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"radio\" name=\"radio\"></a>The Radio Stars</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising played a significant part in the development of radio artists. Advertisers and their producers selected, hired, trained, and polished the radio performers and turned them into celebrities. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most memorable of the radio stars was Priscilla, the Kolynos Girl, who sang jazz for 15 minutes twice a week on the show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1455\"><strong>The Kolynos Hour</strong></a> </i></b>on KZRM in the 1930s. Her real name was Presentacion Bataclan, but <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>, another radio personality on KZRM who doubled as its publicity manager, gave her the shorter and, according to Flor, better-sounding name that could pass as both Filipino and American. It was already common to adopt what were considered glamorous radio names. Flor herself shortened her name from the longer Carolina <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>. Priscilla, who was 13 when she started singing on the air, received an average of 100 letters a week from her fans, including a marriage proposal every now and then, not only from the Philippines but also from India, Burma, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United States. Her program&rsquo;s theme song, <b><i>The Sunshine of Your Smile</i></b>, became one of the best-selling records of the time. She was one of the better-paid, if not the best paid, radio artists before the outbreak of World War II. She received a weekly fee of 15-30 pesos per performance&mdash;which was considered an enormous sum in those days when even established radio artists received only one peso per performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fans organized themselves into clubs, with some radio celebrities having several fans clubs competing for attention. Many considered radio stars brighter than movie stars as the movie industry then produced at most a few dozen movies a year while radio turned out program after program on a daily basis. Thus radio had more newspaper publicity, which may explain why many movie stars also kept a presence on the air, particularly in shows where snippets of upcoming movies were dramatized on radio to encourage listeners to watch the movies. Fans also came to the stations to provide a live audience for some programs. In turn, the radio celebrities dressed the part&mdash;long gowns and linen suits&mdash;even if the listeners at home could not see them. The shows were often recreated through vaudeville-like stage shows where the radio stars personally appeared and performed on stage at fiestas and other special occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were several competitions that indicated the popularity of radio and radio celebrities, including those conducted annually by the <b><i>Literary Song-Movie Magazine</i></b> and <b><i>Graphic</i></b> magazine. Readers sent in their votes by clipping ballots from the magazines, boosting circulation given the legion of radio fans. In its 1934 search for the best radio performers, <b><i>Graphic</i> </b>received over 16,000 ballots to name the best radio singers of popular, classic, Filipino, and Spanish songs, best announcers, best pianists, best orchestras, and best programs. Most of the singers, pianists, and orchestras who made the list were Filipinos, Filipino Americans, and Spanish Filipinos while four of the five best programs were music shows of Filipino performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the list of five best male singers of popular music were four Filipinos and Filipino Americans: Ding Yalong, Cecil &ldquo;The Mystery Singer&rdquo; Lloyd, Francisco &ldquo;Koko&rdquo; Trinidad, and Rodrigo &ldquo;Bimbo&rdquo; Danao. Among the five best female singers of popular music were three Filipinas: Melita Castillo, Cielito Franquelli, and Lily Raquiza. Among the five best male singers of classical music were four Filipinos: J. Corominas, Juan P. de Tagle, V. Villanueva, and Mario del Rio. Among the five best female singers of classical music were three Filipinas: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Galan, Mercedes Matias, and Gorgonia Acosta. The five best singers of what were called native songs were four Filipinos&mdash;Melita Castillo, A. Siauinco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\"><strong>Carmen Rosales</strong></a>, and Lita Pascual&mdash;and a Filipino American: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\"><strong>Cecil Lloyd</strong></a>. All five best singers of Spanish songs were Filipinos or Spanish Filipinos: Carmela &ldquo;Morning Star&rdquo; Hernandez, Mario del Rio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>, Lily Raquiza, and Simplicio Hernandez. The five best pianists were four Filipinos&mdash;Rafael Artigas, Miguel Velarde Jr, Ariston Avelino, and Elizabeth Soliman&mdash;and a Filipino American, Johnny Harris. All five best orchestras were led by Filipinos: Polo Club Orchestra, Lyric Music House Orchestra, Bay View Hotel Orchestra, La Loma Cabaret Orchestra, and Felix Barcelo Orchestra. Four of the five best programs featured Filipino singers: <b><i>Sunrise Club</i></b>, <b><i>Mickey Mouse Bubble Gum</i></b>, <b><i>Air Giggles</i></b>, and <b><i>Chevrolet Jamboree</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is noticeable that the list of best announcers included only Americans as this was 1934, a year before Filipinos would first break into newscasting and major announcing roles. Setting the tone and standards not only of the music aesthetic of radio but of announcing styles, the leading voices on the air were those of Americans: Bert Silen, Ted Wallace, Wally King, George Vogel, Johnny Wightman, Don Bell, Dave Harvey, and Maurice Naftaly. However, Filipinos and Filipino-Americans began to break into the major announcing roles in the mid-1930s: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4801\"><strong>Ira Davis</strong></a>, Johnny Arville, Koko Trinidad, Vero Perfecto, and Ignacio Javier, the radio name of Leon Ma. Guerrero, who was already a noted newspaper journalist at the time. There were newscasts in Spanish read by local Spaniards, among them Conchita Garriz. There were numerous Filipino singers and musicians, among them Katy de la Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> de la Rama, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a>, Alma Corro, Ramon Escudero, Diana Toy, Ramon Alberto, Ramon Estella, the Molina Boys (brothers Celso and Paquito), Ning Navales, Lina Flor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>, the Carvajal Sisters (Fe, Lulu, and Pacita), Russ Ara&ntilde;as, the Mat Castro Family (father Remigio and daughters Luz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a>), and the Silos Trio (Dolores, Remedios, and Lourdes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Renowned classical singers were also popular on the air, including Nati Arellano, Enya Gonzales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3861\"><strong>Dalisay Aldaba</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3996\"><strong>Conchita Gaston</strong></a>. Stage and movie actors straddled the movies and stage and radio, particularly in programs where excerpts of films and plays were performed live on the air both by actors in films and stage as well as talents from radio stations, among them Carmen Rosales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4616\"><strong>Ely Ramos</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>. Many were crossing over from <i>bodabil</i> to radio, including <i>komedya</i> performer and comedian Conde Ubaldo, the couple Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4987\"><strong>Alejandro Villegas</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a> Fernando), Frankie Gomez, Jerry Brandy and his Romancers, and the comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>, Tolindoy, and Vicente Ocampo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Cebu, while KZRC mostly relayed programs from KZRM in Manila, Cebuano programs were also making radio stars out of the performers on KZRC. <b><i>Amateur Hour</i></b> and <b><i>Sunday Night Serenata</i></b>, both musical shows, made Iyo Karpo&mdash;the composer-actor <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4237\"><strong>Ben Zubiri</strong></a></strong>&mdash;a household name. With trilingual programming, Jose del Mar and Gaudencio Pe&ntilde;a read the news in Spanish while Jose Bautista announced the news and handled other shows in Cebuano, some of them with comedian Leonardo Gutierrez. American Harry Fenton read the news in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One yardstick used to measure the quality of the Filipino radio singers was the extent by which they could sound like, even imitate, the voice timber and style of American singers. Contests were held to pick the best &ldquo;So-and-So&rdquo; of the Philippines. Ding Yalong was named Bing Crosby of the Philippines; Koko Trinidad was proclaimed Dick Powell of the Philippines; Lolita Carvajal, with her throbbing voice, was the Dorothy L&rsquo;Amour of the Philippines; and the Silos Trio were dubbed the Pickens Trio of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"block\" name=\"block\"></a>Blocktiming</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As mentioned above, the first advertisers were the owners of the pioneer radio stations, whose investment in radio was principally in support of their retail businesses. When beginning in 1932 other businesses advertised products and services, the mode was through the sponsorship of entire 15-minute blocks of programs. By the mid-1930s, airtime was filled with practically all sponsored programs. A show was typically sponsored by one product advertiser, implied by the program title that carried the name of the product brand. Soon, blocktimers were also buying blocks of airtime, producing variety programs &agrave; la vaudeville, and reselling airtime spots to advertisers who could not afford to sponsor entire programs. Thus blocktime programs were probably the first to have multiple sponsors. Blocktimers were often the performers in their shows, directing an ensemble of other radio artists. Most produced shows in Tagalog while a few produced shows for the Spanish and Chinese listeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Blocktiming was good business. Most blocktimers earned more than those hired directly by the stations. Some of the successful ones were Francisco &ldquo;Frankie&rdquo; Gomez, the husband-and-wife team of Alejandro Villegas and Adela Fernando (who would later be better known as Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan), Remigio Mat Castro, and Conde Ubaldo. Ubaldo, whose real name was Ubaldo Urbina Andres, for example, made an average of 57.50 pesos a week, a fortune in those days when top-level civil servants were earning 30-35 pesos a month. He wrote, produced, read, and performed his own commercials, as was done in those days by blocktimers, who tended to carry the sponsorship of small local business enterprises. Among his clients were the Ma Mon Luk restaurant, the bus company Halili Enterprises, Lavaliere Cosmetics, Bronx Tailoring, Malig Electrical Service, and a grocery store. Among Villegas&rsquo;s clients, on the other hand, were a wet market and a battery, for which he produced the program <b><i>Kiko Baterya, Kiko Bumbilya</i></b>, modeled after the variety show <b><i>Eveready Hour</i></b> on American radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While many radio artists, both American and Filipino, were identified with particular stations, blocktimers were more fluid. They produced programs simultaneously in several stations and took their stable of artists along with them as they hopped from station to station. The audience was largely unaware of such arrangements and the press tended to focus on the programs and the artists rather than the business relationships between stations and producers. Thus, there were probably at least a few blocktimers, or artists who worked with and for blocktimers, among the many names above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Investment in Broadcasting</b>.<b> </b>Businessmen invested in radio broadcasting during the American colonial period expecting several kinds of financial rewards. The first was through merchandise sales in the department stores owned by the investors, for which radio served as advertiser, particularly of radio sets, phonographs, phonograph records, and music sheets. The second was through the profitable radio telegraph business. This was what both Herman and FERI (later RCP) were after, with both wanting to crowd out the other to corner the market. The third was from advertising, which did not happen until the beginning of the 1930s but proved quite profitable when it took off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Araneta and Gaches, who did not venture into radio until at least 16 years after Herman&rsquo;s first experiments, were notably already in the media business when they acquired broadcast stations. Araneta&rsquo;s family had interests in the DMHM chain of newspapers while Gaches in the magazine <b><i>Foto News</i></b>. Both designed ways to synergize operations. For example, Araneta put DMHM journalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\"><strong>Carlos P. Romulo</strong></a> at the helm of KZRM and KZRF while Gaches integrated several activities of KZRH and <b><i>Foto News</i></b>. Furthermore, Araneta may have viewed broadcasting as a tool for the protection of his financial holdings, apart from its potential as a business on its own. Like many members of the elite, his investments were anchored on political and economic ties with the United States, and the talk of independence at this time worried him. Independence meant the loss of preferential trade agreements with the United States and would thus jeopardize the sugar business. Radio, together with the newspapers, was a strategic ally in swaying public opinion and sympathy. Gaches, on the other hand, was counting on radio to become an important and valuable tool to provide not only entertainment but also education or instruction. Invested in agriculture and mining, he was optimistic that the Philippines would thrive. He was already prospecting for television, knowing that its development as the next broadcast technology, with more financial promises, could already be anticipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It may have seemed that Americans dominated the broadcasting business, with the exception of Araneta, but along with Americans, Filipino businessmen as well as businessmen of other nationalities operating in the Philippines were invested in radio as early as the mid-1920s. Only 13.5 percent of the stock ownership of FERI, before it merged with RCP, was owned by Americans while Filipino businessmen held 41 percent. The largest stockholder as a group were the Spaniards, who held 43.2 percent, while the rest, amounting to 2.3 percent, were held by Chinese, French, English, and Russian investors. However, most of the stocks held by some of the Spaniards and Spanish companies, or 25.5 percent of the total holdings of the company, were considered Filipino capital as they represented individuals and firms domiciled in the Philippines. This meant 66.5 percent of the total holdings of FERI was domestically sourced. It is also noticeable that the two largest individual stockholders were Filipinos&mdash;Marcos Roces and Francisco Ortigas, who owned 11 percent and 10 percent of the total stocks, respectively. If FERI could be taken as typical of the broadcasting business structure during the time, it may be assumed that no single individual was entirely responsible for the capital needed to put any broadcast station on the air. American businessmen solicited investments and put together the start-up capital to open a station, spreading the risk involved in prospecting in a new type of business. Americans may have been considered the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; leaders in the broadcast business since the technology was principally imported from the United States, and since commercial broadcasting was a distinctly American model of broadcasting. But the ventures were backed up by capital of multinational sources, with a considerable proportion contributed by Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"audience\" name=\"audience\"></a>The Audience of Colonial Radio</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The colonial administration allowed the importation of various radio apparatus and parts duty free as long as they were made in the United States. Thus, at least 95 percent of receiving sets in the country were of American make. Still, they were costly in relation to the ordinary person&rsquo;s income. In the late 1930s, a crystal radio receiver cost around 45 pesos or the equivalent of about two months&rsquo; salary of a middle-level government bureaucrat. The more modern tube receiver sold at a staggering price of 125-500 pesos each. Nevertheless, sales of the radio receivers were good, aided by the availability of installment schemes that ranged from five pesos to 20 pesos monthly. In 1927, 734 sets were bought by the public. Given the population of 12,326,000, there was one radio set for every 16,838. By 1935, with a population of 14,442,000, there were 28,258 radio sets sold, which meant there was one radio set for every 511 persons in the colony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The figures indicate the exponential growth of radio broadcasting audiences during the period. Other estimates of the size of the listening public vary, but considering that the government distributed radio sets to municipalities throughout the country particularly in the first several years, and that many of these sets were positioned in plazas, making radio listening a community activity, the audience size for each radio set must have been bigger than one family. Unlike in the United States, owners of receivers in the Philippines were required to register their sets and pay a registration fee, which the government collected and used to subsidize broadcasting and purchase radio receivers for the remote barrios. Apart from plazas, homes that had radio sets attracted crowds of neighbors hoping to catch a program or two. In Cebu, for example, a local newspaper report estimated a peak ratio of 400 listeners to a radio set in 1940. It is then possible that the size of the growing audience was much larger than the estimates. By 1940, there were 78,089 licensed sets. There were unregistered sets, and if they were counted, the number could reach 100,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from radio sets supplied by the central administration in Manila to remote areas, other receivers were typically owned by the parish priest and the mayor, who shared their radios with the rest of the community. Receivers were stood by their windows so neighbors could hear the programs. In some provinces, radio signals were heard through loud speakers installed in plazas. <b><i>The Kolynos Hour</i></b> was promoted by Kolynos delivery trucks painted with Priscilla&rsquo;s smiling face and gleaming teeth, with loud speakers inviting the people to listen to her program as the trucks drove through rural towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Broadcast Regulation and Colonial Policy. </b>Since the technology of radio broadcasting emerged out of wireless telegraphy, which was part of the mail system, it was first regulated by the Bureau of Posts, which granted permits for the operation of broadcast stations, including amateur stations, until 1931. Given the growing number of wireless stations operating in the colony, including those in private hands, the colonial government made a request to Washington, DC, for guidance, to which the reply was that federal law in the United States regarding radio did not apply to the colony. However, the policies that developed on radio broadcasting in the Philippines reflected the stance of the United States, articulated in 1928 by then US president Calvin Coolidge in an executive order, that the development of privately owned and operated radio facilities should be encouraged, but that these facilities should be available for national defense in time of war or similar national emergency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from national defense, the colonial government and the American business community were looking at &ldquo;splendid vistas of utility, progress and education&rdquo; that radio broadcasting opened up as &ldquo;every hamlet, no matter how small and distant, can be put into instantaneous touch with the center of the country&rsquo;s business, industrial, social and educational activities &hellip; making the country more homogenous.&rdquo; Calling radio a tremendous impetus for civilization, American businessmen in Manila saw overwhelming possibilities for commerce and considered radio a new and important force for progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The colonial government also saw radio&rsquo;s utility for disseminating official news to its administrators in remote areas and the public. As early as 1929, the colonial government began distributing receivers to isolated areas. When he arrived in Mar 1932, Gov-Gen Theodore Roosevelt Jr apparently shifted the expense to municipalities, which he ordered to purchase radio receiving sets and install these in public squares where communities may listen to broadcasts from Manila. Roosevelt justified the service by drawing attention to the inadequacy of transportation in the islands that prevented the quick and more massive circulation of newspapers and magazines, which until then were the traditional means of disseminating public information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The regulation of radio broadcasting passed from the Bureau of Posts to the newly created Radio Control Board on 11 Nov 1931 when the colonial Philippine legislature passed Act 3846, or the Radio Control Law. The board was put under the supervision of the secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry while the secretary of the Department of Public Works and Communications approved the construction of radio facilities and transmitting stations. The Radio Control Board examined applications for licenses to operate radio, allocated band frequencies, and conducted inspections for the office of the commerce and industry secretary. The law provides that licenses could be granted or transferred only to citizens of the United States or of the Philippines, or to firms or companies that were incorporated under the laws of the Philippines or of any state or territory of the United States of America. Licenses were not to be granted or transferred to any company or corporation in which an alien was employed as officer or director or to any company or corporation whose 20 percent of capital stock could be voted by aliens or their representatives, or by a foreign government or its representatives, or by any company, corporation, or association organized under the laws of a foreign country. The law also provided that the president of the United States or the governor-general of the Philippines, in time of war, public peril, calamity, or disaster, could order the closing of any radio station in the Philippines or authorize the temporary use or possession of any radio station by any department of the government upon just compensation to the owners. Unmistakably, the law was designed to allow government control in time of war, and control by forces friendly to government in time of peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new law gave the Radio Control Board the power to regulate all radio stations and radio communications in the colony except those of the US Army and Navy. It was composed of a representative of the US Army, a representative of the US Navy, and a representative of the Department of Public Works and Communications. In spite of the official view that radio broadcasting was a commercial activity, the board&rsquo;s composition and mandate belied the acute interest of the colonial government, particularly the military, in broadcasting. In fact, before the law was passed, the US Department of State wrote the Department of War on 21 Aug 1931 to inform the latter that radio stations in the Philippines and the Panama Canal Zone were under the jurisdiction of the Department of War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To support the program to reach the entire archipelago through broadcasting, another law was passed in 1932, Act 3997, creating the National Radio Broadcasting Fund, built from the annual collection of radio receiver licenses, similar to car registration fees. The collection of radio receiver license fees was a significant departure from the practice in the United States, but was justified to subsidize both broadcasting and listening. Called the Radio Broadcasting Law, it also created the Radio Regulation Office under the secretary of commerce and communication. Its task was to fund programs that would air news from the government, educational programs, and other programs approved by the secretary of commerce and communication. The fund was to support a minimum of six hours daily of government programming as well as provide subsidy to broadcast stations when necessary. But even before the law was passed, annual registration fees of two pesos for crystal receivers and 10 pesos for tube sets were collected, with exemptions granted to receivers used by the colonial administration and the US Army and Navy. Part of the collection was used to subsidize a government committee for broadcasting and some of the first radio broadcasting stations including KZRM. As mentioned above, prior to 1932, part of the fund underwrote the purchase of radio sets for the rural areas. In 1938, Quezon&rsquo;s Commonwealth government reduced the radio registration fees, abolished the subsidy to the radio stations, and poured the fund into the purchase of sets for distribution to the municipalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Accusing newspapers of inaccurate reporting, Quezon attempted to nationalize broadcasting and use it against his critics. With his powerful sway over the First National Assembly of the Commonwealth, a law was passed in Jun 1936 authorizing Quezon to create a radio board whose task was to study ways and means for the nationalization and acquisition by the government of radio broadcasting stations and to censor all programs to be broadcast or rebroadcast by all stations, whether sustained by the stations or sponsored by advertisers. The takeover did not happen, though, probably hampered by the lack of funds to expropriate the radio stations from private ownership. Quezon did get a chance to control one radio station for a short period of time&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4871\"><strong>KZND</strong></a>, in 1941, shortly before World War II arrived on Philippine shores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"emergence\" name=\"emergence\"></a>The Emergence of Philippine Radio</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The institutions the Americans built in the colony appear to have eroded nationalistic fervor among many Filipinos, who embraced the public school system, appreciated the effects of the health and sanitation programs, and anticipated a perceived modernization to be brought about by American culture. For the local elite, the political reconfigurations from the Spanish period, the economic structures, and secularism introduced by Americans presented promising opportunities. To the colonizers, Americanization of the islands was an expressed goal and radio broadcasting came in handy to speed up the process. Filipinos loved the music and enjoyed the talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino radio performers learned American music and spoke like American announcers and newscasters. Filipino producers formatted their programs according to American radio programs, following the technical standards and organizational structure of American radio. However, almost from the beginning, fragments of expressions of the local inserted themselves into the programming. In 1929, the director of the National Library <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5419\"><strong>Teodoro M. </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w</strong></strong> noted that the frequent airplay of local songs increased their popularity such that the music sheets of the Tagalog love song called <i>kundiman</i> outsold the music sheets of jazz, reviving its popularity as well as that of other Filipino music forms like the Visayan folk song <i>balitaw. </i>Among the more memorable Tagalog compositions that gained wide recognition through radio were &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/884\"><strong>Dahil sa Iyo</strong></a>&rdquo; (Because of You),<i> </i>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\"><strong>Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig</strong></a> (My Only Love), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a>?&rdquo; (Will You Remember?). By this time, the American recording companies Victor and Columbia had been recording the local songs for distribution to the growing Filipino community in the United States. KZIB, KZRM, and KZEG played the records on the air, maximizing profit for the local distributors of Victor and Columbia phonograph records and phonographs, which after all were distributed by the department stores IBeck Escolta and Erlanger &amp; Galinger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other recordings by Filipino music artists that Victor and Columbia pressed included songs where Tagalog and English were mixed, whether originally composed in English or Filipino. For example, Katy dela Cruz recorded the bouncy Tagalog folk song &ldquo;Magtanim Ay Di Biro&rdquo; (Planting Rice Is No Joke) in a mix of Tagalog and English lyrics initially for Filipinos in the United States, carrying the English title &ldquo;Planting Rice.&rdquo; It was her first known recording. Another example is the version of the American popular song &ldquo;Singing in the Rain&rdquo; recorded in both English and Filipino, with comic repartee between lines, by German San Jose and Leonora Reyes for Columbia. There were also recordings in Spanish to appeal to the local Spanish community as well as mixes of English and Spanish in some songs that were originally in English, such as Louis Garcia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Preguntas a las Estrellas&rdquo; (Ask the Stars). There were also recordings by Filipino artists of American popular music, such as Bimbo Danao&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&rdquo; for Victor as well as local compositions in English, like &ldquo;Rosalinda,&rdquo; recorded by Filipino-American Cecil Lloyd, also known as the Mystery Singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As local music artists gained a following, local singing groups sang their recordings more frequently on the air. The Silos Trio began to sing more local and Spanish songs than English as their popularity increased. Also called the SSS Trio and recognized as the best harmony team in local radio, they debuted in the program <b><i>Music Radiolite</i></b> in 1935 when the twins Dolores and Remedios Silos were 13 and their sister Lourdes was 11. Cecil Lloyd, called The Mystery Singer, sang swings, rumbas, and other American popular music, but also kundiman and Spanish compositions to the accompaniment of Lux Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around the beginning of the 1930s, there were entire programs in Tagalog. On KZIB, five of the six programs sponsored by companies were in Tagalog and only one was in English. In 1934, the program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>Balagtasan</strong></a> on the Air</i></b> (Poetic Joust on the Air), sponsored by Elizalde &amp; Co, began airing on KZRM, featuring Filipino poets and writers and supporters of Tagalog literature <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\"><strong>Florentino Collantes</strong></a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5045\"><strong>Emilio Mar Antonio</strong></a>, Domingo Carasig, and Epifania Alvarez. By the late 1930s, all four commercial stations in Manila aired Tagalog programs, including KZRH, the self-appointed teacher of correct English speech to Filipinos. In 1938, an early model of the Tagalog soap opera&ndash;cum&ndash;advice program, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1506\"><strong>Si Aling Juanang Mapag-impok</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(The Thrifty Madam Juana), hosted by Lina Flor, debuted. In the same year, the precursor of the situation comedy in Tagalog, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), which was a satire on Filipino manners, politics, customs, and government, first appeared. Its forerunner was the variety show called <b><i>Common Weal Hour</i></b>, both produced by Horacio de la Costa, who would later become a Jesuit priest. De la Costa produced <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> to fight the divorce bill introduced in the National Assembly, which notably did not prosper in the legislature. <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> poked fun at the establishment, especially government officials, until the 1960s, interrupted only by World War II. The program must have inspired producers in KZRC in Cebu where commentaries on politics, graft, and other issues were also heard on the air. By 1940, most of KZIB&rsquo;s programs were in Tagalog. Among the memorable programs in 1941 were <b><i>Filipino Program</i></b> and <b><i>Tagalog Program</i></b> on KZIB; <b><i>News in Tagalog</i></b>,<i> <b>Tagalog Gospel Hour</b></i>,<i> <b>Tagalog Music</b></i>, and <b><i>Songs of the Islands</i></b> on KZRF; and <b><i>The Mystery Singer</i></b> (featuring American-Filipino Cecil Lloyd) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a> Orchestra</i></b> on KZRH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Blocktimers were the first to use Tagalog as the language of broadcasting, play local music on the air, and inject a local sense of humor and even subversive material into the programming. Most blocktime programs were variety shows that combined short skits, comedy routines and singing, &agrave; la bodabil,<i> </i>such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>, the long-running <b><i>Glossy Merrymakers</i></b> on KZIB, and <b><i>The San Miguel Brewery Hour</i></b> on KZRF produced by Alejandro Villegas. Another variety show, the <b><i>University of the Air</i></b>, mixed the English and Tagalog languages, with half of the program consisting of comic skits in Tagalog. The program <b><i>Purico Troubadours</i></b>, sponsored by the Philippine Manufacturing Company, featured Tagalog and Visayan music performed by a string orchestra conducted by Remigio Mat Castro. Extant recordings of some of the songs sung by blocktimers on the air, including original compositions and racy novelty songs, reveal a number that were critical of the colonial condition, such as Dely Atay-atayan&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Alila&rdquo; (Slave), a thinly veiled metaphor for the colonized country. The sharp element of protest in this and other songs was softened by the comic routines that accompanied their rendition, but some were more explicitly nationalistic, bewailing the colonial condition of the country in such kundiman<i> </i>pieces as &ldquo;Hibik ng Pilipinas&rdquo;<i> </i>(Lament of the Philippines),<i> </i>&ldquo;Ibong Sawi&rdquo; (Broken-Hearted Bird), and &ldquo;Kantahin ng Ulila&rdquo;<i> </i>(Song of the Orphan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Subjected to American measures of broadcast quality, Filipino broadcasters were forced to acquire the accent of American announcers and newscasters and the idiom of American English. In the mid-1930s, Filipino announcers began handling announcing and newscasting in English. Among the first ones were Koko Trinidad, Ira Davis, Vero Perfecto, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4944\"><strong>Norman Reyes</strong></a>. Trinidad, like most, began his long radio career as a singer. He was the first Filipino to be given an English newscasting assignment after an audition on KZRM, beating American applicants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gradually, too, Filipinos began to take more important positions in the stations. Trinidad rose to the position of production manager of KZRM before World War II broke out. By this time, 1938, KZRM had transferred ownership from Anderson&rsquo;s Erlanger &amp; Galinger to Araneta&rsquo;s Far East Broadcasting Corporation (FEBC). Apart from KZRM news, the newscasts remained mostly in American hands, but in dramatized news documentaries, the Filipinos outclassed the Americans. In their production of weekly news summaries in 1941, Trinidad and Lamberto Avellana, both good mimics, dramatized the news by impersonating the voices of important political personalities from around the world. The use of drama to tell the news was a successful innovation of the American network CBS in cooperation with <b><i>Time</i> </b>magazine. Visiting broadcast journalists Fritz Lang and Bill Dunn were impressed, thinking that the Filipinos beat them at replicating the CBS format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American community generally regarded radio as an effective medium for the Americanization of the colony, but American station managers sensed an appetite for Filipino elements in the programming when advertising for Tagalog programs began to increase, so the goal of Americanization came into tension with the demands of making a profit. As businessmen, station owners and managers understood that satisfying the preferences of listeners created the critical mass of audiences that advertisers sought, which by the early 1930s had become the most important source of income of radio stations. Listeners mailed their requests for musical numbers not only in Tagalog but also in other Philippine languages, and it became the job of the broadcasting manager to find individuals who could perform the requested numbers. The use of Tagalog in media gained additional support when Quezon signed the law proclaiming it as the basis of the national language in 1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of the 1930s, the broadcasting business was on its way to becoming an industry. It was exciting, glamorous, and merry, and the audience size was growing exponentially. Regarded primarily as a commercial activity, it enjoyed relative freedom from the control of government, in spite of Quezon&rsquo;s threat to take it over. In 1941, however, the political, economic, and cultural conditions in the Philippines drastically changed as the Americans lost control of the country to Japanese military forces. Radio broadcasting took on various roles in presenting the contending ideologies and worldviews of the Americans and yet another invader who exploited Philippine radio for the realization of their own global expansion designs.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by Elizabeth L.

The fierce and deadly resistance waged by Filipino revolutionaries from 1899 against the American military invaders had waned, and the civilian colonial government established in 1901 had been firmly in place. However, rumblings from the ground of genuine independence continued as the local elite, co-opted by the colonizers, gained political and economic advantage. While the United States granted the Philippines free trade status, the export of cash crops, mainly sugar, and the importation of manufactured goods from the United States were encouraged. Hardly any industrialization took place as the economy remained largely agricultural and became dependent on the United States. American interest in the archipelago was notably economic but military as well, the islands being strategically located as a gateway to Asia, a condition crucial to an expanding world power. Several US military bases were established in the islands, securing American control of sea-lanes and air lanes in this part of the world."

Coming on the heels of the Spaniards whose occupation of the Philippines lasted over three centuries, the new colonizers, far more secular in their strategy, appeared to have succeeded in reshaping Filipino consciousness, perhaps beginning with the hundreds of American teachers who came aboard the <i>USS Thomas</i>&#x2014;thus called the Thomasites&#x2014;for the newly established compulsory public school system. As in most colonial blueprints, reengineering consciousness comes alongside or takes over from violent annexation. Declared the official language, English took hold. Public health and sanitation systems reduced mortality and controlled disease. The powerful Catholic Church lost its official clout&#x2014;though arguably not its sway over the hearts of many Filipinos&#x2014;as the principle of separation of Church and State came with some measure of Filipino self-rule, along with the promise of eventual independence. Established by the Americans, a civil service bureaucracy was staffed mostly by Filipinos by the end of the 1910s."

It was an ad for radio sets. The pitch was that radio brought the music theater into the homes of Americans. Radio then became the promising new medium for the advertising of consumer products and services. This was the same model adopted by the first experimenters and peddlers of radio in the Philippines: apart from the radio set being a product to sell, the radio sold other products as well. American businessmen in the colony enthusiastically welcomed the new salesman for the myriad merchandise they brought into the Philippines."

With the war underway in Europe at the close of the 1930s, NBC rival Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) put Commonwealth president Manuel L. Quezon on the air from Malaca&#xF1;an a number of times.

The program formats were also a takeoff from American radio. Mostly entertainment, many programs combined music and readings of English literature (poetry, prose, drama) while others took off from the vaudeville style of mixing music with comedy skits or comic repartees.

Since all programs were aired live, with very little recorded music, a mistake could not be corrected once it had gone on the air, so the discipline was strict and nothing was left to chance. Everything was scripted thoughtfully and carefully, even short spiels introducing recorded music. <a href=\"/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> numbers were selected carefully, with each announcer required to be thoroughly familiar with the station record library.

By the mid-1930s, airtime was filled with practically all sponsored programs.

Soon, blocktimers were also buying blocks of airtime, producing variety programs &#xE0; la vaudeville, and reselling airtime spots to advertisers who could not afford to sponsor entire programs.

Like many members of the elite, his investments were anchored on political and economic ties with the United States, and the talk of independence at this time worried him. Independence meant the loss of preferential trade agreements with the United States and would thus jeopardize the sugar business. Radio, together with the newspapers, was a strategic ally in swaying public opinion and sympathy. Gaches, on the other hand, was counting on radio to become an important and valuable tool to provide not only entertainment but also education or instruction.

Only 13.5 percent of the stock ownership of FERI, before it merged with RCP, was owned by Americans while Filipino businessmen held 41 percent. The largest stockholder as a group were the Spaniards, who held 43.2 percent, while the rest, amounting to 2.3 percent, were held by Chinese, French, English, and Russian investors. However, most of the stocks held by some of the Spaniards and Spanish companies, or 25.5 percent of the total holdings of the company, were considered Filipino capital as they represented individuals and firms domiciled in the Philippines. This meant 66.5 percent of the total holdings of FERI was domestically sourced. It is also noticeable that the two largest individual stockholders were Filipinos&#x2014;Marcos Roces and Francisco Ortigas, who owned 11 percent and 10 percent of the total stocks, respectively. If FERI could be taken as typical of the broadcasting business structure during the time, it may be assumed that no single individual was entirely responsible for the capital needed to put any broadcast station on the air. American businessmen solicited investments and put together the start-up capital to open a station, spreading the risk involved in prospecting in a new type of business. Americans may have been considered the &#x201C;natural&#x201D; leaders in the broadcast business since the technology was principally imported from the United States, and since commercial broadcasting was a distinctly American model of broadcasting. But the ventures were backed up by capital of multinational sources, with a considerable proportion contributed by Filipinos."

Unlike in the United States, owners of receivers in the Philippines were required to register their sets and pay a registration fee, which the government collected and used to subsidize broadcasting and purchase radio receivers for the remote barrios. Apart from plazas, homes that had radio sets attracted crowds of neighbors hoping to catch a program or two. In Cebu, for example, a local newspaper report estimated a peak ratio of 400 listeners to a radio set in 1940. It is then possible that the size of the growing audience was much larger than the estimates. By 1940, there were 78,089 licensed sets.

However, the policies that developed on radio broadcasting in the Philippines reflected the stance of the United States, articulated in 1928 by then US president Calvin Coolidge in an executive order, that the development of privately owned and operated radio facilities should be encouraged, but that these facilities should be available for national defense in time of war or similar national emergency."

De la Costa produced <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> to fight the divorce bill introduced in the National Assembly, which notably did not prosper in the legislature. <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> poked fun at the establishment, especially government officials, until the 1960s, interrupted only by World War II. The program must have inspired producers in KZRC in Cebu where commentaries on politics, graft, and other issues were also heard on the air. By 1940, most of KZIB&#x2019;s programs were in Tagalog. Among the memorable programs in 1941 were <b><i>Filipino Program</i></b> and <b><i>Tagalog Program</i></b> on KZIB; <b><i>News in Tagalog</i></b>,<i> <b>Tagalog Gospel Hour</b></i>,<i> <b>Tagalog Music</b></i>, and <b><i>Songs of the Islands</i></b> on KZRF; and <b><i>The Mystery Singer</i></b> (featuring American-Filipino Cecil Lloyd) and <b><i><a href=\"/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a> Orchestra</i></b> on KZRH."

Most blocktime programs were variety shows that combined short skits, comedy routines and singing, &#xE0; la bodabil,<i> </i>such as <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>, the long-running <b><i>Glossy Merrymakers</i></b> on KZIB, and <b><i>The San Miguel Brewery Hour</i></b> on KZRF produced by Alejandro Villegas. Another variety show, the <b><i>University of the Air</i></b>, mixed the English and Tagalog languages, with half of the program consisting of comic skits in Tagalog. The program <b><i>Purico Troubadours</i></b>, sponsored by the Philippine Manufacturing Company, featured Tagalog and Visayan music performed by a string orchestra conducted by Remigio Mat Castro. Extant recordings of some of the songs sung by blocktimers on the air, including original compositions and racy novelty songs, reveal a number that were critical of the colonial condition, such as Dely Atay-atayan&#x2019;s song &#x201C;Alila&#x201D; (Slave), a thinly veiled metaphor for the colonized country. The sharp element of protest in this and other songs was softened by the comic routines that accompanied their rendition, but some were more explicitly nationalistic, bewailing the colonial condition of the country in such kundiman<i> </i>pieces as &#x201C;Hibik ng Pilipinas&#x201D;<i> </i>(Lament of the Philippines),<i> </i>&#x201C;Ibong Sawi&#x201D; (Broken-Hearted Bird), and &#x201C;Kantahin ng Ulila&#x201D;<i> </i>(Song of the Orphan)."

By this time, 1938, KZRM had transferred ownership from Anderson&#x2019;s Erlanger &amp; Galinger to Araneta&#x2019;s Far East Broadcasting Corporation (FEBC). Apart from KZRM news, the newscasts remained mostly in American hands, but in dramatized news documentaries, the Filipinos outclassed the Americans. In their production of weekly news summaries in 1941, Trinidad and Lamberto Avellana, both good mimics, dramatized the news by impersonating the voices of important political personalities from around the world. The use of drama to tell the news was a successful innovation of the American network CBS in cooperation with <b><i>Time</i> </b>magazine. Visiting broadcast journalists Fritz Lang and Bill Dunn were impressed, thinking that the Filipinos beat them at replicating the CBS format."

As businessmen, station owners and managers understood that satisfying the preferences of listeners created the critical mass of audiences that advertisers sought, which by the early 1930s had become the most important source of income of radio stations. Listeners mailed their requests for musical numbers not only in Tagalog but also in other Philippine languages, and it became the job of the broadcasting manager to find individuals who could perform the requested numbers. The use of Tagalog in media gained additional support when Quezon signed the law proclaiming it as the basis of the national language in 1938."

Regarded primarily as a commercial activity, it enjoyed relative freedom from the control of government, in spite of Quezon&#x2019;s threat to take it over. In 1941, however, the political, economic, and cultural conditions in the Philippines drastically changed as the Americans lost control of the country to Japanese military forces. Radio broadcasting took on various roles in presenting the contending ideologies and worldviews of the Americans and yet another invader who exploited Philippine radio for the realization of their own global expansion designs.&#xA0;<em><strong>Written by Elizabeth L.

The world was polarized between the military alliances called the Allies&mdash;mainly Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States&mdash;and the Axis powers&mdash;Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Philippines was not spared by this war. While Germany controlled much of continental Europe beginning in 1939, Japan, already at war with China, advanced on Asia and the Pacific. Within hours of bombing Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, USA, on 7 Dec 1941 (8 Dec in the Philippines), Japan began its attack on the Philippines. For over three years, the country endured yet another foreign assault on its land, people, and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like the Americans before them, the Japanese attempted to reengineer Filipino consciousness through a restructuring of the educational system, the teaching of the Japanese language, and even the reorientation of religious activities. A propaganda machinery managed the cultural fronts, including radio, newspapers, film, and theater. However, Filipinos despised the heavy-handed method by which the Japanese imposed its doctrine and vilified the United States. The Japanese seemed to have miscalculated the depth with which American colonial leanings had taken root in the psyche of many Filipinos. Radio under the Japanese deprived Filipinos of the vibrant music and the lively talk of American-style programming, and imposed on them what was perceived as overt propaganda through endless lectures, political speeches, and Japanese marches.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around the world, the Allies and the Axis powers used radio for coded communication and espionage, and radio broadcasting for propaganda. In the Philippines, Filipinos listened to Japanese-controlled radio&mdash;the only broadcasting sanctioned during the period&mdash;but also monitored underground signals emanating from resistance groups broadcasting within and outside the country. World War II was as much a contest of might as it was a battle of ideologies, and radio broadcasting was a critical combat zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"radio\" name=\"radio\"></a>Radio and the Looming War</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular music and other forms of light entertainment filled most of the radio airtime in the 1930s. Regular news programs were brief and comprised only five percent of programming. Except for Quezon, who was keenly aware of radio&rsquo;s ability to raise his profile, key government officials were rarely heard on the air. In the late 1930s, however, with war looming on the horizon, news programs on all radio stations increased in length and frequency. This was when shortwave broadcasting, with its ability to transmit signals across continents, had become an indispensable propaganda device used by both the Allies and the Axis powers in fighting a global war. Radio sets with shortwave reception capacity began to sell more while the Philippine Army encouraged enrollment in schools for radio technicians and engineers, anticipating an increase in radio communication and broadcasting activity &ldquo;in defense of country&rdquo; (<i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i> 1941a, 1941b; <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>ne</i> 1941).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American colonial administration, in the meantime, kept under surveillance radio station owners and staff, both Americans and Filipinos, to check their loyalty in light of the ominous events in Europe and China. The technical capacities of radio equipment were gauged while programs, especially news, were closely monitored and advertising sources verified. In general, the commercial stations were found supportive of the US and the Philippine Commonwealth governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Quezon issued emergency rules through the National Emergency Administration organized on 1 Jul 1941, which included new regulations governing electrical communication and radio installations and the sale or repair of radio sets or radio parts, which should all be registered with the government. Unlicensed radio transmitter installations must immediately be reported to the secretary of national defense, giving the name and address of the owner and the location of the installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4871\"><strong>KZND</strong></a></b>. The emergency rules prohibited the issuance of new broadcasting permits, but the government itself earlier inaugurated on 30 Apr 1941 the new station KZND. Its call letters stood for national defense. The establishment of KZND was not intentional. In early 1941, acting on intelligence information, the government seized a one-kilowatt transmitter from an Axis national. It was an opportunity to have its own broadcast voice, so the government put the confiscated transmitter to use and went on the air. Vero Perfecto was appointed station manager. For a few hours in the evenings, KZND aired newscasts, warned people about the imminence of war, conducted emergency drills, and instructed listeners on safe and proper behavior during air raids. KZND&rsquo;s operation lasted less than eight months. Along with the commercial stations, it ceased broadcast as the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), the combined Filipino and American forces under Gen Douglas MacArthur&rsquo;s command, retreated to Bataan and Corregidor while Japanese invasion forces pushed toward Manila around the end of Dec 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"war\" name=\"war\"></a>War and Propaganda Radio</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio broadcasters in Manila signed on in the morning of 8 Dec 1941 with the news that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Several hours later, the news was about Japanese bombs that had just been dropped on Baguio City and Clark Air Field in Pampanga without warning. The usual entertainment programs immediately made way for newscasts, which were aired not only to Philippine audiences but also to the United States via shortwave. It soon became apparent that reinforcements of MacArthur&rsquo;s ground forces were not immediately forthcoming while the pressure of superior numbers of the invading forces was increasingly felt.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 26 Dec 1941, as the Japanese aggressively advanced toward Manila from the north, MacArthur declared Manila an Open City, abandoning it to retreat west to Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island off Manila Bay, evacuating with him the Commonwealth government in the persons of Quezon and his vice president, Sergio Osme&ntilde;a, and their respective families. The declaration was aimed at sparing the city from battle. However, MacArthur understood the critical role radio would play in the war, so he ordered his troops to destroy private and commercial radio broadcast equipment before leaving the city to render them useless to the Japanese. Large transmitters were blown up but portable transmitters were commandeered and brought to Corregidor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the meantime, US High Commissioner Francis B. Sayre appointed KZRH station manager Bert Silen as chief coordinator of information to &ldquo;propagate favorable news for the Allies and create anti-Japanese feelings and propaganda until such time as the American forces shall liberate us.&rdquo; Silen in turn enlisted as his assistants KZRH program director Johnny Harris, announcer Ramon Escudero, and technician Simeon Cheng. Cheng was a Chinese national who studied radio engineering at the Philippine School of Arts and Trade before joining KZRH. On Silen&rsquo;s instruction, Cheng pulled out and brought to Corregidor a shortwave transmitter and other radio parts and equipment (Cheng Papers, n.d.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The Voice of Freedom</b>. While awaiting reinforcements from the United States, MacArthur and his troops dug in to repel the Japanese onslaught toward Bataan and Corregidor. At the same time, it was important to keep up the propaganda to prevent demoralization of both the USAFFE and the civilian population they left behind, so an improvised radio station was quickly rigged. Military radio engineers led by KZRH announcer and chief engineer Ted Ince (Ted Wallace on the air) assembled inside the Malinta Tunnel a commandeered transmitter and other radio equipment, including equipment brought by Cheng. On 5 Jan 1942, the station, named by MacArthur, went on the air with the program of the same name, <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b>. For over four months, until early May 1942, the <b><i>Voice of Freedom </i></b>broadcast nightly at six o&rsquo;clock, on varying frequencies to elude interference. The listeners followed on the dial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Signing on with the American anthem &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; journalist-publisher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\"><strong>Carlos P. Romulo</strong></a> of the prewar <b><i>Debate</i></b>&ndash;<b><i>Mabuhay</i></b>&ndash;<b><i>Herald</i></b>&ndash;<b><i>Monday Mail</i></b> chain of newspapers, who was also the general manager of the Far Eastern Broadcasting Corporation, the holding company of prewar KZRM and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>KZRF</strong></a>, introduced himself as the voice of freedom without identifying himself. Commissioned as a Philippine Army reserve major, he gave updates on the efforts to stall the southward thrust of the Japanese forces from Lingayen Gulf into Bataan. Romulo, Leon Ma. Guerrero III, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\"><strong>Salvador P. Lopez</strong></a></strong> wrote the news and commentary in English which Romulo, Guerrero, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4944\"><strong>Norman Reyes</strong></a> took turns reading on the air. (Romulo and Lopez would, in the postwar period, be appointed presidents of the University of the Philippines while all three became diplomats, with Romulo enjoying the distinction of being the first Asian to be elected president of the United Nations General Assembly.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The English newscast and commentary were followed by the program <b><i>Tinig ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan</i></b>&mdash;Tagalog for voice of freedom. The voice was that of Philippine Army lieutenant Francisco Isidoro, who translated the English scripts to Tagalog and delivered them on the air. It was Quezon&rsquo;s idea to have a Tagalog speaker deliver the news and commentary in Tagalog on the station, and it was he who identified Isidoro for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">America&rsquo;s failure to send immediate rescue doomed the siege at Bataan and Corregidor. Patriotic encouragement from the <b><i>Voice of Freedom </i></b>was not enough to calm the hunger, fatigue, and frustration of the Filipino-American troops in the face of the relentless and savage offensive of the Japanese, whom the Americans and the Filipinos by this time realized they underestimated. With mounting casualties from battle and disease and impending defeat, Quezon, Osme&ntilde;a, and their families were evacuated to the United States to set up a government in exile while MacArthur was evacuated to Australia in Mar 1942 to plan a return to the Philippines, leaving Lt Gen Jonathan Wainwright in command on Corregidor and Gen Edward King in Bataan. Romulo was also evacuated to Australia just before USAFFE troops in Bataan were overwhelmed on 9 Apr 1942. Taking over the announcing job completely, Reyes is best remembered for his dramatic and emotional reading of Lopez&rsquo;s script on the air announcing the fall of Bataan, which Isidoro translated to Tagalog and then read on the air after Reyes. Lopez&rsquo;s script, which described the defeated Philippine-American troops with &ldquo;heads bloody but unbowed,&rdquo; would later be considered a classic piece of wartime journalistic writing. With his powerful prose, Lopez portrayed the men &ldquo;of unshakable faith &hellip; made of something more than flesh, but &hellip; not made of impervious steel.&rdquo; While he conceded that the flesh had to yield and the battle had to end, Lopez ended with optimism, declaring that the spirit that made Bataan stand was a beacon to all the liberty-loving peoples of the world, and could not fail (Buencamino 2003; Romulo 1943; Ongpauco 1982; Tayag 1946).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the remaining 70,000 USAFFE troops in Bataan now prisoners of war, the Japanese then turned to the 3,500 still on Corregidor, who were by then greatly weakened. To prevent further loss of life, General Wainwright ended the Filipino-American resistance in Corregidor and surrendered to the Japanese in early May 1942. Conscious of the effect of a radio broadcast on the Filipinos who thought the Americans invincible and the Japanese as no match, the latter made him announce the surrender on the air at around 11:30 pm on 7 May 1942. It was on a station that the Japanese built out of remnants of KZRH equipment, for which they kept the same call letters. Until almost midnight, Wainwright called on American and Filipino troops still fighting in the field to surrender to the Japanese.

While the battles in Bataan and Corregidor were still raging, Filipinos in Cebu and nearby provinces monitored the war in Luzon by listening to the Voice of Freedom, whose signals were picked up and relayed by KZRC. KZRC was not covered by MacArthur&rsquo;s order to tear down the broadcast stations on the eve of Japanese assault on Manila, so it continued broadcasting freely until the Japanese overran the province in May 1942 and literally burst through the station door. In addition to the news and commentary from Corregidor, KZRC broadcast its own commentary on the war. Its station manager, American Harry Fenton, was well-known in Cebu for his fierce and lengthy on-air denunciations of the Japanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4990\"><strong>Voice of Juan de la Cruz</strong></a></b>. About a week after the surrender of Corregidor silenced the Voice of Freedom in early May 1942, the Voice of Juan de la Cruz went on the air. It was the voice of 18-year-old Carlos Malonzo. Malonzo picked up information from the shortwave broadcast of Chungking radio in China, which he echoed with his own comments on the air. Chungking (also spelled Chongqing), in Southwest China, was at the time under the control of Generalissimo Chiang-Kai-shek, who was allied with the Americans. Malonzo thought Chungking radio, part of which broadcast was presumably in English, was more outspoken against Japan and the Axis powers and more optimistic in its claims than either the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) or KGEI&mdash;a shortwave station in San Francisco, California, under US military control during the war. Malonzo mocked and insulted the Japanese using coarse language. When the Japanese offered a reward of 2,500 pesos for information leading to his capture, he retorted and offered one peso for every Sakdal (member of a supposedly pro-Japanese organization), five pesos for every Filipino official collaborating with the Japanese, &ldquo;and for that SOB [Japanese Military Commander] General Homma, P7.50&rdquo; (Hartendorp 1967).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Malonzo, who was not a professional broadcaster, was not initially militant against the Japanese. However, witnessing a Japanese sentry slap an elderly Filipino woman for failing to bow in obeisance infuriated him. He then gathered his friends and together they stole 50,000 pesos worth of goods from Japanese supply warehouses and sold the items in the black market to finance the launching and operation of the station. He hired radio technician Tony San Juan to assemble radio parts and equipment, scriptwriter Oscar Arellano, a Japanese-speaking interpreter, another technician, and four others who served as lookouts and bodyguards. KGEI picked up and acknowledged the signal of the Voice of Juan de la Cruz. With radio broadcasting equipment being relatively portable, the station was constantly on the move within Manila and its suburbs to avoid detection. Like the Voice of Freedom, it signed on with the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; which Malonzo himself sang and recorded with guitar accompaniment by his technician Tony San Juan on a rigged recorder. On 4 Jul 1942, he married Violet Brown. Six days later, the Japanese cornered them and their staff and locked them up in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>. Brown was released and carried on the broadcast until Sep 1942 with some members of the group who eluded arrest. Refusing to cooperate with the Japanese, Malonzo and eight of his men were executed after four months of incarceration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"japanese\" name=\"japanese\"></a>Japanese Propaganda Radio</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese came to conquer not only the land and its resources but also the hearts and minds of Filipinos. It had a propaganda corps, which included broadcasters. It was called the Sendenhan&mdash;literally, propaganda corps&mdash;in the first few months of the occupation. It was later renamed Hodobu&mdash;the Department of Information&mdash;to avoid the negative connotation of the name Sendenhan. As soon as they entered Manila on 2 Jan 1942, the broadcast engineers among the corps searched for radio equipment to be able to begin radio propaganda, having found the facilities of KZRH, KZRM, KZRF, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>, and KZND useless. They salvaged an antenna at a transmitting station in a Manila suburb (present-day Cubao, Quezon City), a few pieces of KZRH equipment hidden in the basement of the Heacock Building on Escolta Ave where the station&rsquo;s studios were located, and transmitting equipment found concealed at the Jai Alai Building on Taft Ave, which was being set up by an underground resistance group to communicate with Corregidor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In less than two weeks, the Japanese broadcasters were on the air, on 14 Jan 1942, from the old KZRH studio, keeping its call letters. KZRH and the newspaper dailies <b><i>Tribune</i></b> and <b><i>Taliba</i></b>, which the Hodobu also took over, became the principal propaganda outlets of the invaders. Initially broadcasting for five hours daily from 7:00 pm until midnight, the Japanese-controlled KZRH began broadcasting with announcements from the Japanese Military Administration (JMA), the news in Nihongo (Japanese language) and English, and music. In the beginning, the music played on the air was American light classical music, records of which were found at the KZRH studio. There were no recordings of Japanese music yet, and only later would live Japanese songs and music be heard on the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Programming soon expanded to several more hours a day. As early as May 1942, the station signed on at 7:55 am and signed off at 11:00 pm. A year later, in Apr 1943, airtime increased further and the station began to sign on at 6:55 am and sign off at 11:15 pm. The programs were broadcast mostly in Tagalog but also in Nihongo, Spanish, English, Ilonggo, and Cebuano. Newscasts in English, Tagalog, and Spanish of 15 minutes each were aired three times a day. Eventually, the news was also regularly read in Nihongo. Documentaries on Japanese history and culture were frequently heard. Church services, lectures aimed at women and children, and literary readings in Japanese were allotted airtime, as well as Tagalog comedy skits. K. Hinomizu and K. Okazaki gave lessons on the Nihongo language as a regular part of the programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino music, as well as Western classical music, was played on the air. Since Japan did not have recorded music yet, Japanese songs and music were performed live with the guidance of music sheets. A Japanese pianist, Filipino pianist Jose V. Carreon, and Filipino musicians and singers provided the live music. Fidela Magpayo, better known to postwar radio fans as Tiya Dely, became the most popular radio singer during the period. She sang mostly Filipino songs but she and Polish-Filipina Nellie Bialovlovsky, known professionally as Ginger, also sang Japanese songs repeatedly on the air, which their Japanese managers thought was the best way to teach the Filipinos Japanese music. Somewhat emulating the practice prior to the war, Carreon, Magpayo, and Ginger, who were all in radio before the war, made personal appearances in the rural areas near Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lessons in Nihongo as well as Tagalog were also on the air, which increased as the war progressed. In the early part of 1942, the Nihongo lessons were given by a Professor Kusama. Later, other Japanese professors gave the lessons as a regular part of the programming, including Professor Matsukawa, K. Hinomizu, and K. Okazaki. Lessons on the Tagalog language were also on the air, given by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5689\"><strong>Lope K. Santos</strong></a></strong>, who later would be recognized as the &ldquo;Ama ng Balarila&rdquo; (Father of the Pilipino Grammar and Tagalog Orthography). In conjunction with the language lessons, a Linggo ng Nihongo, or Japanese Language Week, was celebrated every last week of August while there was a Linggo ng Pilipino, or Pilipino Language Week, every last week of December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Rajio Taiso</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>A program that today would sound odd was <b><i>Rajio Taiso</i></b>, with which the station signed on at 7:55 am beginning not later than Oct 1942. It was a 15-minute calisthenics program called <b><i>Rajio Taiso</i></b>, which government employees and schoolchildren were required to tune in to so they could follow the exercise commands of the odd unseen instructor. The program was repeated at noon. Some historians link the physical exercise program to the station&rsquo;s objective: the &ldquo;Japanization&rdquo; of Filipinos, best expressed through obedience to an invisible authority, as in the way the Japanese revered their emperor, who, until then, was not seen in public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Filipino Broadcasters</b>. Most of the broadcast staff of the Japanese-controlled radio station were Filipinos, from the announcers and performers to the engineers and technicians, recruited by the Japanese, some forcibly. While some accepted the job for practical considerations, a few worked in the station to gain access to information that they passed on to various resistance groups. The radio staff enjoyed some special privileges such as rations of rice and sugar, which were among the commodities that were in short supply during the occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the announcing staff were, ironically, KZND station manager Vero Perfecto and Voice of Freedom news writer, commentator, and announcer Leon Ma. Guerrero III. Following the surrender of Corregidor, Guerrero was imprisoned at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a> internment camp. Upon his release, JMA-appointed chairman of the Executive Commission Jorge Vargas took Guerrero to write speeches, messages, and special articles. The Executive Commission was the Japanese-controlled Philippine government in the first 20 months of the occupation. The Hodobu then put Guerrero in KZRH (later PIAM) as a news commentator where he used the name Bienvenido Javier while he also used his prewar pseudonym Ignacio Javier. In the meantime, the Japanese took Norman Reyes to Japan to work at the Japanese propaganda radio in Tokyo where he was made the announcer on <b><i>The Zero Hour</i></b>, a program of American music and anti-American propaganda news intended for American soldiers in the South Pacific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the other Filipino broadcasters became well-known and accomplished writers and artists after the war, such as Clodualdo del Mundo, who became a novelist, playwright, essayist, short story writer, journalist, screenwriter, teacher, critic, and radio soap opera writer; Alfredo Saulo, who became a historian and rebel leader and later wrote the book <b><i>Communism in the Philippines: An Introduction</i></b>, 1990; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3686\"><strong>Hernando Ocampo</strong></a>, who was a fictionist, playwright, editor, and later National Artist for visual arts; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5481\"><strong>I. V. Mallari</strong></a>, essayist and literary and art critic; and Manuel Viray, who became a poet in English. Many others were already in radio before the war, such as Harry Johnson, Simoun Almario, Gavino Tabu&ntilde;ar Jr, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>, Amado Pe, Zacarias Nuguid, Gonzalo Rialp, Marcelo Victoriano, Mauricio Santos, Manuel Esposo, Bienvenido Potenciano, Monserrat Iglesias, Georgina Escamilla, Alma Corro, Yay Panlilio, Vicente Coloso, Manuel Buenafe, Pablo Hidalgo, Quisling Calderon, Amadeo Dacanay, Rizalino Castro, Alfredo Cabasal, Angelo Castro, Demy Alejandro Jr, Porfirio Miraflores, Liberato C. Poblador, and Carmelo Mendoza. Myrtle Listen was the local equivalent of Tokyo Rose, the name given by Allied troops to a number of female radio voices emanating from Tokyo who played popular American music, interspersed with intriguing low-voiced sexy talk and skillfully crafted propaganda aimed at confusing and demoralizing the American soldier. Listen, an American mestiza, imitated Rose&rsquo;s style and was called Manila Myrtle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>PIAM</b>. On 14 Oct 1943, the Japanese declared &ldquo;independence&rdquo; for the Philippines. On the same day, the call letters of KZRH, which until then bore the American call letters KZ, were changed to PIAM, for Philippine Islands A Manila. Relay stations were established outside the capital: the PIBC, for Philippine Islands B Cebu; the PICD, for Philippine Islands C Davao; and the PIDI, for Philippine Islands D Iloilo. The relay stations, apart from carrying PIAM programs emanating from Manila, may have also aired their own programs in Cebuano and Ilonggo. Other relay stations were erected in Naga, Baguio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, Cotabato, and Legaspi. A relay station was planned for Tuguegarao but did not push through. PIAM also aired on shortwave with the call letters PIRN, probably for Philippine Islands Radio Nippon, for the benefit of listeners outside the Philippines (Ampil 1986; BMC-KBP, n.d.; <b><i>Yearbook of the NHK</i></b> 1998; Enriquez 2013; Records of the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service, RG 262).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More Tagalog and Japanese music then replaced American music. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a>, deemed by the Japanese as one of the symbols of the degenerate American culture, was completely suppressed. In May 1943, the Philippine Symphony Orchestra was formed, and their performances of classical music were put on the air. As the war progressed, lessons in Nihongo as well as Filipino languages increased and more newscasts and talk programs urging people to produce food and other necessities went on the air. In stark contrast to radio programs before the war, incessant speeches and exhortations by Japanese officials and Japanese-appointed officials of the Filipino government were aired, including those of Japanese-installed president Jose P. Laurel. Laurel urged the USAFFE members who were still in the resistance &ldquo;to offer themselves for registration&rdquo; and called upon the United States on the air to recognize Philippine Independence. On 8 Dec 1943, the second anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, Laurel delivered a speech over PIAM in celebration of Greater East Asia Day, extolling the virtues of the Japanese and its ideology. The Japanese attempted to forge an alliance of Asian countries, including the Philippines, called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the center and top of this alliance was Japan. On 23 Sep 1944, Laurel went on the air to declare war against the United States and Great Britain (Records of the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service, RG 262; People&rsquo;s Court Records, Case No. 1507).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other officials went on radio to urge the Filipino youth to collaborate with the Japanese-installed government and to invite those who were still waiting for the return of the Americans to give up that hope and begin cooperating with the new republic, such as Quintin Paredes, who was public works and communications commissioner. Senator Vicente Madrigal, who was one of the drafters and signatories of the Philippine Constitution during the occupation, lauded Japan on radio. Representative Benigno S. Aquino, also a drafter and signatory of the said constitution and Speaker of the wartime National Assembly as well as director general of the Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas or Kalibapi, a Japanese-style neighborhood association, called America treacherous in a talk on PIAM and tagged the day the Americans occupied the Philippines, 13 Aug 1898, a day of national humiliation. Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Emilio Abello spoke on the role of the Philippines in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Assistant commissioner of the Department of Education, Health and Public Welfare <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5546\"><strong>Camilo Osias</strong></a> went on overseas broadcast to the United States about the policies of the &ldquo;newly independent&rdquo; Philippines (<b><i>Tribune</i></b> 1942; People&rsquo;s Court Records, Case No. 3530; Jose L. Llanes Guerilla Papers; People&rsquo;s Court Records, File No. 53-453; People&rsquo;s Court Records, Case No. 3528).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the siege of Bataan and Corregidor, Emilio Aguinaldo, leader of the Philippine Revolution against Spain who was captured and marginalized by the Americans, urged MacArthur to surrender in view of what he termed the obvious superiority of Japanese arms. Vargas delivered many speeches on radio while his wife Marina and daughter Nena were also made to air a birthday greeting to Aurora Quezon in the United States and to appeal to her to return to the Philippines. American prisoners of war and American civilians interned in camps in the Philippines were also put on the air to read approved scripts justifying Japanese occupation of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Radio Reconditioning</b>. Winning over the Filipinos to the Japanese side through broadcasting involved not only managing program content but, the Japanese found out, also controlling listening. As early as Feb 1942, the JMA realized that without the prewar commercial stations and with only the Japanese-controlled KZRH on the air, Filipinos turned to shortwave broadcasts from the United States, Britain, and Australia. The Japanese immediately banned aerials (antennae). Then they soon realized that most of the radios in the country were of the latest technology that did not require external antennas to receive overseas broadcasts. Six months later the Hodobu decided on another strategy to restrict radio listening. On 13 Aug 1942, KZRH announced that radio receiving sets must be registered with the Customs Office. On 6 Jan 1943, the JMA ordered the &ldquo;reconditioning&rdquo; of all shortwave receivers, except those permitted by the Japanese army. &ldquo;Reconditioning&rdquo; meant that sets would be converted or refit so that their shortwave tuners could receive only broadcasts made by the Japanese military or those originating from Japan (Hartendorp 1967; Records of the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service, RG 262).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The measure was supposed to protect the Filipinos from &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; foreign influences (Terami-Wada 1984). The Japanese called enemy broadcasts deadlier than enemy bombs from which Filipinos had to be shielded. On 17 Jan 1943, the wartime newspaper <b><i>Tribune</i></b> justified Japanese control of radio, saying that the ruling was necessary to save the Filipinos from the pernicious influence of hostile propaganda and mental sabotage via radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The deadline to submit radio sets for reconditioning was extended to 30 Jun 1943, and again to 31 Oct 1943 for radio sets outside Manila. Realizing the persistence of many Filipinos to listen to unauthorized shortwave broadcasts, defiance of the order became punishable by torture or death. Nevertheless, less than half of the estimated 80,000 sets, which another estimate put at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>,000, were registered. Many that were registered were restored, sometimes in better condition, to receive shortwave signals, often by the Filipinos who constituted the corps of technicians tasked with the reconditioning of the radio sets. Some of them surreptitiously sold expensive removable converters that owners hid at inspection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The only officially permitted radio signals came from PIAM, which the people listened to as it paid to know the enemy propaganda, but at the same time they maligned. PIAM, to some, stood for &ldquo;<i>Putang Ina Ang Maniwala!</i>,&rdquo; which roughly translates to &ldquo;He who believes [the radio propaganda] is a son of a bitch!&rdquo; (Malay 1984; Ampil 1986).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Subversions and Resistances</b>. KGEI was a critical source of news from the United States. Apart from its American broadcasters, at least nine Filipinos were in its staff, including Gregorio San Diego, Jaime V. Catuira, Eddie Ramos, Paciano B. Sanchez, Florencio Marquez, and Marcelino Tanjuatco, whose programs were intended specifically for the Filipino audience. They translated and read the news in English to Tagalog, Ibanag, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Pampango, Bicol, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a>, Cebuano, and Moro. Tagalog phonograph recordings as well as American music were played on the air for the benefit of the Filipinos caught in the war across the Pacific Ocean. Particularly popular was the program of Carmen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a>, who was KGEI&rsquo;s answer to NHK&rsquo;s Tokyo Rose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guerrilla groups in the rural areas as well as individuals in the cities who had access to shortwave radio clandestinely transcribed KGEI broadcasts for underground circulation. Those who were found out by the Japanese and their Filipino agents paid with their lives, or suffered torture. Among them were Harris and Cheng, who delivered KGEI transcripts to Silen, who was interned at the Santo Tomas Internment Camp, where thousands of Americans and a few other foreigners were imprisoned by the Japanese. Harris was caught and executed but Cheng escaped and subsequently survived the war. Inside the internment camps for prisoners of war and civilians, in spite of the impossible conditions, news about the war circulated either through radio transcripts smuggled in by visiting family and friends or by operating clandestine receivers, which received shortwave signals from Radio Chungking, BBC, and KGEI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many prewar broadcasters avoided recruitment by PIAM, among them Koko Trinidad who argued that he was already involved in cultural work on another front. Trinidad and Lamberto Avellana organized the Philippine Artists League and staged shows at the Avenue, Lyric, and Strand Theaters, marking the evolution of bodabil into the stage show, in the absence of American-sounding radio and Hollywood movies. Trinidad, Avellana, and a few others in the league acted as couriers for guerrillas through a nipa shed that was the drop-off and pickup points of coded messages. Briefly within the Japanese-controlled KZRH was a spy, Yay Panlilio, a Filipino-American, who broadcast coded messages aimed at Corregidor. Secretly warned by Hernando Ocampo that she had been found out, she calmly walked out of the station one day and joined the guerrilla group Marking&rsquo;s Guerillas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Inside Malaca&ntilde;an Palace itself was a shortwave radio receiver secretly operated by Philippine Constabulary captain Angelo Frago, who supplied Laurel with Allied radio dispatches from Oct 1943 until late 1944, allowing Laurel to form a balanced picture of the war developments. Laurel discreetly recruited Frago and his men who smuggled the radio parts piece by piece into the palace, which they assembled and operated in a photographic darkroom, suspected but never found by the Japanese. Aware of the sentiments of many Filipinos, Laurel refused to comply with the JMA order to address the country by radio to announce the formation of a government-in-exile in Tokyo as he was evacuated by the Japanese Supreme War Council, together with his cabinet, toward the end of 1944.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"voice\" name=\"voice\"></a>The Voice of Freedom Returns</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From Australia, MacArthur launched a campaign to take the Philippines back from the Japanese. Upon landing on Palo Beach, Leyte, on 20 Oct 1944, he went on the air and announced, &ldquo;This is the Voice of Freedom. General MacArthur speaking. People of the Philippines, I have returned.&rdquo; Thousands of concealed radio sets were tuned in. The new Voice of Freedom was the naval radio station VLC-6, one of the stations Filipino guerrillas monitored on shortwave while it was in the high seas, now a land station called WVLC, with the American call letter W assigned to ship stations at the time. With its powerful 50-kilowatt transmitter, WVLC flooded the air with the speeches of MacArthur, Philippine Commonwealth president Sergio Osme&ntilde;a, who assumed the presidency upon Quezon&rsquo;s death in the United States, and Carlos P. Romulo, now a general, with CBS war correspondent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> J. Dunn as announcer. Osme&ntilde;a announced US president Roosevelt&rsquo;s promise that full independence would be granted the Philippines as soon as the Japanese were driven out. The broadcast emanated from equipment set up on a weapons carrier parked on the beach of Palo, which was shortly moved to a Tacloban schoolhouse where the Signal Corps constructed a makeshift studio. From there the station reported on the war that was about to end and aired American music and other shows sorely missed by Filipinos (DeLay 1951; Dunn 1988; <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine</i> </b>1946; Voice of Freedom 1944; Trinidad 1953).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon after MacArthur&rsquo;s &ldquo;I have returned&rdquo; broadcast, PIAM&rsquo;s Filipino staff dwindled. Programming hours were reduced. The station began signing on as late as 11:00 am and signing off as early as 10:00 pm. On 30 Dec 1944, PIAM ceased broadcast in Manila. The Japanese evacuated Laurel and his cabinet to Baguio City, then to Japan, while the Americans reclaimed the country in the bloody and deadly battles that followed (Magpayo 2000; <b><i>Tribune</i> </b>1942-44; Sato 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Five months after MacArthur&rsquo;s broadcast, the WVLC studio was moved to Manila, broadcasting beginning 26 Mar 1945 on shortwave from a special radio ship named Apache, which was moored in the Pasig River near the shattered Jones Bridge beside the walls of Intramuros. MacArthur directly supervised its operation until it was sent to Japan two months later with the American invasion forces. In the meantime, another US army station, WVTM, which had been transmitting from Polo, Bulacan, was moved to Manila and broadcast from the 6th floor of the scarred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\"><strong>Insular Life Building</strong></a> on Plaza Cervantes, where RCA communications operated before the war. By this time, several other American military broadcast stations were operating. The US Armed Forces Radio Service, established in 1942 in the midst of war, constructed 10 temporary radio stations throughout the country to signal to Filipinos that the Americans were back by airing familiar American music and other programs. Apart from Manila, the stations were located in Cebu, San Fernando, Puerto Princesa, Agusan, Zamboanga, Tolosa, and Iloilo. Many were roving stations which broadcast from the back of trucks that moved with American troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like WVLC, some of these stations were subsequently sent to Japan. The rest were integrated into one station under the US Department of National Defense Office of War Information with the call letters KZFM, and around the end of World War II in Aug 1945 taken over by the United States Information Service of the US State Department. Transmitting at five kilowatts, it aired news, information, and entertainment programs. KZFM was named after Frederic Marquardt, one of the American newsmen on the prewar <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> and MacArthur&rsquo;s close friend. Marquardt was in MacArthur&rsquo;s party that landed on Leyte the previous year. The first KZFM staff was headed by Bill Sanford and Abigail Jacobs. Jacobs later established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a> radio in Dumaguete. In the production and announcing staff were Koko Trinidad, Johnny Arville, Jess Fernandez, Gene Ildefonso, Mon Ylanan, and Eddie Avelino. Gabby Tabu&ntilde;ar and Simoun Almario, who survived their stint at the Japanese-controlled KZRH/PIAM, also joined the staff. Gumsy Alba, another prewar radio announcer, emerged from the hills as a guerrilla and joined the KZFM staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the war over, the US Congress passed legislation empowering Osme&ntilde;a to grant temporary operating permits to private citizens and groups who wanted to go into the radio business to encourage the revival of commercial radio broadcasting. Two commercial stations were almost immediately granted permits: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4895\"><strong>Manila Broadcasting </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (MBC)</strong>, which bought KZRH from H. E. Heacock Co, and the Philippine Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), which was the new name of the old Far East Broadcasting Corporation, owner of the prewar KZRM and KZRF. The following year, on the occasion of the declaration of Philippine Independence from the United States and the inauguration of Manuel Roxas as president on 4 Jul 1946, MBC&rsquo;s KZRH and PBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4872\"><strong>KZPI</strong></a> went on the air and resumed commercial broadcasting in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There was profound resistance to the Japanese-controlled radio, but it should be noted that the cultural policy of the Japanese, intentionally or not, contributed to the flowering of Filipino languages, particularly Tagalog. The Japanese plan was to make Nihongo the lingua franca in the country, and indeed Japanese lessons were on the air, in the newspapers, and at school. However, Nihongo and Tagalog were proclaimed official languages not only because Tagalog was necessary to facilitate translation from Nihongo but also because it appealed to the Filipino sense of nationalism. Historians have described it as a Japanese propaganda strategy that benefited the local culture. Before the war, English was the principal language on radio, even if Tagalog and other Filipino languages began to be heard in many programs in the 1930s. During the war, Tagalog surpassed English on radio. After the war, while English returned as the dominant broadcast language in the beginning, those who invested in the radio industry that was growing tremendously at this time, realized that the Filipino audience expected broadcasting that spoke their tongue, such that stations with all-Tagalog programming began to go on the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcasting during the war evolved from an almost purely entertainment medium to that which is a source of news and information. News programs gained prominence during the war not only on Japanese controlled radio but on banned shortwave stations. There was hunger for credible news that was so critical for Filipinos and for the foreigners in the country as well, to know about the progress of the war in the Philippines and around the world. News perceived as credible gave them a vision of when, not if, liberation from the Japanese stranglehold was to take place. The effect of this persisted after the war. Whereas news programs were a minor part of programming during the American period, they became a critical component of radio&rsquo;s program mix after the war. Filipino broadcasters realized that there was an audience for news and news commentary. A few years after the war, the all-news radio format began to appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The beginning of the new era of broadcasting in the Philippines was marked by several other changes: KZFM became the first of what would become a nationwide network of government broadcast stations. Other networks followed, including religious stations. There were new call letters for Philippine radio stations as a result of the International Radio Conference of the International Telecommunications Union in the United States. Audience size swelled, and a local music recording industry was born. A notable change in programming was more time devoted to news. But entertainment and advertising were back with a vengeance, especially with the new genre called soap opera. Soon, an era that some called the golden age of radio in the Philippines began, later to be followed by a new broadcast medium that mesmerized the Filipinos&mdash;television.<em><strong>Written by Elizabeth L.

The Philippines was not spared by this war. While Germany controlled much of continental Europe beginning in 1939, Japan, already at war with China, advanced on Asia and the Pacific. Within hours of bombing Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, USA, on 7 Dec 1941 (8 Dec in the Philippines), Japan began its attack on the Philippines.

However, Filipinos despised the heavy-handed method by which the Japanese imposed its doctrine and vilified the United States. The Japanese seemed to have miscalculated the depth with which American colonial leanings had taken root in the psyche of many Filipinos. Radio under the Japanese deprived Filipinos of the vibrant music and the lively talk of American-style programming, and imposed on them what was perceived as overt propaganda through endless lectures, political speeches, and Japanese marches."

In the late 1930s, however, with war looming on the horizon, news programs on all radio stations increased in length and frequency. This was when shortwave broadcasting, with its ability to transmit signals across continents, had become an indispensable propaganda device used by both the Allies and the Axis powers in fighting a global war.

About a week after the surrender of Corregidor silenced the Voice of Freedom in early May 1942, the Voice of Juan de la Cruz went on the air. It was the voice of 18-year-old Carlos Malonzo. Malonzo picked up information from the shortwave broadcast of Chungking radio in China, which he echoed with his own comments on the air. Chungking (also spelled Chongqing), in Southwest China, was at the time under the control of Generalissimo Chiang-Kai-shek, who was allied with the Americans. Malonzo thought Chungking radio, part of which broadcast was presumably in English, was more outspoken against Japan and the Axis powers and more optimistic in its claims than either the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) or KGEI&#x2014;a shortwave station in San Francisco, California, under US military control during the war. Malonzo mocked and insulted the Japanese using coarse language. When the Japanese offered a reward of 2,500 pesos for information leading to his capture, he retorted and offered one peso for every Sakdal (member of a supposedly pro-Japanese organization), five pesos for every Filipino official collaborating with the Japanese, &#x201C;and for that SOB [Japanese Military Commander] General Homma, P7.50&#x201D; (Hartendorp 1967)."

However, witnessing a Japanese sentry slap an elderly Filipino woman for failing to bow in obeisance infuriated him. He then gathered his friends and together they stole 50,000 pesos worth of goods from Japanese supply warehouses and sold the items in the black market to finance the launching and operation of the station. He hired radio technician Tony San Juan to assemble radio parts and equipment, scriptwriter Oscar Arellano, a Japanese-speaking interpreter, another technician, and four others who served as lookouts and bodyguards. KGEI picked up and acknowledged the signal of the Voice of Juan de la Cruz. With radio broadcasting equipment being relatively portable, the station was constantly on the move within Manila and its suburbs to avoid detection. Like the Voice of Freedom, it signed on with the &#x201C;Star-Spangled Banner,&#x201D; which Malonzo himself sang and recorded with guitar accompaniment by his technician Tony San Juan on a rigged recorder. On 4 Jul 1942, he married Violet Brown. Six days later, the Japanese cornered them and their staff and locked them up in <a href=\"/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>. Brown was released and carried on the broadcast until Sep 1942 with some members of the group who eluded arrest. Refusing to cooperate with the Japanese, Malonzo and eight of his men were executed after four months of incarceration."

However, Nihongo and Tagalog were proclaimed official languages not only because Tagalog was necessary to facilitate translation from Nihongo but also because it appealed to the Filipino sense of nationalism. Historians have described it as a Japanese propaganda strategy that benefited the local culture. Before the war, English was the principal language on radio, even if Tagalog and other Filipino languages began to be heard in many programs in the 1930s. During the war, Tagalog surpassed English on radio.

Audience size swelled, and a local music recording industry was born. A notable change in programming was more time devoted to news.

American music and talk as well as the new format of soap opera, fueled by advertising, filled the air. News and news commentary increased in significance as Filipinos continued to hunger for credible news that was in short supply during the war. However, the impact of the Japanese cultural policy left traces, which were evident on many cultural fronts, including radio. With both Nihongo and Tagalog proclaimed as official languages of the country, Tagalog surpassed English as the language of broadcasting during the war, even as daily on-air lessons on Nihongo were intended to supplant English. While English returned as the dominant language of broadcasting after World War II, Tagalog maintained a clear and growing presence. Other Filipino languages also flourished on the air as new radio stations began to operate outside Manila, mindful of the audience expecting broadcasters to speak their tongue. This trend extended to music played on radio and later on television as the Philippine recording industry was born and began to press records of local talent singing traditional Filipino songs and more recent local compositions as well as covers of foreign songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television was born just eight years into the new Republic, in 1953. It was the second to air in Asia, only eight months behind the first, the NHK in Japan. As it was before the war, Americans as well as Filipinos invested in the rising broadcast industry, until the 1973 constitution restricted ownership of all media businesses to Filipinos. But there was a noticeable increase in the number of Filipinos staking their claim on the operation of radio and television. Not only was it profitable in the case of commercial stations; it was believed powerful not only in selling products but also in shaping tastes, captivating audiences, and molding consciousness that won elections and consolidated political power. In the postwar years, politics and economics became even more intensely intertwined with broadcasting as it became not only a profitable investment but also an arena of political power matches.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other shifts unfolded after the war. The call letters of broadcast stations changed soon after the inauguration of the Third Philippine Republic in 1946, which followed the end of World War II in 1945. Audiences multiplied as the number of radio stations grew phenomenally, including noncommercial stations operated by government and religious organizations. By the 1950s, the era called &ldquo;golden years of radio&rdquo; was underway, which lasted until the unspeakable era of martial law began in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"early\" name=\"early\"></a>Early Postwar Radio Broadcasts</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As expected, the American military forces under Gen Douglas MacArthur were the first to operate several radio facilities in the Philippines toward the end of World War II following the silence of the Japanese-controlled PIAM at the close of 1944. MacArthur sent several of the transmitters to Japan in early 1945 with the US military takeover forces and integrated the remaining few into one station in Manila with the call letters KZFM. It was first managed by the US Department of National Defense Office of War Information, then turned over to the newly organized United States Information Service (USIS) under the US State Department. To encourage the revival of commercial broadcasting, the US Congress passed a law empowering Sergio Osme&ntilde;a, who became Philippine Commonwealth president upon the death of Manuel Quezon in the United States while awaiting the end of World War II, to grant temporary radio operating permits to private citizens and groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Businessmen brothers Joaquin Miguel Elizalde and Manuel Elizalde were the first to take the incentive in early 1946. They purchased Samuel Gaches&rsquo;s H. E. Heacock Co, which owned the KZRH of the American period, and called their new enterprise the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4895\"><strong>Manila Broadcasting </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (MBC)</strong>. With the help of prewar KZRH station manager Bertrand Silen, the Elizaldes imported broadcast equipment from the United States and set up its studios at the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\"><strong>Insular Life Building</strong></a> along Plaza Cervantes in Binondo, a few meters from the west end of Escolta, where KZRH used to be. Meanwhile, another station, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4872\"><strong>KZPI</strong></a> (PI for Philippine Islands), also acquired a permit to go on test broadcast in early 1946. It was operated by the Philippine Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), the new name of the prewar Far East Broadcasting Corporation (FEBC), which used to run KZRM and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>KZRF</strong></a>. J. Amado Araneta, who owned FEBC before the war, took on new partners&mdash;Leo Prieto, Jose Avelino, Jack Preysler, and Andres Soriano&mdash;and formed PBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 4 Jul 1946, the three stations, KZFM, KZRH, and KZPI, covered live the declaration of Philippine Independence and the investiture of Manuel Roxas as the first president of the Third Republic of the Philippines and his vice president, Elpidio Quirino. It also marked the end of the Commonwealth government. Three and a half months later, on 20 Oct 1946, the second anniversary of MacArthur&rsquo;s landing on Leyte, the USIS turned over KZFM to the new Philippine government&rsquo;s Department of Foreign Affairs, the secretary of which was Quirino. In August of the following year, Roxas moved the station to the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS), which he created as a unit under the Office of the President. PBS then grew into a nationwide network of government broadcast stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cebu was again the site of the first radio stations outside Manila. On 21 Sep 1947, KZRC, operated by MBC affiliate Cebu Broadcasting Company (CBC), went on the air. CBC bought the station from Harry Fenton, who took over the station from the H. E. Heacock Co after the war. It is not clear, however, how the takeover took place. The following year, 1948, PBC inaugurated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4866\"><strong>KZBU</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon after putting KZRH on the air, MBC acquired a franchise for another station, KZMB. PBC, on the other hand, put up KZOK in addition to KZPI. Not long after the inaugural broadcast of KZOK, the Elizaldes acquired PBC, which had KZPI and KZOK in Manila, and KZBU in Cebu. Araneta bowed out of broadcasting while the Elizaldes quickly became the most powerful broadcast operators from the late 1940s until television came in 1953. Notably, there was no law that regulated and limited the number of broadcast stations that any one individual, family, or company could own, and this is true until today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the meantime, Isaac Beck revived <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a> but it folded up after just a few months. Thus, the ownership of radio broadcasting had totally shifted before the decade of the 1940s was over.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>New Call Letters</b>. A change in call letters took effect on 1 Jan 1949 following a conference of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Atlantic City in New Jersey, USA in 1947, where the fledgling Republic applied for a new set of call letters for its radio stations&mdash;PI for Philippine Islands in lieu of the American KZ. Citing bureaucratic problems, the ITU denied the request and gave the Philippines the letter series from DUA to DZZ. The entire D series was originally held by Germany (for Deutschland, which is German for Germany), but the ITU took a restrictive stance against it for Nazi Germany&rsquo;s misuse of radio during the war. Thus, KZFM became DZFM, KZRH became DZRH, and so on. Later the Philippine government assigned secondary letters based on location&mdash;DZ for stations based in Luzon, DY in the Visayas, and DX in Mindanao. DW was later given to FM stations in Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the new Republic came the restoration of many prewar laws, including Act 3846, or the Radio Control Act of 1931, which regulated radio stations and radio communications in the Philippines. Since television involves radio, this law also applied to television stations. Moreover, the law required radio stations to obtain a legislative franchise as a prerequisite to operation, thus effectively shifting the power to grant broadcast franchises from the Office of the President back to the legislature. It should be noted that the law permitted ownership of media businesses not only by Filipinos but also Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"growth\" name=\"growth\"></a>The Growth of the Broadcast Industry</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wealthy families other than the Elizaldes, like the Lopezes, the Roceses, and the Sorianos, also saw a future in broadcasting after the war and eventually followed suit. However, the motive for profit was often coupled with the imperative to acquire or maintain political power through the media, which in turn protected the business interests of those who invested in media. This symbiosis led to a trend that became more transparent with the entry of television in the early 1950s. As the number of radio stations multiplied and audience numbers rose, the idea of television appeared more promising, which led to several radio stations expanding into radio-television networks. Furthermore, broadcast operations were often integrated with newspaper publishing, so newspapers and broadcasting mutually promoted and strengthened each other as well as other investments of their owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early postwar stations, like KZRH and KZPI, were mostly commercial stations. Among the first of these was DXCC in Cagayan de Oro City in Mindanao. In 1948, the brothers Henry and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4779\"><strong>Reuben Canoy</strong></a> conducted test broadcasts, which provided the blueprint of the future Radio Mindanao Network that later grew into a nationwide network that at one time involved television. Station DXCC, however, did not receive a franchise from Congress until 1952. Meanwhile, in 1949, the University of Mindanao Broadcasting Network put up radio station DXMV in Cotabato City, making it the first radio station with an orientation toward audiences living in Muslim-dominated areas in Mindanao to officially go on the air. In 1963, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\"><strong>Ramon Jacinto</strong></a>, a young music enthusiast, put up radio station DZRJ under the family-owned Rajah Broadcasting Network (RBN). This AM-band station specialized in rock and roll music. RBN still operates in the country today with the controlling interest held by Ramon Jacinto Holdings Inc. It was also in 1963 when Abelardo Yabut Sr, a businessman from Mindanao, founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4912\"><strong>Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC)</strong></a>. The enterprise initially consisted of radio station DXYZ in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> City and radio station DZAM in Manila, which then grew into a nationwide network of radio stations. In the same year, the Mareco Broadcasting Network owned by the Manila Record Company began its operations. Local music found a home in this station. In 1968, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4827\"><strong>Eagle Broadcasting Corporation (EBC)</strong></a> began its broadcasts on DZEC. Members of the Iglesia ni Cristo religious group comprised the stockholders of EBC, which operated DZEC as a commercial station.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of noncommercial operations, like KZFM, went into broadcasting for reasons other than profit. In 1948, a group of Protestant evangelists established radio station KZAS, later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4820\"><strong>DZAS</strong></a>, under the Far Eastern Broadcasting Company (FEBC), the first radio station in the country with a religious type of programming. The station was renamed DZFE, which later became an FM station, allowing FEBC to apply for a new franchise for DZAS on AM. The evangelists behind FEBC, not to be confused with the prewar Far East Broadcasting Corporation, broadcast in China beginning in 1945, but the civil war between nationalist and communist forces forced it to move its operations elsewhere. The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines did not follow suit in using radio for evangelization until 1969 when it began operations of DWRV Radio Veritas, which had the strongest radio transmitter in Southeast Asia prior to the imposition of martial law in the Philippines in Sep 1972. While some universities operated commercial radio, the University of the Philippines (UP) in Diliman, Quezon City, started noncommercial shortwave radio experiments from its College of Engineering building under the call letters <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4826\"><strong>DZUP</strong></a> in 1958. When the station ran out of funds the following year, the UP Alumni Association raised funds to help keep the radio station operating. Later the University moved its studio to the College of Arts and Sciences and began broadcasting on the AM band. In 1964, the University of the Philippines in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, established DZLB to provide educational programs to the rural communities surrounding the campus. In 1965, notwithstanding DZFM and the growing network of PBS stations around the country, the government&rsquo;s National Media Production Center (NMPC) under the Office of the President began operating DZRP, the Voice of the Philippines (VOP), on both the AM and shortwave bands. It was the local counterpart of the Voice of America. NMPC&rsquo;s head office was located along Santa Potenciana St in Intramuros, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1968, local and foreign manufacturers of phonographs were promoting the stereo&mdash;a large electronic appliance that had a phonograph, a radio component designed to receive both AM and FM radio transmissions, and two separate speakers, which made stereophonic listening possible. It allowed the listener to adjust bass and treble through the twist of a knob. The stereo also doubled as a piece of decorative furniture because of its polished wooden exterior. Mass production of various models made the stereo affordable. National and Radiowealth were the leading stereo brands at that time. The popularity of the stereo inevitably created an audience for FM radio transmissions, which was tried in the 1950s but did not succeed due to the absence of FM-capable radio sets. This time, broadcast companies saw an opportunity and made plans for going on the air via the FM band. The first to do so was DZFX of the Makati Broadcasting Network, which went on the air in 1968. The first successful commercial FM station in the country broadcast mood music, film soundtracks, and period pieces with high-fidelity stereophonic sound. Its studio and transmitter were located at the top of the new Insular Life Building along Ayala Ave in Makati, which was then a municipality of Rizal Province.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From five radio stations before World War II, the number grew to 33, 10 years after the end of the war. By 1968, sources put the number at more than 200, and 280 just before martial law was declared in 1972. It was an indication of the burgeoning audience, driven partly by the availability of a new radio technology&mdash;the transistor&mdash;beginning around the end of the 1950s. The new radio sets were portable and could be operated on small batteries, a stark contrast to the older radio appliance that was heavy and bulky and that required connection to an electrical outlet. Moreover, the sets, imported from the United States and Japan, were designed to receive FM transmissions. When the local manufacture of portable transistor radio receiver sets and radio-phonographs, such as those made by Avegon, brought the price of the sets down, the audience size grew exponentially. However, while radio remained the most popular mass medium of the time, television began to captivate audiences before the decade of the 1950s was over. The story of its growth cannot be divorced from the political motivations of its pioneers in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>BEC and ABS</b>. On 13 Jun 1946, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4883\"><strong>James Lindenberg</strong></a>, an American entrepreneur who operated in Manila, established the Bolinao Electronics Corporation, a company that manufactured radio transmitters and similar electronic devices. The enterprise was named after Bolinao, a municipality in Pangasinan and the native town of Lindenberg&rsquo;s Filipino wife. Four years later, on 14 Jun 1950, Congress granted Lindenberg a franchise to operate a radio and a television station. Supplies were difficult to acquire, however, due to strict import controls in force at the time, making it difficult for Lindenberg to operate a television facility immediately. He thus decided to focus on the radio business in the meantime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, a motivation other than entrepreneurship was driving the birth of television in the country. By the middle of 1952, Pres Elpidio Quirino was eyeing reelection in the Nov 1953 polls. His administration was perceived as corrupt by many, especially the youth. Antonio Quirino, a former trial court judge and the younger brother of President Quirino, saw radio and television as means to counter public opinion and improve the chances of the reelection of the president. He had a problem to overcome though&mdash;Congress was not willing to grant him a legislative franchise. Antonio Quirino found a solution through Lindenberg. Before 1952 was over, Antonio Quirino bought 70 percent of BEC from Lindenberg, became a partner of the American businessman, and renamed the venture the Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), with DZAQ as its call letters. Alto is a combination of AL, the first two letters of the nickname of Qurino&rsquo;s wife, Aleli Guzman-Quirino, and TO, the first two letters of Tony, his nickname. The letters A and Q in DZAQ are the initials of Antonio Quirino. With BEC&rsquo;s television franchise, ABS obtained permission to transmit television signals on Channel 3. The original ABS radio studio was located along Florentino Torres St in the Santa Cruz district of Manila, where the newsrooms of the leading newspapers of the period were situated. Its transmitter was located at a corner lot along P. Guevarra St, right across Sitio Alto, a large estate in the district of Little Baguio in San Juan, which was then a municipality of Rizal province. Sitio Alto was where Antonio Quirino and his family resided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To promote DZAQ-TV Channel 3, Quirino needed to import television sets into the Philippines. He obtained a loan of 60,000 pesos from Joe&rsquo;s Radio and Electrical Supply, a leading electronic equipment store along Raon St in the Quiapo district of Manila, which in turn became the first to sell television sets in the country. In 1953, that amount was enough to acquire 120 bulky RCA Victor television sets manufactured by the Radio Corporation of America, then the leading brand in the United States known for its high fidelity or capability of faithfully reproducing sound. By the middle of 1953, Quirino had convinced rich families in Manila and the suburbs to buy RCA Victor television sets, with each one costing at least 1,200 pesos&mdash;the equivalent of several months of an average salary in Manila, with the minimum daily wage then set at four pesos. It was considered a status symbol to own a television set, so wealthy and prominent families bought them. Quirino invested the profit he realized from the sales of the TV sets in the business. To generate a bigger audience, Quirino published and distributed announcements inviting the general public to see the new medium at strategic areas in the commercial districts of Manila in early Oct 1953. From six to ten o&rsquo;clock every evening, selected establishments located at the Quiapo, Santa Cruz, and Binondo districts of Manila opened RCA Victor television sets at their respective display areas for everyone to watch what Quirino called &ldquo;the pre-inaugural telecasts of DZAQ-TV Channel 3.&rdquo; The television sets were located at Poulex Department Store and Kairuz Department Store along the Escolta; Sub Bros and Francis Department Store along Dasmari&ntilde;as St; 15&cent; and Up Department Store and Automatic Electrical Appliances store along Rizal Ave; Joe&rsquo;s Radio and Electrical Supply along Raon St (now Gonzalo Puyat St); and the Saulog Transportation ticket office along Florentino Torres St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Oct 1953, DZAQ began its radio and television broadcasts. While DZAQ Radio followed the typical program format of other radio stations, it was partial to news that put the administration of President Quirino in a favorable light. Meanwhile, the premiere telecast of DZAQ-TV Channel 3 finally took place on 23 Oct 1953, which showcased a garden party at Sitio Alto. Although color television technology was already available in the United States, the DZAQ telecast was in black and white. Fifty-two sponsors of this telecast actually paid for the birth of Philippine television. The event made Antonio Quirino, and not James Lindenberg or Eugenio Lopez Sr as others claim, arguably the father of the Philippine television industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Buoyed by the success of its premiere telecast, ABS continued its broadcasts for four hours, from six to ten o&rsquo;clock every evening. Its programs consisted of feature films borrowed from foreign embassies, and religious and cultural plays organized and directed by James Reuter, the well-known Jesuit priest who began using broadcasting for evangelization in the late 1930s. His best-remembered television production was a 1953 adaptation of the classic piece <b><i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i></b>. From 1953 to 1956, ABS had a monopoly over the Philippine television industry. In the meantime, Filipino industrialist and civic leader Domingo M. Guevara saw a large business potential in the television industry, so in 1955, his Radiowealth company began manufacturing and selling local black-and-white television sets bearing the brand Radiowealth-Motorola. Until then, American brands like RCA Victor, Motorola, Zenith, and Admiral dominated the local market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although Antonio Quirino succeeded in establishing the first television station in the Philippines, he failed to get his brother reelected to the presidency in the Nov 1953 national elections. Despite this setback, Quirino went on with his radio and television enterprise. In 1956, he launched DZYL-FM, the first radio station to broadcast via frequency modulation (FM). However, it did not do well as FM was yet unheard of, with most radio receivers at the time having no provision for the reception of FM transmissions. With competition looming in the horizon in 1955, and with the death of former president Elpidio Quirino in 1956, Antonio Quirino considered retiring from the broadcast industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></b>. In 1955, the prominent Lopez family of Iloilo headed by Eugenio Lopez Sr obtained a legislative franchise to operate a radio and a television station under the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). The family had been in the sugar industry since the 1800s and by this time was already invested in other businesses, including the daily newspaper <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, the second most widely circulated newspaper in the country at the time. On 24 Sep 1956, CBN began its radio broadcasts on CBN-DZXL Radio. Its studio and transmitter were located at the CBN Building along <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a> St in Intramuros, Manila. In the weeks that followed, Eugenio Lopez Sr sent overtures to Antonio Quirino about the possible sale of ABS to the Lopez family. Antonio Quirino was open to the idea because the brother of Eugenio Lopez Sr, Fernando Lopez, was the vice president of Pres Elpidio Quirino from 1949 to 1953, even as the Quirino and Lopez families parted ways in 1953 when Fernando Lopez, instead of running for reelection as vice president under the Liberal Party with Pres Elpidio Quirino, ran for the Senate and won under a secondary opposition party. Lindenberg was also open to the idea of selling his share of the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 24 Feb 1957, Eugenio Lopez Sr bought ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg. This purchase made Lopez the biggest investor in the broadcast industry of the Philippines. With his brother in the Senate, he also had very powerful political connections. By 1962, the Lopez business empire included majority ownership of the Manila Electric Company. The strong political clout of the Lopez family grew even stronger&nbsp;in Nov 1965 after Senators Ferdinand Marcos and Fernando Lopez were elected president and vice president of the Philippines, respectively, under the banner of the Nacionalista Party (NP). Marcos anchored his campaign on the nationwide publicity generated by <b><i>Iginuhit ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1011\"><strong>Tadhana</strong></a></i></b> (Destined by Fate), a motion picture about his life, which was a box-office success throughout the country. Lopez, on the other hand, enjoyed the free publicity he got from the family-owned ABS-CBN broadcast network and their newspaper, the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>. It was the second time Fernando Lopez was elected vice president. He was also the secretary of agriculture and natural resources in the Marcos cabinet, a post he held from 1965 to 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For four years, ABS radio and television stations were operated separately from CBN stations, their common ownership notwithstanding. In 1958, ABS transferred its facilities from Santa Cruz in Manila and San Juan, Rizal, to its new studio and transmitter site on Roxas Blvd in Pasay City. In the same year, on 19 Apr, CBN began its television broadcasts on CBN-DZXL-TV Channel 9 using its facilities in Intramuros. In 1961, ABS and CBN stations began using the name ABS-CBN. At the same time, on 14 Jun 1961, ABS-CBN opened its television station in Cebu City. In 1963, ABS-CBN tested the first color television transmission in the Philippines using technology imported from the United States. It was the beginning of color television broadcasting in the Philippines, and by 1966, television programs in color reached the homes of affluent Filipinos. In 1968, the Sony Trinitron color television set made its world debut, making it the leader in television technology until well into the 21st century. In the meantime, before the end of 1967, the Radiowealth Company was manufacturing and selling locally made color television sets for 2,500 pesos each, a pioneering effort that made the Philippines the third country in the world to manufacture color television sets, next to the United States and Japan. Japanese brands like National and Sony alsot made it to the Philippine market when the Precision Electronics Corporation assembled National audio and video products in Oct 1967, and when Solid Industries Inc began distributing Sony radio and television appliances in the country in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the start of 1967, with the opening of more stations throughout the country, ABS-CBN was the Philippines&rsquo; largest network, and its stations&rsquo; identification segments proudly proclaimed its status. On 12 Feb 1967, ABS-CBN launched its iconic logo, which features an aerial transmitter and three concentric rings symbolizing broadcast waves, in the primary colors of red, green, and blue, and the letters ABS on top of the graphic and the letters CBN below it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 18 Dec 1968, ABS-CBN moved its radio and studio facilities to its new headquarters called Broadcast Plaza, located along Bohol Ave (now Sergeant Esguerra Ave) in Diliman, Quezon City. The following year, the old ABS studio along Roxas Blvd in Pasay City was sold to the Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS) owned by Roberto S. Benedicto. KBS acquired a legislative franchise in 1969 to operate a television station, which necessitated a reallocation of the VHF and UHF channel frequencies. Eventually, the government assigned Channels 2 and 4 to ABS-CBN and reassigned Channel 9 to KBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the broadcast technology then still in analog format, the broadcast transmission made by one channel, which was&nbsp;too proximate to the transmission made by another channel,&nbsp;affected both transmissions as they interfered with each other. This was why, prior to the entry of KBS in the Philippine television landscape, television channel assignments were in odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Although Eugenio Lopez Sr did not find the transfer to Channel 2 objectionable, he was upset about the transfer to Channel 4, which caused technical problems to both ABS-CBN-TV Channel 4 and another station, ABC-RTV Channel 5. Joaquin &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Roces, the owner of the latter, shared the sentiments of Lopez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By this time, Lopez Sr was a very powerful oligarch; Roces was a prominent critic of the Marcos administration;&nbsp;and Benedicto, who operated a daily newspaper and a commercial bank,&nbsp;was a very close friend of Pres Marcos. Political observers saw the reallocation of channels in 1969 as a strategy on the part of Pres Marcos to reduce the political power and industrial might of Lopez, to dilute the influence of Roces in the arena of public opinion, and to pave the way for Benedicto to become his powerful ally in a largely anti-Marcos media industry. Lopez Sr&rsquo;s resentment in this regard was the first of many reasons that ultimately led to the deterioration of relations between him and his brother Fernando, on the one hand, and Pres Marcos on the other. When Marcos declared martial law in 1972, ABS-CBN was taken over by government and Benedicto. In 1986, after Marcos&rsquo;s ouster, the Lopezes recovered one television station and a number of radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>ABC Channel 5</b>. On 19 Jun 1960, the Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) began its television operations using the call letters DZMT and the Channel 5 slot. This enterprise was owned and operated by another prominent Filipino family&mdash;the Roces family&mdash;which published the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b>, the leading newspaper of the country in the two decades prior to the martial law period. The letters MT in DZMT stood for Manila Times. Joaquin &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Roces, the helmsman of the daily, was also the top man in DZMT. ABC used to operate from its studio along Roxas Blvd in Pasay City until it moved to a new facility along Pasong Tamo Road in Makati, near Epifanio de los Santos Ave. Its transmitter tower was located at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a> in Rizal Province. To avoid being mistaken for the American Broadcasting Company in the United States, the ABC management identified itself first as ABC-RTV-DZMT and eventually simply as ABC-RTV. The operations of both ABC and the <b><i>Manila Times </i></b>ground to a halt upon the declaration of martial law in 1972, and never resumed under the Roces family even after the ouster of Marcos in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>RBS Channel 7</b>.<b> </b>The Republic Broadcasting System (RBS), present-day GMA 7, traces its roots to Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Stewart, an American war correspondent of the Mutual Broadcasting Company who arrived in the Philippines with the liberation forces of Gen MacArthur in 1944. When the war ended, Stewart remained in the country and went into the radio and television industry in the Philippines. Stewart married a Filipina, Loreto Feliciano, with whom he put up the corporation Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc on 1 Mar 1950. On 14 Jun 1950, the corporation established DZBB Radio, operating from the fourth floor of the Calvo Building on the Escolta. Stewart played an active role in the radio station, doing most of the promotional announcements himself. In 1955, the couple expanded their operation to include DZXX, an AM-band station with a music format. It was the first popular music radio station in the country. In 1957, DZBB and DZXX moved their operations from the Escolta to a new site near Kamuning in Diliman, Quezon City. On 29 Oct 1961, Stewart became part of the television landscape through DZBB-TV Channel 7. His radio and television business was now located at a building of its own along EDSA in Diliman, Quezon City, with its transmitter tower right beside the building. The tower had a triangular base, and near the top, each side bore the number 7 illuminated in green neon light. The lighted signs were like celestial lanterns dotting the evening skies, until Typhoon Yoling destroyed them in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stewart was seen as a supporter of reelectionist president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong></a> of the NP in the Nov 1961 elections. It may be noted that DZBB-TV obtained its franchise under the Garcia administration. When Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party (LP) defeated Garcia in the 1961 presidential elections, Malaca&ntilde;an took steps to have Stewart deported from the country. In the meantime, Stewart&rsquo;s <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b>, a children&rsquo;s program, developed an extensive following. Stewart avoided deportation because thousands of children who regularly watched his show asked their parents to protest to President Macapagal, thus forcing the president to call off the deportation proceedings. Since then, Stewart refrained from getting personally involved in Philippine politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike the other radio and television station operators, Stewart did not publish a newspaper, but he enjoyed substantial investments from the American Broadcasting Company of the United States. In 1963, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc changed its name to Republic Broadcasting System (RBS). It is believed that RBS stood for Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Stewart. Subsequently, during the martial law period, a sale will cause another name change, this time to GMA 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>KBS Channel 9</b>. Roberto S. Benedicto, a lawyer and former corporate officer in the Lopez companies, invested in the radio business in 1960. On 29 Jun, he put station DZKB on the air under the Kanlaon Broadcasting System. Observers say that the letters KB in DZKB refer to the initials of his daughter, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4770\"><strong>Kitchie Benedicto</strong></a>. By then, his commercial interests included substantial investments in the sugar industry in Negros Occidental and investments in the Traders Commercial Bank, which was later renamed Traders Royal Bank. He also owned a daily newspaper, the <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i></b>. Benedicto also enjoyed the full trust and confidence of Ferdinand Marcos, a close friend in law school and college fraternity brother in the University of the Philippines, who in 1965 was elected president of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1969, Congress granted KBS a franchise to operate a television station, KBS-TV Channel 9. As previously mentioned, KBS purchased the old ABS television studio along Roxas Blvd in Pasay City for its television broadcasts following ABS-CBN&rsquo;s move from its old studio to its new headquarters in Quezon City. With KBS now a part of the television industry, government regulators reallocated the frequency assignments of ABS-CBN to accommodate the newcomer. ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Channel 3 and Channel 9 were replaced with Channel 2 and Channel 4, respectively. Channel 9 was assigned to KBS. Like other broadcasting companies in the country, KBS was a stock corporation. In 1970, Benedicto decided to raise investments from the public sector by listing KBS in the stock exchange. This meant that shares of stock of KBS could be purchased by the public. It subsequently changed its name to Radio Philippines Network (RPN) during the martial law period, but kept the name Kanlaon Broadcasting System in its official corporate records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>MBC Channel 11</b>. The Manila Broadcasting Company of the brothers Federico, Joaquin Miguel (&ldquo;JM&rdquo;), and Manuel Elizalde, which put up KZRH, later DZRH, the first commercial station at war&rsquo;s end, expanded its operations to include DZRH-TV after it was granted the corresponding franchise by Congress in 1960. Joaquin Miguel Elizalde had political connections. He served the government as foreign affairs secretary under Pres Elpidio Quirino from 1948 to 1950 and from 1952 to 1953. On 11 Apr 1962, MBC-TV Channel 11 began broadcasting. Its television studio was also located alongside its radio facilities at the old Insular Life Building at Plaza Cervantes in Binondo, Manila. Unlike the other television stations, MBC-TV did not broadcast imported programs, except for a few films to fill the airtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The station suffered from broadcast stoppages due to chronic problems with its transmitter. To address the problem, MBC transferred its television studio to a new location along J. P. Rizal St in the Project 4 district of Quezon City, behind the Quirino Memorial Hospital, known at that time as the Labor Hospital, in the early months of 1972. Its broadcast operations at its new location, however, were short-lived due to the proclamation of martial law in Sep 1972, which led to the closure of the television operations of all stations except KBS. Although MBC was allowed to continue its operations several weeks before the end of 1972, the management decided to abandon its television business and to focus instead on their radio broadcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>RMN-IBC-TV Channel 13</b>. In 1960, the Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) owned by American businessman Dick Baldwin obtained from Congress a franchise to operate a television station. His station, called DZTV, was assigned television Channel 13. On 1 Mar 1960, IBC-TV 13 made its premiere telecast. In 1962, Andres Soriano Sr, a businessman with huge investments in both the A. Soriano Corporation (also known as Anscor) and the San Miguel Corporation (SMC, a giant food and manufacturing conglomerate and the Philippine franchise holder of Coca-Cola back then) bought both IBC-TV 13 from Baldwin as well as the controlling interest in Radio Mindanao Network (RMN) from the Canoy brothers, who founded the network in Cagayan de Oro City in 1952. Later that year, Soriano established DZHP Radio in Manila under the RMN banner, extending RMN&rsquo;s reach to Manila, and merged his radio and television acquisitions into one entity&mdash;RMN-IBC. Soriano housed his radio and television enterprise at the old ABS transmitter site in Little Baguio, San Juan, which he renovated and improved after acquiring it from ABS-CBN. At that time, Soriano owned a daily newspaper, the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Soriano passed away in 1964, his son Andres Soriano Jr took over the family businesses, including the media enterprises. The proclamation of martial law in Sep 1972 led to the temporary closure of the radio and television operations of RMN-IBC and to a stoppage in the publication of the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>. Before the end of 1972, however, the radio and television facilities of RMN-IBC were operational once more since the martial law administration did not consider Soriano a threat to national security. The<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>, however, never resumed publication, even after the end of the Marcos administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Canoy brothers subsequently bought back RMN during the martial law period while Soriano sold IBC to Roberto Benedicto, who was by then operating two television stations: Banahaw Broadcasting System (BBC) Channel 2 and RPN Channel 9. Benedicto renamed his newest broadcast station the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation, keeping the initials IBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"golden\" name=\"golden\"></a>The Golden Age of Philippine Radio</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Veteran radio personalities and executives locate the so-called golden age of Philippine radio (also called golden years of Philippine radio) in the decades after the war, with some claiming it started as early as the late 1940s and ended with the declaration of martial law in 1972. What defined&nbsp;the era was the flourishing of a radio style that began to acquire what was perceived as Filipino, even if strong American influences remained. American voices stayed on but began to be edged out by Filipinos. English persisted as the gold standard of radio announcing, but Tagalog and other languages in the regions slowly but surely took over the air lanes. Western popular music endured but the development of the local recording industry introduced many songbirds whose fame on radio rivaled those of American and English music icons. The new art of the soap opera, the <i>bodabil</i>-inspired variety shows that included comedy skits and quizzes, and amateur singing contests hooked legions of listeners of all ages to the radio set. Advertising nourished the medium and its popularity was fanned by the new technology of the portable, battery-operated, and relatively inexpensive transistor radio. Radio was a national pastime, with more listeners than newspaper and magazine readers, even with the introduction of television in the 1950s, which took a few decades to surpass radio in audience subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Programs and the Local Recording Industry</b>. When the American troops returned at the end of 1944, the broadcasters among them flooded the air with American popular music, which Filipinos sorely missed as the Japanese banned them during the occupation. This had been&nbsp;the regular music fare on radio until a few years after the war when import restrictions limited the entry of foreign music records. The dearth encouraged the birth of the local recording industry, which pressed covers of American popular hits by Filipino singers, but also waxed contemporary local compositions as well as Filipino traditional and folk music such as the <i>kundiman</i> (love song) and <i>harana </i>(serenade). Among the first recording companies were Bataan Recording, Royal, Riego, Mater, Molave, Excelsior, and Villar Recording Company. Others were Union, Mico, Alpha, Super, Scoop, Fama, LVM, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>, Jessica, Imperial, Vicor, Blackgold, and Octo-Arts, few of which survived more than a few years. Acclaimed Hari ng <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong> (King of Kundiman) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a> was among the first to be recorded by Riego and Mabuhay Records. Another successful singer was American-Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\"><strong>Cecil Lloyd</strong></a>, called The Mystery Singer, who put up his own recording studio, the Philippine Recording System (PRS) in 1948, and counted besides himself Sylvia La Torre, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\"><strong>Pancho Magalona</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\"><strong>Leopoldo Silos</strong></a> as his first artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The establishment of Villar Recording Company in the Philippines in 1950 made recordings of Philippine songs and music readily available to radio stations and, more importantly, affordable to many Filipinos. Villar labels included Mareco (Manila Record Company) and Mabuhay. The company radio jingle went like this: &ldquo;Remember your friends abroad, remember your friends abroad, send them lasting gifts of Philippine music on Villar records.&rdquo; However, most of the radio stations were reluctant to play local music at first, mainly because of the perception that audiences preferred Western popular music and the fact that there were more American selections than there were local ones. It took some time before a few radio stations in the country picked up the trend and began including Philippine music in their regular programming, making stars out of Filipino singers, including Bimbo Danao, Phil Delfino, Belle Gonzales, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3905\"><strong>Don David</strong></a></strong> in the 1950s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, Sylvia La Torre, RJ Jacinto, and teenage bands in the 1960s; and in the 1970s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3863\"><strong>Hajji Alejandro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, and the artists of the so-called Pinoy Rock and Manila Sound, the precursor of what is often called original Pilipino music (OPM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music records were successfully used for some political campaigns, the most memorable of which was <b><i>Mambo Magsaysay</i></b>. Elpidio Quirino&rsquo;s opponent from the opposition Nacionalista Party when he ran for reelection in 1953 was Ramon Magsaysay, who was Quirino&rsquo;s secretary of national defense. The mambo was the dance craze of the period, and so Magsaysay&rsquo;s strategists came out with a likeable, danceable song they called &ldquo;Mambo Magsaysay,&rdquo; composed by his aide Raul Manglapus, who later became a senator, and recorded by Rosita de la Vega-Da Roza. Recordings of the song were distributed free to the different radio stations in the country and to NP provincial leaders for distribution to cities, towns, and barrios. As a result, the recording was played on the air almost everywhere in the country while people in town fiestas and similar public gatherings danced to the tune. &ldquo;Mambo Magsaysay&rdquo; virtually did the campaigning for Magsaysay, who won the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s saw Pilita Corrales, then nicknamed Asia&rsquo;s Queen of Song, serenading radio audiences with her renditions of timeless local pieces, particularly Visayan songs. Helen Gamboa was also a regular singing voice on radio back then. Later in the decade and well into the early 1970s, songbird Nora Aunor, who won the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage) television competition in 1967 with her rendition of &ldquo;Moonlight Becomes You,&rdquo; and jukebox king Eddie Peregrina, who was known for &ldquo;What Am I Living For&rdquo; and &ldquo;Together Again&rdquo; were heard frequently on the AM band. Humorous ballads like &ldquo;Naku Inday Bakit Mo Binigay&rdquo;<b> </b>(Oh Inday Why Did You Give It)<b> </b>sung by the yodeling Fred Panopio, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a>&rsquo;s now famous &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\"><strong>Magellan</strong></a>&rdquo;<b> </b>were also well received by local radio audiences. Some stations allowed naughty Tagalog translations of certain songs such as the 1964 piece &ldquo;A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night&rdquo; and &ldquo;Candida,&rdquo; which came out in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s was also a memorable decade for Philippine radio, which played foreign musical greats like the Beatles, the Monkees, Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, and Simon and Garfunkel. After the Beatles performed at the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila on 4 Jul 1966, the younger generation of Filipinos turned to the radio to listen to their singing idols, which was more practical than a vinyl record because radio programs were for free while records were not. Moreover, an unlimited access to songs was available to radio listeners while those who used phonographs could listen only to whatever vinyl records they had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The attractiveness of musical programs to Filipino audiences bred the format amateur singing contest. Among the most popular of these was the program variously called <b><i>Purico Troubadours</i></b>, <b><i>Purico Show</i></b>, and <b><i>Purico Amateur Hour.</i></b> Purico is the brand of a cooking lard manufactured by the Philippine Manufacturing Company (PMC), the local licensee of Procter &amp; Gamble. The show had its origins in prewar radio and was revived after the war. The game shows <b><i>Purico Jamboree</i></b> and <b><i>Timpalak ng Purico</i></b> (Purico Contest) on postwar KZRH were also sponsored by the brand and attained much popularity, but not as much as the amateur singing contest. It ended though when Purico in 1956 began sponsoring <b><i>Tawag ng Tanghalan</i></b> on DZBB, which had been on the air since 1950. The program featured aspiring singers who competed with each other in the hope of getting a crack at the professional scene. Winning contestants were allowed to finish their pieces. The losers were interrupted by the sound of a gong or a bell, which meant the contestant was eliminated. Among the contestants who emerged as singing champions and subsequently made a name for themselves were <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></strong>, who later became one of the hosts of the show when it moved to television, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\"><strong>Diomedes Maturan</strong></a>, Cenon Lagman, Eva Adona, Ofelia Dayrit, Novo Bono Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> Jr, Edgar Mortiz, Jonathan Potenciano, and Nora Aunor. The original hosts of the show were the comedians Rodolfo Quizon, better known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>, and his sidekick Alfonso Alba, better known as Panchito. When it went on the road, Dolphy left the show due to his movie commitments, so he and Panchito were replaced by another comedy pair, Lopito and Patsy (full name: Pastora Mateo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Soap <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>s</b>. Radio dramas, called soaps or soap operas because the first such productions in the United States were sponsored by soap products with the Colgate-Palmolive brands, came in several formats: the melodrama, the situational comedy or sitcom, the sitcom-cum-satire, horror or fantasy and science fiction narratives, and the occasional detective drama. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (Light of the Home), written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> Arceo, was the first postwar soap. It aired on DZRH in Mar 1949, followed a week later by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate) by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>, also on DZRH. Both programs, which aired daily for 15 minutes, were about the highs and lows in the life of ordinary Filipino families and their friends. DZRH enjoyed a virtual monopoly of famous radio dramas in the 1950s, a number of which carried the names of their sponsors. These programs included&nbsp;<b><i>Gabi ng Shell</i></b> (Shell&rsquo;s Evening), sponsored by the Shell petroleum company and which featured the famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4644\"><strong>Lolita Rodriguez</strong></a> and her partner Eddie Arenas; <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, a sitcom about a dysfunctional Filipino family and its patriarch; the fantasy adventures <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1489\"><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong></a></i></b> (Prince Amante), written by Clodualdo del Mundo, and <b><i>Kapitan Kidlat</i></b> (Captain Lightning); the detective serial <b><i>Johnny Davao</i></b>; another Lina Flor opus, <b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b> (Madam Judge),<i> </i>a legal drama; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\"><strong>Genoveva Edroza-Matute</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Aklat ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Book of Love), in which unique stories lasted only months instead of the usual years of a typical melodrama; and <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> (Night of Terror), a horror drama. In 1953, Fidela Magpayo aka Tiya Dely and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>, who had been on radio since 1938 and,&nbsp;during the Japanese period, joined DZRH. She hosted a new drama format titled <b><i>Ito ang Inyong Tiya Dely</i></b> (This Is Your Aunt Dely) and pioneered the counseling type of radio programming, which began with the dramatization of a letter sender&rsquo;s dilemma in life, followed by advice dished out by Magpayo. Her program quickly gained a huge and loyal following and became the model for counseling-and-drama programs both on radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other memorable soaps of the period include DZPI&rsquo;s child-oriented <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1471\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Basyang</strong></i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Grandma Basyang), based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s serial in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> magazine, Clodualdo del Mundo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a></i></b> (Memento), and the melodrama <b><i>Mercedes Cruz</i></b>; DZBB&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1519\"><strong>Tony Narra</strong></a></i></b>, which was the first detective-type of narrative on Philippine radio, Gloria Villaraza-Guzman&rsquo;s love stories <b><i>Mga Lihim ng Puso</i></b> (Secrets of the Heart), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>, a Sunday-night-60-minute reenactment of an upcoming Filipino movie, with the film actors coming to the studio and reenacting the movie dialogue live; and DZBC&rsquo;s <b><i>Panata ng Puso</i></b> (Heart&rsquo;s Promise) and <b><i>Digmaan ng Damdamin</i></b> (Battle of Emotions), both written and directed by Artemio Marquez, and the horror drama <b><i>Sepulturero sa Lumang Libingan</i></b> (Gravedigger in the Old Cemetery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A most unforgettable program that combined satire with comedy-drama was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), which first aired in 1938 before the war and went on until the 1960s, interrupted only by the Japanese occupation. It spoofed Filipino manners, politics, customs, and government, with scripts written first by Narciso Pimentel and Jesus Paredes, and later by Epifanio Matute. Conceptualized by Horacio de la Costa and James Reuter, both Jesuit priests, the show&rsquo;s format was successfully replicated in the provincial stations. Other memorable postwar soaps were Fundador Soriano&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday) and <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>. The latter first aired in Cebu radio and was later translated to Tagalog and produced for Manila television audiences in the late 1970s, like other popular soaps that were later reproduced on television or made into movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The golden years of Philippine radio were marked by the prominence of classical Tagalog&mdash;the kind associated with the great poet Balagtas. It was clearly felt in most program genres and in advertisements, but especially in drama. However, dramas in English were on the air until the 1950s, many produced by college dramatic guilds such as Cathedral Players on DZRH, managed by Ateneo de Manila&rsquo;s James Reuter; Bedan Barristers on DZPI, made up of thespians of San Beda College led by Noe Nebrida; and Republic Players on DZBB, composed of several stage actors, directors, scriptwriters, and producers transitioning to radio, television, and, later, film. To the local broadcast and cinema industries they brought the literary styles and conventions of the Western stage acquired from school-based dramatic clubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Variety shows</b>. The variety show, a m&eacute;lange of musical performances, comic skits, and light banter among hosts and guests, was a popular genre on radio and later on television. A takeoff from the prewar bodabil and the wartime stage show, the variety show later included quizzes, games, and contests. A common feature of variety shows was the live audience in the studio, who participated in the program by joining the contests and providing live laughter and applause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An example of the variety show that appealed to young adults was on DZXL, which scored a hit in 1958 with its innovative noontime program <b><i>CBN Canteen</i></b>, which was aired from the cafeteria of the CBN studio in Intramuros. <b><i>CBN Canteen</i></b> was hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a>, Bobby Ledesma, and Leila Benitez.

The next year, <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> became a noontime television program on DZXL-TV Channel 9. Other popular variety shows were DZXL&rsquo;s <b><i>Darigold Jumbo Jamboree</i></b>, hosted by two of the funniest pairs of comics at the time&mdash;Dolphy and Panchito, and Leila Benitez and Eddie Ilarde; the gag-filled <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b> on DZRH, produced and hosted by Conde Ubaldo and Luz Mat Castro, featuring the brightest stars of the film studio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures; DZFM&rsquo;s <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> (Edong the Dreamer), a string of comic skits; and the memorable <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1499\"><strong>Reyna ng Vicks</strong></a></i></b> (Queen of Vicks) on DZRH, sponsored by Vicks Vaporub vaporizing ointment, which interviewed on the air five female members of the studio audience.

On DZPI was <b><i>Campus Capers</i></b>, made up of comic skits about college life, hosted by Al Spencer with Tita Mu&ntilde;oz, Veronica Palileo, Arling Gonzales, and Al Wayne. <b><i>Professor Quiz</i></b> was a game show on DZMB that asked participants general information type of questions. Its main announcers were Hal Bowie and Don Lee while Ray Oliver, Larry Ng, Ric Tierro, Jess Fernandez, Simeon Bonzon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4991\"><strong>Rafael Yabut</strong></a> took turns in selecting the contestants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Sportscasts</b>. The prewar stations regularly covered sporting events, especially baseball, the most popular sport in the United States, and basketball, by annotating the game to a radio audience that imagined the event they did not see. The practice continued after the war until the visual medium of television took over in the late 1950s, but not before radio made stars of sportscasters Willie Hernandez, Jake Romero, and Jack Garcia, who gave listeners play-by-play accounts of boxing, tennis, and basketball matches. The games of the basketball leagues Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association or NCAA were especially popular.

Interrupted by the war, a program that began to go on the air in 1934 returned on DZRH in the 1950s&mdash;the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>Balagtasan</strong></a></i></b>, a poetic joust usually about a social issue or a cultural tradition. Hosted by poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5045\"><strong>Emilio Mar Antonio</strong></a> every Sunday, he engaged a guest <b>makata</b> (poet) in a debate in Tagalog verse, with the debate topic phrased in questions like, &ldquo;Should divorce be introduced in the Philippines?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Should the Philippines be a state of the United States of America?&rdquo; (Jimenez 1996, 33B; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto 2007, 508).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The absence of American programs during the war created an appetite for radio shows from the United States, which came recorded in 16-inch discs. Many of these were wartime variety productions aimed at the American soldier fighting the war in Europe and in the Pacific, such as <b><i>The Lucky Strike Show with Bob Hope</i></b>, <b><i>The Coca-Cola Show with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a> MacKenzie</i></b>, <b><i>The Perry Como Show with Jo Stafford</i></b>, <b><i>The Martin and Lewis Show</i></b>, and the scary drama thriller <b><i>Witching Hour</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the meantime, a new format of the counseling genre, one in English, with no accompanying tearful dramatizations of listeners&rsquo; lives, went on the air in 1957. This was <b><i>Father Bob and His Telephone</i></b> hosted by Bob Garon, a young Roman Catholic priest. Listeners were encouraged to call up the station and seek help regarding their personal problems, without revealing their real names. The program launched the media career of Father Garon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PBS began airing programs that targeted farmers in the 1950s, but it was in the 1960s that the program type gained popularity and became part of regular programming of several AM stations. Usually aired in the early morning at around five o&rsquo;clock, announcers discussed new ways of increasing agricultural productivity with information coming from the Department of Agriculture, UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, the International Rice Research Institute, the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, and the International Institute for Rural Reconstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A program type that emerged after the war was the personality platter show in which an announcer, later called disc jockey or the DJ, played selected music records and engaged the listeners in a light chat. Several of these shows entertained requests by listeners sent by mail, with some DJs indulging their fans by dedicating the music they played to admirers. The shows boosted sales of records, particularly of popular music, while many DJs became household names. Among these programs were <b><i>Cashmere Bouquet Top Tunes</i></b> hosted by Larry Ng, <b><i>Voice of Firestone</i></b> featuring Broadway melodies and hosted by Ray Oliver, <b><i>Silahis ng Pag-asa</i></b> (Ray of Hope), featuring light classics and hosted by Ric Tierro, <b><i>Latina Americana</i></b> hosted by Louie Garcia, <b><i>Roll of Honor</i></b> hosted by Eddie Mercado, and the so-called request-dedication platter shows such as <b><i>Request Jamboree</i></b> hosted by Dick Taylor, <b><i>Night Owl</i></b> hosted by Lito Gorospe, <b><i>All Night Stand</i></b> hosted by Jo San Diego, <b><i>Mailbag Jukebox</i></b> hosted by Angelo and Cherrie Castro, and <b><i>Platter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\"><strong>Bungalow</strong></a></i></b> hosted by Bong Lapira.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Radio Advertising</b>. In the decades following the war, almost all of the advertising aired on both radio and television was of the hard-sell type, and mostly done in Tagalog and other major Philippine languages. The products advertised consisted mainly of detergents, beauty soaps, dental creams (toothpaste), pomade, cigarettes, soft drinks, milk, instant coffee, gasoline, over-the-counter medicine, milk, beauty products, cooking oil, soy sauce, and many other consumer products. Many of these consumer products were manufactured by the Philippine Manufacturing Company, the local branch of Procter &amp; Gamble, the biggest advertising spender at the time, which poured 90 percent of its advertising budget into radio, until television began to eat into radio&rsquo;s share of the advertising pie during the martial law years. PMC&rsquo;s main competitor was the Philippine Refining Company, the local licensee of Lever Brothers, present-day Unilever. Another corporate competitor of the period was Colgate-Palmolive (Philippines) Inc. The boundary then between broadcast announcers and executives, on the one hand, and advertising men, on the other, was porous. Many crossed over or did both at the same time, producing and hosting programs while writing and voicing ad copy and servicing clients. Some memorable ad lines that were initially produced for radio were later reproduced for television: &ldquo;Johnson yata &rsquo;yan!;&rdquo; &ldquo;Say mabuhay with Tanduay;&rdquo; &ldquo;Kiko Baterya, Kiko Dinamo;&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m walking on clouds in my Camara shoes;&rdquo; and &ldquo;National Zippers slide up and down!&rdquo; (Davis 2007, 223-26).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During election seasons, political adverttising outnumbered commercials for consumer products. Then and now, it was a significant source of income for both radio and television stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1950s, television was getting increasingly popular in the country, and radio industry leaders saw a need to address a potential problem. Specialized programming was seen as a means of keeping the radio industry alive and competitive. DZXX, which began to specialize in popular music, set the trend in reinventing programming to cater to specific audience groups. Soon, other radio stations reinvented themselves. DZRJ concentrated on popular pieces and dance music, and it became a favorite among teenagers. Office workers, wage earners, and housewives became avid listeners of drama on DZAQ, DZRH, and DZXL. DWOW catered to commuters and focused on local popular music and pieces performed by local singers. Highly politicized listeners could choose from several early-morning commentators of the different AM-band radio stations. Listeners on the FM band who liked old-fashioned music and instrumentals tuned in to DZFX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of the decade, radio survived the competition from television by developing its own loyal following during the early morning and late evening hours. While television competed with radio in the nation&rsquo;s urban areas, radio dominated the countryside and rural communities, especially those with no access to electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"age\" name=\"age\"></a>The Age of Television</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The cost of a television set was prohibitive when it was first introduced in the 1950s, so it took another decade for urban middle-class families to have it in their homes. However, as in the early years of radio, television owners invested in programming in the belief that television would eventually become a profitable business. In the meantime, programs had to be put on the air. There were two sources: American TV stations that sold canned serials and existing local radio programs transmuted into the visual medium. Buying canned shows from the United States was a practice that prevailed for decades as it was a lot less expensive to buy them than produce original shows. Moreover, it was a guaranteed investment as the Filipino audience was already conditioned to enjoy American programs. But while it was more capital-intensive to produce television programs locally, the formats and popularity of several radio shows suggested that they could be migrated to television successfully in terms of production values and audience reception. Besides, the television owners also owned the counterpart radio stations that produced the thriving programs on radio. That gamble paid off. Thus, early television programs in the country had their origins in radio. Many carried the original radio titles while others used new program titles but with the same formats. From the 1960s up to 1972, television stations in the Philippines broadcast from five o&rsquo;clock in the morning and ended their broadcast day at midnight, supported and sustained by advertising. It was an indication of a growing and loyal television audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1372\"><strong>Variety Shows</strong></a></b>. Radio&rsquo;s variety programs were the first and easiest to be replicated in television. In 1959, the variety program <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> on CBN-DZXL radio became a noontime television program on then CBN-DZXL-TV Channel 9. It retained its hosts Eddie Ilarde, Leila Benitez, Bobby Ledesma, and Pepe Pimentel. It was enormously popular but in 1964, Ilarde, Benitez, and Ledesma left the show following a misunderstanding with the managers of ABS-CBN-TV Channel 9 and moved to another television program, <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b>, on Manila Broadcasting Company&rsquo;s TV Channel 11, which also had its origins as a radio program on DZRH. Pepe Pimentel remained on <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> but he was unable to sustain the popularity of the show, thus leading to its termination in 1965. The management replaced <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> with <b><i>Stop, Look and Listen</i></b> hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4546\"><strong>Eddie Mesa</strong></a>.<i> </i>Later, during the martial law years,<i> <b>Student Canteen</b></i> was revived as a television program on RBS-TV Channel 7, which Ilarde and Ledesma hosted with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine comedy king Rodolfo V. Quizon, also known as Dolphy, made his television debut in 1964 on the weekly variety show <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b> (Actor&rsquo;s Life), also on Channel 3. He shared the television limelight with his cinema sidekick Alfonso Alba, also known as Panchito. Among the new television programs that went on the air on ABS-CBN-TV Channel 3 in 1965 was <b><i>Magandang Tanghali</i></b> (Good Afternoon), a noontime variety show hosted by Pancho Magalona. In 1967, the evening variety show <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b> (Happy Hour) began airing on Channel 3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, ABS-CBN-TV Channel 9 is remembered for <b><i>The</i> <i>Lucky Strike Show</i></b>, an evening variety program hosted by Nelda Navarro; <b><i>The Baby O&rsquo;Brien Show</i></b>, another variety program hosted by Baby O&rsquo;Brien, and <b><i>Da Best Show</i></b>. All three began airing in the early 1960s. At around the same time, <b><i>Everyday Holiday</i></b>, a post-noontime variety program hosted by actor and singer Sylvia La Torre and comedian Doro de los Ojos, went on the air. Its opening song described the show in this manner: &ldquo;Every day, holiday, <i>oras ng kasiyahan</i> every day!&rdquo; (Every day, holiday, happy hour every day!) Some of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s variety programs were hybrids of variety and musical-dance or sitcom, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></a></i></b>, a highly popular late-evening program starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a> and Nestor de Villa, whose dance routines were legend, and<b><i> Da Pakulo</i></b> (The Gimmick).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\"><strong>Chiquito</strong></a> Show</i></b> hosted by comedian Chiquito, Augusto Valdez Pangan in real life, aired on ABC-RTV Channel 5. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most popular local shows on Channel 5 was <b><i>Seeing Stars with Joe Quirino</i></b>, where host Joe Quirino interviewed international celebrities who happened to be in town. Often, Quirino got his guests to sing or perform an act, and gave them their cue with his immortal line, &ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; seasoned with a thick Ilocano accent. Joe Quirino was the Philippine equivalent of America&rsquo;s celebrated television showman Ed Sullivan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On RBS TV Channel 7, Robert Stewart hosted <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4964\"><strong>Bob Stewart</strong></a> Show</i></b>, which featured guests who discussed with him almost anything of interest to television audiences. During the early years of the martial law era, this program became <b><i>The Maestro and Uncle Bob</i></b>, and later on, <b><i>Uncle Bob and Friends</i></b>. On MBC TV Channel 11, the most well-known program was <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b>, a noontime variety show that first aired as <b><i>Darigold Jumbo Jamboree</i></b> on DZRH radio, hosted by veteran performers Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Leila Benitez, and Johnny Wilson, and sponsored by Darigold Milk, a leading American franchise brand of the day. As mentioned above, <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b> migrated from radio after Ilarde, Ledesma, and Benitez, who were the hosts of <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> on CBN-TV Channel 9, had left <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> after a disagreement with CBN-TV management. Arrangements to have Pepe Pimentel and comedian <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\"><strong>Bentot</strong></a></strong> (Arturo Vergara Medina in real life) join <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b> did not materialize. For a time, <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b> faced tough competition from <b><i>The Big Show</i></b>, another variety show aired on a rival television channel and sponsored by Liberty Milk, another American franchise brand. <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b> aired from 1964 to 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>s and Dance Programs</b>. Derivatives of the variety show genre, programs with music and dance were popular. Coinciding with the year 1961 when ABS and CBN stations began using the name ABS-CBN, Channel 3 inaugurated <b><i>Jam Session</i></b>, a musical program that specialized in youth-oriented music starring Bobby Ng and a band called the Hi-Jacks. A memorable Channel 3 musical was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1437\"><strong>An Evening with Pilita</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>hosted by Pilita Corrales, who was then dubbed Asia&rsquo;s Queen of Song, and aired on prime time from 1965 to 1972. A variant of the musical show was the singing contest, which had enjoyed immense following on radio. Also on Channel 3, the television version of <b><i>Tawag ng Tanghalan</i></b> (Call of the Stage), hosted by Pepe Pimentel, aired also in 1965, until 1969. <b><i>Tawag ng Tanghalan</i></b> produced a champion in 1967 who became one of the more iconic and respected stars on the Philippine film, television, radio, and the music industries&mdash;Nora Aunor. Winning the championship on her second try, Aunor&rsquo;s victory assured her of roles in other ABS-CBN television programs like the evening variety show <b><i>Oras ng Ligaya</i></b> (Happy Hour) on Channel 3. Another popular singing contest was <b><i>Hamon sa Kampeon </i></b>(Challenge to the Champion), hosted by Dely Magpayo and Pepe Pimentel. A discotheque program called <b><i>Nineteeners</i></b> began airing on ABS-CBN Channel 9 in 1966.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Competing with <b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b> were the evening musical programs <b><i>Helen of Song</i></b>, hosted by Helen Gamboa, and <b><i>Carmen on Camera</i></b>, featuring veteran singer Carmen Soriano on ABC RTV Channel 5, in the 1960s. On RBS TV Channel 7, <b><i>Dancetime with Chito</i></b> went on the air late at night, hosted by a socialite, Chito Feliciano. The program was one of the few local programs on Channel 7 broadcast live from the studio within a Spartan studio set. It was the first of its kind in the Philippines, becoming a model for subsequent dance programs on television. Feliciano and his guests demonstrated the latest dance steps to the audience. Meanwhile, on MBC TV Channel 11, <b><i>DJ Dance Time</i></b> and <b><i>The Nite Owl Dance Party</i></b> rivaled RBS TV&rsquo;s highly popular <b><i>Dancetime with Chito</i></b>. In 1970, Channel 11 cashed in on the popularity of filmdom&rsquo;s teen idol Tirso Cruz III, from the musical Cruz family, with the song-and-dance <b><i>Catch Up with Tirso</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were several imported canned musical programs in the 1960s, among them <b><i>This Is &hellip; Tom Jones</i></b>, which aired on ABS-CBN Channel 3, and <b><i>The Engelbert Humperdinck Show</i></b> on KBS TV Channel 9, both starring popular pop singers in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Soaps and Other Narratives</b>. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong>tic shows on television may be loosely classified into melodramas, fantasy-horror, action-adventure, and family-oriented dramas. While there were a few daily soaps or the drama serial whose episodes continued the narrative from day to day over a period of years, many were weekly anthologies where a unique story was featured in every series. Among the most remarkable of these drama anthologies was ABC Channel 5&rsquo;s <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), which featured productions of the Philippine Educational Theater Association beginning in 1967, with Cecile Guidote, Lupita Concio, Alberto Florentino, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4884\"><strong>Nick Lizaso</strong></a> as producers.

Dauden subsequently also hosted the latter when she left Channel 5. <b><i>Santa Zita and Mary Rose</i></b>, a memorable Sunday afternoon Catholic-oriented drama about household helpers, also aired on ABC. Evolving from a radio counseling program, it was hosted by Mary Rose Jacinto and featured stage thespian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2735\"><strong>Zeneida Amador</strong></a> under the direction of James Reuter, sponsored by the Jacinto Steel Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Canned dramas from American and English television aired on local TV, such as <b><i>Marcus Welby, M.D.</i></b> on ABS-CBN, <b><i>Peyton Place</i></b> on RBS Channel 7, the original hospital emergency room drama <b><i>Ben Casey</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and the courtroom dramas <b><i>Perry Mason</i></b> and <b><i>Ironside</i></b> on RMN-IBC Channel 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Locally produced but short-lived horror programs <b><i>Hiwaga sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>Bahay na Bato</strong></a></i></b> (Mystery in the House of Stone) and <b><i>Limbo</i></b> aired on ABS-CBN in the 1960s. Programs that imitated American and British action shows include <b><i>Agent 69</i></b> and <b><i>Kwatro Bidas</i></b> (Four Heroes),<b><i> </i></b>a program considered unique because it is a serious drama that featured four known comedians&mdash;Doro de los Ojos, Teroy de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4307\"><strong>Cachupoy</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Fernando</strong>&mdash;as special law enforcers who are experts in martial arts.

In this case, the program rotated different detective shows including <b><i>McCloud</i></b>, <b><i>Millan &amp; Wife</i></b>, <b><i>Columbo</i></b>, and <b><i>Quincy, M.E.</i></b>, each broadcast at intervals of three to five weeks. A British-made television program, <b><i>The Baron</i></b>, was also on ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABC Channel 5 also aired canned American action-adventure programs, including the detective shows <b><i>It Takes a Thief</i></b>, <b><i>Mannix</i></b>, <b><i>The Protectors</i></b>, and <b><i>Randall and Hopkirk</i></b>; and the mystery anthology <b><i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i></b>. Channel 5 became known for <b><i>The Samurai</i></b>, a Japanese television series dubbed in English and shown in mid-morning and early evening time slots. Through his connections in the United States, especially friends from the American Broadcasting Company, Stewart obtained for RBS Channel 7 a substantial volume of the most popular American television programs of the period, dominating the station&rsquo;s primetime programming up to the early 1970s. They include the war action classic <b><i>Combat!</i></b>; the iconic <b><i>Mission: Impossible</i></b> and <b><i>The Fugitive</i></b>; the camp program <b><i>Batman</i></b>; the series on the adventures of a female private investigator titled <b><i>Honey West</i></b>; the futuristic adventure program called <b><i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i></b><i> </i>and its spin-off <b><i>The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.</i></b>; Westerns such as <b><i>Bat Masterson</i></b>, <b><i>Daniel Boone</i></b>, <b><i>The Rifleman</i></b>, and <b><i>The Virginian</i></b>; the detective adventure shows <b><i>The Green Hornet</i></b> and <b><i>The Persuaders!</i></b>; mystery science fiction adventures <b><i>Star Trek</i></b>, <b><i>Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea</i></b>, <b><i>Land of the Giants</i></b>, <b><i>The Time Tunnel</i></b>, and <b><i>Lost in Space</i></b>; other family-oriented serials like <b><i>Gilligan&rsquo;s Island</i></b>, <b><i>Flipper</i></b>, and <b><i>The Patty Duke Show</i></b>; action programs <b><i>77 Sunset Strip</i></b>, <b><i>The Untouchables</i></b>, and <b><i>Hawaiian Eye</i></b>; and <b><i>Flash Gordon</i></b>, a science fiction serial produced by Universal Pictures in 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RMN-IBC Channel 13, on the other hand, aired the police-detective program <b><i>The FBI</i></b>, a detective show based on extrasensory perception called <b><i>The Sixth Sense</i></b>, and <b><i>One Step Beyond</i></b>, a horror-thriller patterned after <b><i>The Twilight Zone</i></b>. There were two British productions broadcast also on prime time: <b><i>The Avengers</i></b> and <b><i>The Saint</i></b>. Both programs were about British agents who fought foreign spies and other enemies of the West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Sitcoms and Gag Shows</b>. A most memorable program of this genre began airing on radio in 1938, during the American colonial period, the <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> (Tall Tales). Interrupted during the Japanese occupation, the show went back on radio after the war and in the 1960s was produced by ABS-CBN Channel 3 as a television sitcom. By the middle of the 1960s, Channel 3 also had <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, a Saturday evening situation comedy about a dysfunctional family and its naughty patriarch. ABS-CBN produced other situational comedies such as <b><i>Mrs. Milyonarya</i></b> (Mrs Millionaire), starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>, and <b><i>Wanted Boarders</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a>; and the gag show <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b>. ABC RTV Channel 5, on the other hand, produced <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1440\"><strong>Gorio and His Jeepney</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1516\"><strong>Tisoy</strong></a> </i></b>(moniker for someone of mixed race, usually Filipino and Caucasian mix), both of which were adaptations of popular comic strips of the same respective titles in the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b>. Chiquito played the character of Gorio while the cast of <b><i>Tisoy</i> </b>was composed of Jimmy Morato, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4600\"><strong>Pilar Pilapil</strong></a>, Bert Marcelo, and Moody Diaz. In 1967, MBC-TV Channel 11 began the telecast of the sitcom <b><i>Etcetera, Etcetera</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imported canned sitcoms were numerous. ABS-CBN had <b><i>The Flying Nun</i></b>, <b><i>Get Smart</i></b>, <b><i>Hogan&rsquo;s Heroes</i></b>, <b><i>The Partners</i></b>, and<i> <b>The Partridge Family</b></i> while ABC Channel 5 aired the fantasy-comedy program <b><i>Bewitched</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>RBS Channel 7 imported the slapstick comedy <b><i>The Addams Family</i></b> and the romantic comedy <b><i>I Dream of Jeannie</i></b> while KBS Channel 9 aired the sitcoms <b><i>From a Bird&rsquo;s Eye View</i></b>, <b><i>Hey, Landlord</i></b>, <b><i>My Favorite Martian</i></b>, <b><i>My Mother the Car</i></b>, and <b><i>Temperatures Rising</i></b>; a slapstick comedy featuring one-liners, <b><i>Rowan &amp; Martin&rsquo;s Laugh In</i></b>; and the drama anthology <b><i>My World &hellip; and Welcome to It</i></b>. Early morning and mid-afternoon programs on RMN-IBC Channel 13 consisted of episodes of the original slapstick comedy series <b><i>The Three Stooges</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1358\"><strong>Game Shows</strong></a></b>. The visual medium of television offered greater audience involvement than radio in programs that featured contests and games with prizes. Perhaps the most popular of these shows in the 1960s was <b><i>Kuarta o Kahon</i></b> (Cash or Box), which debuted on ABS-CBN Channel 3 in 1962, with Pepe Pimentel as host. Contestants were asked to choose between a sum of money and a mystery prize inside a randomly selected box. This show lasted until 1969, but returned to television during the martial law era via Barangay Broadcasting Corporation (later renamed Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation) Channel 2, with Pepe Pimentel as the mainstay host. Other game shows on ABS-CBN were <b><i>Winner Take All </i></b>and the American canned show <b><i>The Game Game</i></b>. ABC RTV Channel 5 meanwhile aired <b><i>Kwarta Na!</i></b> (Money Already!), a game show where everyone seemed to win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A different type of game was on KBS Channel 9, the <b><i>Pintakasi</i></b>, a Sunday afternoon live television coverage of the Philippine betting game called <i>sabong</i> (cockfights) held in selected cockpits in the metropolis. Hosted by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4924\"><strong>Ray Pedroche</strong></a></strong>, <b><i>Pintakasi</i></b> afforded fans the convenience of watching a cockfight, called <i>tupada</i>, and the betting, too, without leaving home. <b><i>Pintakasi</i></b><i> </i>left the air in Sep 1972. Another betting game was on Channel 11, the weekend horse races at the San Lazaro and Santa Ana hippodromes. The announcer always began his spiels with the line, &ldquo;There they go &hellip; and they&rsquo;re running &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Children&rsquo;s Programs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1060\"><strong>Animation</strong></a></b>. TV stations invested in programs for children more during the postwar years than the subsequent periods of Philippine broadcasting. RBS Channel 7 aired the hour before lunchtime on Sundays the children&rsquo;s educational and entertainment program <b><i>Eskuwelahang Munti</i></b><i> </i>(Little Schoolhouse). The title was taken from a Tagalog motion picture of the same title starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4461\"><strong>Luis Gonzales</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a>. Another program on Channel 7 was the <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky Seven Club</i></b>, a weekly late afternoon television program where Bob Stewart interviewed youngsters and gave away prizes. Bespectacled and friendly, Stewart called himself everybody&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uncle Bob.&rdquo; On ABC Channel 5 was a short-lived children&rsquo;s program featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4849\"><strong>Subas Herrero</strong></a>, <b><i>Mr. Jumbo</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the few local programs KBS Channel 9 produced during the period was <b><i>Clubhouse 9</i></b>, the most popular local program on the station prior to the martial law period, which made its television debut in 1970. It was a late afternoon children&rsquo;s live television program hosted by veteran showman Pepe Pimentel inside the KBS studio filled with children accompanied by their parents or guardians. It went on the air Mondays to Saturdays, 5:30-7:00 pm. The show opened with a young boy or girl, a <i>bulilit</i> announcer, introducing both the program and the host. The term &ldquo;bulilit&rdquo; is a Tagalog idiomatic expression which means &ldquo;diminutive or extremely small.&rdquo; Pauline Bonnevie, the sister of local film actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4300\"><strong>Dina Bonnevie</strong></a>, was one of the most famous <i>bulilit</i> announcers of <b><i>Clubhouse 9</i></b>. Following in the style of veteran television broadcaster Robert &ldquo;Uncle Bob&rdquo; Stewart on Channel 7, Pimentel had himself called &ldquo;Tito Pepe&rdquo; (Uncle Pepe), a name that endeared him to both the studio audience and those watching on television. This moniker managed to stick to Pimentel even as he hosted other shows in future years including <b><i>Kuarta o Kahon</i></b> and <b><i>Family Kuarta o Kahon</i></b>. Toward the last quarter of 1971, <b><i>Clubhouse 9</i></b> acquired a right to broadcast the 1961 Japanese animated film <b><i>Alakazam the Great</i></b>, a 1960 Japanese musical animated film dubbed in English and narrated by American actor Sterling Holloway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the imported canned programs for children were animations, such as those that aired on ABS-CBN, including <b><i>Atom Ant</i></b>, <b><i>Birdman and the Galaxy Trio</i></b>, <b><i>Frankenstein Jr. and the Impossibles</i></b>, <b><i>The Hillbilly Bears</i></b>, <b><i>The Pebbles and Bam-Bam Show</i></b>, <b><i>Space Ghost</i></b>, and <b><i>Squidly Diddly</i></b>, all from Hanna-Barbera Productions; and <b><i>Super Six</i></b> from DePatie-Freleng Productions. The other American animated programs on the ABS-CBN channels were <b><i>Batfink</i></b>, <b><i>The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo</i></b>, <b><i>Farmer Al Falfa and His Terrytoon Pals</i></b>, <b><i>The Woody Woodpecker Show</i></b>, and <b><i>Walt Disney&rsquo;s Wonderful World of Color</i></b>. <b><i>Walt Disney&rsquo;s Wonderful World of Color</i></b> was not fully animated; it had live action segments featuring Disney himself. A favorite among the youngsters was the <b><i>Marvel Super Heroes</i></b> series featuring characters like <b><i>Captain America</i></b>, <b><i>The Sub-Mariner</i></b>, <b><i>The Mighty Thor</i></b>, <b><i>The Incredible Hulk</i></b>, and <b><i>The Invincible Ironman</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABC Channel 5 also imported animated programs such as <b><i>The Adventures of Johnny Quest</i></b>, <b><i>The Flintstones</i></b>, <b><i>Huckleberry Hound</i></b>, <b><i>Peter Potamus</i></b>, and <b><i>Ricochet Rabbit</i></b>, all from Hanna-Barbera Productions; and <b><i>Mighty Mouse</i></b> and <b><i>Heckle and Jeckle</i></b> of the Terrytoons line. <b><i>The Banana Splits Adventure Show</i></b>, a children&rsquo;s variety and musical program combining live action sequences and animated segments, likewise from Hanna-Barbera, also aired on Channel 5. <b><i>Gigantor</i></b>, a black-and-white animated program, made its Philippine debut on the same station. It is the first Japanese animated robot program aired on Philippine television, beating <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> by 10 years. Restored episodes of <b><i>Gigantor</i> </b>have been colorized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other stations also imported animated programs aimed at children. On RBS Channel 7 were American animated shows like <b><i>Popeye</i></b> (both prewar and postwar productions), <b><i>Beany and Cecil the Seasick <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1942\"><strong>Sea Serpent</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Gumby</i></b>, <b><i>Harveytoons</i></b>, <b><i>The New Three Stooges</i></b>, <b><i>Tales of the Genie</i></b>, <b><i>Sinbad the Sailor</i></b>, <b><i>The Dick Tracy Show</i></b>, and <b><i>Roger Ramjet</i></b>. The animated program lineup of Channel 7 likewise included <b><i>The Funny Company</i></b>, a part-animated, part-live action documentary show also produced in the United States, and episodes of a dialogue-free children&rsquo;s show about a nameless, costumed man with magical powers produced by Trans Tel Zeit of what was then known as West Germany. Weekday afternoons, Saturday mornings and afternoons, and a couple of hours on Sunday mornings were reserved for animated programs. KBS Channel 9 had a limited number of programs in its animation chest: <b><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></b>, <b><i>Archie&rsquo;s TV Funnies</i></b>, <b><i>Porky Pig</i></b>, and <b><i>Rocket Robin Hood</i></b>. These shows went on the air during the late afternoons. On RMN-IBC Channel 13 were the animated programs <b><i>Wally Gator</i></b> and <b><i>Magilla Gorilla</i></b> from Hanna-Barbera Productions, and <b><i>The Alvin Show</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1969, ABC Channel 5 hosted the Philippine premiere of the now classic American educational program <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b>. Filipinos were pleasantly surprised that the one-hour show had no commercial interruptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Movies on TV</b>. Television during the period became an outlet for old movies that would otherwise not enjoy exposure beyond their cinema runs. On the other hand, the films helped provide TV the material to fill its airtime. ABS-CBN Channel 3 aired several local films under the labels <b><i>Puting Tabing</i></b> (Silver Screen) in the morning and <b><i>Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1105\"><strong>Anino</strong></a>ng Gumagalaw</i></b> (Moving Shadows) in the afternoon. On ABC Channel 5, Tagalog motion pictures aired on prime time under the banners <b><i>Sinagtala</i></b> (Star Beam) and <b><i>Bahaghari</i></b><i> </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/985\"><strong>Rainbow</strong></a>). Those aired in the afternoons were under the label <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> ng Tahanan</i></b> (Joy of the Home).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As with the other program genres, foreign films were also on the air. ABS-CBN aired Hollywood films under the label <b><i>Color Movie Greats</i></b> for color films exhibited at night, <b><i>Movie Greats</i></b> for black-and-white films aired at night, <b><i>Command Performance</i></b> for afternoon films, and <b><i>Repeat Performance</i></b> for movie replays. During the summer months, the mid-afternoon slot was reserved for <b><i>Republic Serials</i></b>, which consisted of prewar and wartime black-and-white movies in serial form including <b><i>Batman</i></b>. On ABC Channel 5, Hollywood films were also aired under the label <b><i>Million Dollar Movies</i></b>, sponsored by the General Textile Company; Philippine Blooming Mills Inc, a steel manufacturing enterprise; Marvel, a detergent powder; Mikado, a Japanese brand of pomade; and Kaminomoto Oban, a Japanese brand of therapeutic plaster. Some non-American movies were also aired under this label. RBS Channel 7 aired American as well as Chinese movies, often with English subtitles, broadcast during Sunday afternoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early years of KBS Channel 9, almost all of its programs were canned American shows, with RBS Channel 7 as the only one that had more canned programs. Channel 9 aired numerous motion pictures, many of them horror or science fiction films and light dramas produced by American International Pictures, including <b><i>House of Usher</i></b>, <b><i>The Pit and the Pendulum</i></b>, <b><i>The Raven</i></b>, <b><i>Tales of Terror</i></b>, and <b><i>Pajama Party</i></b>. Hollywood films dominated Monday and Thursday evenings on KBS-TV. The movie date on Mondays was called <b><i>The KBS Spectacular of the Week</i></b> while the one on Thursdays was called <b><i>Thursday Night at the Movies</i></b>. When KBS started using the name Radio Philippines Network in 1974, <b><i>The KBS Spectacular of the Week</i></b> was renamed <b><i>The RPN Spectacular of the Week</i></b>. Night owls on Sunday evenings were treated to American horror movies under the label <b><i>Sunday Suspense Theatre</i></b> (<b><i>SST</i></b>). The first film it featured was <b><i>Daughter of the Mind</i></b> starring Ray Milland. After KBS ran out of American horror films for <b><i>SST</i></b>, the management resorted to syndicated British horror-mysteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were also Hollywood films on RMN IBC Channel 13, shown late at night under the labels <b><i>Armchair Theatre</i></b> and <b><i>Curtain Call</i></b>. Movies about war were featured under the title <b><i>War Classics</i></b>. Because of the acute lack of program materials on the station, <b><i>War Classics</i></b> was shown twice on the night it was scheduled for broadcasting. For the same reason, the station often broadcast filler films during the afternoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Sports</b>. The medium of television lent itself well to the spectacle of sports. Sports programs coincided with the seasonal staging of athletic events and the occasional international special sporting match. Among the memorable specials was the fight that made a boxing icon out of Gabriel &ldquo;Flash&rdquo; Elorde aired on ABS-CBN Channel 3. On 16 Mar 1960, the world junior lightweight boxing championship match between Elorde of the Philippines and Harold Gomes of the United States was held at the newly opened <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a> in Cubao, Quezon City, with 36,000 spectators filling the arena. Channel 3 brought the fight to households that had television sets. The television event was the first of its kind in the Philippines. Elorde won that fight, while ABS made history. In 1972, days before Marcos put the Philippines under martial law, KBS Channel 9 provided Philippine viewers with a live coverage of the 1972 Olympic Games held in Munich, West Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Long before the Philippine Basketball Association became famous, basketball enthusiasts in the country were loyal viewers of the games organized by the MICAA and broadcast on MBC&rsquo;s radio and television stations in the early part of the 1960s. Companies that fielded teams in the MICAA basketball games include the Manila Electric Company, Crispa-Floro, San Miguel Corporation, Yutivo Motors, and E. R. Squibb Pharmaceuticals. Problems regarding the television transmitter of MBC eventually forced the transfer of the radio and television coverage of the MICAA games to other broadcasting companies toward the later part of the 1960s. In the meantime, there was also an audience among the basketball-crazy Filipinos for the prerecorded games of the National Basketball Association in the United States, which went on the air through ABS-CBN. The Boston Celtics was the dominant team back then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RMN<b>-</b>IBC Channel 13 aired mostly canned programs because its studio was so small that it could accommodate only a news program production, but it managed to air <b><i>Fistorama</i></b>, because the coverage of the sporting events was done by remote broadcast rather than in a studio. <b><i>Fistorama</i></b> was a local primetime program featuring boxing matches between promising but unknown pugs looking for an opportunity to go big time. First aired on DZRH radio, it was annotated for Channel 13 by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\"><strong>Joe Cantada</strong></a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Specials and Documentaries</b>. By the late 1960s, local television had acquired the technological capacity to cover extraordinary events live, such as the Apollo 11 spaceship launch and its subsequent landing on the moon. On 16 Jul 1969, Channel 7, as the carrying station, broadcast the launch live via satellite simultaneously on all Philippine television channels. Stewart was chosen as the anchor of the Philippine segment annotating the long countdown to the actual space launch. The day was declared a national holiday in the Philippines to allow everybody to watch the historic space launch. A digital clock indicating the number of minutes left to actual lift-off was on the television screen. While on the air, Stewart interviewed Pres Ferdinand Marcos on the telephone a half hour prior to lift-off. During the actual conversation, Stewart was seen talking on the telephone with a photograph of Marcos inset in the corner of the screen. The Apollo 11 lunar landing on 20 Jul 1969 was also broadcast live via satellite simultaneously on all local television channels, again with Stewart as the anchor of the Philippine segment. Innumerable Filipinos watched both the space launch and the lunar landing, but the subsequent return flight of the Apollo 11 space capsule did not have the same enthusiastic viewership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to the Apollo 11 coverage, in 1968 ABS-CBN brought to Filipino audiences the first satellite transmission in the country&mdash;the aftermath of the assassination of Sen Robert Kennedy, a popular American political figure and younger brother of the late president John F. Kennedy, in Los Angeles, California. ABS-CBN also aired documentaries from the United States, among them the documentary anthology <b><i>Appointment with Destiny</i></b>. On Channel 7, an American program for dog owners, <b><i>Training You to Train Your Dog</i></b>, went on the air on late Saturday afternoons right before prime time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Station IDs and Promos</b>. Television stations promoted themselves by adopting logos and symbols, by having talking heads address the audience, and by producing vignettes that mixed pictures and sound and other special effects to create their respective distinctive brands. In 1963, when ABS-CBN tested the first color television transmission in the Philippines using technology imported from the United States, it also adopted a new logo&mdash;a square containing a symbolic transmitter antenna with radio waves. Three years later, in Jun 1966, the network began the commercial launch of its color television broadcasts using the same technology used by the Radio Corporation of America. Since not all local or imported programs broadcast by the network were in color, a color program was introduced by an animated sequence of the legendary <i>sarimanok </i>(a mythical bird with a fish in its beak) of Philippine Muslim lore formed by moving feathers and accompanied by the audio spiel, &ldquo;The following program is brought to you in living color&rdquo; delivered by veteran announcer Francisco &ldquo;Frankie&rdquo; Evangelista. Of course, the color program appeared in color only in a color television set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each primetime program on the two ABS-CBN television channels was introduced by a female talent, who interspersed her announcement with promotional spiels about a sponsor&rsquo;s product, usually a bath soap, a detergent, or cleansing cream. The segment took two to three minutes. Programs outside of prime time were introduced by a title card and the disembodied voice of Evangelista. For the station identification segments of ABS-CBN Channel 3, Evangelista&rsquo;s voice heralded, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on Channel 3, the extra member of your family&rdquo; simultaneously with a visual featuring the station identification card. This explains why ABS-CBN has been referring to itself as the <i>Kapamilya</i> (member of the family) network in contemporary times. As for ABS-CBN Channel 9, the promotional spiel was delivered by an unidentified female voice saying, &ldquo;The viewing is fine on Channel 9.&rdquo; As mentioned above, in 1969, ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Channel 9 moved to Channel 4 while Channel 3 moved to Channel 2 when KBS acquired a franchise to operate Channel 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On ABC Channel 5, each program, whether on prime time or otherwise, was introduced by the disembodied voice of a female announcer. Other spiels, including those promoting other programs, were voiced by a male announcer. Only a title card with a simple illustration provided the visual component of these promotional segments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1970, RBS Channel 7 embraced color television technology. Like he did on radio, Stewart personally promoted many products live on his television channel along with the station identification aired between programs. He appeared on a bare set, sitting on a bar stool with a product in hand. Through medium shots, close-ups, and extreme close-ups, Stewart enticed the viewer to consider, for instance, buying food products like Glendale Butter or toys from Panacraft and Toylandia, which were well-known toy stores of that time, as well as purchasing a new electronic product called the video tape recorder. Channel 7 had its fair share of loyal sponsors that placed 30-second and one-minute prerecorded advertisements within its regular programs. They included Air Manila (a competitor of Philippine Air Lines), Ultrabrite Toothpaste, Stork Margarine, Seven-Up soft drink, L&amp;M cigarettes, Frigid-Aire refrigerators, and Suntory Whiskey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of 1971, KBS Channel 9 promoted its programs by putting a spin on the name of the month. Thus, the station came out with labels like &ldquo;A September to Remember,&rdquo; &ldquo;Solid Gold October,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sweet November.&rdquo; From the start, KBS&rsquo;s Channel 9 broadcasts were in color. The management used the moniker &ldquo;Accucolor 9&rdquo; for its station&mdash;<i>accu</i> from <i>accurate</i>. All programs on KBS-TV, whether local or canned, were introduced by a male disembodied voice saying, &ldquo;the following program is brought to you in Accucolor.&rdquo; Only a visual card told the audience the title of the program. Channel 9 distinguished itself from the other television stations by framing a digital clock at the lower left-hand corner of its screen. The clock had four digits to indicate the hour and the minutes. In early 1972, the station used the clock with the promotional campaign called <b><i>Playtime with Television 9</i></b>. At randomly selected segments, once every hour for five hours in the evening, from five to ten o&rsquo;clock, Mondays to Fridays, a voice announced that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s playtime on Television 9!&rdquo; Right after this announcement was made, an arrow pointed to the digital clock. Then the voice recited the simple instructions of the game. The viewer is urged to jot down the time displayed on the digital clock at the exact moment the arrow appeared. If the viewer was able to get all five correct time indications, he was told to write them down on a piece of paper together with his/her name, address, and signature, and to place it in a sealed envelope and either mail it to the KBS headquarters in Pasay City, or drop in any <b><i>Playtime on Television 9</i></b> drop box found at designated supermarkets within the Greater Manila Area (at present the area referred to as Metro Manila). At the end of the promotion period, viewers who sent correct information participated in a raffle which entitled them to as many chances as they had correct entries. Dozens of Sony Trinitron color television sets, which were the most sought-after appliances during that time, awaited the winners. <b><i>Playtime on Television 9</i></b> provided the KBS-TV management valuable demographic data for media research purposes. It also enhanced consumer desire to acquire a color television set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since KBS owner Roberto Benedicto built his business empire on sugar, a brief musical-type documentary on the importance of the sugar industry to the Philippines featuring Filipino singers Sonny Cortez and Millie Mercado was broadcast at regular intervals on KBS-TV. Cortez and Mercado sang and danced to &ldquo;The Sugar Song,&rdquo; a medley of songs about sugar and sweetness such as &ldquo;Sugartime,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Spoonful of Sugar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roses Are Red, My Love.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sugar Song&rdquo;<b> </b>was produced by Vicor Records in 1971. The main sponsors of KBS-TV during the pre-martial law era were Silver Bell Ice Cream, Swedish Steak and Chicken House, Trusteeship Memorial Plans, and the Visayan Packing Corporation, which manufactured Vispac Pork and Beans. Film and television personalities Prospero Luna and Nanding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> were the principal promoters of the Vispac brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RMN-IBC Channel 13 aired a musical spiel about what day of the week it was. The spiels went like this, &ldquo;Today is Monday and Monday is unique &hellip;&rdquo; At exactly 6:00 pm of every broadcast day, the station ran a segment on The Angelus, an evening prayer Roman Catholics are expected to recite on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Television <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1346\"><strong>Advertisement</strong></a>s</b>.<b> </b>Advertisements on television were and continue to be called commercials. During the pre-martial law period, commercials were classified as imported and local commercials, commercials in English and in Tagalog, and one-minute and 30-second commercials. Imported products relied on foreign-produced commercials, although a number of imported products were promoted using both foreign-produced and locally produced commercials. Local products relied on commercials in either English or in Tagalog and the other major languages of the Philippines depending on the target audience. Filipino film and television industry actors were often employed to endorse local products. Major advertisers had both one-minute and 30-second versions of their commercials. The advertising industry called these commercials by the technical term &ldquo;spots.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Politicians of the period hardly used television for their campaign propaganda. In 1967, the opposing parties placed group advertisements of their senatorial candidates on prime time. These group advertisements featured very brief footage of each of the eight candidates of the political party in a span of 30 seconds. In 1969, Pres Marcos simply exploited his continuing exposure in the television news for his television campaign. The opposition candidate for president, Sen Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Jr, placed numerous campaign advertisements mostly on television channels not identified with either Marcos or Lopez. Only reelectionist senator Gil J. Puyat campaigned extensively on television. In 1971, only senatorial candidates Juan Ponce Enrile and Blas Ople campaigned using television. Their rivals from the Liberal Party did not bother to advertise on television; they simply exploited public sympathy following their having been injured when grenades exploded during their party proclamation rally at Plaza Miranda on 21 Aug 1971, and went around town in braces, plaster casts, and wheelchairs, followed by news teams from print and broadcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>News and Commentary</b> As mentioned above, news and news commentary increased in significance in the postwar years not only as a reaction to the scarcity of credible news during the Japanese occupation but also because the experience of war heightened the audience&rsquo;s sense of vigilance and interest in local as well as global politics and economics. Stations allocated airtime to news and news commentary, which increased as political rivalry during the Third Republic intensified and as the nation approached another perilous period, which began with the events leading up to the declaration of martial law. These, the media, including radio and television, chronicled, analyzed, and critiqued. While accusations that there were news persons whose pen could be bought may have been warranted, many played their role as the so-called watchdogs of those who run the government and others in power. The news media was so strident in its reporting and criticism and perceived as so influential in shaping public consciousness that when Marcos signed the proclamation placing the country under martial rule, the media was among the first to be silenced&mdash;literally, in the case of radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Until the simultaneous declaration of Philippine Independence from the United States and the inauguration of Pres Manuel Roxas in 1946, radio coverage of political events focused only on similar ceremonial political occasions and on war reporting in connection with World War II. In 1953, the use of broadcasting for partisan politics began when radio as well as the newly inaugurated DZAQ Channel 3 was mobilized for the election campaign for the presidency. This set a pattern for subsequent political contests. Cinema was likewise mobilized for political campaigns. In the 1965 presidential elections, Ferdinand Marcos anchored his campaign on the nationwide publicity generated by <b><i>Iginuhit ng Tadhana </i></b>(Destined by Fate), a motion picture about his life which was a success in box offices throughout the country. In the meantime, his vice presidential running mate Fernando Lopez enjoyed free publicity from the family-owned ABS-CBN broadcast network and their newspaper, the<b><i> Manila Chronicle</i></b>. While political campaigns often took the form of political ads, news programs and news commentaries were significant venues for airing political issues. All radio stations allocated time for news, although music stations tended to limit such airtime to short newsbreaks. The leading stations had 15-minute newscasts that aired daily, often twice a day, in the morning and at night. Commentary programs aired daily in the MBC and ABS-CBN radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most well-remembered commentator was Rafael Yabut, who started working with MBC as an electrician in its radio station DZRH. The management saw his ambition and potential and gave him a radio program called <b><i>Tayo&rsquo;y Mag-aliw</i></b> (Let&rsquo;s Have Fun). His other programs were <b><i>Ruleta Musikal</i></b><i> </i>(Musical Roulette), <b><i>Tatlo Lamang</i></b><i> </i>(Only Three), and <b><i>Gumising sa Pagsikat ng Araw</i></b> (Wake Up at Sunrise). It was in the early morning program <b><i>Gumising sa Pagsikat ng Araw</i></b> where Yabut reinvented himself into a hard-hitting radio commentator by criticizing government officials. His listeners loved his tirades and he developed a loyal following and the ire of those in the receiving end of his diatribes. In 1968, he survived a gunshot wound in what appeared to be an assassination attempt, then returned to his programs until the declaration of martial law in 1972. Another outspoken radio commentator was Damian Sotto, who dished out his attacks in DZAQ radio in the program <b><i>Mangatuwiran Ka</i></b> (Bring to Reason). Sotto was a staunch, opinionated critic of organized religion and corrupt government officials. Other announcers and commentators who joined DZAQ during that period include Joe Taruc and Rey Langit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABS-CBN&rsquo;s DZAQ <b><i>Radyo Patrol </i></b>(Patrol Radio), which began in 1968 after DZAQ exchanged its old 620 kHz frequency assignment for DZXL&rsquo;s 960 kHz, was proof of the increasing importance of news and public affairs programs in the late 1960s. It was an expensive proposition as the station invested not only in broadcast-equipped mobile patrols roaming the city; it required the hiring of news reporters that transmitted news stories to the stations throughout the day. <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b>, the brainchild of then ABS-CBN program director for radio and television <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4755\"><strong>Ben Aniceto</strong></a>, treated its listeners to a more or less sensational reportage of the day&rsquo;s news, especially fires, accidents, strikes, hostage situations, and robberies. In 1970, <b><i>Radyo Patrol </i></b>reported from all over what was then called Greater Manila Area and nearby provinces when Typhoon Yoling devastated Luzon. The transistor radio audience was tuned in, especially in the absence of television due to the power outages, making <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> the model for news reporting on radio since the period. Among its first reporters were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4950\"><strong>Barr Samson</strong></a>, Rey Langit, Emmy Arcilla, Mario Garcia, Vic Jose, Rey Pascua, Mario Crisostomo, Ysmael Reyes, Naldie Castro, Cris Daluz, Butch Gamboa, and Franklin Leocadio. They were later joined by Joe Taruc, Bobby Guanzon, Ely Aligora, Perry Alcudia, Joey Collantes, Bert Mercado, and Chat Guillermo. The studio anchors include Johnny Midnight, Eddie Ilarde, and Bessie Ocampo. The <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> format of news reporting was actually preceded by <b><i>Sound of the City </i></b>on RMN&rsquo;s DZHP in the early 1960s, but it was <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> that is still remembered today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stewart had three television programs on RBS-TV. The first was <b><i>The News with Uncle Bob</i></b>, where he delivered the late evening news, which he often editorialized. It was the television news program of the station, which first went on the air on 30 Oct 1961, a day after RBS-TV began its television broadcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Newscasts and commentaries were also on television. MBC Channel 11 aired the first television news programs in Tagalog, <b><i>Ano ang Balita</i></b><i> </i>(What&rsquo;s News), which ran from 1962 to 1972, and <b><i>Balitang Barbero</i></b> (Barber&rsquo;s News), which first aired in 1965. These newscasts were broadcast late at night, outside of prime time. In 1962, ABC Channel 5 produced the <b><i>The Big News</i></b>, which became the leading television news program of its time. The original newscasters of <b><i>The Big News</i></b> were Duds Rivera and Bong Lapira. Jose Ma. Velez joined the program in 1968 after Lapira moved to ABS-CBN. Rivera and Velez remained with ABC-RTV until the station was closed on the eve of the martial law era. In 1966, ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Channel 9 began airing <b><i>The World Tonight</i></b>, an evening news program anchored by Hal Bowie, Eric Eloriaga, and Henry Halasan at 8:30. The newscasters read the news from loose sheets of bond paper. Visuals consisted of still photographs inset on the screen. The photographs were mostly of top politicians, the facades of government buildings, and famous landmarks and logos. The following year, in 1967, <b><i>The World Tonight</i></b><i> </i>moved from Channel 9 to Channel 3 and aired at a later time, at ten o&rsquo;clock. Its vacated slot in Channel 9 was filled by <b><i>Newsbreak</i></b>, anchored by Bong Lapira, who was pirated in 1968 from <b><i>The Big News</i></b>, the rival evening news program on ABC-TV Channel 5. In 1970, KBS-TV launched <b><i>Newswatch</i></b>, aired nightly at ten o&rsquo;clock, with Harry Gasser as main anchor. Gasser used to be a newscaster of IBC Channel 13 before he joined KBS. The other newscasters in KBS-TV during this period were Babes Romualdez (now known as Babe Romualdez) and Frankie Abao. Meanwhile, on IBC Channel 13, the nightly news program was titled <b><i>Vigilantes</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio Mindanao Network&ndash;Inter-island Broadcasting Company&ndash;TV Channel 13 aired mostly canned programs because its studio was so small it could accommodate only a news program production. This program was given many titles, the last and most memorable of which was <b><i>Vigilantes</i></b>, which aired nightly<b><i> </i></b>from 1970 to 1972. Its opening billboard music was lifted from the theme of the 1969 James Bond motion picture <b><i>On Her Majesty&rsquo;s Secret Service</i></b>. <b><i>Vigilantes</i></b> began on RMN&rsquo;s DZHP radio, which continued alongside the television counterpart until 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On Sunday mornings, several newspaper columnists led by Leon O. Ty went live on Channel 7 to express their opinions on the latest events of national significance. MBC-TV was also known for the television talk show <b><i>Straight from the Shoulder</i></b> hosted by Luis &ldquo;Louie&rdquo; Beltran, a news reporter of the now-defunct <b><i>The Evening News</i></b>. It ran from 1970 to 1972. On ABS-CBN Channel 2, <b><i>Impact</i> </b>was a popular talk show hosted by veteran journalist Maximo Soliven. Even the irrepressible Rafael Yabut had a brief television program on Channel 7 called <b><i>The Rafael Yabut Show</i></b>. As expected of him, Yabut lambasted government officials, while almost all of the other commentators were critical of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 14 Nov 1967, ABS-CBN Channel 3 produced <b><i>Halalan &rsquo;67</i></b> (Election &rsquo;67), a 36-hour live television coverage of the results of the congressional elections nationwide. It was the first of its kind in television history, and from then on, almost all radio and television stations imitated its format of covering elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Elections for the presidency, the vice presidency, and eight seats in the Senate were held in Nov 1969. Pres Marcos and Vice Pres Lopez were running for reelection under the Nacionalista Party against Sen Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Jr, and Sen Genaro Magsaysay, respectively, under the opposition Liberal Party. Being the incumbent, Pres Marcos took advantage of his regular exposure in the broadcast news, instead of placing campaign advertisements on radio and television. <b><i>Pinagbuklod ng Langit</i></b><i> </i>(Joined by Heaven), a sequel to his earlier biographical film <b><i>Iginuhit ng Tadhana </i></b>(Destined by Fate), gave him nationwide publicity anew, and was even proclaimed Best Motion Picture of 1969 by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</strong></a>. <b><i>Pinagbuklod ng Langit</i></b><i> </i>starred Luis Gonzales and Gloria Romero. As in the other election campaigns, radio campaign jingles of Lopez regularly aired on ABS-CBN radio stations all over the country. For the 1969 campaign, his radio jingle opened with the phrase, &ldquo;<i>Si </i>Fernando Lopez<i>, walang kapares!</i>&rdquo; (Fernando Lopez has no match) and was followed by a series of rhyming lines highlighting his achievements starting with &ldquo;<i>Binigyan niya ng lunas ang ani ng bigas</i>&rdquo; (He found a solution to the problem of the rice harvest).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television was Osme&ntilde;a&rsquo;s choice for the bulk of his political campaign, which consisted of numerous afternoon and primetime advertisements mainly in stations that were not identified with either Marcos or Lopez. Osme&ntilde;a&rsquo;s propaganda focused on the shortcomings of the Marcos administration. Senator Gil J. Puyat was the only senatorial candidate in the 1969 elections who campaigned extensively on television. Puyat&rsquo;s television advertisements spelled out his surname and identified him as a man of integrity. He won reelection to the Senate under the NP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos and Lopez were reelected that year. Their second inauguration at the Luneta was covered extensively on radio and television. Marcos also got positive reviews from KBS, which highlighted the achievements of his administration in most of its broadcast news. As mentioned above, KBS operator Roberto Benedicto was a close Marcos supporter, whose franchise to run broadcast stations gave Marcos a dependable ally in the broadcast media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1971, popular sentiment had turned against the Marcos administration due to the public perception that despite the constitutional prohibition against a third consecutive term as president, Marcos was manipulating the 1971 Constitutional Convention to allow him to remain in office beyond 1973. Many broadcast journalists and radio commentators shared the sentiment. Moreover, student activism in the national capital and in adjoining areas was at its heyday, and military operatives from the now-defunct Philippine Constabulary often ended up in violent confrontations with student activists demonstrating near Malaca&ntilde;an Palace and the legislative building. These violent clashes made many broadcast journalists and radio announcers, particularly those from ABS-CBN and ABC, livid at the administration. The largely experimental DZUP radio of the University of the Philippines did not speak well of the Marcos administration either, and its broadcasts were widely noticed in spite of the limited reach of its signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the meantime, the close political ties between Pres Marcos and Vice Pres Lopez had begun to deteriorate as a result of numerous disagreements in years past between government regulators and the Lopez-owned Manila Electric Company (Meralco) over hikes in electricity rates. Friction between Marcos and Lopez actually began during their first term. Political analysts noticed that each time government regulators refused a petition by Meralco for an increase in the electricity rates to be imposed on consumers, the Lopez-owned newspaper <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b><i> </i>and some ABS-CBN radio and television programs hit the government. Readers of the newspaper began to notice that its editorial cartoons regularly put Marcos in a bad light. Its editorial section repeatedly used one and the same cartoon&mdash;an elderly male public school teacher asking his pupils a question and with all the pupils raising their hands, with the caption changing every time the cartoon is used. The caption bears the question asked by the teacher, always referring to a perceived anomaly committed by Marcos. The conflict between Marcos and Lopez became obvious when Lopez left his cabinet post as agriculture secretary in the same year, but retained his post as vice president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Coincidentally, a national midterm election was set for Nov 1971, with candidates from the pro-administration NP and the opposition LP contesting eight Senate seats, and all congressional and local government positions. In the evening of 21 Aug 1971, two grenades exploded at the LP proclamation rally held at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila, causing death and injury to many, including several LP senatorial candidates. The event created huge political capital against the NP, and the film clip taken of the bombing was the best political propaganda for the LP. ABS-CBN announced that it was going to broadcast the footage. Senator Jose Roy of the NP tried to legally stop the broadcast but failed. The footage went on the air on ABS-CBN-TV Channel 3, further alienating Pres Marcos from Vice Pres Lopez and his brother Eugenio Sr. To cover the results of the 1971 election, the ABS-CBN television stations came out with <b><i>Bilang ng Bayan</i></b> (Nation&rsquo;s Count). An instrumental rendition of &ldquo;Pilipinas Kong Mahal&rdquo; (My Beloved Philippines) was repeatedly played in the background in the ending segment of the live coverage. Six LP candidates and two NP candidates won in the senatorial race. Radio and television personality Eddie Ilarde won his seat in the Senate under the LP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bombing of the opposition Liberal Party proclamation rally at Plaza Miranda increased the anti-Marcos sentiment of the people and media persons, including broadcasters. Toward the end of 1971, the political allies of Pres Marcos were branded by the media, radio especially, as &ldquo;<i>mga tuta ni</i> Marcos&rdquo;&mdash;lapdogs of the president. News commentators on television were likewise critical of the administration, including Beltran on Channel 11 and Velez on Channel 5. By the middle of 1972, ABC owner Joaquin Roces was openly identified with political forces opposed to the Marcos administration. Roces was particularly close to Sen Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr of the LP, the most outspoken critic and political nemesis of Pres Marcos. Before Aquino entered politics, he had started as a reporter of the Roces newspaper <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>, the same newspaper that continuously lambasted the Marcos administration in the years prior to the proclamation of martial law. Roces was also close to Maximo Soliven, who persistently criticized Marcos in his column in the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b>. Roces also openly supported his newscaster Jose Ma. Velez when the latter ran for a delegate&rsquo;s seat in the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Velez was elected to represent the first district of Rizal Province. He was one of several convention delegates openly against allowing Pres Marcos to perpetuate himself in power under a new constitution (Roces 1983; Velez 1986).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1972, Soliven&rsquo;s <b><i>Impact</i> </b>had become a popular talk show on ABS-CBN-TV Channel 2 for its intense fiscalizing of the Marcos administration. Soliven, a known supporter of the political opposition, had Senator Aquino on <b><i>Impact </i></b>on 13 Sep 1972. Aquino had just delivered a privilege speech at the Senate where he exposed &ldquo;Operation Sagittarius,&rdquo; the plan of Marcos to place Metro Manila and outlying areas under the control of the Philippine Constabulary, and subsequently place the entire country under martial law. Marcos was going to use the recent bombings in the Greater Manila Area, including the one at Plaza Miranda, as a justification for his takeover and subsequent authoritarian rule. Aquino repeated his words to Soliven at his program and to a shocked audience. It seemed that, indeed, only an extraordinary measure like resorting to martial law could turn the tide in favor of the administration&mdash;and that is precisely what happened in Sep 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It has been widely assumed that Marcos declared martial law on 21 Sep 1972. However, radio, television, and newspaper operations appeared normal until 22 Sep 1972. That evening, the convoy of defense secretary Juan Ponce Enrile was ambushed in Wack-Wack as he was going home to Dasmari&ntilde;as Village in Makati before 9:00 pm. Enrile revealed in 1986 that the ambush had been staged by Marcos to justify martial law, although he subsequently retracted his statement. In the morning of 23 Sep 1972, a stunned nation woke up to a silent radio and blank TV screen. The newspapers were nowhere to be seen either. People would later find out that all television and radio stations as well as newspaper operations had been padlocked by the Constabulary, except Benedicto&rsquo;s KBS Channel 9 and sister radio stations, through which Marcos announced the declaration of martial law at 7:15 in the evening of 23 Sep 1972. The following morning, the Sunday edition of Benedicto&rsquo;s newspaper <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i></b> bannered the headline in all capital letters, &ldquo;FM DECLARES MARTIAL LAW.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos had Aquino and several opposition leaders jailed, as well as a number of media persons including Roces, Soliven, Velez, and Beltran. Eugenio Lopez Sr was in the United States at the time, so he escaped arrest, but his son Eugenio Jr was incarcerated. The media operations that were slowly coming back toward the end of 1972 became tame, cowed by the conditions of the authoritarian rule of Marcos and his military arm, or had changed hands, most of them to Marcos cronies. It was another dark era in the history of the Philippines. The broadcast industry, as well as the rest of the media, for the most part lost its vibrancy.<em><strong>Written by Victor C.

				"value": "Broadcasting in the Philippines in the years following World War II bore a strong imprint of American colonial broadcasting in spite of and possibly in reaction to the Japanese imposition of its culture and anti-American propaganda via radio. American music and talk as well as the new format of soap opera, fueled by advertising, filled the air. News and news commentary increased in significance as Filipinos continued to hunger for credible news that was in short supply during the war. However, the impact of the Japanese cultural policy left traces, which were evident on many cultural fronts, including radio. With both Nihongo and Tagalog proclaimed as official languages of the country, Tagalog surpassed English as the language of broadcasting during the war, even as daily on-air lessons on Nihongo were intended to supplant English. While English returned as the dominant language of broadcasting after World War II, Tagalog maintained a clear and growing presence. Other Filipino languages also flourished on the air as new radio stations began to operate outside Manila, mindful of the audience expecting broadcasters to speak their tongue. This trend extended to music played on radio and later on television as the Philippine recording industry was born and began to press records of local talent singing traditional Filipino songs and more recent local compositions as well as covers of foreign songs."

As it was before the war, Americans as well as Filipinos invested in the rising broadcast industry, until the 1973 constitution restricted ownership of all media businesses to Filipinos. But there was a noticeable increase in the number of Filipinos staking their claim on the operation of radio and television. Not only was it profitable in the case of commercial stations; it was believed powerful not only in selling products but also in shaping tastes, captivating audiences, and molding consciousness that won elections and consolidated political power. In the postwar years, politics and economics became even more intensely intertwined with broadcasting as it became not only a profitable investment but also an arena of political power matches."

It was first managed by the US Department of National Defense Office of War Information, then turned over to the newly organized United States Information Service (USIS) under the US State Department. To encourage the revival of commercial broadcasting, the US Congress passed a law empowering Sergio Osme&#xF1;a, who became Philippine Commonwealth president upon the death of Manuel Quezon in the United States while awaiting the end of World War II, to grant temporary radio operating permits to private citizens and groups."

However, the motive for profit was often coupled with the imperative to acquire or maintain political power through the media, which in turn protected the business interests of those who invested in media. This symbiosis led to a trend that became more transparent with the entry of television in the early 1950s. As the number of radio stations multiplied and audience numbers rose, the idea of television appeared more promising, which led to several radio stations expanding into radio-television networks. Furthermore, broadcast operations were often integrated with newspaper publishing, so newspapers and broadcasting mutually promoted and strengthened each other as well as other investments of their owners."

The station was renamed DZFE, which later became an FM station, allowing FEBC to apply for a new franchise for DZAS on AM. The evangelists behind FEBC, not to be confused with the prewar Far East Broadcasting Corporation, broadcast in China beginning in 1945, but the civil war between nationalist and communist forces forced it to move its operations elsewhere. The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines did not follow suit in using radio for evangelization until 1969 when it began operations of DWRV Radio Veritas, which had the strongest radio transmitter in Southeast Asia prior to the imposition of martial law in the Philippines in Sep 1972. While some universities operated commercial radio, the University of the Philippines (UP) in Diliman, Quezon City, started noncommercial shortwave radio experiments from its College of Engineering building under the call letters <a href=\"/8/69/4826\"><strong>DZUP</strong></a> in 1958. When the station ran out of funds the following year, the UP Alumni Association raised funds to help keep the radio station operating. Later the University moved its studio to the College of Arts and Sciences and began broadcasting on the AM band. In 1964, the University of the Philippines in Los Ba&#xF1;os, Laguna, established DZLB to provide educational programs to the rural communities surrounding the campus. In 1965, notwithstanding DZFM and the growing network of PBS stations around the country, the government&#x2019;s National Media Production Center (NMPC) under the Office of the President began operating DZRP, the Voice of the Philippines (VOP), on both the AM and shortwave bands.

It allowed the listener to adjust bass and treble through the twist of a knob. The stereo also doubled as a piece of decorative furniture because of its polished wooden exterior. Mass production of various models made the stereo affordable. National and Radiowealth were the leading stereo brands at that time. The popularity of the stereo inevitably created an audience for FM radio transmissions, which was tried in the 1950s but did not succeed due to the absence of FM-capable radio sets. This time, broadcast companies saw an opportunity and made plans for going on the air via the FM band. The first to do so was DZFX of the Makati Broadcasting Network, which went on the air in 1968. The first successful commercial FM station in the country broadcast mood music, film soundtracks, and period pieces with high-fidelity stereophonic sound. Its studio and transmitter were located at the top of the new Insular Life Building along Ayala Ave in Makati, which was then a municipality of Rizal Province."

By 1968, sources put the number at more than 200, and 280 just before martial law was declared in 1972. It was an indication of the burgeoning audience, driven partly by the availability of a new radio technology&#x2014;the transistor&#x2014;beginning around the end of the 1950s. The new radio sets were portable and could be operated on small batteries, a stark contrast to the older radio appliance that was heavy and bulky and that required connection to an electrical outlet. Moreover, the sets, imported from the United States and Japan, were designed to receive FM transmissions. When the local manufacture of portable transistor radio receiver sets and radio-phonographs, such as those made by Avegon, brought the price of the sets down, the audience size grew exponentially. However, while radio remained the most popular mass medium of the time, television began to captivate audiences before the decade of the 1950s was over. The story of its growth cannot be divorced from the political motivations of its pioneers in the Philippines."

By the middle of 1952, Pres Elpidio Quirino was eyeing reelection in the Nov 1953 polls. His administration was perceived as corrupt by many, especially the youth. Antonio Quirino, a former trial court judge and the younger brother of President Quirino, saw radio and television as means to counter public opinion and improve the chances of the reelection of the president. He had a problem to overcome though&#x2014;Congress was not willing to grant him a legislative franchise. Antonio Quirino found a solution through Lindenberg. Before 1952 was over, Antonio Quirino bought 70 percent of BEC from Lindenberg, became a partner of the American businessman, and renamed the venture the Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), with DZAQ as its call letters. Alto is a combination of AL, the first two letters of the nickname of Qurino&#x2019;s wife, Aleli Guzman-Quirino, and TO, the first two letters of Tony, his nickname. The letters A and Q in DZAQ are the initials of Antonio Quirino. With BEC&#x2019;s television franchise, ABS obtained permission to transmit television signals on Channel 3. The original ABS radio studio was located along Florentino Torres St in the Santa Cruz district of Manila, where the newsrooms of the leading newspapers of the period were situated. Its transmitter was located at a corner lot along P. Guevarra St, right across Sitio Alto, a large estate in the district of Little Baguio in San Juan, which was then a municipality of Rizal province.

In 1953, that amount was enough to acquire 120 bulky RCA Victor television sets manufactured by the Radio Corporation of America, then the leading brand in the United States known for its high fidelity or capability of faithfully reproducing sound. By the middle of 1953, Quirino had convinced rich families in Manila and the suburbs to buy RCA Victor television sets, with each one costing at least 1,200 pesos&#x2014;the equivalent of several months of an average salary in Manila, with the minimum daily wage then set at four pesos. It was considered a status symbol to own a television set, so wealthy and prominent families bought them. Quirino invested the profit he realized from the sales of the TV sets in the business. To generate a bigger audience, Quirino published and distributed announcements inviting the general public to see the new medium at strategic areas in the commercial districts of Manila in early Oct 1953. From six to ten o&#x2019;clock every evening, selected establishments located at the Quiapo, Santa Cruz, and Binondo districts of Manila opened RCA Victor television sets at their respective display areas for everyone to watch what Quirino called &#x201C;the pre-inaugural telecasts of DZAQ-TV Channel 3.&#x201D; The television sets were located at Poulex Department Store and Kairuz Department Store along the Escolta; Sub Bros and Francis Department Store along Dasmari&#xF1;as St; 15&#xA2; and Up Department Store and Automatic Electrical Appliances store along Rizal Ave; Joe&#x2019;s Radio and Electrical Supply along Raon St (now Gonzalo Puyat St); and the Saulog Transportation ticket office along Florentino Torres St."

When Marcos declared martial law in 1972, ABS-CBN was taken over by government and Benedicto. In 1986, after Marcos&#x2019;s ouster, the Lopezes recovered one television station and a number of radio stations."

When the war ended, Stewart remained in the country and went into the radio and television industry in the Philippines. Stewart married a Filipina, Loreto Feliciano, with whom he put up the corporation Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc on 1 Mar 1950. On 14 Jun 1950, the corporation established DZBB Radio, operating from the fourth floor of the Calvo Building on the Escolta. Stewart played an active role in the radio station, doing most of the promotional announcements himself. In 1955, the couple expanded their operation to include DZXX, an AM-band station with a music format. It was the first popular music radio station in the country. In 1957, DZBB and DZXX moved their operations from the Escolta to a new site near Kamuning in Diliman, Quezon City. On 29 Oct 1961, Stewart became part of the television landscape through DZBB-TV Channel 7. His radio and television business was now located at a building of its own along EDSA in Diliman, Quezon City, with its transmitter tower right beside the building.

American voices stayed on but began to be edged out by Filipinos. English persisted as the gold standard of radio announcing, but Tagalog and other languages in the regions slowly but surely took over the air lanes. Western popular music endured but the development of the local recording industry introduced many songbirds whose fame on radio rivaled those of American and English music icons. The new art of the soap opera, the <i>bodabil</i>-inspired variety shows that included comedy skits and quizzes, and amateur singing contests hooked legions of listeners of all ages to the radio set. Advertising nourished the medium and its popularity was fanned by the new technology of the portable, battery-operated, and relatively inexpensive transistor radio.

However, as in the early years of radio, television owners invested in programming in the belief that television would eventually become a profitable business. In the meantime, programs had to be put on the air. There were two sources: American TV stations that sold canned serials and existing local radio programs transmuted into the visual medium. Buying canned shows from the United States was a practice that prevailed for decades as it was a lot less expensive to buy them than produce original shows. Moreover, it was a guaranteed investment as the Filipino audience was already conditioned to enjoy American programs. But while it was more capital-intensive to produce television programs locally, the formats and popularity of several radio shows suggested that they could be migrated to television successfully in terms of production values and audience reception. Besides, the television owners also owned the counterpart radio stations that produced the thriving programs on radio. That gamble paid off. Thus, early television programs in the country had their origins in radio. Many carried the original radio titles while others used new program titles but with the same formats. From the 1960s up to 1972, television stations in the Philippines broadcast from five o&#x2019;clock in the morning and ended their broadcast day at midnight, supported and sustained by advertising. It was an indication of a growing and loyal television audience."

It was an expensive proposition as the station invested not only in broadcast-equipped mobile patrols roaming the city; it required the hiring of news reporters that transmitted news stories to the stations throughout the day. <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b>, the brainchild of then ABS-CBN program director for radio and television <a href=\"/8/69/4755\"><strong>Ben Aniceto</strong></a>, treated its listeners to a more or less sensational reportage of the day&#x2019;s news, especially fires, accidents, strikes, hostage situations, and robberies. In 1970, <b><i>Radyo Patrol </i></b>reported from all over what was then called Greater Manila Area and nearby provinces when Typhoon Yoling devastated Luzon. The transistor radio audience was tuned in, especially in the absence of television due to the power outages, making <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> the model for news reporting on radio since the period. Among its first reporters were <a href=\"/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a>, <a href=\"/8/69/4950\"><strong>Barr Samson</strong></a>, Rey Langit, Emmy Arcilla, Mario Garcia, Vic Jose, Rey Pascua, Mario Crisostomo, Ysmael Reyes, Naldie Castro, Cris Daluz, Butch Gamboa, and Franklin Leocadio. They were later joined by Joe Taruc, Bobby Guanzon, Ely Aligora, Perry Alcudia, Joey Collantes, Bert Mercado, and Chat Guillermo. The studio anchors include Johnny Midnight, Eddie Ilarde, and Bessie Ocampo. The <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> format of news reporting was actually preceded by <b><i>Sound of the City </i></b>on RMN&#x2019;s DZHP in the early 1960s, but it was <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> that is still remembered today."

These newscasts were broadcast late at night, outside of prime time. In 1962, ABC Channel 5 produced the <b><i>The Big News</i></b>, which became the leading television news program of its time. The original newscasters of <b><i>The Big News</i></b> were Duds Rivera and Bong Lapira. Jose Ma. Velez joined the program in 1968 after Lapira moved to ABS-CBN. Rivera and Velez remained with ABC-RTV until the station was closed on the eve of the martial law era. In 1966, ABS-CBN&#x2019;s Channel 9 began airing <b><i>The World Tonight</i></b>, an evening news program anchored by Hal Bowie, Eric Eloriaga, and Henry Halasan at 8:30. The newscasters read the news from loose sheets of bond paper. Visuals consisted of still photographs inset on the screen. The photographs were mostly of top politicians, the facades of government buildings, and famous landmarks and logos. The following year, in 1967, <b><i>The World Tonight</i></b><i> </i>moved from Channel 9 to Channel 3 and aired at a later time, at ten o&#x2019;clock. Its vacated slot in Channel 9 was filled by <b><i>Newsbreak</i></b>, anchored by Bong Lapira, who was pirated in 1968 from <b><i>The Big News</i></b>, the rival evening news program on ABC-TV Channel 5. In 1970, KBS-TV launched <b><i>Newswatch</i></b>, aired nightly at ten o&#x2019;clock, with Harry Gasser as main anchor. Gasser used to be a newscaster of IBC Channel 13 before he joined KBS. The other newscasters in KBS-TV during this period were Babes Romualdez (now known as Babe Romualdez) and Frankie Abao. Meanwhile, on IBC Channel 13, the nightly news program was titled <b><i>Vigilantes</i></b>."

Pres Marcos and Vice Pres Lopez were running for reelection under the Nacionalista Party against Sen Sergio Osme&#xF1;a Jr, and Sen Genaro Magsaysay, respectively, under the opposition Liberal Party. Being the incumbent, Pres Marcos took advantage of his regular exposure in the broadcast news, instead of placing campaign advertisements on radio and television. <b><i>Pinagbuklod ng Langit</i></b><i> </i>(Joined by Heaven), a sequel to his earlier biographical film <b><i>Iginuhit ng Tadhana </i></b>(Destined by Fate), gave him nationwide publicity anew, and was even proclaimed Best Motion Picture of 1969 by the <a href=\"/4/26/4436\"><strong>Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</strong></a>. <b><i>Pinagbuklod ng Langit</i></b><i> </i>starred Luis Gonzales and Gloria Romero. As in the other election campaigns, radio campaign jingles of Lopez regularly aired on ABS-CBN radio stations all over the country. For the 1969 campaign, his radio jingle opened with the phrase, &#x201C;<i>Si </i>Fernando Lopez<i>, walang kapares!</i>&#x201D; (Fernando Lopez has no match) and was followed by a series of rhyming lines highlighting his achievements starting with &#x201C;<i>Binigyan niya ng lunas ang ani ng bigas</i>&#x201D; (He found a solution to the problem of the rice harvest)."

Puyat was the only senatorial candidate in the 1969 elections who campaigned extensively on television.

Many broadcast journalists and radio commentators shared the sentiment. Moreover, student activism in the national capital and in adjoining areas was at its heyday, and military operatives from the now-defunct Philippine Constabulary often ended up in violent confrontations with student activists demonstrating near Malaca&#xF1;an Palace and the legislative building. These violent clashes made many broadcast journalists and radio announcers, particularly those from ABS-CBN and ABC, livid at the administration. The largely experimental DZUP radio of the University of the Philippines did not speak well of the Marcos administration either, and its broadcasts were widely noticed in spite of the limited reach of its signal."

Friction between Marcos and Lopez actually began during their first term. Political analysts noticed that each time government regulators refused a petition by Meralco for an increase in the electricity rates to be imposed on consumers, the Lopez-owned newspaper <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b><i> </i>and some ABS-CBN radio and television programs hit the government. Readers of the newspaper began to notice that its editorial cartoons regularly put Marcos in a bad light. Its editorial section repeatedly used one and the same cartoon&#x2014;an elderly male public school teacher asking his pupils a question and with all the pupils raising their hands, with the caption changing every time the cartoon is used. The caption bears the question asked by the teacher, always referring to a perceived anomaly committed by Marcos. The conflict between Marcos and Lopez became obvious when Lopez left his cabinet post as agriculture secretary in the same year, but retained his post as vice president."

In the evening of 21 Aug 1971, two grenades exploded at the LP proclamation rally held at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila, causing death and injury to many, including several LP senatorial candidates. The event created huge political capital against the NP, and the film clip taken of the bombing was the best political propaganda for the LP. ABS-CBN announced that it was going to broadcast the footage. Senator Jose Roy of the NP tried to legally stop the broadcast but failed. The footage went on the air on ABS-CBN-TV Channel 3, further alienating Pres Marcos from Vice Pres Lopez and his brother Eugenio Sr. To cover the results of the 1971 election, the ABS-CBN television stations came out with <b><i>Bilang ng Bayan</i></b> (Nation&#x2019;s Count). An instrumental rendition of &#x201C;Pilipinas Kong Mahal&#x201D; (My Beloved Philippines) was repeatedly played in the background in the ending segment of the live coverage. Six LP candidates and two NP candidates won in the senatorial race. Radio and television personality Eddie Ilarde won his seat in the Senate under the LP."

News commentators on television were likewise critical of the administration, including Beltran on Channel 11 and Velez on Channel 5. By the middle of 1972, ABC owner Joaquin Roces was openly identified with political forces opposed to the Marcos administration. Roces was particularly close to Sen Benigno &#x201C;Ninoy&#x201D; Aquino Jr of the LP, the most outspoken critic and political nemesis of Pres Marcos. Before Aquino entered politics, he had started as a reporter of the Roces newspaper <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>, the same newspaper that continuously lambasted the Marcos administration in the years prior to the proclamation of martial law. Roces was also close to Maximo Soliven, who persistently criticized Marcos in his column in the<b><i> Manila Times</i></b>. Roces also openly supported his newscaster Jose Ma. Velez when the latter ran for a delegate&#x2019;s seat in the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Velez was elected to represent the first district of Rizal Province. He was one of several convention delegates openly against allowing Pres Marcos to perpetuate himself in power under a new constitution (Roces 1983; Velez 1986)."

Soliven, a known supporter of the political opposition, had Senator Aquino on <b><i>Impact </i></b>on 13 Sep 1972. Aquino had just delivered a privilege speech at the Senate where he exposed &#x201C;Operation Sagittarius,&#x201D; the plan of Marcos to place Metro Manila and outlying areas under the control of the Philippine Constabulary, and subsequently place the entire country under martial law. Marcos was going to use the recent bombings in the Greater Manila Area, including the one at Plaza Miranda, as a justification for his takeover and subsequent authoritarian rule. Aquino repeated his words to Soliven at his program and to a shocked audience. It seemed that, indeed, only an extraordinary measure like resorting to martial law could turn the tide in favor of the administration&#x2014;and that is precisely what happened in Sep 1972."

Enrile revealed in 1986 that the ambush had been staged by Marcos to justify martial law, although he subsequently retracted his statement. In the morning of 23 Sep 1972, a stunned nation woke up to a silent radio and blank TV screen. The newspapers were nowhere to be seen either. People would later find out that all television and radio stations as well as newspaper operations had been padlocked by the Constabulary, except Benedicto&#x2019;s KBS Channel 9 and sister radio stations, through which Marcos announced the declaration of martial law at 7:15 in the evening of 23 Sep 1972.

The media operations that were slowly coming back toward the end of 1972 became tame, cowed by the conditions of the authoritarian rule of Marcos and his military arm, or had changed hands, most of them to Marcos cronies. It was another dark era in the history of the Philippines. The broadcast industry, as well as the rest of the media, for the most part lost its vibrancy.<em><strong>Written by Victor C.

Marcos, through Proclamation 1081, lasted from 21 Sep 1972 until 17 Jan 1981 when Marcos officially lifted it by way of Proclamation 2045. The latter proclamation notwithstanding, authoritarian government remained, as seen in the power of Marcos to continue to legislate concurrently with the Batasang Pambansa, the legislative assembly under the 1973 Constitution. From 1981 up to early 1986, the military could still order the arrest and detention of citizens, media personnel included, and shut down any periodical or broadcast station for virtually any reason. It is from this perspective that martial law in the Philippines is seen as the period covering 21 Sep 1972 up to the downfall of the Marcos administration on 25 Feb 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a id=\"imposition\" name=\"imposition\"></a><strong>The Imposition of Law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The start of the 1970s was a period of political unrest in the Philippines, especially in the national capital and its suburbs. A communist insurgency was threatening the country, an armed secessionist movement was creating trouble in Mindanao, and student activism was at its apex. By the middle of 1972, Marcos was more than halfway into his second term as president and his political enemies were getting ready for the Nov 1973 presidential elections. The 1935 Constitution, the charter then in force, denied Marcos a third term. Other events that marked the period were the infamous Plaza Miranda bombing in Quiapo, Manila, on 21 Aug 1971 and the staged assassination attempt on then defense secretary Juan Ponce Enrile hours before the declaration of martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The political scenario literally changed overnight when Marcos signed Proclamation 1081 on 21 Sep 1972, placing the entire country under martial law, a prerogative granted to him by the Constitution. Marcos coordinated the seizure of power during the night of the implementation of martial law through the national military telephone alert system of the country, which was installed by the United States Agency for International Development in the late 1960s. The proclamation, however, was made public two days later on 23 Sep 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Closure of Media Companies</b>.<b> </b>A major step in the execution of martial law was the closure of the media companies that was specified in Letter of Instruction 1. Newspapers and magazines expected at the news stands and from delivery personnel never made it to their destinations in the early morning of 23 Sep 1972. There were no programs on radio or television either. Hours before daybreak, all print and media facilities were closed down by armed soldiers from the Philippine Constabulary following orders from the secretary of the Department of National Defense (DND) and then secretary of the Department of Public Information (DPI) Francisco Tatad. Gen Fidel Ramos was the chief of the Philippine Constabulary, a unit of the Armed Forces of the Philippines responsible for maintaining order in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon the proclamation of martial law, the government shut down 15 of the 16 daily newspapers, six of the seven TV stations, and all radio services. The major radio and television facilities shut down by the government included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> of Eugenio &ldquo;Kapitan&rdquo; Lopez Sr, which operated two TV channels and the daily newspaper <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>; the Associated Broadcasting Corporation (ABC-RTV-DZMT) of Joaquin &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Roces, who owned the newspaper <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>; the Republic Broadcasting System (RBS-DZBB) of American war correspondent Robert &ldquo;Uncle Bob&rdquo; Stewart; the Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (MBC-DZRH) of the Elizalde brothers Maestro Federico, former ambassador Joaquin Miguel &ldquo;JM,&rdquo; and Manuel &ldquo;Don Manolo&rdquo; Sr; and the Radio Mindanao Network&ndash;Inter-island Broadcasting Corporation (RMN-IBC) of Andres Soriano Sr, the brothers Don Henry and Atty <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4779\"><strong>Reuben Canoy</strong></a> of Cagayan de Oro City, Robin Cui, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3739\"><strong>Vicente Rivera</strong></a>.

Fr James Reuter, SJ, one of the early producer-directors on Philippine radio and television, narrates in an interview that the radio transmitters of Radio Veritas in Malolos, Bulacan, were smashed with clubs by a truckload of goons. Radio station <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4826\"><strong>DZUP</strong></a> in the Engineering Building and in the Arts and Sciences Building of the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City, was raided and its equipment completely destroyed. All other radio stations in Metro Manila were also raided, with guards posted on the premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Everyone in the media who were known or even suspected to be critics of the Marcos administration were also detained at the stockades, mostly in Camp Crame in Quezon City. Among those in the broadcast media who were detained when martial law was proclaimed were Eugenio &ldquo;Geny&rdquo; Lopez Jr, the son of the owner of ABS-CBN; Joaquin Roces; Jose Mari Velez, news anchorman of ABC-RTV-DZMT; and talk show hosts Maximo Soliven and Luis Beltran.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two incumbent senators who were immediately detained upon the proclamation of martial law were Benigno Aquino Jr and Jose W.

The <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i></b> and KBS-RPN were owned and operated by Roberto S. Benedicto, a sugar baron from the south, a staunch ally and fraternity brother of Pres Marcos. Both were explicitly allowed by Pres Marcos to operate on 23 Sep 1972 and onward.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 23 Sep 1972 issue of the <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i></b> revealed that Pres Marcos resorted to martial law to &ldquo;save the Republic&rdquo; from, among others, the communist insurgency. Appearing on KBS-RPN TV Channel 9 that day, the secretary of the DPI confirmed that the Philippines had been placed under martial law by the president. Subsequent announcements from Malaca&ntilde;an Palace were also aired at irregular and largely unpredictable hours of the day. Before nightfall, Marcos himself appeared live on the same TV channel confirming what everybody had already known. In that same appearance, Marcos answered questions from a panel of three journalists from abroad in an interview conducted live via satellite. He assured his audience, and the world for that matter, that martial law was not a military takeover of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In between announcements from Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, KBS-RPN 9 broadcast an endless array of animation programs. There were no commercial advertisements on the air until regular programming resumed before the end of Sep 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Legality of Marcos Edicts</b>.<b> </b>The proclamation of martial law was scheduled in a way that Pres Marcos could institutionalize one-man rule legally. When Pres Marcos proclaimed martial law, Congress was not in session. Leaders of Congress could not convene the legislature because soldiers had closed down the legislative building. Moreover, numerous leaders of the political opposition party were thrown in the stockades, and those who managed to escape the dragnet fled abroad. Since the martial law government had no qualms about imprisoning incumbent members of Congress, the idea of convening the legislature to undo martial law seemed unthinkable.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Sep 1972, the 1971 Constitutional Convention had not yet finished its task of drafting a new charter for the country. Many of its delegates who were perceived as enemies of the state were likewise detained in military camps. Those who were not arrested were mostly pro-Marcos people who finished the charter toward the end of 1972. The draft charter gave Marcos unbridled power under its transitory provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pres Marcos submitted the draft charter for ratification by the people not through a plebiscite as mandated by the 1935 Constitution then in force, but through so-called citizens assemblies purportedly created all over the country. In Jan 1973, Marcos announced that the 1973 Constitution was approved by the people. Three months later, the Supreme Court agreed and ruled that the new charter was in force and effect (<i>Javellana v. The Executive Secretary</i>, 50 SCRA 30, 1973). That ruling was followed by an equally controversial pronouncement declaring that all orders and decrees issued by Pres Marcos have the force and effect of law (<i>Aquino, Jr. v. Commission on Elections</i>, 62 SCRA 275, 1975).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The Laws</b>.<b> </b>With the proclamation of martial law came a series of edicts from Pres Marcos: general orders, letters of instruction, and presidential decrees. Through these issuances, Marcos did anything he pleased, including ordering the detention of suspected enemies of the state, and enforcing a nationwide curfew. The original curfew was from midnight to 4:00 am. Later on, this was shortened to 1:00-4:00 am. Beginning 1975, the curfew was temporarily lifted every yuletide season. By 1976, the curfew was lifted completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Overnight, the military establishment became very powerful. Freedom took the back seat to authoritarian government. Congress could not do anything about the situation because it was not in session, and the legislative building had been shut down by soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The closure of all print and broadcast media, with the exception of the <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i> </b>and the KBS-RPN broadcast facilities, was undertaken pursuant to Letter of Instruction 1, which directed the secretaries of the DND and the DPI to take over and control all media in the country. The Philippine Constabulary carried out their directives.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 2 Nov 1972, Pres Marcos issued Presidential Decree (PD) No. 36 which cancelled all legislative franchises issued by Congress to radio and television stations prior to the proclamation of martial law. All broadcast stations before martial law were required to obtain a legislative franchise from Congress as a prerequisite to its operations. A legislative franchise was in the form of a Republic Act duly approved by Congress and signed into law by the president. PD 36 further mandated that no radio or television station may resume broadcast operations without obtaining a prior clearance from the Mass Media Council (MMC) created by the president. Most of the members of the MMC were military officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos also made it unconstitutional for foreigners to own and operate the media, including broadcast networks, effectively Filipinizing ownership of Philippine media for the first time. To many, the change was revolutionary. The expressed objective was to decolonize the media and balance the flow, estimated at 90 percent, of media output from the West that dominated the media environment in the Third World. The downside was that the ownership of Philippine media was relegated by Marcos to family and friends, and those owned by political rivals remained padlocked or were taken over by his cronies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">PD 191, issued by Pres Marcos on 11 May 1973, replaced the MMC with the Mass Media Advisory Council (MMAC). Unlike the MMC, the MMAC had more civilians among its members. This was apparently necessary to erase the impression that the military was in charge of the regulation of the media under martial law. Thus, the MMAC was given the power to issue permits for the operation of mass media in the Philippines, subject to the approval of the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 9 Nov 1974, Pres Marcos issued PD 576, which abolished the MMAC and transferred its powers to two distinct bodies&mdash;namely, the Philippine Council for Print Media (PCPM) and the Broadcast Media Council (BMC). Some sources erroneously state that the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP), not the Broadcast Media Council, was the agency created under PD 576. The KBP is a private, nonstock, nonprofit corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The individuals composing the PCPM and the BMC were mostly from the media sector themselves. By creating these bodies, the government wanted to convey the message that under martial law, the media in the Philippines were subject to self-regulation, instead of state regulation. Nonetheless, both agencies continued to operate under the strict policy of the government against printing or broadcasting materials that go against the New Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The KBP represented the broadcasters themselves, mostly from the private sector. However, the independence of the KBP was questionable, as could be expected under a martial law regime, because the head of the KBP and the BMC was one and the same person, well-known columnist Teodoro Valencia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To ensure its tight grip on the broadcast media, <span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\">all the foregoing regulatory councils exclusively issued permits with a limited duration</span>, some lasting for just one month. As a result, permit renewal was periodically required. This arrangement forced broadcast stations to stay on good terms with the government. After all, the broadcast media industry is capital intensive and it cannot afford to miss even a day of broadcast operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The BMC and KBP produced some resolutions that would have some beneficial effects. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of these guidelines was regarding commercial loads. To address charges of overcommercialization of the air, the BMC imposed a limit of 13 minutes of advertising per clock-hour on radio. Other guidelines included those regarding the number of OPM or original Pilipino music to be played every broadcast hour, tax exemptions for imported broadcast equipment, and the establishment of broadcast stations in neglected areas, albeit a strategy by the government to expand its influence via the airwaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Regulation of Technical Matters</b>.<b> </b>In Sep 1972, the technical aspects of broadcast media operations, such as transmitter strength and frequency assignments, were regulated by the Radio Control Office (RCO) created by law in 1962. The RCO was replaced by the Telecommunications Control Bureau in 1974. On 23 Jul 1979, Pres Marcos issued Executive Order 546 vesting in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4914\"><strong>National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)</strong></a> regulatory powers regarding technical matters over the broadcast media. The NTC had this responsibility for the remaining years of the Marcos administration, and continues to maintain such regulatory power in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Martial Law Propaganda</b>.<b> </b>Right after proclaiming martial law, Marcos heralded that he replaced the old, discredited political order with &ldquo;the New Society&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ang Bagong Lipunan.&rdquo; Government propaganda about the New Society was everywhere. The words<i> </i>&ldquo;Ang Bagong Lipunan&rdquo; appeared on money bills and coins. People were bombarded with announcements in the print and broadcast media, and on street posts as well, all bearing the slogan &ldquo;<i>Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan</i>&rdquo; (For the country to progress, discipline is necessary). Other auxillary slogans, likewise set to rhyme, were also disseminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All these slogans were promoted by the Mabuhay ang Pilipino Movement (Long Live the Filipino Movement), a group of private citizens who were willing to give the New Society a chance to succeed. The &ldquo;Mabuhay ang Pilipino&rdquo; song, which was set to a marching tempo, was regularly played on radio and television, and before every screening in all cinema houses in the country. Two other government-sponsored songs were regular features on broadcast media and in movie theaters as well. The first was the &ldquo;Bagong Lipunan Hymn&rdquo;<i> </i>(New Society Hymn), which had a slow beat, and the second was &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo;<i> </i>(New Birth), which sounded more inspiring. Later, &ldquo;Bagong Pagsilang&rdquo; was renamed the &ldquo;Bagong Lipunan March&rdquo; (New Society March).

Another newspaper, the <b><i>Times Journal</i></b>, came out the following year. It was operated by a brother-in-law of Pres Marcos, Benjamin &ldquo;Kokoy&rdquo; Romualdez.

Stewart&rsquo;s Republic Broadcasting System was broadcasting anew via radio station DZBB and television Channel 7. Stewart was forced to sell RBS when the 1973 Constitution took effect. Under the new charter, foreigners were disallowed from owning mass media in the Philippines. Marcos presidential aide Gilberto M.

In 1975, Benedicto, a Marcos crony, bought the controlling interest in RMN-IBC and renamed it the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Manila Broadcasting Company of the Elizaldes did not resume its television operations but it was allowed to reopen its DZRH radio facilities. ABS-CBN and ABC-RTV-DZMT of the Lopezes were never allowed to reoperate any of its radio or television facilities for the duration of the authoritarian government of Pres Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jun 1973, a fire that destroyed the KBS-RPN studios on Roxas Blvd in Pasay City forced its transfer to the already closed ABS-CBN operations center in Quezon City. A year later, KBS-RPN began using the call letters RPN in its station identification segments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another broadcast facility, the Barangay Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), opened in Nov 1973. Like KBS-RPN and IBC, BBC was owned by Marcos crony Benedicto. Like RPN, BBC used the facilities of the shuttered ABS-CBN studios in Quezon City. It operated DWWX radio and BBC Channel 2. The letters &ldquo;BBC&rdquo; also stood for &ldquo;Big, Beautiful Country,&rdquo; a description then First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Romualdez Marcos gave to Metropolitan Manila, which she called &ldquo;the city of man.&rdquo; Songwriter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a> was commissioned to write the station&rsquo;s theme song. More than two years later, BBC changed its name to Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation after Pres Marcos announced that the terms &ldquo;<i>barangay</i>&rdquo; (kin-based village during the pre-Spanish and Spanish colonial periods) and &ldquo;<i>maharlika</i>&rdquo; (nobility) were for the exclusive use of the government. In 1980, BBC was renamed City 2. It reverted to BBC in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By Aug 1973, Benedicto&rsquo;s companies were broadcasting on all the ABS-CBN TV and radio frequencies, and operating nearly all the ABS-CBN provincial stations, except for the Iloilo radio station which was adjacent to the house of Fernando Lopez. By 1974, Benedicto had a virtual monopoly of Philippine television, owning three of five existing TV stations then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1974, Channel 3 Cebu and Channel 4 Bacolod were reopened and changed their call signs to DYCW-TV Cebu and DYBW-TV Bacolod. Also in 1974, the administration established the Government Television Network or GTV, which operated TV Channel 4. GTV&rsquo;s airtime was initially shared by the Department of Public Information (DPI), the National Media Production Center (NMPC), and RPN 9. NMPC, whose original headquarters for its TV operations were on Santa Potenciana St in Intramuros, Manila, used the facilities of ABS-CBN in Quezon City when it gained full control of Channel 4 in 1980. By this time, the ABS-CBN facilities in Quezon City were given a new name: Broadcast Plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two years later, in 1976, BBC 2, KBS-RPN 9, and IBC 13 moved to a new site at Old Balara in Quezon City called Broadcast City. Thus, GTV, supervised by George Viduya and Emil Jurado, had the old ABS-CBN facilities to itself. GTV 4 would gain the notoriety of being the propaganda station of the regime. Joe Jalandoon supervised IBC, Salvador &ldquo;Buddy&rdquo; Tan was the general manager of KBS, Jun Medina was the operations manager of RPN, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4770\"><strong>Kitchie Benedicto</strong></a> ran BBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1976, Benedicto&rsquo;s Channels 9, 2, and 13 cornered about 85 percent of total airtime sales of the four major networks, equivalent to 102.1 million pesos. The highest earner was RPN 9 with total TV sales recorded at 67.4 million pesos, followed by BBC 2 with 29.5 million pesos. Third was GMA 7, which took 19.4 million pesos, and last was IBC 13 with 9.1 million pesos. In 1977, RPN enjoyed a whopping 50 percent audience market share. By 1978, RPN had 13 TV stations and at least 31 radio stations. During this period, airtime cost increased from 200-300 pesos for a 30-second spot to 2,400-3,600 pesos, simultaneous with a significant rise in television production costs, with the hit comedy <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a></i></b> (John and Marsha) and the top-rating musical program <b><i>Superstar</i></b> receiving the highest investment in terms of amount poured into each episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1980, GTV 4 was renamed the Maharlika Broadcasting System (MBS), headed by Gregorio Cenda&ntilde;a, who sought the help of former <b><i>Manila Times</i></b> reporter Rod Reyes to run the government station. Reyes just came from a three-year stint reorganizing GMA. At the government station, he &ldquo;poured his energy into mounting highly professional coverage of the President&rsquo;s activities, such as the Marcos trip to Japan in 1977 and to Washington in 1982&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 105).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, there was an attempt on the part of a Christian group to open television Channel 11. Although a studio was constructed for it at the Strata building at the Ortigas business center in Pasig, the plans did not materialize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1984, presidential daughter Imee Marcos attempted to take over GMA 7, but was resisted by Jimenez and Gozon. Stewart did not leave the country until after 1986. He was heartbroken because he did not get GMA back which he thought he would when Pres Corazon Aquino came to power (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 105).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Reopened Radio Stations</b>.<b> </b>The martial law government was hot on the heels of AM radio stations, particularly those that had news commentaries hosted by hard-hitting announcers who took potshots at Marcos and his government. FM radio, though operational, remained unaffected, since its programming was mainly music and did not pose any potential threat to the administration. At the onset of martial law, FM was not really a bandwidth to which people listened, since most programs were concentrated on AM. The FM band during the early days of martial law was used merely as a link to connect an AM station to its transmitter, usually located at the outskirts of the city. The government also did not seem to be too strict on privately owned, nonpolitical radio stations, and those operated by established religious groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Within a few weeks from the proclamation of martial law, popular AM radio stations like DZBM and DZRJ, which had music for its programming, were allowed back on the air. As mentioned earlier, DZRH of Elizalde&rsquo;s Manila Broadcasting Company was allowed to reopen its radio and TV facilities, but discontinued airing on TV following technical difficulties. The radio stations owned by religious groups that resumed operations soon enough were DZRV-Radio Veritas of the Roman Catholic Church, the Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC) owned by a Christian organization, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4827\"><strong>Eagle Broadcasting Corporation (EBC)</strong></a> of the Iglesia ni Cristo group. DZRV-Radio Veritas started operating in the Philippines on 11 Apr 1969. Maintaining good relations with established religions made it easier for Pres Marcos to run the nation under an authoritarian regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1975, two pioneering Cebu radio stations, DYRC of the Cebu Broadcasting Company and DYBU of the Philippine Broadcasting Corporation, reopened, this time under the ownership of the Elizaldes. In 1976, the government established DWIM-FM, which operated at the Philippine Communications Center tower along Ortigas Ave in Pasig. It had the strongest radio transmitter in the country and the latest digital broadcast equipment. The letters IM and FM in its call letters are believed to stand for the initials of Imelda Marcos and Ferdinand Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The station with the most powerful concentration during the period was the Voice of America (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>0 kw), followed by RPN, Radio Veritas, FEBC, and the government&rsquo;s National Media Production Center, each operating at 50 kw. The US Armed Forces station, which operated in the Subic Naval Base, ran on a frequency of 25 kw. Sussman (1981) reports that of the 257 radio stations in 1978, 86 percent were commercial. Eighty-three of the radio stations were owned by only five people, the largest owner of whom was Benedicto who owned RPN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising was mainly from affiliates of transnational corporations (TNCs). Seventy-five percent of the 123 members of the Philippine Association of National Advertisers who used the airwaves were TNCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The Return of Entertainment Programs</b>.<b> </b>The return of entertainment on broadcast and other media would be used to signal the return to a sense of normalcy. Local television programs of the pre-martial law period had to find slots in the other stations which were allowed to continue operations after Sep 1972. These programs were allowed on the air again by Oct 1972, provided that they changed their titles to reflect a shift from the old order to the New Society. These programs, mainly comedy and humorous shows, used to air on the ABS-CBN television channels. <b><i>Si Tatang Kasi</i></b> (Blame It on Father), which featured the tandem of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\"><strong>Bentot</strong></a></strong>, reemerged on RPN 9 as <b><i>Naku Po, Tatang</i></b><i> </i>(Oh No, Father). <b><i>Mrs</i></b>.<b><i> Milyonarya</i></b> (Mrs Millionaire), which starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>, became <b><i>Ginang Milyonarya</i></b> (Madame Millionaire) on RPN 9. <b><i>Wanted: Boarders</i></b>, which starred Patsy, became <b><i>Boarding House</i></b> on GMA 7. <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b>, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4744\"><strong>Ramon Zamora</strong></a>, Tange, Balot, Babalu, <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>June Keithley</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>, and Maya (Mitch) Valdez, was renamed <b><i>Laughing Stock </i></b>on GMA 7. The classic game show <b><i>Kuarta o Kahon</i></b><i> </i>(Cash or Box), hosted by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></strong>, was reborn on BBC 2, which later became <b><i>Family Kuarta o Kahon</i></b> on RPN 9. <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b> (Happy Hour) became <b><i>Oras ng Saya</i></b> (Happy Hour) on IBC 13. <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b><i> </i>(Actor&rsquo;s Life) retained its title when it transferred to IBC 13. The talk program <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>, hosted by socialite Elvira Manahan and Joey Lardizabal, the latter subsequently replaced by Eddie Mercado, reappeared on Channel 4, then moved to GMA 7 with Nestor Torre as co-host. Gone forever were <b><i>Oh My Love</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a> </i></b>(Tall Tales),<i> <b>Santa Zita and Mary Rose</b></i>,<i> <b>My Family Three</b></i>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Tomodatsi</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were hardly any visible changes in the feature programs on radio in the aftermath of the proclamation of martial law. The dramas remained, and <b><i>Dear</i> <i>Tiya Dely</i></b> (Dear Aunt Dely) still prevailed on afternoon radio. Popular broadcasters Johnny de Leon and Joe Taruc moved to KBS&rsquo;s station DWWW. Veteran broadcaster Kuya <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a> still entertained his listeners on <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b><i> </i>(Just Yesterday), which moved from DZXL to DZBB in 1975, and ended his broadcasts with the usual &ldquo;Give my regards to the family, <i>mabalos</i>!&rdquo; (short for the Bicolano expression <i>dios mabalos</i>, thank you). The old radio program <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, again starring Pugo and Bentot, was reborn on television via BBC 2. Conspicuously missing from Philippine radio was the horror program <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b><i> </i>(Night of Terror).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio AM programming during the period was predominantly entertainment, consisting of soap dramas, personality programs, and music, which was mainly foreign. Music was either interspersed between programs or was part of counseling and showbiz programs. The AM band catered primarily to audiences of the lower socioeconomic class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FM programming during the early days of the martial law period was in its infancy stage, but would blossom during the period. Among different sectors of the broadcast industry, FM radio was the least affected by the political situation of the country mainly because it concentrated on music programming that aired politically safe music pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Imported Programs</b>.<b> </b>The usual array of pre-martial law American television programs was back on the airwaves after Sep 1972. These shows include <b><i>Hawaii Five-O</i></b><i> </i>on RPN 9, and <b><i>Lost in Space</i></b> and the camp <b><i>Batman</i> </b>series on GMA 7. As expected, new shows from the United States filled the gap, such as <b><i>The Six Million Dollar Man</i></b>, <b><i>Policewoman</i></b>, <b><i>SEARCH</i></b>, <b><i>The Price is Right</i></b>, and <b><i>Family Feud</i></b>, on RPN 9; and <b><i>The Bionic Woman</i></b>, <b><i>Kolchak: The Night Stalker</i></b>, <b><i>Charlie&rsquo;s Angels</i></b>,<i> <b>The Muppet Show</b></i>, <b><i>Mork &amp; Mindy</i></b>, <b><i>James at 15</i></b>, <b><i>Little House on the Prairie</i></b>, <b><i>The Paul Lynde Show</i></b>, <b><i>Love Boat</i></b>, <b><i>Three&rsquo;s Company</i></b>, <b><i>CHiPS</i></b>, <b><i>Starsky &amp; Hutch</i></b>, and <b><i>How the West Was Won</i></b><i> </i>on GMA 7. BBC 2 aired the afternoon soap <b><i>The Young and the Restless</i></b>. There were programs from England as well, like <b><i>Tales of the Unexpected</i> </b>and <b><i>The Benny Hill Show</i></b>, both aired on GMA 7. A hit program was <b><i>Dance Fever</i></b>, GMA 7, hosted by Deney Terio, an American disco dance competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imported religious programs found their way into Sunday programming. These programs include <b><i>The 700 Club</i></b> and <b><i>The Rev. Ernest Angley Hour</i></b>, both on GMA 7; <b><i>Rex Humbard World Outreach Ministry</i></b>, <b><i>Jimmy Swaggart</i></b>, and <b><i>The Baptist Hour</i></b>, on IBC 13; and <b><i>Gospel Crusade</i></b> on GTV 4, which also aired the local program <b><i>The Sunday Mass</i></b>. <b><i>The 700 Club</i></b> would also later gain the late evening daily time slot of GMA and would eventually have a Philippine version of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from American, Japanese, and British broadcast productions entering the Philippine market, imported Chinese-language programs found a dent in the Sunday morning programming of television, which catered to the Chinese language-speaking sector of the population. Examples include <b><i>Beautiful Sunday</i></b>, IBC 13; <b><i>Ring of Love</i></b>, GMA 7; and several programs featuring old Chinese movies. <b><i>Chinese Weekend <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>s</i></b>, IBC 13, gained a Saturday late evening programming in the late 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Undoubtedly the most popular imported show was the educational program <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b>, 1974, produced by the Children&rsquo;s Television Workshop, which featured Jim Henson muppets Big Bird and Cookie Monster. Significant about the program was the absence of commercials within the show, which was in accordance with the instructions of the American producers of the show. Each episode of the program cost only 50 dollars, but the use of a special tape to record each episode was so prohibitive that its distributor had to tap season sponsorships from large corporations such as Delta, Cocobank, and the Philippine National Bank, and had to periodically transfer to different channels to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New animated programs of the period include <b><i>Wait Till Your Father Gets Home</i></b> and <b><i>Yogi&rsquo;s Ark Lark</i></b> from Hanna-Barbera Productions,<i> </i>and <b><i>Arnie Barkley</i></b> and <b><i>The Houndcats</i></b><i> </i>from DePatie-Freleng Productions. By 1978, the iconic <b><i>Voltes V</i></b>, a Japanese show about the saga of a family and their robot that went on the air every Friday afternoon on GMA 7, dominated juvenile television programming. Its phenomenal success could be seen in the fact that schoolchildren actually sang its Japanese-language theme song without understanding what the words meant. After about a year, an English version of the song replaced the original one in the program. Locally sold <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> toys and stationery generated tremendous sales. The success of <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> prompted GMA 7 management to bring in other robot-type Japanese animated programs like <b><i>Mazinger Z</i></b> and <b><i>Mekanda Robot</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although each episode of <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> was a complete story in itself, all the episodes were part of a bigger story with an anticipated end. Sadly, <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> fans were unable to watch the last four or five episodes of the show because Pres Marcos ordered a ban on robot animation programs on television, because parents were ostensibly complaining of violence shown to children. Many, however, were of the opinion that the cancellation of the program was because its content reflected the repression of the Marcos government. There were no digital video disks and no cyber technology available in 1978. Moreover, the country was still under martial law and what Marcos wanted, Marcos got. The disappointed viewers had to wait until about 15 years later when GMA ran the entire gamut of <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> episodes over a fixed period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1974, over 75 percent of television broadcast time was imported, the broadcast of which was supported by big advertisers, mostly from US transnational corporations. By the late 1970s, almost 58 percent of the average of 573.5 hours of weekly broadcasting was foreign, largely canned programs from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan (Ministry of Public Information 1979).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The importation of syndicated programs was partly due to the high cost of producing a local TV production. It was more expensive to produce shows than to buy shows from foreign suppliers. A local network in the 1970s needed about 6,000-18,000 pesos (800-2,400 US dollars at exchange rates of the period) to produce a single episode, while it needed practically the same cost (8,000-20,000 pesos or 1,000-2,600 US dollars) to import a complete series of a highly rated program (Mercado 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"censorship\" name=\"censorship\"></a>Censorship </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The times were not normal in spite of the return of entertainment in the broadcast media. The government and its military arm exerted control over the media through both coercive and persuasive methods: prior censorship, threats of legal sanctions, bribery, detention, physical intimidation, and the ultimate method of death when nothing else worked. The climate of suppression corrupted many and broke the spirit of others. The government&rsquo;s Board of Censors monitored all broadcast programs. The board did not allow programs or parts of programs that were considered politically or morally unfit for broadcast. The Lumauig Bill threatened to limit the free expression of artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For example, during the first few years of the Marcos dictatorship, drama programs were required to submit their scripts to the military prior to airing to root out what was deemed subversive content. This departed from the previous practice of writing the scripts literally minutes before the radio program was either aired or recorded. Some programs were asked to revise or retape parts that were considered politically or morally unfit for broadcast. Perhaps one of the worst forms of censorship, which became a practice under a climate of fear, was self-censorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcast news, accountable to Marcos, was monitored and censored by the Office of Civil Affairs. &ldquo;You write the news and then it goes to Civil Affairs and then it goes back to you censored&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4838\"><strong>Freddie Garcia</strong></a>, quoted in Rodrigo 2006, 261). &ldquo;The networks maintained a tightlipped silence about inconvenient truths. The de facto news policy was &lsquo;see no evil&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rodrigo 2006, 260). The public affairs program <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko</i></b> (My Dear Fellowman), GMA 7, which featured poor people in desperate need of assistance, was ordered to momentarily stop its airing in 1975 when the Marcos government was sprucing up Manila and Quezon City for the visit of an official of the International Monetary Fund&ndash;World Bank. Pasig Mayor Emiliano Caruncho Jr and his henchmen mauled Radio Veritas reporter Salvador F. Reyes on 16 Jun 1981, an election day. Reyes asked the mayor about a voter who had not been allowed by the Commission on Election to vote because of a certification concern, which irritated the mayor. GMA cameraperson Boy Sonza captured on camera the mayor and his aide pulling the reporter&rsquo;s hair, strangling him, and hitting him on different parts of his body, which GMA aired on <b><i>News at Seven</i></b>. Ronnie Nathanielsz of GTV 4 attempted to squelch the controversy by casting doubt on the credibility and integrity of Reyes and Sonza. The mayor was eventually suspended though, but Radio Veritas station manager Fr Sonny Ramirez had to fire Reyes and publicly condemn him for signing an affidavit of desistance from his civil, criminal, and administrative charges against the mayor. Also censored was news about the collapse on 17 Nov 1981 of the fourth floor of Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s pet project, the seven-level Manila Film Center or &ldquo;film palace,&rdquo; killing 64 workers, including an engineer, and wounding 168 construction workers, who were rushing its construction for the 18 Jan 1982 opening of the First Manila International Film Festival. A government news crew was suspended by Malaca&ntilde;an when he inadvertently showed footage of Marcos, at a time when he was rumored to be ill with lupus, looking weak during a cabinet meeting and being fanned by aides (Rodrigo 2006, 260).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lupita Aquino-Concio (now Aquino-Kashiwahara) said in an interview that there was an &ldquo;unwritten blacklisting&rdquo; in the broadcast media. In the early 1970s, Concio was handling RPN&rsquo;s music variety program <b><i>Superstar</i> </b>and the weekly drama anthology <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora </i></b>(The Colorful World of Nora), which offered some competition to top-rating programs <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b> and <b><i>Hawaii Five-O</i></b>. Concio&rsquo;s programs were rating high and winning awards, but management informed her that <b><i>Superstar</i> </b>needed reformatting, which meant tapping several directors taking turns doing the show. Concio accepted this arrangement for the good of the show. She learned later, however, that the same would be done with <b><i>Makulay na Daigdig</i></b>. She knew then that she was being eased out of the two top-rated shows. Concio believed that her connection to Benigno Aquino Jr, her brother, who was a staunch critic of the Marcos regime, was the reason behind this plan by the management. Concio did not resign from the network, but stayed on until she was fired. The broadcast industry&rsquo;s loss was the movie world&rsquo;s gain. Concio moved on to direct films like <b><i>Minsa&rsquo;y Isang Gamu-Gamo </i></b>(<b><i>Once a Moth</i></b>), a sociopolitical critique of the American bases in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ms. Ellaneous</i></b> hosts Ma-an Hontiveros, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4941\"><strong>Tina Revilla</strong></a>, and Yogi Dominguez-Zaragoza also found themselves gradually eased out of their program after they tried to have opposition lawyer Jose Diokno as a guest (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 161).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) had to cancel even the government-produced program <b><i>Metro Magazine</i></b>, which aired at different days and time on all Metro Manila channels, because it found one of its episodes, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>, Tula, at Kasaysayan,&rdquo; seditious and inciting to rebellion. The 30-minute episode featured the theater group Tambisan ng Sining singing fervently patriotic songs, such as &ldquo;Babaeng Walang Kibo&rdquo; (The Tight-lipped Woman), &ldquo;Palasyong Alipin&rdquo; (Enslaved Palace), &ldquo;Republikang Basahan&rdquo; (Tattered Republic), &ldquo;Awit ng Rebolusyonaryo&rdquo; (Song of the Revolutionary), &ldquo;Ang Masa&rdquo; (The Masses), and &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong>&rdquo; (My Country). The episode was seen on RPN 9&rsquo;s 26 Apr airing and on GMA 7&rsquo;s 28 Apr airing by members of a government agency that was regularly monitoring on-air programs.

For example, the late-night talk show <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b> featured and interviewed activists and opposition leaders in some of its episodes, which prompted the Board of Censors under Maria <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w Katigbak to make moves, although unsuccessfully, to require the program to tape all their episodes so it could cut out the parts that it deemed radical, incendiary, and unfit for TV. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a>&rsquo;s GMA exclusive on the Marcoses&#39; hidden wealth; Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno&rsquo;s interview with newly widowed Corazon Aquino on his talk program <b><i>Viewpoint</i></b>, 1984-94; Tina Monzon Palma&rsquo;s outfit of black or yellow, the symbols of the opposition, on <b><i>News at Seven</i></b>, or the expressions on her face that would reveal her distrust of the news stories she was reading; and GMA news reporters or anchorpersons rolling their eyes as they talked about the accomplishments of the dictator&mdash;all this prompted Malaca&ntilde;an and its cronies to reprimand or admonish the owners of the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rod Reyes, who was running the government television station MBS 4, objected to instructions from Malaca&ntilde;an to downplay the funeral of Ninoy Aquino.

As in the time of the Japanese occupation, the climate of suppression produced a heightened consciousness not only among broadcast workers but also among their viewers and listeners. Once again, the people longed for the lively, irreverent, and liberal programming, particularly that of radio, of a previous era, which was perceived to be free and credible. This consciousness would very soon lead to the forging of protest broadcast, which was part of the alternative media&mdash;alternative to the crony media, that is&mdash;of the early 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By late 1980, Pres Marcos announced that martial law was no longer necessary because all the problems that had triggered its proclamation were virtually solved. On 17 Jan 1981, Marcos issued Proclamation 2045 lifting martial law throughout the Philippines. Despite this proclamation, he kept his authoritarian government intact by retaining his power to legislate under the 1973 Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pres Marcos also announced that the lifting of martial law carried with it the abolition of the PCPM and the BMC. Thus, permits to operate broadcast media in the Philippines, like before, would require a legislative franchise, either a Batas Pambansa (Republic Act) from the Batasang Pambansa, which was dominated by the pro-administration party, or a presidential decree issued by Marcos himself. Simply put, it became more difficult to get such a permit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The abolition of the BMC and the PCPM in 1981 did not automatically mean full freedom for the broadcast media. Any broadcaster who created trouble could be charged with subversion and detained indefinitely. Marcos already had his cronies running the media. Roberto Benedicto was in charge of ABS-CBN and the Kanlaon Broadcasting System networks and the <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i></b>. Benjamin Romualdez, the brother of the First Lady Imelda, controlled the <b><i>Times Journal</i></b>. Hans Menzi, a former military aide of the president, owned the <b><i>Manila Bulletin</i></b>. Presidential assistant Juan Tuvera and Imelda&rsquo;s official biographer Kerima P. Tuvera had <b><i>Focus</i></b>, <b><i>Evening Post</i></b>, and <b><i>Orient Express</i></b>. Leon O. Ty, a Marcos-appointed governor of the Development Bank of the Philippines, and Ralph Nubla, a Marcos organizer in Chinatown, were publishers of the <b><i>Weekly Examiner</i></b> and the <b><i>United Daily News</i></b>. The government media, including the broadcast networks, were naturally in the service of the Marcos regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"programming\" name=\"programming\"></a>Programming Developments</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Development Communication and Renaissance Programming</b>.<b> </b>Development communication, a concept that originated from agricultural extension, was stressed during the martial law years. Educational programs were produced to push the concept of development communication, such as <b><i>Ating Alamin</i></b> (Let Us Find Out), 1974-91, hosted by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4842\"><strong>Gerry Geronimo</strong></a></strong>, and <b><i>Tele-Aralan ng Kakayahan</i></b> (Knowledge Educational TV), hosted by theater artist CB Garrucho (Cecilia Bulaong-Garrucho), both aired on weekends on KBS-RPN 9. Even shows like the top-rating comedy program <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b> had to develop and send &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; messages about health, family planning, discipline, good citizenship, and family morals across its audience (Sioson-San Juan 1999). On radio, a classic example is the hour-long program <b><i>Lingap ng Pangulo sa Barangay </i></b>(The President&rsquo;s Care for the Barangay), a nonformal educational series that all KBP member stations were required by the government to broadcast. School-on-the-air types of programs, which targeted rural audiences to send across the development programs of the government, became one of the trends, a forerunner of which is DZLB of the University of the Philippines at Los Ba&ntilde;os (Flor 1994).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The concept of development communication extends to the government&rsquo;s effort to usher in what it termed as &ldquo;renaissance programming&rdquo; in Philippine broadcasting, which meant bringing &ldquo;culture&rdquo; closer to the people by airing educational and cultural programs during prime time&mdash;that is, 7:30-8:00 pm and preceded by the news at 7:00 pm. That was how KBS general manager Buddy Tan was able &ldquo;to air an entire library of Encyclopedia Britannica documentaries, and to transfer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>&rsquo;s late-night musical <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1400\"><strong>Aawitan Kita</strong></a></i></b> to prime time&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 117).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The idea of renaissance television, unfortunately, was not commercially viable and it was soon forgotten. In various seminars and workshops organized by the BMC and the KBP, development communication was always presented as a vision. However, it was virtually impossible to realize since the mass communication system remained commercial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Original Pilipino Music</b>.<b> </b>On 27 Apr 1973, leaders of the broadcast media industry organized themselves as the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster <i>sa</i> Pilipinas (KBP, Organization of Broadcasters <i>in</i> the Philippines), later changed during the Corazon Aquino administration to Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster <i>ng</i> Pilipinas (Organization of Broadcasters <i>of </i>the Philippines), to encourage more professionalism among radio and television broadcasters. All radio and television stations were required to be members of the KBP, which was a private, nonstock, nonprofit corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the biggest positive impact of the KBP-BMC regulation of radio broadcasting was the tremendous growth attained by the local recording industry as a result of the rule that all radio stations play what were called Original Pilipino Music (OPM) on the air, which referred to a song or piece composed by a Filipino, or any song or piece performed by a Filipino, or a song or piece composed by a Filipino but performed by a foreigner. The move challenged the dominance of foreign music and talents. Beginning with one song per program hour in 1975, the requirement was brought up to four in 1982. From the mid-1970s until the middle of the 1980s, local composers, singers, and musicians enjoyed unprecedented exposure on radio and achieved a measure of maturity in their craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before martial law, popular Filipino music referred primarily to folk songs and the <i>kundiman</i> (love songs). OPM during martial law took on a more distinctively younger sound, incorporating elements of Filipino culture with pop, jazz, folk, and rock music. This paved the way for the birth of the &ldquo;Manila Sound.&rdquo; Music from bands became the vogue. The most popular band of the period was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\"><strong>Hotdog</strong></a>, creator and performer of such hits as &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You Are the Miss Universe of My Life) and the iconic &ldquo;Manila.&rdquo; Other popular bands were The Ambivalent Crowd, The New Minstrels, The Circus Band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Juan de la Cruz Band</strong></a>, Maria Cafra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\"><strong>Heber Bartolome</strong></a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a>, and VST &amp; Company.

Benedicto-run BBC renamed DZYK to DWWK 101.9 in 1972, which aired pop vocal and instrumental jazz, then labeled as jazz fusion. DWLL 94.7 &ldquo;The Mellow Touch,&rdquo; owned by FBS Radio Network Inc and which adopted the adult Top 40 format, started airing in 1973. The taped voice of Butch Gonzalez became the signature voice of the station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Midway through the decade, Fred J. Elizalde&rsquo;s MBC migrated to FM by establishing 90.7 DZMB &ldquo;Love Radio,&rdquo; which went on the air during Valentine&rsquo;s Day of 1975. The station took on an adult contemporary easy listening format, which included love songs, oldies, country music, and later OPM. This was in keeping with the band&rsquo;s predominantly laid-back sound. Also in 1975, IBC operated DWKB 89.1, a pop music-format station. It was also around this time that RMN&rsquo;s DZHP migrated to FM, occupying the frequency 93.9 MHz. It took on the middle-of-the-road format (music with general appeal or something not too current, not too old, and neither too loud nor too soft), combining disco hits with oldies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. RBS relaunched DZXX as DWLS in the FM band in 1976, with LS standing for Loreto Stewart, the wife of owner Robert La Rue Stewart, more popularly known as Uncle Bob; it played oldies and pop music. Trans-Radio Broadcasting Company, which owned DZTR Radyo Pilipino on AM, acquired a license in 1976 to broadcast on FM, enabling it to migrate to FM under the call letters DWRT, aka 99.5 RT, owned by Emilio R. Tuason and Andre S. Khan, who were considered then the young turks of the industry whose innovations would alter FM programming of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Easy listening station DWIM-FM 104.3, which went on the air in 1976, was owned and operated by the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS) under the Office of the Press Secretary. In 1978, Radio Mindanao Network, after having DZHP migrate to FM in the mid-1970s, reformatted the station and renamed it DWKC 93.9, making it the network&rsquo;s flagship station in Metro Manila. It took on pop music programming aimed at targeting a mass audience. DWKC was among several FM radio stations that RMN launched nationwide as part of the network&rsquo;s expansion efforts during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine FM&rsquo;s radio programming became synonymous with the so-called contemporary sound, a supposedly high-brow alternative to the otherwise mass-based AM type of programming. This was characterized primarily by classical, easy listening (ballads and instrumentals), or middle-of-the-road formats, which were meant to target mature audiences. During the late 1970s, the FM band opened its doors to younger-sounding formats, like contemporary hit radio or the Top 40 format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Less talk, more music&rdquo; was the mantra during Philippine FM&rsquo;s early years during the martial law period, or at least until radio stations like DWRT came into the picture and broke the mold by highlighting its programming with deejay (DJ) chatter. Although music programs on AM had disc jockeys manning the airwaves, FM&rsquo;s music programs consisted of prerecorded voices ensuring continuity or the smooth transition from music sweep to commercial break and vice versa. Voices of such talents as Butch Gonzalez of DWLL 94.7 &ldquo;The Mellow Touch,&rdquo; Suzette Arboleda of DWFM 92.3 &ldquo;MRS (Most Requested Song) Radio,&rdquo; and Jess Decolongon of DWIM-FM 104.3, now known as &ldquo;Business Radio,&rdquo; complemented the flow of their respective station&rsquo;s programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DWFM introduced &ldquo;seamless programming&rdquo; as an alternative to the already existing album-oriented programming. FM stations initially played the entire music album and stopped only to accommodate time checks. It was DWFM that started playing a variety of tunes segued one after the other, and complemented by prerecorded announcer spiels delivered by Arboleda, DWFM&rsquo;s official voice-over announcer after her stint with DXIR in Iligan, a provincial station of NBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The entrance of DWRT 99.5 into the scene, which went on the air in 1976 using a five-kilowatt Sparta transmitter accompanied by a JamPro penetrator antenna, set industry standards that consequently compelled the other stations to eventually run on five kilowatt-powered transmitters. FM radio stations used to broadcast using only one kilowatt-powered transmitters. DWRT 99.5 is said to have become the radio technology showcase for Asia. Everything was state of the art. Audio equipment brand Philips even approached Tuason, one of the station&rsquo;s owners, to tie in with them in launching compact discs (CDs) and laser discs through the station. The dawn of the digital age arrived on Philippine radio as early as 1981. Among DWRT&rsquo;s innovations are the introduction of the contemporary hit radio format, a mix of pop, rhythm and blues, and rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll; the syndicated American Top 40; and niche programming, a type of programming meant to target specific audiences. Legendary deejays of DWRT include Joppy Gutierrez, Al Torres (aka Al W. Leader), Eric Eloriaga (aka Eric Caine), a certain Dr John Madness, Ramon Cruz (aka Adam Kite and Joey Pizza), Gerry Magnaye (aka Jeremiah Junior), Bob Kishore Bhavnani (aka Bob Curry), Vince de Guzman (aka Vince Saint Price), Sonny Zarate (aka Sonny Z), Jigs Ona (aka Jiggy), Dikie Aragama (aka Dick Reese), station manager <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4922\"><strong>Mike Pedero</strong></a>, and Tuason himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DZFX, DWFM, DWWK, and DWLL targeted mature audiences, albeit through contrasting musical genres, while DWRT aimed for the younger demographics. RMN&rsquo;s DWKC catered to a more low-end segment of listeners, and one of its innovations was the incorporation of jokes by its deejays into its pop music programming. DWKC&rsquo;s deejays included Bobby Ante (aka The Nutty Professor), Mike Enriquez (aka Baby Michael), Willy Inong (aka Hillbilly Willy), Louie Ansaldo (aka Happy Louie), Brian Bhavnani (aka Dr Buddy Brian), Reginald Francisco, and Butch Gonzalez, who were all from AM radio station DWBL. The idea to implement a mass-based approach to FM programming on DWKC started when the announcers saw the success of DZHP when it was still on AM, particularly the music program of one of its announcers, the Taglish-speaking (a mash-up of Tagalog and English) deejay Nick Mendoza (aka Friendly Nick). This led them to experiment on implementing the so-called <i>bakya</i> (mass appeal) concept of programming, but with English as their medium of expression. English was the language that prevailed on FM at the time. Having a steady supply of jokes was a major concern. Deejays read jokes verbatim on air, lifted from published joke books, which were based on American humor, resulting in a rather toned-down version of mass-based program formats of the 1990s on through the 2000s. Surprisingly, DWKC managed to capture part of the high-end market, gaining a huge following among high school students from exclusive schools and elevating the station&rsquo;s deejays to celebrity status. The station even had some joke books published as a result, which they gave away to listeners during on-air promotions. The novelty of the concept wore off through time, since people&rsquo;s listening habits, wants, and likes often shifted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1980s may well be considered the heyday of the Philippine FM radio history as more radio stations started mushrooming, more so since FM radio remained unaffected by the regime. At the same time, it was also a period of transition for some, since a handful of stations underwent programming changes mainly due to station acquisitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982, DWXB 102.7, owned by the National Council of Churches in the Philippines, a coalition of Protestant churches, forged a management contract with programming expert Freddie Dandan and marketing man Ciro Songco, who would handle sales for Radyo Inquirer in the 2000s, and renamed it Magic Disco 102, bringing an exclusively disco programming to the airwaves. It was later on sold to Marcos crony Danding Cojuangco, and its programming shifted to new wave and alternative rock, under the helm of program director Jesse Gonzalez. This went on until the time of the EDSA Revolt, after which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4775\"><strong>Bombo Radyo Philippines</strong></a> purchased the station from Cojuangco and renamed it DWSM 102.7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1983, DWEI 93.1 of Liberty Broadcasting Company was acquired by Audiovisual Communicators Inc, then owned by Rene Lacson and Freddie Garcia, and became DWRX 93.1 or Music City RX 93, which featured pop music. The call letters &ldquo;RX&rdquo; are said to stand for prescription music, just what the doctor ordered, and &ldquo;Rated eXcellent.&rdquo; The station was later acquired by Antonio Barreiro Sr, a founding member of the KBP, which would later be owned by his sons Chito, Rafael, and Antonio Jr, under its new monicker Monster Radio RX 93.1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1984, Mabuhay Broadcasting Company, owned by Edgar Ragasa and wife Cynthia, went on the air via DWKY 91.5, which took on a contemporary hit radio format combined with OPMs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the same year, Banahaw Broadcasting Company changed DWWK&rsquo;s format to pop, and went by the call name DWOK 101.9. Several format-based radio stations followed suit in 1985, and these were mellow rock station <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4818\"><strong>DWRK</strong></a> 96.3 Real Radio for Real People owned and operated by ACWS&ndash;United Broadcasting Network Inc led by Benny Rebueno Hodreal Sr, who was also a founding member of the KBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DWBM 105.1 of Mareco Broadcasting Network Inc, owned and operated by Manuel P. Villar Sr, also began operations, after proving successful on AM via DZBM. It must be remembered that in 1950 Villar founded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a>, which was famous for recording Philippine folk songs, kundiman, <i>balitaw </i>(courtship song), and other love songs from the different regions of the country. For this, Villar earned the title as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Recording&rdquo; for his pioneering work in recording original Filipino music. DWBM took on a new wave format, which eventually changed to adult contemporary format toward the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the end of the martial law period, niche programming became the prevailing pattern, as FM radio stations targeted specific audiences. With DWRT trailblazing the trend, a number of other format-oriented radio stations soon followed suit and eventually made a mark in Philippine FM radio history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"regional\" name=\"regional\"></a>Regional Expansion and the Telecommunications Industry </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before the proclamation of martial law, television did not reach many parts of the archipelago. Most television broadcasts could only reach northern and southern Luzon. Developments in telecommunications technology after 1972 made it possible to transmit television programs to key cities in the Visayas and Mindanao by relay stations. Satellite technology, which improved immensely in the middle of the 1970s, also contributed to the wider reach of television during this period, simultaneous with the continuing hold of transnational corporations on the telecommunications industry of the country, which became one of the most concentrated areas of business ownership and one of the primary generators of foreign investments in the country, specifically in so-called growth centers although mainly carried out in Manila and in export processing zones. The industry had interlocking interests with large transnational corporations and also became associated with military security. The telecommunications industry provided the conduit for transnational advertising, the system that brought together the separated regions of the country, and the infrastructure that integrated the nation into the globalized world system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Benedicto group, having drawn loans from the government-owned Philippine National Bank, expanded the operation of its network, RPN, to 12 regions of the country. On 21 Sep 1977, the fifth anniversary of the declaration of martial law, Benedicto inaugurated domestic satellite communications or DOMSAT, with RPN serving as its transmitting network of 11 satellite earth stations nationwide and for all special broadcasts from the Office of the President. RPN also served as the relay station of IBC&rsquo;s 12 television and 18 radio stations, as well as those of KBS, BBC, and GTV. DOMSAT went full blast in its operation in Jan 1980 in preparation for the provincial and municipal elections during the same year, which made possible the national coverage of candidates under Marcos&rsquo;s political party, the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL). It also made possible the influx into the network of many foreign entertainment programs and specials. Through DOMSAT, the daily noon variety program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a> </i></b>(Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) of RPN was able to expand its viewership, enabling the program to dislodge from the top spot its rival program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> of RBS-GMA. RPN also attracted top transnational corporations (TNC) for its advertisements&mdash;namely, Unilever&rsquo;s Philippine Refining Company, Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Consolidated Foods Corporation, Nestle&rsquo;s Filipro, San Miguel, Pepsi Corporation, Radiowealth, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The lone fully domestic corporation advertiser it had was Banco Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1978, Marcos secured control of the television industry to RPN by overturning a law that encouraged domestic production of TV receivers and, through Letter of Instruction 640, gave Nivico, a Japanese-Benedicto joint TV manufacturing venture, sole tax- and duty-free component import rights. Nivico&rsquo;s principal foreign partner was the Japanese transnational conglomerate Marubeni, a television manufacturer, which became the major supplier of RPN and DOMSAT. Other major television manufacturers protested the decree, but nothing came out of the protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also in 1978, Benedicto, by then the undisputed media mogul in the Philippines, ventured into cable television. He operated Sining Makulay Inc from the old RMN-IBC studio facilities, the ancestral Quirino house by KBS, in Little Baguio in San Juan, Metropolitan Manila. Subscribers to the service received programs from two channels&mdash;namely, 5 and 11&mdash;on their regular television dial. The subscription fee was rather expensive, and the service was available only to the plush subdivisions in Makati, San Juan, Pasig, and Quezon City. Benedicto&rsquo;s cable TV was considered by critics &ldquo;a political animal&rdquo; operated by the Marcos administration to &ldquo;monopolize all the channels of VHF and close the airwaves to other bidders&rdquo; so much so that &ldquo;aside from the commercial channels, cable Channels 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 were now also under government control&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 105). Although Benedicto had monopoly of cable TV, &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; operations were widespread in the provinces, mainly to bring via cable broadcast signals that could not reach certain areas. It was a response to a demand that could not be met by broadcasting via the air. Cable subscription was 60 pesos per month. Benedicto&rsquo;s cable TV enterprise proved not to be very successful, and its operations were overtaken by the political events of 1983. It stopped its operations soon thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another player in the telecommunications industry was Eastern Telecommunications Philippines Inc (ETPI), one of three major international record carriers that handled telegraph, telex, and data transmission, which had cooperation with Cable &amp; Wireless, a British international communication giant, and Oceanic Wireless Inc, an international tropospheric scatter (troposcatter) radio communication system. ETPI had Benedicto as one of its principal partners. The Marcos government granted ETPI the exclusive rights to the communications market of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that consequently made it possible for ETPI to corner other Asian cable markets, and the sole permit to operate institutional circuits from the Bataan export processing zone, which attracted multinational communications and electronics industries to invest in the Philippines. ETPI&rsquo;s top user was the US military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another key figure in the telecommunications industry was the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) of Ramon Cojuangco, the pro-Marcos wing of the landed Cojuangco family. He was also a major stockholder in DOMSAT. PLDT provided domestic terrestrial connections to and from every DOMSAT ground station in voice, video, record, and data communications. PLDT was dependent on the cable of ETPI for its traffic to and through Asia. It had million-dollar contracts with General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) Corporation of the United States and Siemens Corporation of the Federal Republic of Germany for electronic switching equipment. PLDT competed with 67 smaller telephone companies all over the country, but it cornered 85 percent of the country&rsquo;s telephone services. PLDT&rsquo;s principal international toll users were hotels, while the largest domestic users were Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever&rsquo;s Philippine Refining Company, Procter &amp; Gamble, the Philippine National Bank, and foreign oil companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both Benedicto and Cojuangco, together with Marcos defense minister Enrile, were principal partners in another major player in the telecommunications industry, the Philippine Communications Satellite (Philcomsat), which had the US military as its largest and single-end user. Another major player was Philippine Communications Corporation (Philcom) of Radio Communication of America (RCA), nominally headed by former ambassador to the United States Ernesto V. Lagdameo, with Enrile and energy minister Geronimo Z. Velasco as one of its major stockholders. Among Philcom&rsquo;s largest wideband users were the US military, Pan Am, and IBM, while its narrowband users were US and Japanese transnational corporations, such as Caltex, IBM, Xerox, Getz Bros., Seatrain, General Electric, General Instrument, Cummins Engine, Timex, and Hitachi-Union. Globe-Mackay Radio Corporation of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, which had the Ayalas and the Zobels for its major business partners, operated the telephone and communications systems of the Bataan export processing zone, the Philippine National Assembly, the Philippine Navy, the Philippine National Bank, the Bank of the Philippine Islands, the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, Puerto Azul, the Westinghouse Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, the Philippine International Convention Center, and the convention centers in Baguio City and Olongapo City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The growth of the telecommunications industry, with satellite transmission in previously inaccessible areas, made significant headway for various industries, mostly transnational corporations, and linked the so-called offshore operations that foreign investments established in the Philippines to the centers of these operations, which were mainly in industrialized countries. The industry, with interlocking local and global interests, made it possible for these investors to market their products and services under the full protection and support of the Marcos government. The expansion of international capital informed the transnationalization of media, which, in turn, fed into the strategic development goals of the military government of Marcos that favored the concentration of capital among friendly members of the elite, which would later be termed as crony capitalism. Indeed, the broadcast media industry, both as part of the bigger telecommunications industry and as a conduit of transnational capital, is one classic example of the operations of crony capitalism during the martial law period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"news\" name=\"news\"></a>News and Public Affairs Programs </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few days after the proclamation of martial law was announced to the public, regular news programs began airing on KBS-RPN 9 and its radio counterpart. When RBS-DZBB and RMN-IBC resumed operations, they carried regular news programs as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio news programs consisted of a series of announcements aired either every half-hour or every hour. Toward the evening, the news of the day was discussed by some panelists over a longer talk show-type of program. The broadcast news had to be approved by the DPI, and the discussions always had to end on an optimistic note about the New Society. Television news programs were just as restricted, especially during the early months of martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the news programs returned to the air in Oct 1972, a number of radio commentators like Rey Langit resumed their broadcast activities. DWWW, a crony-owned AM station of KBS, began to air in 1974, which had new recruits Johnny de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4569\"><strong>Rod Navarro</strong></a>, Noli de Castro, and Vic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first of the regular evening television news programs was <b><i>The DPI Reports</i></b>, hosted by Bong Lapira. As its title suggested, the news announced on this program were provided by the DPI itself. Aired right after <b><i>The DPI Reports</i></b> was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1493\"><strong>Pulong-Pulong sa Kaunlaran</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Public Forum for Development), a discussion about the accomplishments of the New Society. The panelists spoke positively about the government and its officials. Both programs, however, were eventually scrapped, and the DPI concentrated its dissemination of the news through the regular news programs of the radio and television stations currently operating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When RBS-DZBB Channel 7 and RMN-IBC Channel 13 were allowed to resume broadcasting, they were required, together with KBS-RPN, to broadcast <b><i>The DPI Reports</i></b> and <b><i>Pulong-Pulong sa Kaunlaran</i></b>. This simulcast compelled television audiences to watch these programs, there being no other shows at those hours. In due time, KBS-RPN was allowed to resume its pre-martial law era news program <b><i>NewsWatch</i></b> with veteran news anchor Harry Gasser as its principal newscaster, assisted by newscasters Babes Romualdez and Frankie Abao. Ninez Cacho-Olivarez later joined the group. Gasser used to be the news anchor on the RMN-IBC evening news program <b><i>Vigilantes</i> </b>before he joined KBS-RPN. Babes Romualdez later went by the name Babe Romualdez. RBS-DZBB Channel 7 and RMN-IBC 13 were also allowed to broadcast their own news programs. Antonio Zorilla was the principal newscaster of <b><i>News at Seven</i></b> on Channel 7, later anchored by Bong Lapira, Jose Mari Velez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4908\"><strong>Tina Monzon-Palma</strong></a>, and weatherman Amado Pineda, with Jun Bautista as one of its most reliable field reporters. The newscasters at <b><i>News at Seven</i></b> tried to copy the trend of some television news anchors in the United States to &ldquo;personalize&rdquo; the news by adding some commentaries. The practice was discontinued soon afterward. Francisco &ldquo;Frankie&rdquo; Evangelista Jr and Bingo Lacson were the news anchors of <b><i>Newsday</i></b> on IBC 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When BBC went on the air in 1973, it introduced <b><i>BBC Balita</i></b>, the first primetime news program in Filipino after the declaration of martial law, anchored by Lee Andres and Paul Lacanilao; it would later be given a new title, <b><i>Balita Ngayon </i></b>(News Today), which would become the only news program in Filipino until the launch of <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, ABS-CBN, in 1987 following the ouster of Marcos. MBS Channel 4 came out with <b><i>Newscenter 4</i></b>. Its opening theme was lifted from the Hollywood motion picture <b><i>Battlestar Galactica</i></b>. Veteran broadcast journalist Lito Gorospe was the news anchor. Another GTV 4 news program was <b><i>News Today </i></b>with Joe Sobrino, Romy Sager, and Betsy Enriquez, later joined by other hosts, including Bon Vibar. By that time, KBS-RPN 9 came out with an innovation and decided to broadcast two editions of <b><i>NewsWatch</i></b>: the evening edition at 7:00 pm and the final edition at 10:00 pm, hosted in pair and alternately by Harry Gasser, Caloy Prieto, Ernie Fresnido, Pat Lazaro, Cielo Villaluna, Cathy Santillan, and Eric Eloriaga. <b><i>NewsWatch</i> </b>made innovations by adding in to its programming the weekly <b><i>NewsWatch: Junior Edition</i></b>, 1976-93, with children reading the news or talking about the issues of the day in a freewheeling discussion portion presided over by producer Agnes Caballa. Children newscasters of the early versions of the program included Janice de Belen and Cathy Babao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The old pre-martial law era television talk show <b><i>Meet the Press</i></b>, produced by the National Press Club, was likewise back in business. Its main competitor was <b><i>Face the Nation</i></b>, which went on the air via<i> </i>MBS Channel 4. Public affairs news programs of similar orientation came out, such as Julie Yap Daza&rsquo;s <b><i>Tell the People</i></b> on KBS-RPN 9 and Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Viewpoint</i> </b>on GMA 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To state the obvious, the news on all broadcast channels was subjected to strict censorship. As expected, they were not allowed to criticize the Marcos administration. The stations concerned broadcast stories provided by the DPI itself, or air stories from their own news department provided that the stories were first cleared by a representative of the DPI who held office inside the station itself. All news about the activities of the political opposition was absolutely forbidden on the air. Paid advertisements or announcements relating to their activities were likewise prohibited. Media personalities who dared disobey these prohibitions faced indefinite detention in a military stockade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Personalities identified with the political opposition were not allowed to go on the air. To avoid incurring the anger of the government, broadcasters refrained from inviting personalities from the political opposition to their programs. One sure way of avoiding trouble was to focus on what Mrs Marcos referred to as &ldquo;the true, the good and the beautiful&rdquo; in the sense that the martial law government perceived these to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1978, many radio and television personalities did just that. They went out of their way to openly support the administration candidates who were running for seats in the interim Batasang Pambansa under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like every general rule, there were a few noted exceptions. In Apr 1978, Rosario &ldquo;Charito&rdquo; Planas, a sworn Marcos foe, denounced, on live radio, the fraud allegedly committed by Marcos supporters in the elections for seats in the interim Batasang Pambansa in the national capital region. Planas was one of those who ran with political opposition leader Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr under the Lakas ng Bayan (Laban) ticket in that ill-fated election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometime toward the end of 1985, Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno Jr interviewed Salvador &ldquo;Doy&rdquo; Laurel, a former senator and Marcos critic who announced that he was ready to run against Marcos if a special election were to be called in 1986. Although Laurel refrained from using below-the-belt lines against Marcos while on television, Laurel criticized Marcos in categorical terms. Fortunately for Puno, his program was not axed either by the station&rsquo;s management or by Malaca&ntilde;an. Perhaps, with a presidential election in the horizon, it would not have looked good for the administration to order the closure of a television program simply because its host interviewed a potential opponent of Pres Marcos in that election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Charity shows were the trend in public service programs, which were aired in the late afternoon. The most popular were <b><i>Mr. Public Service</i></b>, hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4674\"><strong>Tony Santos</strong></a> Sr; <b><i>Damayan </i></b>(Helping One Another), revived in 1976, GTV 4, with film actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4651\"><strong>Rosal Rosa</strong></a>l calling on various organizations to help alleviate the plight of indigent people going to the program to seek help; and <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko </i></b>(My Dear Fellow), 1974, GMA 7, with Orly Mercado, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a>-Roa, Cielito del Mundo, and kidney specialist Dr Antonio Talusan helping those who need medical attention, reuniting estranged siblings, and mending broken families. <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko</i> </b>is the first program to feature volunteer sign-language interpreters from the Philippine School for the Deaf on a portion of the TV monitor. On radio, DZRH launched the program <b><i><strong>Opera</strong>tion Tulong </i></b>(Operation Assistance), 1979, which aired from midnight until 2:00 am and hosted by Manny Calpito, who conducted interviews on air and assisted the homeless, taxi drivers, people in need of medical care, and those who needed all sorts of immediate help. Financial and other forms of support came from the listeners, not from government and corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometime in the late 1970s, GTV 4 aired <b><i>Sambayanan </i></b>(The Nation), a government-produced morning talk show aired every day from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm, hosted by Ed Tipton. The program&rsquo;s significance lay not in its content, which obviously carried government&rsquo;s point of view on several issues discussed in the program, but in its attempt to introduce a talk program in a time slot dominated by soap and variety programs. The 11:00-11:30 am programming during the period was mainly devoted to daily drama soaps, the 11:30-12:00 noon programming to news or variety programs, and the 12:00-1:00 pm schedule to variety programs. <b><i>Sambayanan</i></b>&rsquo;s airing on this time slot would serve as a precursor of later light talk shows in the same time slot during the post-Marcos period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television stations in Cebu in the Visayas during the late 1970s and early 1980s were anchored on Manila stations. The programming was &ldquo;made in Manila,&rdquo; as Cebuanos put it. Features and news followed the slant of the Office of Media Affairs. Radio stations on both the AM and FM bands include DYRC, DYHP, DYGB, DYFM, and DYBU. These stations were financed reportedly by businessmen from Manila. DYLA is owned by the Associated Labor Union of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines. Blocktimers on radio were a potent presence during the period, the most popular of which was DYLA&rsquo;s talk and public affairs program <b><i>Saksak Sinagol</i></b> (Pound, Push, and Mix), hosted by lawyers Miguel &ldquo;Migs&rdquo; Enriquez and Vic Villordon, with a huge listenership base in Cebu, Bohol, Samar, Leyte, Northern and Western Mindanao, Negros Oriental, and the Cebuano-speaking areas of Negros Occidental (Espina-Moore 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Civil society organizations began creeping into mainstream broadcast during the latter days of the Marcos dictatorship. <b><i>Radyo Womanwatch </i></b>(Womanwatch on Radio), produced by activist women belonging to Women in Media Now, began airing in 1985 on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4825\"><strong>DZSR</strong></a> Sports Radio, and became one of the launching pads of discussions of women&rsquo;s issues. A television version was produced after the ouster of Marcos, and the radio version moved to different stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The extent of television news censorship under martial law was realized by the people in two milestones in Philippine broadcast media history&mdash;namely, the Mar 1978 televised interview of political opposition leader Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr and the coverage of his assassination and funeral in Aug 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To repeat, elections for seats in the interim Batasang Pambansa were set for Apr 1978. Aquino, a former senator incarcerated at Fort Bonifacio and the nemesis of martial law, declared his intention to run. He lamented that while he was allowed to go home to Quezon City for a few days, he was not given enough freedom to reach out to the people. The government responded with an offer to get Aquino interviewed by a panel of journalists on the evening talk show program <b><i>Face the Nation</i></b> on GTV 4. Aquino agreed, provided that the interview would be broadcast live. The government took a chance, and Aquino was interviewed live at Fort Bonifacio on the evening of 10 Mar 1978. It was a decision the government regretted. Aquino mesmerized the audience and underscored the faults and abuses of the Marcos administration. For the first time in years, somebody was openly criticizing Pres Marcos and his martial law regime. People who had never even heard of Aquino, much less heard him speak, experienced a televised ringside seat to a litany of the sins of the dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The government tried to take remedial measures by airing an edited version of the interview the next day. To those who were able to watch the interview live on television, the edited version only reminded them of the freedom of expression the martial law administration had been denying them since Sep 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The coverage of the Aquino assassination is another sad chapter in the history of press freedom in the Philippines. After a three-year exile abroad, the most famous political opposition leader of the country arrived at the Manila International Airport on 21 Aug 1983. Right after touchdown, Aquino was escorted out of the plane by a squad of soldiers assigned to protect him. Seconds after leaving the plane, Aquino was shot in the head at the tarmac, in broad daylight. His funeral was a national event, and the funeral procession was a pilgrimage joined by millions. The last time a funeral procession attracted multitudes of grieving Filipinos was that of Pres Ramon Magsaysay, who died in a plane crash in 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the national significance of the event, no radio or television station gave detailed coverage of the assassination, its aftermath, and the funeral procession. No actual footage of the shooting of Aquino while descending from the plane was ever made public; either there was none taken or any footage taken was not made available to or by the media. Horacio Paredes reports in a <b><i>Mr. &amp; Ms.</i></b> article: &ldquo;Fifteen maintenance men, 106 co-passengers, 10 AVSECOM (Aviation Security Command) soldiers on the ground, four soldiers coming down the ramp and at least two plainclothesmen on the upper landing of the ramp, a television camera crew, all are in positions to see a lot yet not one says he saw anything. Perhaps, now that it is established that the civilians saw nothing, the public awaits the testimony of the military witnesses&rdquo; (Espina-Moore 1983, 9). Fifteen media men covered Aquino&rsquo;s trip home. Among them were reporters of <b><i>Time</i></b> and <b><i>Asiaweek</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and radio and TV crew of the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK)&ndash;Japan Broadcasting Network, and the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS). Aquino&rsquo;s brother-in-law Ken Kashiwahara of ABC, then on leave, was traveling with Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With no available footage of the actual shooting, people resorted to reproducing NHK, JBS, and TBS Betamax tapes of the assassination and other sources of photographs and TV footage, which were distributed and circulated clandestinely. Local commercial media, especially the broadcast networks, were no longer considered the site of reliable news. The search for the truth was played out elsewhere, this time mainly on Betamax units at home and in offices. The duplication and circulation in domestic private spaces of any available footage published or broadcast in foreign media networks proved to be the most reliable source of news about the Aquino assassination. The people found creative ways to feed their thirst for the truth in spaces that they had managed to keep from the reach or radar of the government and the military. Interestingly, Betamax video tapes in the late 1970s were mainly used by the gossip mill in circulating footage of men and women actors engaged in unseemly acts. The Betamax, however, also proved to be the most accessible and effective route in circulating images, mostly from international sources, of the assassination of Ninoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few networks dared to cover the event. DZRV-Radio Veritas was the only radio station that provided a blow-by-blow account of Ninoy Aquino&rsquo;s arrival, with its correspondent annotating the events through a pay phone. Radio Veritas and other radio stations attempted to cover the 10-hour funeral procession of the slain senator, attended by two million sympathizers, but their frequencies were jammed. GMA 7 was just daring enough to devote a limited time of its primetime news to the funeral procession; testimonies state that the on-air coverage ran for only eight seconds. The talk show <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>, known for glamour and glitz, also had the courage to feature a 15-minute tribute to the slain hero, including footage of the funeral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many citizens in the predominantly Catholic nation took DZRV&rsquo;s stance as indicative of the Catholic clergy&rsquo;s increasing displeasure with Marcos. For many, it was also their cue to begin taking an oppositional stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The changed situation encouraged radio commentators in several AM stations to view more critically the unfolding events that would lead to the end of Marcos&rsquo;s rule. As the political opposition mounted street protests and launched civil disobedience campaigns that had the public boycott the crony press among other things, some radio stations braved the government restrictions that were still in effect and covered and commented on the escalating opposition to Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Provincial radio was also beginning to stir. One of the feistiest commentators in Cebu, for example, Inday Nita Cortes-Daluz, was detained by the military for covering a march staged by the political opposition in Cebu, but resumed her political commentary on the air as soon as she was released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Variety Programs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1358\"><strong>Game Shows</strong></a> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Variety programs were plentiful during the martial law period, which were a mix of musical numbers and interviews with personalities; some had segments on games or contests usually promoted by commercial sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many AM radio stations were also programmed for music, aside from news and drama. One of the top AM music stations during the period was DWBL, which had Rudolph Rivera, Willy Inong, and Mike Enriquez, who would become a popular news anchor on GMA 7 in the 1990s. DWKW had Bambi Fonacier, Bingo Lacson, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a>, Vic Salta, Howard Medina (aka Long Tall Howard), and Robert D&rsquo;Lion. DZRJ-AM &ldquo;Boss Radio,&rdquo; owned by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\"><strong>Ramon Jacinto</strong></a> and which would become Radyo Bandido during the EDSA Revolt, focused on rock music, which earned for the station its monicker &ldquo;The Rock of Manila.&rdquo; Popular DZRJ programs included the daily show <b><i>Pinoy Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Rhythm</i></b>, hosted by Bob <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1268\"><strong>Posas</strong></a> (aka Bob Magoo) and later by Dante David (aka Howlin&rsquo; Dave). The show featured the early vinyl releases of pioneering Filipino rock music groups, such as RJ and the Riots, Juan de la Cruz Band, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong> Bayan, Maria Cafra, Petrified Anthem, and Destiny. Its midnight show, <b><i>The Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Roll Machine</i></b>, followed the cross-genre, album-oriented format. Its early morning program opened with Howlin&rsquo; Dave&rsquo;s voice announcing &ldquo;Gising na, RJ na!&rdquo; (Wake up, it&rsquo;s RJ time!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On television, the noontime show <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, with mainstays Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, minus Pepe Pimentel, but with new addition Helen Vela and later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4942\"><strong>Coney Reyes</strong></a>, was relaunched on GMA 7 in 1975. &ldquo;IQ Seven,&rdquo; a quiz show for university students, was one of <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>&rsquo;s most popular Saturday segments. Independent company Television and Production Exponents (TAPE), headed by Romy Jalosjos, launched <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) on RPN 9 in Jul 1979, with Tito, Vic, and Joey, who were formerly provided employment by Ledesma through GMA&rsquo;s weekly dance show <b><i>Discorama</i></b>. <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> would eventually unseat <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> from its hold of the daily noontime programming, particularly when RPN 9 switched to domestic satellite (DOMSAT) broadcast, which provided nationwide live coverage of the program, highlighted by the transfer of Coney Reyes to <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> in 1982. <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i> </b>launched the career of many child stars, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\"><strong>Aiza Seguerra</strong></a>, a runner-up in the program&rsquo;s &ldquo;Miss Little Philippines&rdquo; in the 1980s, and Ryzza Mae Dizon, a winner of the same child beauty contest in the 2010s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A phenomenon of the variety program genre of the period was advertising personality <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4979\"><strong>Ariel Ureta</strong></a>. He captured the hearts of the Filipino audience as the witty and well-dressed host. The mustached funnyman started with a noontime show called <b><i>12 O&rsquo;Clock High</i></b> on BBC 2, then moved from one station to another. From <b><i>Noontime Matinee</i></b> and <b><i>For the Boys</i></b> on IBC 13, Ureta moved back to BBC 2 with <b><i>Ariel con Tina</i></b>, which ended when co-host Tina Revilla started disappearing to do movies. He conceptualized and hosted the early-evening variety show <b><i>Ariel &amp; Co. After Six</i></b>, BBC 2, with a child co-host, then child superstar Ni&ntilde;o Muhlach, and guest appearances by pretty female co-hosts. Ureta also had <b><i>The Morning Show</i></b>, GTV 4, co-hosted by Merce Henares, which was a pioneer of daily morning talk-magazine programs. There is an account of Ureta supposedly mocking the New Society slogan &ldquo;Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, disiplina ang kailangan&rdquo; with his own &ldquo;<i>Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, bisikleta ang kailangan</i>&rdquo; (For the country to progress, bicycle is necessary). Rumors at that time had it that Ureta was arrested, taken to Camp Crame, and ordered to ride a bicycle around the camp while shouting the government slogan in its correct text. In recent years, Ureta denied having made that comical version of the New Society slogan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a> thrilled her fans with the weekly musical show <b><i>Superstar</i></b>, 1971-89, RPN 9. The Salvador family, led by Lou Salvador Sr, was all over the place in <b><i>Showbiz with the Salvadors</i></b>, with one of his sons, Leroy, heading the program. Joe Quirino, considered the Ed Sullivan of the Philippines, hosted the musical variety-talk show <b><i>Seeing Stars with JQ</i></b>, 1975-86, IBC 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Entertainment variety programs that focused more on featuring upcoming teen stars include <b><i>Big Ike&rsquo;s Happening</i></b>, BBC 2,<i> </i>by star manager Ike Lozada, and <b><i>Germside</i></b>, 1978, GMA 7, later retitled <b><i>Germspesyal</i></b>,<b> </b>then <b><i>GMA Supershow</i></b> by star builder <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4912\"><strong>German Moreno</strong></a></strong></strong></strong>. The teen variety show <b><i>Apat na Sikat</i></b> (The Famous Four), RPN 9, featured popular young stars Arnold Gamboa, Maribel Aunor, Dondon Nakar, and Winnie Santos. These programs were the precursor of teen variety shows that were produced after the fall of Marcos that capitalized on young stars&rsquo; ambition to make it big in show business but eventually became a sort of training school for these young talents, such as <b><i>That&rsquo;s Entertainment</i></b>, 1986-96,<b><i> </i></b>by German Moreno on GMA, and <b><i>Ang TV </i></b>(The TV), 1992-97, and <b><i>Flames</i></b>, 1996-2002, on ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A new game show patterned after the American was developed into <b><i>Spin-a-Win</i></b>, RPN 9, with Jeanne Young. A matchmaking game show, <b><i>Rhoda and Me</i></b>, 1975-78, GTV 4, hosted by Joey Lardizabal, later replaced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4625\"><strong>Ronald Remy</strong></a>, and a charming female computer called Rhoda, gained popularity among audiences and critics alike, and which became the model for the 1990s show <b><i>It&rsquo;s a Date</i></b> by Plinky Recto. Pepe Pimentel&rsquo;s <b><i>Kuarta o Kahon</i></b>, revived<i> </i>on BBC 2, was one of the most popular in its genre.

GMA 7 produced <b><i>Discorama</i></b>, hosted by Bobby Ledesma and the Apo Hiking Society, with a DJ segment for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4882\"><strong>Loren Legarda</strong></a>, who was still then a broadcast communication student; they were later joined by the comedic trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey, and <b><i>Penthouse Seven</i></b>, a remake of the pre-martial law <b><i>Dancetime with Chito</i></b>, with new host Archie Lacson and dancers Mike Monserrat, Joannie Feliciano, Ray-An Fuentes, Sandy Hontiveros, Ida Ramos, and Poncy Quirino.

Another important program, <b><i>Sunday, Sweet Sunday</i></b>, which began airing in 1969, was revived after the declaration of martial law, and ran until 1974.

Major accomplishments in independent broadcast production were <b><i>Aawitan Kita </i></b>(I Shall Sing for You), produced by Armida Siguion-Reyna, which began airing in 1970 and was occasionally broadcast until 2005, and the musical special <b><i>At Long Last, Celeste!</i></b>, produced by Circus Band member Richard Tan and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4993\"><strong>Fritz Ynfante</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b>, which moved from one television network to another in its 35 years of broadcast existence, showcases the rich musical tradition and heritage of the Philippines, specifically Filipino classic love songs, such as the Tagalog kundiman, the Visayan balitaw, and Filipino music from different regions of the country. The program, hosted by Siguion-Reyna herself, featured singers Robert Natividad, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\"><strong>Diomedes Maturan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a>, and later Lirio Vital, Leo Valdez, Bimbo Cerrudo, Richard Reynoso, Carla Martinez, and Cris Villongco. Siguion-Reyna, the sister of martial law defense minister Enrile, also sings popular kundiman in the program. The program used to air on late nights, but was transferred to an earlier time slot following a directive by then KBP chair Teodoro Valencia to air cultural and educational programs in the 7:30-8:00 pm time slot immediately after the news programs, which were programmed at 7:00 pm. Critics remarked that on the one hand the episodes are &ldquo;gloriously photographed, the music lushly orchestrated,&rdquo; but on the other, that the show is &ldquo;simply an exercise in vanity&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 139). Ultimately, however, <b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b> undoubtedly promoted an aspect of Philippine culture through the broadcast medium that has always been described as a vast wasteland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>At Long Last, Celeste!</i> </b>starred singer Celeste Legaspi, then the young lead of the singing group The Ambivalent Crowd. Ynfante, who was then making a name as a director of music programs on television, developed a concept for Celeste. He said that &ldquo;the musical is a story of a new star on her concert night&rdquo; (del Mundo 2003, 23). The show includes backstage scenes with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2956\"><strong>Joonee Gamboa</strong></a> as a reporter, hounding the new star for an interview. Ryan Cayabyab, then a rising young music composer, was tapped to do the musical direction. The special was taped over a three-day period at the Meralco Theater with all the huge and unwieldy camera equipment. Celeste did mostly American tunes, like a medley of Cole Porter, and capped the show with &ldquo;A Corner of the Sky.&rdquo; <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong>, with choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\"><strong>Alice Reyes</strong></a>, provided the dance numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Noteworthy directors of musical variety programs were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4986\"><strong>Mitos Villareal</strong></a>, choreographer <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Al Quinn</strong></a></strong>, and Fritz Ynfante. Villareal&rsquo;s TV productions became synonymous with elegance &ldquo;in which the music and the songs were the stars&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 132). Quinn&rsquo;s productions were visually stunning but the extravagance never upstages the stars. Ynfante&rsquo;s works were &ldquo;marked by an extravagance that draws inspiration from Broadway and the world of big musicals&rdquo; and &ldquo;a party where only the most beautiful people got invited&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 138).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise in the number of entertainment programs and cultural shows on television reflected the ironies and contradictions of the times. From the point of view of propaganda, perhaps it was cunning of the Marcos regime to allow the development of cultural programs, even of some that bordered on the political, which was more obvious in Philippine cinema. This openness announced to the world that the regime was also supportive of cultural programs that were independently produced and innovative in approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"comedy\" name=\"comedy\"></a>Comedy Shows </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New locally produced television programs appeared during the martial law period. These include situation comedies that focused on family life, like <b><i>My Son, My Son</i></b>, which starred Chichay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4476\"><strong>Jay Ilagan</strong></a>, Patsy, and Tange, RPN 9; <b><i>Problema Mo Na &rsquo;Yan</i></b><i> </i>(That&rsquo;s Your Problem), which starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a> and Bentot; <b><i>Ang Biyenan Kong Mangkukulam</i></b><i> </i>(My Witch In-Law), a local version of the US television program <b><i>Bewitched</i></b> and which featured <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\"><strong>Pancho Magalona</strong></a>;<i> <b>&rsquo;Yan ang Misis Ko</b> </i>(That&rsquo;s My Wife), with Ronald Remy and Rosal Rosal as mainstays; <b><i>Wala Kang Paki </i></b>(None of Your Business), with Nida Blanca; <b><i>Mommy Ko si Mayor </i></b>(The Mayor Is My Mom), featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4679\"><strong>Gloria Sevilla</strong></a>, Amado Cortez, and the Ranillo siblings Suzette, Mat, Dandin, and Lilibeth; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>Apartment</strong></a> 153-A</i></b>, written and directed by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Fernando</strong> and which starred Panchito as an oldie bachelor who always gets into funny situations. In spite of the relatively high number of comedy programs, the plot of these comedies is practically the same: someone makes a mistake, the error puts the characters in unexpected situations, the mistake is discovered at the end, and the characters patch things up. Others resorted to making fun of physical attributes, peppered with a dose of gay bashing or sexist jokes, like <b><i>Chicks to Chicks</i></b>, 1984, IBC 13, written by Ipe Pelino, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, with mainstays Nova Villa, Freddie Webb, Chuchi, Chito Arceo, Strawberry, Sammy Lagmay, and sexy women characters played by Carmi Martin and beauty queens Lorraine Schuck, Bong Dimayacyac, and Maria Teresa Carlson, who would become famous for her &ldquo;<i>Si ikaw, si ako</i>&rdquo; (You, me) lines. <b><i>Duplex</i></b>, 1982-84, RPN 9, stands out among the sitcoms, which is about a dysfunctional family, written and directed by Ading Fernando and starring Fernando himself, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4404\"><strong>Marissa Delgado</strong></a>, Dely Atay-atayan, Al Tantay, <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2791\"><strong>Bernardo Bernardo</strong></a></strong></strong></strong>, Soxy Topacio, beauty queen Anna Lorraine Kier, and Janice Jurado whose character &ldquo;Liweng&rdquo; as the beautiful yet dumb house helper became popular. <b><i>Duplex</i> </b>had good narratives but would sometimes poke fun at people&rsquo;s deformities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Relevant sitcoms were produced in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. <b><i>Baltic &amp; Co.</i></b>, 1974-76, GMA 7, based on the comic strip created by Roni Santiago, is about a hot-headed boss named Baltic and the daily concerns of his employees. Nanding Flores, the original Mr Baltic, was replaced by Prospero Luna when Flores passed away in 1975, and later played by Bert Tawa Marcelo. The classic pre-martial law Juan Tamad character was resurrected on TV as <b><i>Juan Tamad</i></b> (Lazy Juan), 1979, GTV 4, and starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a> as the legendary lazybone hero who is a caricature of the Filipino, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a> and Aurora Salve. <b><i>Prinsipe Abante </i></b>(Prince Abante), 1979, GMA 7, directed by Ading Fernando and featuring Bert Marcelo, Tina Revilla, Dely Atay-atayan, Gene Palomo, and Prospero Luna, is a modern spoof of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1489\"><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong></a> </i></b>(Prince Amante), a <i>komiks</i> serial by Mario del Mar in the 1950s and adapted into a radio play by Clodualdo del Mundo Sr. <b><i>Two Plus Two</i></b>, 1982, BBC 2, with Vic Sotto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4300\"><strong>Dina Bonnevie</strong></a>, their daughter Danica who was then a toddler, Chichay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4691\"><strong>Maricel Soriano</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Martinez, Gary Lising, and Herbert Bautista, whose character &ldquo;Bistek&rdquo; originated from this show, deals with the daily concerns of a young middle-class couple. The daily sitcom <b><i>Cafeteria Aroma</i></b>, 1982, GMA 7, is about a job placement bureau and a talent agency operated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4757\"><strong>Apeng Daldal</strong></a> and the different characters&rsquo; search for ideals shattered by the difficulties of landing the right job. It was conceptualized and starred by Apeng Daldal, produced by Ben S. Fernandez, written by Naning Estrella, aka Lukas Pakaskas of <b><i>Balitang Kutsero</i></b> (Coachman&rsquo;s News) during pre-martial law, directed by Arjel Joseph, and featuring comedians Brother Manok, Miniong Villegas, and a former <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> dancer named Johnson. An interesting sitcom produced during the waning years of the Marcos administration until the early years of the post-EDSA period was <b><i>U.F.O.: Urbana, Felisa, and Others</i></b>, 1984-89, GMA 7, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\"><strong>Jose Javier Reyes</strong></a> and featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4210\"><strong>Mitch Valdes</strong></a>, Ariel Ureta, Francis Magalona, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3349\"><strong>Lou Veloso</strong></a>, whose character Mang Truman was introduced in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two sitcoms became extremely popular during the period. <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b> (School Bumps), 1977-90, IBC 13, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4917\"><strong>Bibeth Orteza</strong></a>, spoofed a bunch of lazy, ambition-less students making fun of people around them. The slapstick featured the comedic trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey whose triumvirate would become a phenomenon during the martial law years and a powerful launching pad for the political career of Tito Sotto. A rival program was put up by RPN, <b><i>Coed Fever</i></b>, premiered in 1979, scripted and directed by Rico Flores and starring the Apo Hiking Society and Maya (now Mitch) Valdez, about zany situations in a boarding house of college students, but the effort failed to dent the audience share of <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sitcom that ruled the ratings and became one of the longest-running comedy programs was the weekly <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, 1973-90, RPN 9, created by musician-writer-director Ading Fernando. It featured the poor man John Puruntong (played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>), his rich wife Marsha (Nida Blanca), their children Shirley (Maricel Soriano) and Rolly (Rolly Quizon), Shirley&rsquo;s suitor Isko (Isko Salvador), the overweight, very rich mother-in-law of John, Do&ntilde;a Delilah (Dely Atay-atayan), and Delilah&rsquo;s helper and sidekick <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4900\"><strong>Matutina</strong></a> (Evelyn Bontogon). Each episode of the program ended with Do&ntilde;a Delilah screaming her advice to her financially challenged son-in-law, &ldquo;<i>Kaya ikaw, John, magsumikap ka!</i>&rdquo; (So you, John, try even harder!), which became a household catchphrase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lumbera (1975) comments that the caricature of economically poor Filipinos as lazy or not industrious enough to make both ends meet, particularly in the case of John Puruntong, discounts institutional and structural deficiencies in Philippine society that render them poor in the first place, almost always barred from opportunities to rise above their conditions, and only shifts the blame on fate and the individual rather than on the responsibility of the government to provide the citizens with basic social services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three gag shows also became popular. <b><i>T.O.D.A.S.</i></b>, 1977-89, IBC 13, starring Joey de Leon, Val Sotto, Richie D&rsquo;Horsey, Maribeth Bichara, Frieda Fonda, and Jimmy Santos, made fun of popular personalities, spoofed commercial advertisements, and popularized the &ldquo;knock-knock&rdquo; and &ldquo;use in a sentence&rdquo; jokes, but was highly criticized for its toilet humor and sexual innuendos. The show that attracted the higher end of TV audiences was the social commentary-cum-gag show <b><i>Champoy</i></b>, 1975-85, first on GTV 4 then moved to RPN 9 only after a few weeks. It was conceptualized by advertising men <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4849\"><strong>Subas Herrero</strong></a>. Inspired by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a> Hardy and Stan Laurel image on the champoy wrapper, &ldquo;fat&rdquo; Herrero and &ldquo;thin&rdquo; Trinidad worked with a new group composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\"><strong>Peque Gallaga</strong></a>, Gary Lising, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4969\"><strong>Tessie Tomas</strong></a>, and Mitch Valdes, who would soon make their respective marks on television, film, and theater. Another relevant comedy is &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Buding,&rdquo; a stand-up gag segment of the live weekly musical variety program <b><i>Penthouse Live</i></b>, GMA 7, which featured members, or imaged as members, of the middle class or those aspiring middle-class status. The program&rsquo;s audiences cut across all social classes. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Buding,&rdquo; played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4856\"><strong>Nanette Inventor</strong></a>, ridicules the sensibilities, illusions, and delusions of the middle class, the high society, and the filthy rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some comedy programs portray women as sex objects or as stupid and silly persons, like the women characters of <b><i>Chicks to Chicks</i></b> and the character of &ldquo;Liweng&rdquo; in <b><i>Duplex</i></b>, who are often seen wearing clothes with plunging necklines, or in shorts, bikinis, or micromini skirts to highlight their physical charms and delectable body, or unable to comprehend the simple situations in which they find themselves. Being an unmarried woman is a source of laughter for the character Miss Tapia in <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b>, or being a loud mouth, like that of Matutina in <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>. Sexist jokes permeate <b><i>Chicks to Chicks</i></b> and most gag skits in <b><i>T.O.D.A.S</i>. </b>Physical attributes of men and women, like the shape of one&rsquo;s body, the color of one&rsquo;s skin, or any physical deformity, are the butt of jokes in <b><i>Duplex</i> </b>and <b><i>T.O.D.A.S</i>.</b>, even in family-oriented comedies like <b><i>My Son, My Son</i></b>, <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, and <b><i>Cafeteria Aroma</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"programs\" name=\"programs\"></a>Programs for Children</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Local children&rsquo;s shows were more entertainment in orientation, and had themes that revolved around discipline, cooperation, and the nationalism of the New Society. Imee Marcos produced <b><i>Kaluskos Musmos </i></b>(Kiddie Noise), 1979-89, RPN 9, about children&rsquo;s fantasies and pranks and kiddie newscasts, directed by Johnny Manahan, with a cast of children headed by Maricel Soriano, Herbert Bautista, Dranreb Belleza, Princess Aquino, Maila Gumila, Siegfried Garcia, and Sharon Manabat, with adult mainstays Bert Marcelo, Gary Lising, Chichay, and Estrella Kuenzler. Its writers, considered the best in the genre, included Ading Fernando, George Javier, Gary Lising, and later cartoonist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\"><strong>Nonoy Marcelo</strong></a> and theater and film director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2739\"><strong>Dindo Angeles</strong></a>. BBC 2 produced <b><i>Kuskos Balungos</i></b> (Just Making Noise), 1980-82, and absorbed the senior children in the cast of <b><i>Kaluskos</i> </b>who &ldquo;graduated&rdquo; from the show, such as Soriano, Bautista, Gumila, Garcia, and Manabat, and added children Jose Mari Samson and Ronald Daguio, and later teen idol William Martinez. <b><i>Kuskos Balungos</i></b>, written by Raffy Oyales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5435\"><strong>Domingo Landicho</strong></a>, Rowie Morales, and Ed Morales, followed the format of <b><i>Kaluskos</i></b>. RPN 9 also produced <b><i>The New Raffle Gang</i></b>, 1979, hosted by Rina Reyes, Michael Uytengsu, Dolly Carvajal, who would become a movie columnist like mother Inday Badiday, and Andre Castillo, who would become part of the music group The Company. GMA 7 had <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b>, 1976-92, and <b><i>Telebong, Telebong, Telebong</i></b>, 1979, hosted by Willie Nepomuceno. GTV 4 had <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a>an ng mga Bata</i></b> (Children&rsquo;s Pastime) in the 1970s, produced by the Bureau of Public Schools. IBC 13 had <b><i>Communicating with Wilma</i></b>, also in the 1970s, hosted by Wilma Cruz Tapalla, on learning with kids, and <b><i>Kulit Bulilit </i></b>(Curious Children), 1982-88, another program produced by Imee Marcos similar to <b><i>Kuskos</i></b> and <b><i>Kaluskos</i></b>, written by Edna Mae Landicho and Ed Morales. In 1984, the Philippine Sesame Street Project came up with the educational show <b><i>Sesame</i></b>, 30 minutes of which is from the original <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b> and the remaining 30 minutes a Filipinized version, which introduced local muppets Kiko Matsing and Pong Pagong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"magazine\" name=\"magazine\"></a>Magazine Programs and Entertainment Talk Shows </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Magazine programs and talk shows of the period, even if promoted as informative, served more as entertainment than a platform for serious discussions. A pioneer of the daily morning talk show was the pre-martial law news-magazine program <b><i>The Morning Show</i></b>, which was revived during martial law as <b><i>Good Morning, Manila</i></b>, GTV 4, hosted by Ariel Ureta and Merce Henares, later replaced by Baby O&rsquo;Brien, and introduced Bibeth Orteza, who took advantage, in a positive note, of her heavy Ilonggo accent for her character in the program named Bibeth <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a>. The show featured personalities, the weather, sports, and other cultural facts, but less news. Another pioneer of the daily early morning talk show was <b><i>Coffee with Lee</i></b>, 1976, BBC 2, 8:00-9:00 am, hosted by Lee Andres and Noel Trinidad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An excellent magazine program beginning in the mid-1970s was <b><i>Metro Magazine</i></b>, a combination of talk, travelogue, and mini-documentaries, produced by Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s Metro Manila Commission. An episode was broadcast daily, each on a different day and time on each of all the five Metro Manila TV channels.

Other talk programs were <b><i>The Late Hour with June and Johnny</i></b>, GMA 7, with June Keithley and Johnny Litton; <b><i>Something with Pilita</i></b>, 1978, IBC 13, directed by Manolo Brion, where hosts Pilita Corrales and Eddie Mercado roast the program&rsquo;s guests, with pro-Marcos newspaper columnist Teodoro Valencia as one of their first &ldquo;victims;&rdquo; and <b><i>Celebrity</i></b>, 1979, GTV 4, hosted by basketball star Robert Jaworski and theater artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3359\"><strong>Joy Virata</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A prominent but often maligned television entertainment program host was Inday Badiday, whose movie talk shows on television <b><i>Nothing but the Truth</i></b>, 1976, followed by <b><i>Would You Believe?</i></b>, 1978, both on BBC 2, then <b><i>See-True</i></b>, 1979-87, on IBC 13 then on GMA, followed by two more shows after the EDSA Revolt, <b><i>Eye-to-Eye</i></b>, 1988, and <b><i>The Truth and Nothing but the Truth</i></b>, 2000, both on GMA, focused on showbiz gossips and controversies and featured a panel of movie reporters who queried invited stars who often lied in their answers. Guests were mostly superstars, soft-core porn actors, aging starlets, vulnerable young actors, and showbiz personalities eyeing public office. Her shows put on camera movie reporters who were then considered taboo on the air. These showbiz reporters include Lolit Solis, Cristy Fermin, Nap Gutierrez, Lulubelle Lam Ramos, Anselle Beluso, Aster Amoyo, Jun Nardo, and Eugene Asis, some of whom would later have their own radio and television talk shows or segments in popular broadcast entertainment programs. To acknowledge <b><i>Nothing but the Truth</i></b>&rsquo;s sponsors, Inday would say, &ldquo;<i>Pasok, Noli</i>&rdquo; (Your turn, Noli), and the voice-over of Noli would enumerate the show&rsquo;s sponsors; the voice was that of Noli de Castro, who would become vice president of the country. Inday Badiday simultaneously hosted the daily radio showbiz talk and counseling program <b><i>Inday ng Buhay Ko</i></b> (The Woman of My Life), DWWA, which she regularly ended with a piece of advice that referred to the insincere and hypocritical relationships common in the entertainment industry: &ldquo;Bye for now. <i>Mag-ingat sa mga taong hindi mo kilala; mas lalo kang mag-ingat sa mga taong kilala mo</i>.&rdquo; (Bye for now. Beware of people you don&rsquo;t know, more so with people you already know.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>See-True</i></b> was the most prominent movie talk show on television during the martial law period, gaining national prominence at a time when public affairs talk show on television was gaining ground, buoyed up by the political events of the period as a result of the 1983 assassination of Ninoy Aquino. Talk programs, specifically public affairs programs, before Aquino&rsquo;s assassination were those sanctioned by the regime. After Aquino&rsquo;s assassination, political talk programs began to go on the air, such as <b><i>Viewpoint</i></b>, 1984-94, GMA 7, hosted by Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno. It tackled national issues that captured the imagination of the restless middle class. These programs, according to Capino, became &ldquo;a public ritual of interrogation and discussion, denial and confession&rdquo; (2003, 263). Capino contends that Inday Badiday&rsquo;s <b><i>See-True</i></b> reflected, unintentionally, the conduct of public affairs on television that relied on the spectacular and the lachrymose, and capitalized on the blurred distinctions between the public and the private, the vulgar and the sacred, the vicious and the virtuous, the political and the showbiz, the real and the fake, the truth and the lie. Both showbiz and politics lie. But, says Inday Badiday in an interview, &ldquo;truth in showbiz is different from truth in politics. In showbiz, when a movie star tells a lie, it is entertaining. In politics, when a politician tells a lie, no matter how small, it can ruin the nation&rdquo; (HRC 2005).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"drama\" name=\"drama\"></a>Drama Programs </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio dramas during the martial law period were melodrama and fantasy stories. Most radio melodrama serials were produced by MBC&rsquo;s DZRH, RPN&rsquo;s DWWW, and RMN&rsquo;s DZXL. Themes on radio dramas were usually about suffering as God&rsquo;s test of individual faith, as reflected in <b><i>Maja Vida</i></b> (Pleasant Life) on DWWW; the poor are always blessed by God, as shown in <b><i>Kasaysayan ni Aida Nu&ntilde;ez</i></b> (Story of Aida Nu&ntilde;ez) and <b><i>True Confessions</i></b> on DZRH; the poor are always happy, as depicted in <b><i>Pinagpala</i></b> (Blessed) on DZRH; love is powerful, as exemplified in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/913\"><strong>Kapantay ay Langit</strong></a></i></b> (As Hight as Heaven) on DWWW, <b><i>Love Story</i></b> on DZRH, and <b><i>Di Ko Malilimot</i></b> (I Will Never Forget), <b><i>Alaala ng Isang Awit</i></b> (Memory of a Song), and <b><i>Hibik ng Puso</i></b> (Lamentations of the Heart), all on DZXL; and happy endings await a faith-filled character, such as the return of the prodigal child, the return of the unfaithful husband, the punishment of the culprit, the spiritual rebirth of a bad character, and the reward of the faithful, as dramatized in <b><i>Lumipas na Madaling Araw</i></b> (Forgotten Morn) on DZXL, and <b><i>Bukang-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> sa Takipsilim</i></b> (Dawn at Dusk) on DZRH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most popular radio productions was the fantasy-adventure drama serial <b><i>Zimatar</i></b>, written by Pedro Tiangco, which started its run in the 1970s and went on the air for two decades on DZRH. It is about a young prince searching for his lost mother and whose kingdom is threatened by a rival kingdom. The characters of Zimatar and his assistant Eng-eng were voiced by Eloisa Cruz-Canlas, while the character of Tagani was performed by Mike Perez, who replaced Ben David&rsquo;s voice-over for the horror drama <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> (Night of Terror). A hit melodrama that came out in 1973 and is still airing on DZRH is the daily soap <b><i>Ito ang Palad Ko</i></b> (This Is My Fate), directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jun Soler, aka Virgilio Garcia Jr, and Raquel Monteza, which features one complete story per day. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> are usually above love and domestic issues. Some voice talents of the anthology are Rosanna Villegas, Leonel Benjamin, and Rashida Elba Abanco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prominent radio voice drama talents of the period are Tani Cruz, Greg Arnaldo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4830\"><strong>Luz Fernandez</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4968\"><strong>Mely Tagasa</strong></a></strong>, the last two becoming popular on television and film. Other voice talents, some of whom also alternated as radio drama directors and most of whom are still active, are Tony Angeles, Vilma Borromeo, Nick de Guzman, Chiquit del Carmen-Amor, Jun Legaspi, and Susan Lemon. Sound designers include Froilan Malimban, Bobby Salonga, Eric Lucero, Manny Salas, and Froilan Villegas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine drama programs on television during the martial law period were weekly one-hour melodrama anthologies, followed later on by daily serials. Weekly dramas during the period relied less on good narrative than on the audience-drawing power of stars. The titles alone of weekly drama anthologies beginning in 1974 provide an indication of this phenomenon: Tina Revilla&rsquo;s <b><i>Christina</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Dulambuhay ni Rosa Vilma </i></b>(Life Story of Rosa Vilma) directed by Mitos Villareal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4952\"><strong>Marcial Sanson</strong></a>, and Pinky de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Ito Ako, Pinky</i></b> (This Is Me, Pinky) directed by Sanson, all on BBC 2; Tirso Cruz III&rsquo;s <b><i>Sila sa Buhay ni Tirso</i></b> (They Who Are Part of Tirso&rsquo;s Life) and <b><i>Chat <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1004\"><strong>Silayan</strong></a> Drama Studio</i></b>, 1981-86, both on GMA 7; Nora Aunor&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b> (The Colorful World of Nora), directed by Lupita Concio, on KBS-RPN 9; and <b><i>Coney Reyes-Mumar Drama Studio</i></b>, 1977-81 on GMA 7, then 1984-89 on RPN 9, directed by Mario O&rsquo;Hara and Argel Joseph. <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b> and <b><i>Coney Reyes-Mumar Drama Studio</i></b> showed gems in some of their episodes. The heavy reliance on women actors in drama programs continued on to the post-EDSA years, this time with investments on the stars&rsquo; commercial packaging that included spinning drama on the real lives of the stars themselves to compensate for the lack of dramaturgy in their television drama programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The daily serialized drama on television during the martial law period was introduced in 1977, the first of which was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate), 1977-85, on BBC 2, followed by <b><i>Mga Kuwento ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Stories of Love), RPN 9. <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b>, reincarnated from the daily radio soap of the same title created by writer <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong> that aired on DZRH from 1949 to 1956, is a family drama that focuses on the travails of a young couple: Carding (Ronald Courveau), a loving yet philandering husband who comes from a rich family, and Luisa (Marianne de la Riva), a suffering and martyr wife who comes from a poor family and is always emotionally tormented by her cruel mother-in-law (Tita de Villa). The TV series was directed by Marcial Sanson and written by Lina Flor&rsquo;s sister, Loida Viri&ntilde;a. It launched the career of child actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4958\"><strong>Romnick Sarmenta</strong></a> who played Peping in the program, and also starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4669\"><strong>Caridad Sanchez</strong></a>, Beth Bautista, Metring David, and Augusto Victa. In a 1978 survey, it garnered a 63.1 percent audience share, a feat rarely accomplished by any broadcast program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period also witnessed the stiff competition of two daily late afternoon soaps that each featured children. <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, 1979-84, RPN 9, also written by Loida Viri&ntilde;a, and alternately directed by Mario O&rsquo;Hara, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3084\"><strong>Leo Martinez</strong></a>, Benny Rivera, Orlando Nadres, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3354\"><strong>Lorli Villanueva</strong></a>, and Tony Santos Sr, introduced child actor Janice de Belen who played the title role. <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, 1980-85, GMA 7, directed by Gil Soriano, starred Julie Vega.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, based on a radio drama written by Marcos Navarro Sacol, is about an 11-year-old girl from a middle-class family who tries to keep her family intact in the face of several trials they face, one of which is the meanness of her stepmother, played by Laurice Guillen. Flor&rsquo;s father is a military man, played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4434\"><strong>Dindo Fernando</strong></a>. Flor is also tormented by her cruel stepgrandmother, Nyora Agueda, played by Carmen Enriquez. <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, on the other hand, is about the trials and tribulations of a poor young girl. Anna Liza is an abused child yet is civil and caring toward people whose lives she touches and changes in a positive way. The series ended when Vega died in 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some daily drama serials were aired in the morning, such as <b><i>Damdamin</i></b> (Feelings) and <b><i>Nang Dahil sa Pag-ibig</i></b> (Because of Love), both in the late 1970s and on GMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many weekly television drama programs featured real-life stories of viewers who sent in their narratives to popular counseling programs, such as <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday), 1976-86, hosted by Eddie Ilarde, and <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>, 1980-96, hosted by Helen Vela, both on GMA 7. The stories were mostly about domestic concerns, especially issues revolving around marital issues and relationships between lovers, but there were also true stories of orphaned children in <b><i>Ulila </i></b>(Orphan), hosted by Rosal Rosal, 1978-79, on BBC 2. Dramas with children were popular. Child actor Romnick Sarmenta appeared in four weekly drama anthologies: <b><i>Peping: Ang Munting Anghel</i></b> (Peping: The Little Angel), 1976; <b><i>Bata </i></b>(Child); <b><i>True Story</i></b>; and <b><i>Se&ntilde;or Santo Ni&ntilde;o</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some fiction drama programs made use of action as a main vehicle to discuss love, oppression, and revenge, such as <b><i>Bertong Dragon</i></b> (Berto the Dragon), starring Ramon Zamora, on GTV 4, which was patterned after Bruce Lee karate movies, or horror to exemplify the battle between good and evil, such as <b><i>Guni-guni</i></b> (Imagination), 1979, on GMA 7, or fantasy to highlight moral values, such as <b><i>Ora Engkantada</i></b> (Enchanted Hour), 1973, on GTV 4, then on BBC 2 in the late 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Weekly television drama anthologies that followed the social realist tradition started by the pre-martial law <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), 1968-71, ABC-RTV5, were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1468\"><strong>Maskara</strong></a> </i></b>(Mask), 1979, on BBC 2, a critique of the entertainment industry; <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/649\"><strong>Rosas</strong></a></strong></i> </b>(Rose), 1979, on Channel 4, about women&rsquo;s social issues; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (Light of the Home), 1979, on BBC 2, about the family trials of a mother, all produced by Armida Siguion-Reyna.

This could be considered the first miniseries on Philippine television, later to be called telenovela in the 2000s. RPN 9 produced the drama special <b><i>Alab ng Lahi </i></b>(Ardor of the Race). The weekly anthology <b><i>Dahong Ginto </i></b>(Golden Leaf), 1973, on IBC 13, and Mario O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s TV adaptation of a Spanish novel, <b><i>Marcelino, Pan y Vino: Alamat o <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a>? </i></b>(Marcelino, Bread and Wine: Legend or Miracle?), 1979, on BBC 2, followed the initial efforts by Fr James Reuter of adapting literary classics to television in the mid-1960s.

Some of the directors of these television drama programs were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>, Mario O&rsquo;Hara, Maryo J. de los Reyes, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4698\"><strong>Romy Suzara</strong></a></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4598\"><strong>Elwood Perez</strong></a></strong></strong>, Joey Gosengfiao, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4884\"><strong>Nick Lizaso</strong></a>, and Tony Santos Sr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both radio and television dramas are often trapped in delineating female stereotypes: &ldquo;the woman as martyr, as femme fatale, as sacrificial lamb, as the faithful shadow, as the manipulator&rdquo; (Reyes 1991, 188). Most situations depict them mostly in the confined spaces of the household, in which their characters are unable to relate their domestic concerns to pertinent social issues. Their situations are often &ldquo;the conflict between mother and daughter, the struggle between two sisters for their parents&rsquo; attention, and coping with delinquent children&rdquo; (Reyes 1991, 189). While most dramas revolve mainly around women, their representation in these dramas remains conventional and orthodox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the social realist drama anthologies indeed offered &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; perspectives on poverty, prostitution, unemployment, and other social concerns on TV, which could be considered a breakthrough under very restrictive conditions of the broadcast industry, particularly given the tight hold of the government and the military on the medium and First Lady Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s insistence on &ldquo;the true, the good, and the beautiful&rdquo; and Manila as the &ldquo;City of Man.&rdquo; The narratives of these drama programs countered the highly romanticist and didactic orientation of most fictional broadcast narratives of the period. However, in these drama series and anthologies, society is a prison, and the characters end up helpless, dead, or as social deviants, criminals, and prostitutes left with no recourse but to fight back courageously as individuals, but still to be defeated in the end. Such discourse in the broadcast narratives of the period was critically backward if compared to the alternatives offered by a sector in the literary movement, specifically the writers of the early 1970s, like the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/662\"><strong>Sigwa</strong></a></strong> group and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5565\"><strong>Panulat para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan</strong></a> (PAKSA), who saw the need to provide narratives whose characters wield an agency that considers collective and liberative ways of responding to social injustices. If taken within the frame of the Sigwa and PAKSA writers, the broadcast drama of the 1970s encouraged a tradition of defeat, not a literature that liberates (Nofuente 1986). The drama genre of a few programs of the martial law era was socially daring and progressive within the boundaries of the broadcast industry and the martial law discourse of Philippine renaissance television, but quite off the mark when contextualized in the national struggle for liberation from the dictatorship of the Marcos regime and the hold of the United States on the country&rsquo;s economy and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"other\" name=\"other\"></a>Other Programs</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pioneers of culinary shows were <b><i>Cooking It Up with Nora</i></b>, BBC 2, with host Nora Daza demonstrating cooking lessons and providing practical tips on preparing Filipino and foreign recipes. A worthy program on consumers was <b><i>Ang Mamimili</i></b> (The Consumer), 1979, GTV 4, hosted by Gerry Geronimo, with Aida Sevilla-Mendoza handling its &ldquo;Action Line&rdquo; portion. A radio program that caught the curiosity of many was the daily program of Johnny Midnight (aka John William Xeres-Burgos Joseph Jr) on DZBB from midnight to 2:00 am, which provided listeners with health tips and religious references. Johnny Midnight was one of those radio journalists who became famous with his on-the-spot coverage of the collapse of the six-story Ruby Tower in Binondo on 2 Aug 1968 following an intensity 7 earthquake that rocked Manila, with 342 of the building&rsquo;s 600 tenants losing their lives. In 1981, he introduced in the program a water therapy session called &ldquo;toning&rdquo; and pyramid healing. Listeners were asked to place a glass of water within reach. The glass must be under a pyramid, which he himself sold. The pyramid was made of aluminum tubes believed to radiate an astral energy that gives the water its curing qualities. The time of the &ldquo;healing&rdquo; session varied, so listeners had to stay tuned in, but the &ldquo;toning&rdquo; session on the air lasted for 15 minutes. He would end the session by playing the George Canseco composition &ldquo;Bulaklak&rdquo; (Flower), sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\"><strong>Kuh Ledesma</strong></a>. At the height of its popularity, Dyna Records released <b><i>Toning: Johnny Midnight</i></b>, a long-playing talk and music album of the broadcaster&rsquo;s &ldquo;self-healing&rdquo; science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A two-hour special was the animated version of the Iluko epic <b><i>Biag ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></i></b>, which aired on RPN 9 on 21 Sep 1979, directed by cartoonist Nonoy Marcelo and Salvii Casino, with the script written by Marcelo himself. It was an unusual project because animation was rarely pursued in Philippine television, particularly during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The programs that consistently topped the ratings, always overtaking even popular programs like <b><i>Superstar</i> </b>and <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, were the live coverage of basketball games, such as those by the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) and the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). A ratings winner when it was aired on Channel 4 before martial law, the MICAA coverage, this time produced by Jun Jison, first aired on RBS 7 for a few months in 1973, then moved to BBC 2 later that year until 1974. The PBA coverage, produced by Jison, Romy Jalosjos, and Ramy Diez, aired on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays on BBC 2 beginning on 9 Apr 1975. Its undisputed success in the ratings was bolstered by the euphoria of the rivalry between the teams of Crispa and Toyota. The anchors of the PBA coverage were Dick Ildefonso and Emy Arcilla. Florencio Campomanes hosted a show for chess fans, <b><i>Chess with the Masters</i></b>; he is the first and so far the only Filipino who became president of Federation Internationale des Echecs or FIDE, the world chess federation. <b><i>Chess Today</i></b> on GTV 4 was hosted by chess expert Glenn Bordonada and Campomanes. <b><i>Marlboro Hour of Sports</i></b>, GMA 7, featured sporting competitions like car racing, rodeo riding, cycling, skiing, and motocross events. <b><i>Blow by Blow</i></b>, GTV 4, featured live local professional and amateur boxing bouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Old Filipino movies were broadcast on TV in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\"><strong>Sinehan</strong></a> Dos</i></b> (Movie Theater on Two) and <b><i>Sunday Super Sine</i></b> (Sunday Super Movie) on BBC 2; <b><i>Tagalog Movie</i></b> on GTV 4; <b><i>Aliwang Pang-umaga</i></b> (Morning Entertainment), <b><i>Sine Siete</i></b> (Cinema Seven), and <b><i>Sine Espesyal</i></b> (Special Movies) on GMA 7; and <b><i>Cine Pinoy</i></b> (Pinoy Cinema), <b><i>Piling-Piling Pelikula</i></b> (Highly Selected Movies), <b><i>IBCinema 1</i></b>, and <b><i>Roadshow Pilipino</i></b> on IBC 13. <b><i>Movie Parade</i></b> and <b><i>Movie Date</i></b>, IBC 13, featured excerpts of movies currently showing or about to be shown in movie houses in Manila and clips of movies-in-the-making. Documentary films from different embassies based in Manila were shown on <b><i>Embassy Film</i></b>, GMA 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television specials hosted by the Philippine government that had simultaneous international broadcasts were the 23rd <b><i>Miss Universe Pageant</i></b>, held at the Folk Arts Theater in Manila on 21 Jul 1974, and <b><i>Thrilla in Manila</i></b>, the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a> in Quezon City on 1 Oct 1975, both of which were broadcast live by RPN 9. Some critics point out that the efforts by the Marcos government to sponsor these two events were to divert the attention of the public from the social turmoil that the country was experiencing under martial law. Marcos loyalist Ronnie Nathanielsz said Marcos &ldquo;wanted to show that the Philippines was stable, had no peace and order problem, and the country was moving forward economically&rdquo; (Teves 2011).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"technology\" name=\"technology\"></a>The Technology of Orality </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At a time when mainstream media, controlled by those with economic and political power, was either lying about the conditions of the country or reluctant to report events that run counter to the stance of the government, marginalized and socially underprivileged groups, such as peasants, indigenous peoples, and workers, relied on traditional folk media to &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; news and analyses about their locality. An example of this form of communication is the <i>komposo</i>, specifically used in the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A komposo is generally a short piece of song similar to the corrido<i> </i>of Mexico (Simmons 1957). In most cases, it has four to six stanzas, and each stanza usually has four lines. A komposo of this length runs under five minutes. In some cases, it may be a long narrative. The komposo is usually sung any time and any day by common folks in public places or in very important community gatherings. It has structures, rhymes, and patterns that are popular among the people. The singer follows the pattern but changes the narrative verses of the song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Generally, the subject of the komposo is a news item. The song carries stories of crime and passion that happened in the community; disasters, tragedies, domestic squabbles, and other events perceived as important by members of the community; or messages that are didactic in nature, such as expressions of moral standards and religious beliefs. During the height of the Marcos dictatorship, the komposo bannered human rights violations committed by government authorities or the military, issues of land-grabbing, lives of folk heroes, latest attacks against the government by revolutionary forces, and political campaigns launched by certain groups to advance a specific cause. The narrative below about civilians caught in the cross fire between government forces and communist insurgents in an island in the Visayas is an example of this type of &ldquo;newscast,&rdquo; which was rarely reported in mainstream commercial media, even after the EDSA Revolt in 1986. The excerpt is from a komposo by a <i>tuba </i>(coconut wine) gatherer in the village of Batan in Aklan province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sa makarong tiyempo sige rong pinaeatyan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Halin sa siyudad ag sa kabukiran</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">NPA ag army naga-aeambusan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nadadaeahig ro ibang sibilyan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Sung by Raco Roberto; lifted from French 1994, 33.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(These days, a lot of killing takes place</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both in the cities and in the mountain areas</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ambuscades between NPAs and military men</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Catch civilians in the cross fire.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other similar forms of communication, like the <i>ismayling</i>, <i>balitaw</i>, <i>luwa</i>, <i>tablay</i>,<i> salidum-ay</i>, <i>ogayan</i>, and <i>baleleng</i>, were tapped by various local communities in the country as outlets of information that mainstream broadcast media were reluctant or afraid to cover. Traditional theater forms, such as the <i>sarsuwela</i>, <i>panunuluyan</i> (Christmas Eve playlet), <i>sinakulo</i>, and <i>bodabil</i>, were revitalized with the infusion of liberative messages. New forms, such as the <i>tula-dula</i> (poem-play) and <i>kanta-koryo</i> (choral interpretations), were employed by progressive groups in mass actions they launched beginning in the early 1980s, which grew in number and scope particularly after the assassination of Ninoy Aquino. Propaganda messages, interspersed with protest music, were recorded on cassette tapes and cartridges, which were played and amplified by megaphone speakers in jeepneys as they go around the main streets of Manila and other provincial cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Progressive artists produced video and film documentaries that exposed human rights violations, poverty, and the corruption of the Marcos regime and the role of the United States in the political affairs of the country. Foremost among these artists were those who formed in 1982 the alternative video group Asia Visions, composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4701\"><strong>Lito Tiongson</strong></a>, Joe Cuaresma, Danny Consumido, Joey Clemente, and Nonoy Regalado. Some of the documentaries the organization produced during the height of the protest movement against Marcos were <b><i>The Arrogance of Power</i></b>, which traced the rise of Marcos to power and documented the rising tide of protest against his government; <b><i>Lakbayan: Lakad ng Bayan para sa Kalayaan</i></b> (March of the People: Long March for Freedom), which documented the one-week nationwide march of farmers, workers, students, professionals, church people, and artists from Angeles City in the north and San Pablo City in the south that both culminated at the Luneta Grandstand; <b><i>Beyond Prison</i></b>, which is about the lives of political prisoners and the tortures perpetrated on political detainees by the military or agents of the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When mainstream commercial and government media tended to lie or limit the expanse of truth, the technology of orality and the alternatives proffered by progressive groups became more reliable than the technology of &ldquo;hard&rdquo; electronic equipment for people in areas with limited or no access to mainstream media. These various forms of &ldquo;narrowcasting&rdquo; by the underprivileged and the politically marginalized served as a parallel form of broadcasting. These traditional and revitalized forms were as contemporary as the evolving modern technologies of modern broadcast media. Through this alternative &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; media track, people mediated meanings and interpretations about events in Philippine society beyond what commercialized and government-controlled media were able to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"broadcast\" name=\"broadcast\"></a>Broadcast Media and the 1986 EDSA Revolt </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Restrictions on radio and television news coverage began to ease up somewhat in Dec 1985 after Pres Marcos announced that he was running for reelection in a special election set for Feb 1986. The elections that Marcos called, which he announced on the American ABC-TV show <b><i>This Week with David Brinkley</i></b>, proved to be the dictator&rsquo;s own undoing. The political opposition party was able to run several campaign spots for their presidential candidate Corazon &ldquo;Cory&rdquo; Cojuangco Aquino on GMA 7, even if only for a while. Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel were the candidates for president and vice president, respectively, of the political opposition. Marcos even appointed to the Commission on Elections Ramon Felipe Jr, a commissioner recommended by the dominant political opposition party. Felipe would later on be appointed chairman of the commission during the incumbency of Pres Corazon Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The reforms were introduced by Marcos because many foreign observers critical of the political situation in the Philippines were arriving in Manila to monitor the elections. As expected, the elections were marred by cheating, highlighted by the walkout of computer operators from the site of the operations quick count at La Salle Greenhills. In the end, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his vice-presidential running mate Arturo Tolentino the winners in the 1986 special elections, popularly referred to as the &ldquo;snap&rdquo; elections. The people did not accept the results of the elections. The rising tide of the people&rsquo;s power could not be contained. Rallies and demonstrations were unstoppable. A segment of the military did not accept the election results, either. The military turned its back on Marcos, and mounted a mutiny which won the support of the people. Jaime Cardinal Sin, the archbishop of Manila, spoke on Radio Veritas, asking the people to congregate on EDSA to support the splinter group of Juan Ponce Enrile and Gen Fidel Ramos that was sheltered in Camp Crame. That mutiny succeeded in ousting Marcos from power and has come to be called the 1986 EDSA Revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even in its final days in late Feb 1986, the martial law government of Pres Marcos did not back down in preventing the free dissemination of the news. June Keithley-Castro was the broadcaster who used Radio Veritas to rally the people to join the military mutineers and protest the victory of Pres Marcos. When Radio Veritas became the voice of the revolution, military goons destroyed its facilities in Quezon City, and threatened the staff of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s radio station. It would be too risky for Veritas to put Keithley on air. Keithley&rsquo;s group tried the Far East Broadcasting Company, the Protestant-owned classical music radio station. The station was willing, but its location in Valenzuela, Metro Manila, was too far. Finally, Keithley turned to DZRJ owned by the Rajah Broadcasting Company of the Jacinto family, who were then living in the United States. DZRJ broadcast over 810 and Radio Veritas on 846. The frequency of DZRJ was reconfigured from 810 to 846, so the signal could be received on Radio Veritas. Keithley continued broadcasting under a nom de guerre, Radyo Bandido; updated the listeners on what was happening on EDSA; encouraged them to be one with the people; and started playing &ldquo;Mambo Magsaysay,&rdquo; the old 1953 campaign song of Pres Ramon Magsaysay composed by Raul Manglapus. The Magsaysay mambo served as the theme song of the crusade against the dictatorship of Pres Marcos during these tumultuous days on EDSA. On 24 Feb, Marcos went on the air on government television Channel 4. An unforgettable image was that of Gen Fabian Ver getting the permission of the president to &ldquo;annihilate&rdquo; the rebels. Marcos was unable to finish his announcement on TV. The station was put off the air by rebel troops who had taken over the station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later in the afternoon, the government station went back on the air. This time, however, the announcers were those on the side of the rebels, among whom were Jose Mari Velez, Ma-an Hontiveros, Orly Punzalan, Noel Trinidad, Subas Herrero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\"><strong>Jim Paredes</strong></a>, and Keithley. TV director Mitos Villareal &ldquo;hired a helicopter and took the shots of the million-strong crowd at EDSA&rdquo; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 120). The rebel forces and the civilians had captured Channel 4 and all other broadcast stations, which practically carried the coverage of the inauguration of Corazon Aquino at Club Filipino as the new president of the country. A parallel presidential inauguration of Marcos was taking place at Malaca&ntilde;an, covered by RPN 9, the network where he announced the declaration of martial law in 1972, and now the last media outlet still in government control. The coverage of the inauguration was interrupted. Rebel forces had taken over the station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Clearly, the EDSA revolt was not mainly a shooting battle. It was foremost a broadcast media war, an all-out battle to control the airwaves, the main resource and recourse of competing sociopolitical forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 25 Feb 1986, Pres Marcos, with his family and close associates, fled to Hawaii. His regime was ended unceremoniously. With his ouster from office came the end of one-man rule in the Philippines and the dawn of a new order of freedom for the nation&rsquo;s broadcast media.<em><strong>Written by Victor C.

Marcos, through Proclamation 1081, lasted from 21 Sep 1972 until 17 Jan 1981 when Marcos officially lifted it by way of Proclamation 2045. The latter proclamation notwithstanding, authoritarian government remained, as seen in the power of Marcos to continue to legislate concurrently with the Batasang Pambansa, the legislative assembly under the 1973 Constitution. From 1981 up to early 1986, the military could still order the arrest and detention of citizens, media personnel included, and shut down any periodical or broadcast station for virtually any reason. It is from this perspective that martial law in the Philippines is seen as the period covering 21 Sep 1972 up to the downfall of the Marcos administration on 25 Feb 1986."

By the middle of 1972, Marcos was more than halfway into his second term as president and his political enemies were getting ready for the Nov 1973 presidential elections. The 1935 Constitution, the charter then in force, denied Marcos a third term. Other events that marked the period were the infamous Plaza Miranda bombing in Quiapo, Manila, on 21 Aug 1971 and the staged assassination attempt on then defense secretary Juan Ponce Enrile hours before the declaration of martial law."

A legislative franchise was in the form of a Republic Act duly approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.

English was the language that prevailed on FM at the time. Having a steady supply of jokes was a major concern. Deejays read jokes verbatim on air, lifted from published joke books, which were based on American humor, resulting in a rather toned-down version of mass-based program formats of the 1990s on through the 2000s. Surprisingly, DWKC managed to capture part of the high-end market, gaining a huge following among high school students from exclusive schools and elevating the station&#x2019;s deejays to celebrity status.

Developments in telecommunications technology after 1972 made it possible to transmit television programs to key cities in the Visayas and Mindanao by relay stations. Satellite technology, which improved immensely in the middle of the 1970s, also contributed to the wider reach of television during this period, simultaneous with the continuing hold of transnational corporations on the telecommunications industry of the country, which became one of the most concentrated areas of business ownership and one of the primary generators of foreign investments in the country, specifically in so-called growth centers although mainly carried out in Manila and in export processing zones. The industry had interlocking interests with large transnational corporations and also became associated with military security. The telecommunications industry provided the conduit for transnational advertising, the system that brought together the separated regions of the country, and the infrastructure that integrated the nation into the globalized world system."

RPN also served as the relay station of IBC&#x2019;s 12 television and 18 radio stations, as well as those of KBS, BBC, and GTV. DOMSAT went full blast in its operation in Jan 1980 in preparation for the provincial and municipal elections during the same year, which made possible the national coverage of candidates under Marcos&#x2019;s political party, the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL).

Subscribers to the service received programs from two channels&#x2014;namely, 5 and 11&#x2014;on their regular television dial. The subscription fee was rather expensive, and the service was available only to the plush subdivisions in Makati, San Juan, Pasig, and Quezon City. Benedicto&#x2019;s cable TV was considered by critics &#x201C;a political animal&#x201D; operated by the Marcos administration to &#x201C;monopolize all the channels of VHF and close the airwaves to other bidders&#x201D; so much so that &#x201C;aside from the commercial channels, cable Channels 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 were now also under government control&#x201D; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 105). Although Benedicto had monopoly of cable TV, &#x201C;illegal&#x201D; operations were widespread in the provinces, mainly to bring via cable broadcast signals that could not reach certain areas. It was a response to a demand that could not be met by broadcasting via the air. Cable subscription was 60 pesos per month.

ETPI had Benedicto as one of its principal partners.

The industry, with interlocking local and global interests, made it possible for these investors to market their products and services under the full protection and support of the Marcos government. The expansion of international capital informed the transnationalization of media, which, in turn, fed into the strategic development goals of the military government of Marcos that favored the concentration of capital among friendly members of the elite, which would later be termed as crony capitalism. Indeed, the broadcast media industry, both as part of the bigger telecommunications industry and as a conduit of transnational capital, is one classic example of the operations of crony capitalism during the martial law period."

Talk programs, specifically public affairs programs, before Aquino&#x2019;s assassination were those sanctioned by the regime.

Capino contends that Inday Badiday&#x2019;s <b><i>See-True</i></b> reflected, unintentionally, the conduct of public affairs on television that relied on the spectacular and the lachrymose, and capitalized on the blurred distinctions between the public and the private, the vulgar and the sacred, the vicious and the virtuous, the political and the showbiz, the real and the fake, the truth and the lie. Both showbiz and politics lie. But, says Inday Badiday in an interview, &#x201C;truth in showbiz is different from truth in politics. In showbiz, when a movie star tells a lie, it is entertaining. In politics, when a politician tells a lie, no matter how small, it can ruin the nation&#x201D; (HRC 2005)."

However, in these drama series and anthologies, society is a prison, and the characters end up helpless, dead, or as social deviants, criminals, and prostitutes left with no recourse but to fight back courageously as individuals, but still to be defeated in the end. Such discourse in the broadcast narratives of the period was critically backward if compared to the alternatives offered by a sector in the literary movement, specifically the writers of the early 1970s, like the <strong><a href=\"/7/58/662\"><strong>Sigwa</strong></a></strong> group and the <a href=\"/9/80/5565\"><strong>Panulat para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan</strong></a> (PAKSA), who saw the need to provide narratives whose characters wield an agency that considers collective and liberative ways of responding to social injustices. If taken within the frame of the Sigwa and PAKSA writers, the broadcast drama of the 1970s encouraged a tradition of defeat, not a literature that liberates (Nofuente 1986). The drama genre of a few programs of the martial law era was socially daring and progressive within the boundaries of the broadcast industry and the martial law discourse of Philippine renaissance television, but quite off the mark when contextualized in the national struggle for liberation from the dictatorship of the Marcos regime and the hold of the United States on the country&#x2019;s economy and politics."

Florencio Campomanes hosted a show for chess fans, <b><i>Chess with the Masters</i></b>; he is the first and so far the only Filipino who became president of Federation Internationale des Echecs or FIDE, the world chess federation. <b><i>Chess Today</i></b> on GTV 4 was hosted by chess expert Glenn Bordonada and Campomanes. <b><i>Marlboro Hour of Sports</i></b>, GMA 7, featured sporting competitions like car racing, rodeo riding, cycling, skiing, and motocross events. <b><i>Blow by Blow</i></b>, GTV 4, featured live local professional and amateur boxing bouts."

Some critics point out that the efforts by the Marcos government to sponsor these two events were to divert the attention of the public from the social turmoil that the country was experiencing under martial law. Marcos loyalist Ronnie Nathanielsz said Marcos &#x201C;wanted to show that the Philippines was stable, had no peace and order problem, and the country was moving forward economically&#x201D; (Teves 2011)."

				"value": "At a time when mainstream media, controlled by those with economic and political power, was either lying about the conditions of the country or reluctant to report events that run counter to the stance of the government, marginalized and socially underprivileged groups, such as peasants, indigenous peoples, and workers, relied on traditional folk media to &#x201C;broadcast&#x201D; news and analyses about their locality. An example of this form of communication is the <i>komposo</i>, specifically used in the Visayas."

A komposo of this length runs under five minutes. In some cases, it may be a long narrative. The komposo is usually sung any time and any day by common folks in public places or in very important community gatherings. It has structures, rhymes, and patterns that are popular among the people. The singer follows the pattern but changes the narrative verses of the song."
			},

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Generally, the subject of the komposo is a news item. The song carries stories of crime and passion that happened in the community; disasters, tragedies, domestic squabbles, and other events perceived as important by members of the community; or messages that are didactic in nature, such as expressions of moral standards and religious beliefs. During the height of the Marcos dictatorship, the komposo bannered human rights violations committed by government authorities or the military, issues of land-grabbing, lives of folk heroes, latest attacks against the government by revolutionary forces, and political campaigns launched by certain groups to advance a specific cause. The narrative below about civilians caught in the cross fire between government forces and communist insurgents in an island in the Visayas is an example of this type of &#x201C;newscast,&#x201D; which was rarely reported in mainstream commercial media, even after the EDSA Revolt in 1986. The excerpt is from a komposo by a <i>tuba </i>(coconut wine) gatherer in the village of Batan in Aklan province."

Traditional theater forms, such as the <i>sarsuwela</i>, <i>panunuluyan</i> (Christmas Eve playlet), <i>sinakulo</i>, and <i>bodabil</i>, were revitalized with the infusion of liberative messages. New forms, such as the <i>tula-dula</i> (poem-play) and <i>kanta-koryo</i> (choral interpretations), were employed by progressive groups in mass actions they launched beginning in the early 1980s, which grew in number and scope particularly after the assassination of Ninoy Aquino.

Some of the documentaries the organization produced during the height of the protest movement against Marcos were <b><i>The Arrogance of Power</i></b>, which traced the rise of Marcos to power and documented the rising tide of protest against his government; <b><i>Lakbayan: Lakad ng Bayan para sa Kalayaan</i></b> (March of the People: Long March for Freedom), which documented the one-week nationwide march of farmers, workers, students, professionals, church people, and artists from Angeles City in the north and San Pablo City in the south that both culminated at the Luneta Grandstand; <b><i>Beyond Prison</i></b>, which is about the lives of political prisoners and the tortures perpetrated on political detainees by the military or agents of the military."

The political opposition party was able to run several campaign spots for their presidential candidate Corazon &#x201C;Cory&#x201D; Cojuangco Aquino on GMA 7, even if only for a while. Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel were the candidates for president and vice president, respectively, of the political opposition.

Felipe would later on be appointed chairman of the commission during the incumbency of Pres Corazon Aquino."

In the end, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his vice-presidential running mate Arturo Tolentino the winners in the 1986 special elections, popularly referred to as the &#x201C;snap&#x201D; elections. The people did not accept the results of the elections. The rising tide of the people&#x2019;s power could not be contained. Rallies and demonstrations were unstoppable. A segment of the military did not accept the election results, either. The military turned its back on Marcos, and mounted a mutiny which won the support of the people. Jaime Cardinal Sin, the archbishop of Manila, spoke on Radio Veritas, asking the people to congregate on EDSA to support the splinter group of Juan Ponce Enrile and Gen Fidel Ramos that was sheltered in Camp Crame. That mutiny succeeded in ousting Marcos from power and has come to be called the 1986 EDSA Revolt."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Even in its final days in late Feb 1986, the martial law government of Pres Marcos did not back down in preventing the free dissemination of the news. June Keithley-Castro was the broadcaster who used Radio Veritas to rally the people to join the military mutineers and protest the victory of Pres Marcos. When Radio Veritas became the voice of the revolution, military goons destroyed its facilities in Quezon City, and threatened the staff of the Catholic Church&#x2019;s radio station. It would be too risky for Veritas to put Keithley on air. Keithley&#x2019;s group tried the Far East Broadcasting Company, the Protestant-owned classical music radio station. The station was willing, but its location in Valenzuela, Metro Manila, was too far. Finally, Keithley turned to DZRJ owned by the Rajah Broadcasting Company of the Jacinto family, who were then living in the United States. DZRJ broadcast over 810 and Radio Veritas on 846. The frequency of DZRJ was reconfigured from 810 to 846, so the signal could be received on Radio Veritas. Keithley continued broadcasting under a nom de guerre, Radyo Bandido; updated the listeners on what was happening on EDSA; encouraged them to be one with the people; and started playing &#x201C;Mambo Magsaysay,&#x201D; the old 1953 campaign song of Pres Ramon Magsaysay composed by Raul Manglapus. The Magsaysay mambo served as the theme song of the crusade against the dictatorship of Pres Marcos during these tumultuous days on EDSA. On 24 Feb, Marcos went on the air on government television Channel 4. An unforgettable image was that of Gen Fabian Ver getting the permission of the president to &#x201C;annihilate&#x201D; the rebels. Marcos was unable to finish his announcement on TV. The station was put off the air by rebel troops who had taken over the station."

TV director Mitos Villareal &#x201C;hired a helicopter and took the shots of the million-strong crowd at EDSA&#x201D; (Sioson-San Juan 1999, 120). The rebel forces and the civilians had captured Channel 4 and all other broadcast stations, which practically carried the coverage of the inauguration of Corazon Aquino at Club Filipino as the new president of the country. A parallel presidential inauguration of Marcos was taking place at Malaca&#xF1;an, covered by RPN 9, the network where he announced the declaration of martial law in 1972, and now the last media outlet still in government control. The coverage of the inauguration was interrupted. Rebel forces had taken over the station."

Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was in Camp Aguinaldo and AFP Vice Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos was in Camp Crame when they broke away from Marcos, initiated by the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) led by Lt Col Gregorio Honasan on 22 Feb 1986. When Orly Punzalan declared in the afternoon of 24 Feb 1986, &ldquo;Channel 4 is back on the air to serve the people. Now, you will get the truth from this channel,&rdquo; it was very clear that ousting the dictatorship necessitated capturing the very medium of its propagation. Punzalan&rsquo;s statement was both a critique of the media of lies that was the convention during the time of Marcos and a reaffirmation of the responsibility to truth of the broadcast media. It was the ultimate successor to a series of memorable mass media audiovisual moments: Marcos&rsquo;s announcement of the imposition of martial law on television, radio, and print on 23 Sep 1972; the announcement of the breakaway from Marcos by Enrile and Ramos; and the four-day EDSA Revolt, which, in its climax, witnessed the TV blackout during Marcos&rsquo;s press conference and the near-simultaneous oath-taking of Marcos and Aquino as the country&rsquo;s president, and culminated on 25 Feb 1986 with Marcos, his family, and cronies fleeing the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"aftermath\" name=\"aftermath\"></a>In the Aftermath of the 1986 EDSA Revolt </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Closure, Sequestration, Reopening, and Ownership of Media Networks</b>.

Tussles between the government and private media companies ensued when the Aquino administration sequestered the broadcast companies Marcos snipped for his cronies. The new government took over broadcast networks RPN 9, IBC 13, and BBC 2, which dominated the industry in terms of local entertainment productions and was considered the top networks during the martial law years (Tolentino 1987). IBC 13 suffered the most from complicated legal matters; it became a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> percent government-owned station in the 1990s by virtue of a compromise agreement between former owner Roberto Benedicto and the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Marcos&rsquo;s Maharlika Broadcasting System was renamed People&rsquo;s Television Network Channel 4, which, like Channel 9, continued operations but later suffered from the intensely competitive field of commercial broadcasting. The Lopezes recovered one station, Channel 2, and relaunched <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>. The company held a show, <b><i>Pagbabalik ng mga Bituin</i></b> (Return of the Stars), in Mar 1987 to signal its return to the media industry. ABS-CBN resumed broadcasting on 14 Sep 1986. The network, however, continued to struggle with the new government for nearly a decade over ownership of the station. GMA&rsquo;s triumvirate owners Gilberto M. Duavit Sr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4845\"><strong>Felipe L. Gozon</strong></a>, and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Menardo R. Jimenez</strong></a></strong></strong> changed the network&rsquo;s name from Greater Manila Area Radio Television Arts to Global Media Arts, with the same acronym. Both ABS-CBN and GMA would lord it over in the ratings game, which defined the character of commercial broadcasting of the post-EDSA period. The Elizaldes continued the broadcast of their radio network, the Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Aquino administration also sequestered the major newspapers that were considered loyal to Marcos: <b><i>Bulletin Today</i></b>, the <b><i>Philippines Daily Express</i></b>, and the Journal Group of publications. These pro-Marcos newspapers either retreated or closed shop, while the so-called alternative press, composed mainly of the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></i></b>, became the mainstream media. Pre-martial law newspapers were revived: the Roceses&rsquo; <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>, the Lopezes&rsquo; <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, and the Elizaldes&rsquo; <b><i>Manila Standard</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of the capital-intensive nature of media and the low return on investments of newspapers and broadcast networks, media ownership remained in the hands of individuals and families engaged in diverse business interests. Ownership of revived newspapers changed hands either due to economic reasons or the new policy that prohibited cross-media ownership. The new owners include the Prietos of the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>, Yap of Bulletin Corporation, the Gokongweis of the <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>, Go-Belmonte of the Star Group of Publications, Coyiuto of the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, Cabangon Chua of the <b><i>Philippines Graphic</i></b>, and the Locsins of the <b><i>Philippines</i></b><i> <b>Free Press</b></i>. Ownership of the new free TV network, VHF (very high frequency) station Channel 11, was contested by two religious charismatic groups: the Jesus Is Lord Movement of Brother Eddie Villanueva and the El Shaddai of Brother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Broadcast Media and Coup Attempts. </b>The Aquino administration and the broadcast networks during this tenuous period of political transition became easy targets of military coup attempts. Rightist or disgruntled members of the AFP, either coming from Marcos loyalists or Honasan&rsquo;s Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM), launched six coup plots to topple the Corazon Aquino administration from 1986 to 1989. Three of these coup attempts involved the seizure of broadcast networks to bring down the new government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos&rsquo;s losing vice-presidential running mate Arturo Tolentino led the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a> plot on 6-8 Jul 1986. Defense Secretary Enrile and the RAM masterminded and led the God Save the Queen plot on 22 Nov 1986. Pro-Marcos military loyalists seized GMA 7 and the Sangley Point Airport Base in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a> on 27-29 Jan 1987. Fifty-six rebel soldiers raided Fort Bonifacio on 18 Apr 1987, an event that came to be known as the Black Saturday incident. Some military members took over the Manila International Airport in Jul 1987. The 28-29 Aug 1987 coup, one of the most serious destabilizing attacks by the military against the Aquino government, was led by Honasan, whose forces attacked Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, seized portions of Camp Aguinaldo, including the headquarters of the Department of National Defense, Villamor Air Base, military camps in Pampanga and Cebu, the airport in Legaspi City, and took ABS-CBN, GMA, and the government-owned PTV 4, under siege, in which 40 GMA employees were held hostage by Col Oscar Canlas.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Aug 1987 coup attempt left 53 dead and more than 200 wounded. The Jan 1989 plot was led by renegade policeman Rizal Alih, who seized Camp Cawa-Cawa in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> City. The deadly 1-6 Dec 1989 coup, led again by Honasan, is considered the biggest coup attempt on Corazon Aquino&rsquo;s presidency, which involved nearly 3,000 military officers and men staging multiple attacks on Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, Villamor Air Base, Fort Bonifacio, Camp Crame, Mactan Air Base in Cebu, and Sangley Point in Cavite. The Dec 1989 coup once again targeted television networks ABS-CBN, GMA, and PTV. Ninety people died and 570 were wounded in the December coup attempt. The Dec 1989 coup was also staged in the business center of Makati. Radio directly played a key role during the event: it helped secure the safety of civilians and foreign tourists caught in the cross fire. On DZRH, reporter Rey Langit negotiated on the air with the rebels, who had stationed snipers on top of several high-rise buildings in Makati, for a ceasefire to allow tourism secretary Rafael Alunan to escort hostaged local and foreign tourists out of the battle zone. On 4 Mar 1990, suspended Cagayan governor Rodolfo Albano and his armed men of 200 seized a hotel in Tuguegarao on 4 Mar 1990, killing a general and 12 men on both sides of the gunfire that ensued. Finally, soldier mutineers, led by Brig Gen Danilo Lim, raided and seized an army base in Mindanao on 4-6 Oct 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Media and the Constitution</b>. The adoption of the 1987 Philippine Constitution was the most significant development during the Aquino administration. Some members of the constitutional commission were from the media: Florangel Rosario-Braid, journalists Napoleon Rama and Vic Foz, both of the Bulletin group, and film director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new constitution contained an unprecedented 13 communication-related provisions, foremost of which is the flagship provision, which is contained in the Declaration of Principles and State Policies: &ldquo;The State recognizes the vital role of communication and information in nation building.&rdquo; It strengthened the critical role of media and communication in creating self-reliant communities, redressing imbalances in the distribution of wealth, and promoting peace and national identity, which were concerns not directly mentioned about media in the 1973 Constitution. The new constitution also improved on the coverage of press freedom, which now included &ldquo;expression&rdquo; as an expansion of the more conventional freedom of speech and the press. The right to information found in the 1973 Charter was also expanded with the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;as well as government research data used as basis for policy development.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1987 Constitution also institutionalized the Filipinization of mass media, mainly in terms of media ownership. The new constitution retained the provision on 100 percent ownership of mass media by Filipinos, one of the legacies of Marcos. Article XVI, Section 11, Article 1 of the new constitution explicitly states that &ldquo;the ownership and management of mass media shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations, cooperatives or associations, wholly-owned and managed by such citizens.&rdquo; It allowed, however, foreign equity in advertising entities, defined by law as part of mass media, through its 70:30 provision. Telecommunications and the cable industries fall under the 60:40 equity ratio, in favor of Filipinos. Present ownership of telecommunication and the new information technology, however, consists of joint ventures between local owners and transnational corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several mass media-related bills and resolutions were filed in the reconvened Philippine Congress starting in 1987. These covered freedom of information, public access, public broadcasting system, support for community media, privatization of sequestered media, and the transnationalization of telecommunication. Media legislation was slow, mainly because legislators were cautious in introducing media-related bills, some of which were perceived by some sectors as a curtailment of freedom of expression. A few of the bills passed into law were Republic Act (RA) 7306 granting PTV a charter, RA 7925 or the Public Telecommunications Policy Act, RA 8370 or the Children&rsquo;s Television Act, and RA 8293 or the Intellectual Property Code. Among the more active media policy advocates in the upper house were Senators Agapito Aquino, Leticia Shahani, Nikki Coseteng, and Heherson Alvarez; in the House of Representatives, these advocates included Michael Mastura, Ramon Bagatsing, Leandro Verceles Jr, Romeo Candazo, and Andrea Domingo.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Regulation of the Broadcast Media. </b>Regulation of the broadcast media in the Philippines emanates from three sources: the State, the broadcast industry itself, and the internal mechanisms of the stations themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine laws that regulate broadcasting companies are Act 3846, approved in 1931 and amended by Commonwealth Acts 365 and 571, and RA 584, approved in 1950. Both require the approval of a broadcasting franchise by the Congress of the Philippines. Memorandum Circular 7-3-93 stipulates that once a franchise has been obtained, the company is required to secure a certificate of public convenience from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4914\"><strong>National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)</strong></a>, a government agency established in 1979 under the Department of Transportation and Communication. Executive Order 205, issued on 30 Jun 1987, governs the regulation of cable antenna television (CATV) and requires a network to obtain a certificate of authority to operate for not more than 15 years, which can be renewed for a similar period. By the 2000s, broadcasting firms have saturated the VHF and UHF (ultra-high frequency) bandwidths in Metro Manila. Programs aired on these bandwidths are the main sources of advertising revenues for the networks, so much so that networks tended to overload these programs with commercials, an issue that has generated a lot of debate among members of the broadcast industry, the government, and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two important state agencies that continue to regulate broadcast media content were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\"><strong>Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong></a> and the Presidential Appeals Board. The MTRCB, created through Presidential Decree 1986, screens television programs, commercials, and publicity materials. It classifies programs according to audiences: G for general patronage, PG for parental guidance, and SPG for strict parental guidance. The MTRCB bans shows that depict lewd, offensive or demeaning content; contain attacks against any race, creed, or religion; condone and encourage the use of illegal drugs; undermine faith and confidence in government; glorify criminals or condone crimes; are libelous or defamatory; or constitute contempt of court. The Presidential Appeals Board addresses issues raised by parties pertaining to decisions made by the MTRCB. It submits recommendations to the president of the Philippines, who makes the final decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The MTRCB made decisions that shaped the nature of broadcast regulation. In 1991, the MTRCB decided it has jurisdiction to review episodes of documentaries before they get aired on national television. The decision stemmed from complaints by officials of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) about &ldquo;Prosti-tuition,&rdquo; an episode of <b><i>The Inside Story</i></b>, 1991, ABS-CBN, hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4882\"><strong>Loren Legarda</strong></a>, that featured PWU female students allegedly engaging in prostitution to finance their studies. In 2005, the Supreme Court decided in favor of PWU, citing that a public affairs program such as that by Legarda is not exempt from review by the MTRCB. A number of episodes in 1992 of the weekly TV program <b><i>Iglesia ni Cristo</i></b> (INC, Church of Christ), produced by the INC, received an X rating from the MTRCB because of the program&rsquo;s criticisms of the veneration by Roman Catholics of the Virgin Mary. In 1994, the Supreme Court held MTRCB&rsquo;s X rating as a prior restraint on the freedom of religious speech. The MTRCB slapped several suspensions of varying durations on Willie Revillame, Randy Santiago, and John Estrada, hosts of the daily noontime show <b><i>Magandang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b> (Good Afternoon, Nation), 1998-2005, ABS-CBN, because of their sexist remarks and jokes. The show itself was suspended for one week in 2001 because of a similar offense, which led to the ouster of Revillame as host of the program. Eli Soriano&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Dating Daan</i></b> (The Old Road) went off the air in 2004 when MTRCB suspended it for three months following complaints by INC ministers, who were the target of invectives by Soriano on national television. The Supreme Court affirmed MTRCB&rsquo;s decision, explaining that personal attacks on persons cannot be considered part of freedom of religious speech. The MTRCB also suspended the television documentary <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1447\"><strong>i-Witness</strong></a></i></b> for two weeks in 2006 because of its airing of the episode &ldquo;Lukayo: Hindi Ito Bastos&rdquo; (Lukayo: This Is Not Obscene), which is about <i>lukayo</i>, a wedding ritual involving old women dancing with wooden phalluses in the town of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan in Laguna. In 1996, the MTRCB also ordered the withdrawal of three sexy liquor commercials that featured Amanda Page, Sunshine Cruz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4545\"><strong>Glydel Mercado</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Self-regulation by the broadcast industry has become more responsive during the post-martial law period. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)</strong></a>, which was established in 1973, continues to regulate the broadcast industry after the martial law period. This time, the KBP has functioned as a truly self-regulatory organization of broadcasters, unlike its role during the Marcos martial law period. It continues to coordinate with government regulators; lobby important laws, policies, and regulations with state legislators; police its own ranks; impose sanctions for violations committed by its members; and promulgate and regularly review its broadcast code of ethics. The KBP also works actively with the Advertising Board or AdBoard, the umbrella organization of advertisers that formulates and enforces standards in both print and broadcast media advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Individual networks and stations also internally regulate themselves, but only ABS-CBN and GMA and the online platform Rappler, have full-time ombudspersons in charge of monitoring and regulating their programs, especially against their journalists and staff engaged in so-called envelopmental journalism, receiving grease money from politicians and interest groups or providing these individuals and groups with unfair access to media exposure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"am\" name=\"am\"></a>AM Radio</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">AM radio after the 1986 EDSA Revolt continued to be providers mainly of news and information, while FM radio continued to be oriented toward music and entertainment. The gradual shift of some AM radio stations from entertainment to news was recognizable beginning with the assassination of Ninoy Aquino in 1983. However, much caution was exercised by broadcast journalists as the country was still under a climate of censorship and control despite Marcos&rsquo;s lifting of martial law in 1981. After 1986, the people&rsquo;s demand for news became seemingly insatiable, following the long years of being saturated with propaganda by the Marcos regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Such developments, plus the restoration of freedom and democracy, emboldened AM radio stations to reformat. Most stations either strengthened their news programming or completely shifted from entertainment to news and public affairs. For example, DZRH, acknowledged as the pioneer of radio dramas and musical variety shows since its founding in 1939 until the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986, began focusing on news and public affairs. GMA&rsquo;s DZBB, which started as news, public affairs, and entertainment during its early broadcasts beginning in 1955 and focused on music and personality-oriented programs during the martial law period, reoriented its programming to news after the ouster of Marcos, relaunching DZBB as &ldquo;Radyo Bisig Bayan&rdquo; (Radio with the People) in 1989, then recast it as &ldquo;Super Radyo&rdquo; (Super Radio). ABS-CBN&rsquo;s DZMM brought back its pre-martial law type of news programming, revived <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> (Patrol Radio), which would dominate the airwaves during the early years of the Corazon Aquino administration. These stations expanded the running time of their major newscast programs both in the morning and in the early evening slots. Unlike in the 1960s until the early 1970s when announcers read news straight from newspaper articles, wire copies from local and foreign news agencies, and syndicated reports coming from the government-owned Philippine News Agency, the post-EDSA newscasts were enhanced with more voice clips, spot reports, and live or phone-patched interviews. Even the stations&rsquo; weather reports, which also used to be read from newspapers, were now coming straight from the weather agency Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Stations would call and put on-air interviews with PAGASA personnel for the weather updates, with some of the meteorologists eventually becoming regular announcers for these programs, such as Amado Pineda in the 1970s and the 1980s and Nathaniel &ldquo;Mang Tani&rdquo; Cruz in the 1990s and the 2000s for GMA&rsquo;s news programs. This procedure also applied when getting traffic updates, information on water service interruption, and brownout schedules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reports from the field were aired not only during the news and public affairs programs, but also in other programs, including entertainment shows, all throughout a station&rsquo;s broadcast hours. Marked changes in the 1990s included improvements in electronic news-gathering technologies, such as portable transmitters and more convenient mobile communication gadgets and monitoring equipment. Present technologies that enhanced the news programming of AM radio stations include cable television and computers with Internet services, digital recording units, and editing software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stations that shifted to news and public affairs required the setting up of a separate news department. With most stations creating their respective news departments, increasing the number of news personnel, and purchasing more efficient and convenient technologies and transportation units, news production beginning in the late 1980s became more systematic, eventually developing full productions. The format, however, remained mainly news and talk. Documentaries would see their full potential on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A significant development during the post-EDSA period was the entry of civil society groups into the broadcast scene, first on radio, then on TV. The Citizens&rsquo; Alliance for Consumer Protection continued airing its weekly radio drama-talk program <b><i>Pintig ng Konsyumer</i></b> (Pulse of the Consumer) on DWXI. The peasant organization Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas produced regular audio materials for its campaigns about <i>palay</i> production subsidy for peasants, genuine agrarian reform, and the politics of grains trading on DZRH, 1988-2000. The Philippine Peasant Institute, a nongovernment organization (NGO) that focused its advocacy on agrarian reform and related peasant issues, produced the daily radio commentary program <b><i>Punlaan sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1179\"><strong>Himpapawid</strong></a></i></b> (Seedling Plots on Air), which premiered on DWBC, 1987, then went weekly as an early evening one-hour drama and talk program on DWAN, 1988-90, until its final run in the late 1990s. Tambuyog Development Center, one of the earlier NGOs that advocated for a community-based coastal resource management, produced the weekly early evening one-hour drama and talk program <b><i>Radyo Lundayan</i></b> (Lundayan Radio), DZEC, 1991-95. The Arts Research and Training Institute in Southern Tagalog, an artists&rsquo; group based in provinces south of Manila, produced the magazine program <b><i>Kalinangang Bayan</i></b> (National Culture), DZLB, 1989-91, which featured critical analyses of social issues that find expression on the region&rsquo;s local cultures. The Development Education Media Services, a progressive media training group, produced radio drama productions, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>inagway</i></b>, 1991-92, which tackled issues of workers, farmers, urban poor, indigenous peoples, internal refugees, and the human rights situation of the country. The underground Communist Party of the Philippines&ndash;National Democratic Front produced <b><i>Radyo Sierra Madre </i></b>(Sierra Madre Radio), an occasional talk radio commentary program in the early 1990s, surreptitiously tapping bandwidths from where it could clandestinely broadcast for an hour or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1990s until the early 2000s, radio continued to be one of the main avenues of programs for the advocacy of civil society groups. Pathways Productions, under the management of Garth Noel Tolentino and the creative direction of Tet Maceda, produced the daily drama serial-public forum program <b><i>Pitlag! Kuwento ng Buhay, Isyu ng Bayan</i></b> (Jolt! Narratives of Life, Issues of Community and Nation), which first aired on Radio Veritas, 2000-2001, as part of the movement to oust Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>, and relaunched in 2002 and aired until 2006 on the 25 stations all over the country of Radio Mindanao Network. The relaunched program maintained its original format, but the new series covered a wider range of topics, some of which included the social cost of war in Mindanao, the struggles of indigenous peoples, the death penalty, and child labor. Radio programs and public service announcements produced by civil society groups critical of the administrations of Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, and Arroyo would not have been permitted airtime during the Marcos martial law period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The change in programming of AM radio stations, from an entertainment to a more news-oriented approach, was born out of the stations&rsquo; interaction with the social environment. Influences on programming shifts can be classified as external and internal. Externally, the reprogramming to news was shaped by historical events, political regulation, new technologies, and the competitive environment under which the stations operated. Internally, management played a significant role in the improvement of the radio stations&rsquo; news productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"fm\" name=\"fm\"></a>FM Radio </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Programming</b>.<b> </b>Niche programming, also called format radio or modern radio programming, a specialized programming with a specific market segment as an intended target audience, became the prevailing pattern in FM radio broadcast. In niche programming, the station, through its program or station manager, and not its deejays, created the image of the station through a well-planned music playlist. Deejays had to strictly adhere to the principles and aesthetics of the station&rsquo;s projected identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DWRT 99.5, aka &ldquo;RT 99.5,&rdquo; was the trailblazer of the trend since it went on the air in 1976. More stations adopted niche programming during the post-EDSA years. DWDM 95.5, under Eagle Broadcasting Co., carried the adult contemporary/OPM format; OPM refers to original Pilipino music, which became a major trend in Philippine radio broadcasting in the 1970s. DWTM &ldquo;Magic 89.9&rdquo; under Quest Broadcasting Inc, owned by Jose Luis Vera, was one of the top-rating format radio stations in Metro Manila. It featured deejays like Nelson &ldquo;Sgt. Pepper&rdquo; Capulso and Adel &ldquo;Little David&rdquo; Gabot, both formerly with 96.3 WRock, Ken Fortun, Paul &ldquo;Paul Reno&rdquo; Alejandrino, Vince &ldquo;Rockin&rsquo; V&rdquo; Faner, and Roland &ldquo;Joe D&rsquo; Mango&rdquo; Sulit, who became a household name through his &ldquo;Love Notes&rdquo; segment where he read letters sent by avid listeners pertaining to love problems. DWKS 101.1 Kiss FM&rsquo;s <b><i>Top Ten at Ten</i></b> and <b><i>Top 20 at 12</i></b> music countdowns generated a huge following among its young listeners throughout its three-year existence, prior to reformatting to jazz, then to a more mass-based format after it was acquired by the Manila Broadcasting Company and has since become 101.1 Yes FM. Kiss FM&rsquo;s main newscasters include Marinela &ldquo;Pinky&rdquo; M. Aseron, Lindy Pellicer, and Bernadette Sta. Maria. Its on-air staff was composed of former 99.5 RT deejays Gerry &ldquo;Jeremiah Junior&rdquo; Magnaye, Eric &ldquo;Eric Caine&rdquo; Eloriaga, Vince &ldquo;Vince St. Price&rdquo; de Guzman, Sonny &ldquo;Sonny Z&rdquo; Zarate, Jigs &ldquo;Jiggy&rdquo; Ona, and Dickie &ldquo;Dick Reese&rdquo; Aracama. &ldquo;Manila&rsquo;s Intelligent Alternative&rdquo; City Lite 88.3, owned and operated by Raven Broadcasting Co and which began operations in 1987, was composed of former marketing executive Francis Lumen, businessman Alexander Limjuco, Guam-based real estate developer <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4842\"><strong>Gerry Geronimo</strong></a></strong>, lawyer Steve Salonga, engineer Francisco &ldquo;Kit&rdquo; Ravina, and programming expert Joselito &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; Pedero. Featuring a playlist consisting primarily of vocal and instrumental jazz, rhythm and blues, New Age music, and genre-specific musical programs, its announcers included Marinela &ldquo;Pinky&rdquo; Aseron, who also served as the station&rsquo;s manager, Mike &ldquo;Adam Kite&rdquo; Taylor, Ramon &ldquo;Joey Pizza&rdquo; Cruz, Pancho &ldquo;Pancho&rdquo; Alvarez, and Jay &ldquo;J Latin&rdquo; Zorilla, with newscasters Armie Jarin-Bennett, Karen Wu, Carissa Tiongson-Palanca, and Marie Anjanette Fernandez. It catered to a high-end market, including the expatriate community. After 16 years, it changed format in 2003 and had since become Jam 88.3. DWNU NU 107.5, &ldquo;The Home of New Rock,&rdquo; which began operations in 1987, was owned and operated by Progressive Broadcasting Company led by banker and businessman Atom Henares and telecommunications executive Orlando &ldquo;Doy&rdquo; Vea, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4922\"><strong>Mike Pedero</strong></a> as partner and programming head. It introduced modern rock and incorporated cutting-edge programming with events that became popular such as the annual NU107 Rock Awards, with local rock icon Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a>, Jun Lopito, Jingle Magazine, and the Rock Jocks of DZRJ as some of its awardees. NU&rsquo;s announcers included Tom &ldquo;Major Tom&rdquo; Lupton, Gerry Dris, GJ Torres, Gerry Why, Charlie &ldquo;Charlie Y&rdquo; Ysmael, Claire Miranda, Russ Davis, and musicians Francis &ldquo;Francis Brew&rdquo; Reyes of the rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a>, and Myrene Academia of the rock band Sandwich. Ramon &ldquo;RJ&rdquo; Jacinto&rsquo;s Rajah Broadcasting Company migrated its DZRJ 180 AM to FM via DZRJ 100.3 in 1987. Considered one of the industry&rsquo;s more enduring stations, DZRJ &ldquo;RJ FM&rdquo; took on the adult contemporary/classic hits format, combining four decades of pop music from the 1960s to the 1990s, gaining for RJ the label &ldquo;pied piper of retro/revival music.&rdquo; Other stations that adopted format radio were DWRock, KY 91.5, DYNY-FM Cebu, and Y101 Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio stations that followed an easy listening format, playing mellow standards, include DWAD 97.9, owned and operated by the Crusaders Broadcasting Co., GMA Network&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Giant&rdquo; DWLS 97.1 FM, and DWCD 103.5 of the Global Broadcasting Co. These stations began operations in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Top 40 format, also known as contemporary hit radio, which was a major trend in the 1970s, began to lose its appeal to radio audiences during the post-EDSA period, mainly due to the innovations in programming introduced by many stations that preferred niche programming. From 1986 to 1988, some FM radio stations reformatted to meet the challenges posed by niche programming. DWXB 102.7 changed its format from new wave to easy listening via &ldquo;Gentle Wind&rdquo; DWSM 102.7, under the management of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4775\"><strong>Bombo Radyo Philippines</strong></a>. DWKB 89.1, which had already been part of the sequestered Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation, became DZMZ or DMZ &ldquo;Dance Muzik Zone&rdquo; and featured dance and club music. DWKS 101.1 became Kiss <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a>, taking on the adult contemporary/jazz format. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4818\"><strong>DWRK</strong></a> 96.3 became lite rock station 96.3 WRock. English was still the main language used in most FM radio stations. Lately, however, there has been a rise in the number of bilingual FM stations, appealing to a broader market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Provincial radio programming is usually &ldquo;chop suey,&rdquo; a hodgepodge of musical programs, the reason being that niche stations rarely click in these areas. Provincial stations subsist mainly on blocktimers, specifically politicians who wish to maintain their &ldquo;visibility&rdquo; to their constituents. For marketing, some stations in the provinces affiliated with large Manila-based networks, which proved to be a viable option, such as the case with the Canoys&rsquo; Radio Mindanao Network affiliating with GMA. Metro Manila&ndash;based broadcast stations had their regional counterparts, with the most number coming from ABS-CBN and GMA. Southern Broadcasting Network (SBN) had FM stations DWSN 97.9 Laoag, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4821\"><strong>DZRB</strong></a> 95.9 Naga, DYCP 90.3 Bacolod, DYAP 88.3 Cebu, DYJP 101.5 Tacloban, DXJP 101.9 Zamboanga, DXCS 92.7 Cagayan de Oro, and DXSS 97.9 Davao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Branding</b>. Niche programming, in which music on the playlist featured by deejays depended on the station&rsquo;s image, gained a strong foothold among FM radio stations. Beginning in the 1990s, branding became an apparent trend. In 1991, Mareco Broadcasting Network Inc changed Power 105&rsquo;s new wave format into easy listening, using &ldquo;World-Class Music&rdquo; as its catchphrase, which later became 105.1 &ldquo;Crossover.&rdquo; In 1992, &ldquo;The Giant&rdquo; 97.1 DWLS of GMA Network tweaked its programming to target the youth via &ldquo;Campus Radio 97.1 LS FM.&rdquo; Also in 1991, Fred Elizalde of Manila Broadcasting Company acquired DWKS of Makati Broadcasting Company, transforming 101.1 Kiss Jazz into DWST &ldquo;Showbiz Tsismis,&rdquo; which centered on showbiz news and talk. In 1995, the Crusaders Broadcasting Company sold DWAD 97.9 to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Broadcasting Company owned by Antonio Cabangon-Chua Sr, who changed its call letters to DWQZ and went by the moniker &ldquo;97dot9 Home Radio.&rdquo; The Barreiros&rsquo; DWRX 93.1 was rebranded as &ldquo;Monster Radio&rdquo; RX 93 and went by the slogan &ldquo;Metro Manila&rsquo;s first creative radio station.&rdquo; Ramon Florete of Bombo Radyo Philippines acquired 102.7 &ldquo;Gentle Wind&rdquo; and renamed it &ldquo;Star FM 102.7.&rdquo; Radio Partners Inc, a medium-scale network of Metro Manila and provincial radio stations led by lawyer Jose Luis Vera, acquired DWCD 103.5 and repackaged it as 103.5 &ldquo;K-Lite.&rdquo; In 1996, Far East Broadcasting Company reinforced the positioning of its classical and Christian music format radio station DZFE 98.7 via the slogan &ldquo;Christ for the world by radio.&rdquo; In 1998, ABS-CBN switched the programming of DWRR 101.9 from adult contemporary easy listening to a mass-based format and went by the slogan &ldquo;101.9 for life!&rdquo; UR 105, a sister station of DZRJ 100 FM, labeled itself &ldquo;Underground Radio.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>More Talk Programs</b>. By the mid-1990s, talk-oriented programs slowly crept into the FM programming scene. Early talk-oriented format programs include RX 93.1&rsquo;s <b><i>Morning Rush</i></b>, hosted every early morning by the deejay tandem of Chico and Delamar; 103.5 K-Lite&rsquo;s <b><i>Talk Back</i></b>, an early evening program that encouraged listeners to phone in their views and opinions on a given topic; and NU 107&rsquo;s <b><i>Twisted</i></b>, hosted by Jessica Zafra every Sunday, which was a radio version of her column of the same title. Toward 1996, K-Lite came out with another talk-oriented program called <b><i>Nite Lite</i></b>, which replaced <b><i>Talk Back</i></b> but carried its same format, hosted by Mano &ldquo;Monica&rdquo; Figueras, Adel &ldquo;Little David&rdquo; Gabot, and Jess &ldquo;The Blade&rdquo; Reyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More transitions took place, specifically in Metro Manila&rsquo;s FM radio stations, at the turn of the new century. In 2001, TRPI added DZMZ 89.1 to its stable of FM radio stations, repackaged it as Wave 89.1 under the network name Blockbuster Broadcasting Company, and took on an easy listening R &amp; B format. In 2003, after 16 years of broadcasting as an adult contemporary radio station, DWCT &ldquo;City Lite 88.3&rdquo; shifted to light pop and alternative music and repackaged as Jam 88.3. Magic 89.9 added more talk-oriented programs during its primetime programming, including <b><i>Good Times with Mo Twister</i></b>, which dominated the airwaves during the 6:00-9:00 am drive time, and <b><i>Boys&rsquo; Night Out</i></b>, with Sam YG, Slick Rick, and Tony Toni, which took the evening drive-time shift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Masa </i>Programming</b>.<b> </b>The shift by most FM radio stations to talk-oriented programs ushered in a new trend, caused primarily by the need to get more listeners, particularly the so-called <i>masa</i> (mass) group composed of the C, D, and E economic classes, which comprise the bulk of the radio-listening public. FM radio during its early years in the 1960s until the 2000s mainly catered to the A and B markets. Those from the lower economic groups started to gain more access to new technological gadgets during the post-EDSA period, while the A and B markets began shifting to more high-end electronic equipment. These developments altered the listening habits of audiences. Some from the A-B crowd abandoned radio listening in favor of music downloadable onto their new mobile devices without the need for an FM radio station. The C-D-E market, on the other hand, began tuning in to FM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New talk-oriented programs adopted mass-based programming to reach the masa. In the 1990s and on to the 2010s, among the radio stations that took on the masa bandwagon were DWYS 101.1 &ldquo;Yes FM&rdquo;; DWRR 101.9 &ldquo;For Life&rdquo;; DWLS 97.1 &ldquo;Barangay LS&rdquo;; DWKY 91.5 Energy FM; DWOW 103.5, which used to be Max FM; DWET 106.7, formerly jazz and easy listening station Dream FM; and DWNU 107.5, from modern rock to masa programming and renamed Win Radio 107.5. In 2011, Progressive Broadcasting Company acquired the frequency franchise of 91.5 and repackaged it as Big Radio. Energy FM moved to 106.7, which used to be adult contemporary radio station Dream 106 FM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A milestone in the history of Philippine FM radio was the entry of Media Quest Holdings Inc, led by telecommunications mogul Manuel &ldquo;MVP&rdquo; Pangilinan, into FM radio on 28 Nov 2010. Pangilinan&rsquo;s group took over the frequency 92.3 after Francis Lumen&rsquo;s All-Youth Channel&rsquo;s lease expired, and converted the station into 92.3 News Radio, aka Radyo Singko, a news and talk-oriented radio component of TV5 of the Associated Broadcasting Company. It positioned itself as &ldquo;Ang Bagong Tunog ng FM&rdquo; (The New Sound of FM). Its entry into the medium may be considered a milestone in the history of Philippine FM radio in the sense that a network has ventured into migrating what is traditionally an AM format into a predominantly music-oriented medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the emergence of more stations scrambling to attract a huge mass-based audience, music programming took a back seat as a radio station&rsquo;s main marketing tool. Listeners have come to know a station not by the music it plays nor by its frequency and call letters, but by its catchy slogan. Examples are 90.7 DZMB Love Radio&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Kailangan pa bang i-memorize &rsquo;yan?</i>&rdquo; (Do you need to memorize that?), 106.7 Energy FM&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Hi, Pangga!</i>&rdquo; (Hi, Love!), and Magic 89.9&rsquo;s &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s best music!&rdquo; Talk entertainment, characterized by high-energy banter, jokes, and canned laughter, became the order of the day. Music in these programs comprised less than 40 percent of its hourly programming. As of 2011, almost half of the total 25 FM radio stations in Metro Manila have already adopted the mass-based programming format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"programming\" name=\"programming\"></a>Programming Developments </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Development Communication and Educational Media</b>.<b> </b>Whereas Marcos used the framework of development communication to usher in the so-called development projects of international lending institutions and its concept of renaissance programming during the martial law period to mask and justify propaganda, development communication as a programming concept took on a different turn in the aftermath of the EDSA Revolt. It shifted to distance education using broadcast. The advent of new information and communication technologies provided greater opportunities to use these technologies as alternative learning delivery schemes. Digital classrooms started to become sites of the active interaction of teachers and students mediated by multimedia technology. Communication specialists active in development communication and educational broadcasting include Alexander Flor, Rebecca Pesta&ntilde;o-Smith, Louie Tabing, Teresa H. Stuart, Mary Ebitha Y. Dy, Felix Librero, Carlos Arnaldo, Cesar Mercado, Nora C. Quebral, Juan Jamias, Juan Mercado, Frankie Llaguno, Delia Barcelona, Benjamin Lozare, Paulina Bautista, Zenaida Domingo, and Grace J.

The early years following the EDSA Revolt saw broadcast television programming by the networks mainly relying on blocktimers. Friends of network owners filled in the airtime. Broadcast Marketing, owned by Jun Sison, put up new drama shows for the new ABS-CBN, such as <b><i>Ina</i></b> (Mother), 1986, directed by Lino Brocka, and <b><i>Parak</i></b> (Police), 1986, directed by Lamberto Avellana and starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4259\"><strong>Anthony Alonzo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\"><strong>Robin Padilla</strong></a>, then a young, emerging actor. ABS-CBN initially had popular canned shows from abroad, such as <b><i>The Golden Girls</i></b> and <b><i>The Cosby Show</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Movie outfits <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a>, owned by Lily Monteverde, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\"><strong>Viva Films</strong></a>, owned by Vic del Rosario, co-produced weekly primetime shows.

For GMA, Regal produced the weekly drama anthology <b><i>Mother Studio Presents</i></b>, 1986-96, and the weekly horror serial <b><i>Regal Shockers</i></b>, 1985-91. In 1988, Viva pulled out of IBC 13 and transferred to GMA to produce <b><i>Viva Box Office Hits</i></b>, 1988-90, renamed <b><i>Viva Sinerama</i></b>, 1990-91, then <b><i>MVP: Monday Viva Presentations</i></b>, 1994, a weekly program for the rerun of the studio&rsquo;s latest movies on national television. Viva Television continued to produce more programs for GMA in the 1990s, such as the weekly drama anthologies <b><i>Spotlight</i></b>, 1993-98, and <b><i>Mikee</i></b>, 1999; the daily soap operas <b><i>Villa Quintana</i></b>, 1995-96, <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b>, 1996-2002, <b><i>Ganyan Kita Kamahal </i></b>(That&rsquo;s How I Love You), 1998, <b><i>Ikaw na Sana </i></b>(I Hope It&rsquo;s You at Last), 1997-98, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\"><strong>Halik</strong></a> sa Apoy </i></b>(Kiss the Fire), 1998-99; the comedy shows <b><i>Ober da Bakod</i></b> (Over the Fence), 1992-96, <b><i>Haybol Rambol</i></b> (Rumble in the House), 1993-95, and <b><i>Si Manoy at si Mokong</i></b> (Manoy and Mokong), 1997-98; and the youth-oriented shows <b><i>T.G.I.S.</i></b>, 1995-99, and <b><i>Growing Up</i></b>, 1997-98.

Television and Production Exponents (TAPE) by Tony Tuviera began airing the noontime variety show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) on RPN 9, 1979-89, then transferred to ABS-CBN, 1989-94, before settling to GMA beginning in 1994. TAPE produced top-rating afternoon soaps. For RPN 9, it produced <b><i>Heredero</i></b> (Heir), 1984-87, and <b><i>Agila</i></b> (Eagle), 1987-89, which later moved to ABS-CBN until its run in 1992. For ABS-CBN, it produced <b><i>Valiente</i></b>, 1992-95, before it moved the drama soap to GMA until its end in 1997.

When networks began filling in the evening primetime slots with their entertainment programs, which were mainly drama series, the public affairs programs of blocktimers were moved to the late-night shift. The VHF channels also migrated their foreign canned programs to their respective UHF channels. Local programming on the VHF channels, particularly the network giants ABS-CBN and GMA, thus began to dominate over foreign programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Networks started filling in the late morning and afternoon prime time with more entertainment programs to reach a wider audience, mainly the so-called masa. ABS-CBN attempted to rival the dominance of <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, which has been with GMA since 1994, with noontime shows like &lsquo;<b><i>Sang Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b> (APO Now Runs for a Week), 1995-98, and <b><i>Masayang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b> (Happy Afternoon, Nation), 1998-2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News and public affairs programs, including entertainment news, on VHF adopted a combination of information and entertainment in their format, but were, and continues to be, tabloid in character, filled with stories of crime, violence, and mundane celebrity trivia that bordered on sensationalism, all in the rush for scoops. The line separating news from entertainment has become indistinct. Many cases were exploited to the fullest, an example of which includes the Bishop Bacani sexual harassment case. Trivia about the Taiwanese F4 band of <b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b> fame got equal treatment in national news programs. Celebrity Ruffa Gutierrez&rsquo;s wedding, and later divorce, and all the controversies of Kris Aquino that involved her relationships were headline news as much as the war on terrorism. Considered an all-time low in Philippine broadcast journalism is the coverage of the death of matinee idol Rico Yan. The news was exploited in primetime news programs and talk shows. The networks covered the actor&rsquo;s death from every possible angle, without due regard to the proper sensibilities required of the situation. The practice, undoubtedly, had its precedent in the 1980s with the exploitation of the death of Julie Vega, the young star of the daily serial <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, 1980-85, GMA, when Vega&rsquo;s funeral was seamlessly incorporated into the story of her own soap opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reality TV programs would proliferate beginning in the 1990s in varying formats, as in the cinema verit&eacute; recording of contestants&rsquo; daily routines, and were viewed on national television at different times of the day, or those in the form of game shows and talent search programs. Real-life narratives of participants and contestants permeated these new programs, some of which were apparently scripted. Some of these narratives focused on the lachrymose, very much like the melodrama of the daily soaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indecency and insensitivity seemed to have become the practice by popular hosts and even by broadcast journalists. Similar incidents include the coverage of natural disasters, crisis situations, crime, and children, such as the case of a male ABS-CBN reporter who shoved the microphone into a small opening to interview a young girl, who was trapped under a debris of boulders of a four-story school building in Cabanatuan City which collapsed during the 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck northern Luzon in Jul 1990&mdash;and who would later die of her injuries&mdash;and insensitively asked how she was feeling; the Rizal Park crisis where several Chinese tourists were taken hostage by a policeman on 23 Aug 2010; and the Janjan macho dance controversy on TV5&rsquo;s program <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b> on 12 Mar 2011. Real life and TV soap, and a dose of incompetent and unethical reporting, were fused into a spectacle in the name of commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the stiff competition to capture a wider audience reach and increase ratings and profits, the networks employed younger news anchors and reporters, which was a welcome development, except that they seemed to be more concerned with appearances than professional practice. They were made up and made over like any other television performer. In general, younger newscasters and reporters became more valued than ever, with the older newscasters relegated to the UHF or cable channels, including Frankie Evangelista and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4908\"><strong>Tina Monzon-Palma</strong></a>. The younger ones, like Korina Sanchez, Karen Davila, Vicky <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es, and their male counterparts like Julius Babao, Henry Omaga Diaz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\"><strong>Tony Velasquez</strong></a>, are all cast and glamorized for the news programs&rsquo; VHF channels. Senior newscasters like Mike Enriquez, Noli de Castro, and Mel Tiangco are more the exception than the rule, although their personas are manufactured for the medium. Enriquez and de Castro are packaged and imaged as the no-nonsense critics of all forms of abuses and defenders of the downtrodden, while Tiangco is the motherly friend, the <i>kapuso</i> (close to the heart) of every Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mix of entertainment and news seemed to have gained traction in the packaging of broadcast journalists. News anchors cross over to entertainment programs, such as Mel Tiangco of GMA who anchors <b><i>Frontpage</i></b> and hosts <b><i>Magpakailanman </i></b>(Forever), 2002-8, then revived in 2012, a melodramatic anthology based on the lives of celebrities and, later, of ordinary people. Vicky Morales, who anchors GMA&rsquo;s news program <b><i>Saksi</i></b>, does the same with her weekly wish-granting program <b><i>Wish Ko Lang! </i></b>(Just My Wish!), premiered 2002. Korina Sanchez of ABS-CBN anchors the news program <b><i>TV Patrol </i></b>and co-hosted the entertainment talk show <b><i>Morning Girls</i></b>, 2002-4, with Kris Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More local soaps, derived from real-life stories, would deluge TV primetime programming. New soaps from abroad would also enter into the picture, particularly drama serials, first from Mexico and Latin American countries, which were called telenovelas, which are limited-run drama serials, then from Taiwan, which Filipinos called <b>chinovelas</b> (Chinese telenovelas), and from Korea, which were termed <b>koreanovelas</b>. All these new drama serials, together with Japanese anime programs, which also started to flood local primetime programming in the 2000s, were dubbed in Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Telenovelas, Chinovelas, and Koreanovelas</b>.<b> </b>The phenomenal program that significantly altered local television programming was <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, 1996, which came not from the giant commercial networks ABS-CBN and GMA but from RPN, which at that time was under contestation between Marcos crony Benedicto and the government&rsquo;s Presidential Commission on Good Governance. <b><i>Marimar</i></b> was a Mexican telenovela produced by Televisa, a Mexican broadcast production group. It was brought to the Philippines by Procter &amp; Gamble, which sold Televisa soaps into the country in exchange for free spots within the programs. The Latin American soap was dubbed in Filipino. RPN had earlier aired a Latin American telenovela, <b><i>La Traidora </i></b>(The Lady Traitor), 1994, but it was <b><i>Marimar</i></b> that ultimately changed the landscape of the late afternoon and evening primetime programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Marimar</i></b> had a fast-paced narrative. Thalia, the star of the series, became a household name, and the program became a monster hit, which seriously threatened to dislodge the newscast <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> of ABS-CBN from its number one ranking in the ratings game. <b><i>Marimar</i></b> was broadcast from Monday to Friday on prime time, at a time slot opposite the second half of <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> and GMA&rsquo;s early evening newscast. This horizontal programming showed the other networks that there was economic sense in scheduling a program five days a week on the same hour. Once the program clicked with the audience, like <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, the station would have control of that hour five days a week. ABS-CBN and GMA seriously considered vertical programming and learned many lessons from the hit telenovela, one of which was that a daily soap can beat stable news programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The success of <b><i>Marimar</i></b> provided the impetus for broadcast networks to produce daily drama serials in the early evening primetime programming, the first of which were the back-to-back tandem of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s 30-minute drama series <b><i>Mula sa Puso</i></b> (From the Heart), and <b><i>Esperanza</i></b>, both from 1997 to 1999. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1466\"><strong>Mara Clara</strong></a></i></b>, ABS-CBN&rsquo;s popular daily series in the afternoon slot, was also moved to the early evening programming. By the late 1990s, the daily drama serials, either locally produced or imported, had started to flood the airwaves, with Latin American telenovelas dominating the evening programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the phenomenal popularity of <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, RPN offered more Mexican telenovelas, some of which include <b><i>Maria la del Barrio</i></b> (Maria of the Slums), 1996; <b><i>Luz Clarita</i></b>, 1996; <b><i>Acapulco: Cuerpo y Alma</i></b> (Acapulco: Body and Soul), 1996; <b><i>Esmeralda</i></b>, 1996; and <b><i>Sin Ti </i></b>(Without You), 1997. ABS-CBN also got hold of Mexican telenovelas, like <b><i>Maria Mercedes</i></b>, 1996, <b><i>Rosalinda</i></b>, 2000, both Thalia starrer, and <b><i>Rubi</i></b>, 2005, while GMA acquired <b><i>Agujetas de Color de Rosa</i></b> (Pink Shoe Laces), 1996, and ABC 5 got <b><i>Morena Clara</i></b>, 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Telenovelas also came from other countries, and were dubbed in Filipino. From Colombia, RPN 9 had <b><i>La Viuda de Blanco </i></b>(The Widow of Blanco), 1997; ABS-CBN had <b><i>Pasion de Amor</i></b> (Passion of Love), 2005-6; and GMA had <b><i>Betty La Fea</i></b> (Ugly Betty), 2007, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a></i></b>, 2013. From Venezuela, ABS-CBN aired <b><i>Ilusiones </i></b>(Illusions) and <b><i>Maria Mercedes</i></b>, both from 1996 to 1997, <b><i>Kassandra</i></b>, 1997-98, <b><i>Solita Mi Amor</i></b> (Solita, My Love), 2003, and <b><i>Gata Salvaje</i></b> (Wild Cat), 2003-5; and GMA aired <b><i>Mis Tres Hermanas</i></b> (<b><i>All My Love</i></b>), 2002. ABS-CBN showed <b><i>Ana Manuela</i></b>, 2014, from Brazil and <b><i>El Cuerpo de Deseo</i></b> (Body of Desire), 2008, from Florida in the United States. From Argentina, GMA showed <b><i>Mu&ntilde;eca Brava</i></b> (aka Monica Brava), 2001, and from Peru, <b><i>Girasoles para <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a></i></b> (Sunflowers for Lucia), 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning in the 2000s, when telenovelas dubbed from Spanish to Filipino were waning in popularity, new drama series from Asia began airing on Philippine VHF channels. Chinovelas from Taiwan became popular. IBC 13 started the trend with its airing of <b><i>Amazing Twins</i></b>, 2002, but it was <b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b>, 2003, ABS-CBN, which starred the Taiwanese boy band F4 over which young Filipino audiences went crazy, that became a huge hit almost on the same level as that attained by <b><i>Marimar</i></b>. Other chinovelas aired on ABS-CBN that also became successful were its sequels <b><i>Meteor Rain</i></b> and <b><i>Meteor Garden II</i></b>, both in 2003, and <b><i>101st Proposal</i></b> aka <b><i>My Perfect Girl</i></b>, 2008. TV5 showed <b><i>Easy Fortune, Happy Life</i></b>, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Simultaneous with chinovelas was the entry of telenovelas from South Korea into Philippine primetime TV, most of which were aired on GMA. The most popular was <b><i>Full House</i></b>, 2005, and <b><i>Dae Jang Geum</i></b> aka <b><i>Jewel in the Palace</i></b>, 2006. Other koreanovela hits aired on GMA were <b><i>Bright Girl</i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Autumn in My Heart</i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Winter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\"><strong>Sonata</strong></a></i></b>, 2004; <b><i>Stairway to Heaven</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>Frog Prince</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>My Name Is Kim Sam-soon</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Coffee Prince</i></b>, 2008; <b><i>Love Story in Harvard</i></b>, 2008; <b><i>Queen Seon Deok</i></b>, 2010; <b><i>Shining Inheritance</i></b> aka <b><i>Brilliant Legacy</i></b>, 2010; <b><i>Dong Yi</i></b>, 2011-12; and <b><i>My Love from the Star</i></b>, 2014. ABS-CBN aired <b><i>Lovers in Paris</i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Green Rose</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>Memories of Bali</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>Only You</i></b>, 2005-6; <b><i>A Love to Kill</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Jumong</i></b>, 2007; <b><i>Marrying a Millionnaire</i></b>, 2007; and <b><i>Boys over Flowers</i></b>, 2009-10. By the late 2000s and on to the 2010s, other networks joined the bandwagon, like TV5, which aired <b><i>Golden Bride</i></b>, <b><i>Oh Su Jung vs. Karl</i></b>, <b><i>Hero</i></b>, and <b><i>My Wife Is a Superwoman</i></b>, and Net25 showed <b><i>The Snow Queen</i></b>, 2013, <b><i>Level 7 Civil Servant</i></b>, 2014, and <b><i>Hidden Identity</i></b>, 2015. QTV and Studio 23 had reruns of koreanovelas that were initially broadcast on their sister stations GMA and ABS-CBN, respectively. The government channel PTV 4 began airing koreanovelas in 2014, starting with <b><i>Oh, Ja Ryong Is Coming</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the mid-2000s, these imported telenovelas and locally produced drama serials dominated afternoon and evening primetime programming. Entertainment talk and variety programs took the late morning and early afternoon time slots. Documentaries and public affairs programs were relegated to the late evening block, some of which were canceled, moved to weekend programming, or transferred to free UHF channels. Major networks ABS-CBN and GMA virtually broadcast all day with local programming and have practically deserted foreign shows in their VHF channels, while TV5, Net 25, Solar, PTV 4, and the rest continue to mix foreign programs because it is generally cheaper to import.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"regional\" name=\"regional\"></a>Regional Expansion and the Telecommunications Industry</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three important developments contributed to the growth of Philippine broadcasting beginning in the 1990s. These were the move toward decentralization, resulting in the growth of provincial media; the rapid revolution in communication technology; and the liberalization and deregulation of the telecommunications sector. These developments coincided with the return and expansion of the democratic space after the EDSA Revolt and the promotion and protection of the free enterprise system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before the turn of the 21st century, the 1998 KBP Broadcast Media Factbook estimated the number of television stations nationwide at 137. Of this number, 63 were originating stations, 50 were relay, and 24 were on UHF. In terms of distribution of TV stations by island groups, 12 TV stations were in Metro Manila, 53 in Luzon, 28 in the Visayas, and 44 in Mindanao. The number increased by the early 2000s. There were 952 radio stations scattered throughout the archipelago, 369 of which were AM and 583 FM. The number of television stations in the country was estimated at 225, all of which had access to 1,373 community antenna television networks. Beginning in 2005, Cebu had more FM radio stations than AM. The FMs numbered 23, while the AMs were only 16. Of the 10 television stations operating in Cebu, the most prominent are ABS-CBN, GMA, RPN 9, ABC 21, PTV 11, Channel 23, Channel 27, and SBN 6. A newcomer then was the Cebu Catholic Television Network (CCTN 47), which had started reaching out to audiences in Eastern Visayas and Northern Mindanao. There was only one cable TV, the Sky Cable, which was servicing the Cebu public during this period. As in Manila, the battle for the mass television audience was between the two most aggressive protagonists, network giants ABS-CBN and GMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The phenomenal growth was in cable television beginning in the 1990s. President Aquino abolished a Marcos decree that granted exclusive franchise to ally Roberto Benedicto to install and operate cable TV nationwide. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4887\"><strong>Geny Lopez</strong></a> of ABS-CBN Corporation put up SKYVision on 25 Mar 1991, under the trade name SKY Cable. Beginning operations in Feb 1992, SKY Cable has since become the country&rsquo;s leading cable TV operator. Included in its initial programming lineup were programs from CNN, HBO, Starworld, Discovery Channel, and ESPN, and local cable TV programs Cinema One, ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC), and the Lifestyle Channel. SKY Cable merged with competitor Home Cable in 2000 to increase its dominance of its market in Metro Manila and the regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To get a dose of foreign programs, one has to switch to cable where one can get a smorgasbord of international programs: news at CNN, BBC, NHK, ANC, and other networks; shows for the young in Nickelodeon; cartoons on the Cartoon Network; nature documentaries on the National Geographic channel; foreign movies on HBO, Showtime, AXN, and Star Movies; local movies on Cinema One and Pinoy Box Office; sports on ESPN, Star Sports, and Solar Sports; music on MTV and Myx; and many more in various languages from various continents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the turn of the 21st century, there were about 753 cable TV operators nationwide owned by more than 500 companies, reaching about 430,000 households all over the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">UHF channels in Metro Manila became popular in the 1990s, which mainly served as an alternative to cable television. UHF broadcasting offered free programming for households in the target markets. Similarly, pay services were also introduced in 1992, when DWBC-TV Channel 68 began initial transmissions as a paid UHF station, and commenced regular service in Jan 1993. It offered foreign programs not shown on local TV, but eventually folded up due to intense competition from Sky Cable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first commercial station to broadcast on the UHF channel in Metro Manila was the Southern Broadcasting Network (SBN) DWCP-TV on Channel 21, which aired in May 1992 featuring programs from World TV. Owned by Chinese-Filipino business tycoon Lucio Co, the founder of the supermarket chain Puregold, SBN is both a radio and television network. It was then known as Word TV 21 before it changed its name to SBN Channel 21 in 1995. SBN was originally a radio station based in Davao City, which started broadcasting in 1970. SBN Channel 21&rsquo;s programming was patterned after FEN Channel 17 of the former Clark US air base before it was abandoned in 1992 because of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in that year and the non-extension of the bases agreement. SBN entered into an agreement with Solar Entertainment, which leased airtime on SBN beginning in Jan 2008. Solar aired programs from its entertainment channel ETC or Entertainment TV Channel. SBN renewed its partnership with Solar in 2011 to create the news network Talk TV, which became known as Solar News Network (SNN), a 24-hour English news channel on free-to-air TV, beginning on 30 Oct 2012. SNN moved to RPN 9 in 2013, renamed it 9TV, then CNN Philippines in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 31 Oct 1992, the Radio Mindanao Network became the second radio-based network to launch a TV station called DWKC-TV on Channel 31 and the first UHF station to carry the format of a cable movie channel. It was renamed CTV 31, also in 1992. In 1997, it started broadcasting shows from E! Channel, a US cable TV channel. It stopped broadcasting in Aug 2000, but returned on 3 Jul 2011 as Beam Channel 31, but has since then undergone various programming changes, from the Game Channel to a new programming called CHASE, to Jack City, then Vision TV Shopping followed by Tagalog-dubbed telenovelas from the Telenovela Channel beginning in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1993, the third channel to go on UHF was the Rajah Broadcasting RJTV 29 of Ramon &ldquo;RJ&rdquo; Jacinto. An all-female and lifestyle TV station and the first local UHF channel to feature a home TV shopping program, it went into niche programming, showing infomercials, foreign shows, and cartoons, which all catered to kids during the day and baby boomers at night. It ended its operations in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the initial success of these stations, other channels went to UHF. DWDB-TV Channel 27 of GMA Network was launched on 27 Aug 1995. Popularly known as CityNet Television from 1995 to 1999, Entertainment Music Channel (EMC) from 1999 to 2001, and resumed as CityTV in 2005, it was GMA&rsquo;s main outlet for imported programs, freeing up slots in GMA 7&rsquo;s programming for more domestic productions. DWAC-TV Channel 23, a UHF station of ABS-CBN Corporation, was launched on 12 Oct 1996. It originally carried music TV of MTV Asia from Hong Kong&rsquo;s Star TV. <b><i>News 23</i></b>, produced by ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs over Channel 23, premiered on 14 Oct 1996. On the same year, it was renamed Studio 23, and carried the slogan &ldquo;The Premium Network.&rdquo; Studio 23&rsquo;s programming catered to the upscale youth sector. Strong programs included the basketball games of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and supplemental programming for programs originally shown on ABS-CBN 2, such as the reality programs <b><i>Pinoy Dream Academy</i></b> and <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b>. Originally an all-English station, it switched to Taglish, a combination of English and Tagalog, in 2004. In 2011, it severed ties with MTV Asia. Studio 23 stopped operations in 2014. It has since then been replaced by ABS-CBN Sports+Action. ABS-CBN also launched its music channel Myx on UHF in 2000. Early VJs and hosts of Myx TV were Sally Acupan, Rico Blanco, Heart Evangelista, Franco Mabanta, Luis Manzano, Karel Marquez, Bernard Palanca, Ala Paredes, Michi Valeriano, Lourd de Veyra, and Iya Villania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other UHF channels followed suit. In 1998, Delta Broadcasting System launched DBS TV Channel 35. In 1999, the Eagle Broadcasting Company launched Net 25, the Progressive Broadcasting Company (PBC) launched NTV 37 as a television counterpart for its NU 107 radio station by airing rock-related music videos, the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC) ran its UHF station DWDZ Channel 47, and Channel 7 started carrying Channel V Philippines. In 2000, MTV Philippines launched Channel 41. In 2001, Channel 45 ran 3ABN or 3 Angels Broadcasting Network. In 2005, the Philippine Independent Church started operating Channel 49 GEM TV. In 2006, Sonshine Media Network International launched SMNI TV 39. In 2008, ZOE Broadcasting Network ran its UHD station ZOE TV-33. In 2011, the Nation Broadcasting Corporation of MediaQuest Holdings launched Aksyon TV Channel 41.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of these UHF stations either closed shop after a few years of broadcasting or reformatted or rebranded their identities. Those who folded up or became inactive include ABC&rsquo;s DWDZ in 2003, RMN CTV 31 in 2003, Channel 47 and DBS Channel 35, both in 2004, and MTV Philippines in 2007. Those that changed programming formats were PBC, which replaced NUTV with UNTV in 2001; GMA CityNet changed to QTV or Quality Television in 2005, later replaced with GMA News TV Channel 27 in 2011; ZOE was renamed Light TV 33 in 2011; Solar Entertainment replaced Talk TV Channel 21 with Solar News Channel in 2012; and GEM TV Channel 49 was replaced by INC TV in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 2001 to the present, UHF channels were also established in the regions. These provincial UHF broadcasts specialize in news, public service, and other types of shows as part of their free programming. A good example of UHF broadcasting from the regions is Beam Channel 26 DWHB-TV Baguio, owned by Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media. Formerly affiliated with Solar Entertainment, Beam started its broadcast on 15 Aug 2011, carrying The Game Channel. Its main blocktimers are Essential Broadcasting Network, owned by the Greg Durante Ministries, and the CJ Group of Korea. It reaches the provinces of La Union, Pangasinan, Isabela, Cagayan Valley, the rest of the Ilocos, and the northern parts of Central Luzon. Another significant UHF station is the Cebu Catholic Television Network (CCTN) Channel 47. Founded by Nonito Limchua in 2002, it reaches out to audiences throughout the Visayas and Northern Mindanao. It mainly features religious programs, but it is keeping up with trends in mass-based programming by offering locally produced television drama series, absorbing media artists of the radio dramas that have been discontinued by some stations. In Mindanao, Hope Channel Philippines, first seen on UHF Channel 25 in Davao, was launched on 26 Sep 2011 by the religious network of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and Gateway UHF Broadcasting. It shares a network with 3ABN International and is aired on Channel 45 in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the emerging UHF channels experimented on niche programming, which targeted specific markets for the different types of programming they employed. These UHF channels, especially those owned by or affiliated with local VHF channels, favored programming that featured canned programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"news\" name=\"news\"></a>News and Public Affairs Programs</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News became the most valued program after the 1986 EDSA Revolt as it was deemed that with the Marcos propaganda machine out, people could expect the &ldquo;true news,&rdquo; even if it was not pleasant, as opposed to the conjugal dictatorship&rsquo;s ironic and obsessive promotion of &ldquo;the true, the good, and the beautiful.&rdquo; ABS-CBN jumpstarted newscast in the Filipino language with the revival of the pre-martial law <b><i>Balita Ngayon</i></b> (News Today), 1986-87. It ran for only a year, but since then newscasts in Filipino underwent a series of reformatting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABS-CBN was vigorous in its recruitment of anchors and staffers into its news and public affairs department, including those that were identified with the Marcoses, among whom were Frankie Evangelista of IBC 13; Noli de Castro from Benedicto&rsquo;s DWWW; and Mel Tiangco, Ces Drilon, Doris Bigornia, and Korina Sanchez from MBS 4 (Rodrigo 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>GMA Headline News</i></b>, 1986-92, aired almost coterminous with the Corazon Aquino administration, while <b><i>GMA Balita</i></b> (GMA News), 1986-97, covered the Aquino and Ramos administrations. GMA&rsquo;s news anchors, like Tina Monzon-Palma and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4800\"><strong>Randy David</strong></a>, and journalists, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4962\"><strong>Jessica Soho</strong></a> and Alex Tinsay, delivered a more sober reportage than ABS-CBN&rsquo;s news that tended toward the loud barker-type newscasting for its entertainment-filled, sometimes shocking, reportage. News programs lived up to its social responsibility of informing the public. However, with the preponderance of popular genre programs since 1986, primetime news served to hook the viewing public to profitable shows afterward, creatively forming the symbiosis of news-as-service and comedy/drama/action-for-profit programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most significant development in Philippine media programming was the institutionalization of Filipino as the language of news and public affairs. The establishment used to propagate the idea that English is the medium of delivery for newscast to be believable. With the euphoria over people empowerment, democratization of media space occasioned communication with the widest audience possible, and Tagalog-based Filipino became the standard. From <b><i>Balita Ngayon </i></b>(News Today), ABS-CBN produced <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, 1987-present, led by broadcast journalists Noli de Castro, Mel Tiangco, Frankie Evangelista, and Angelique Lazo. New team members, such as Korina Sanchez, Ted Failon, and Julius Babao, either joined or replaced the original members of the news team. The Filipino viewing audience listened to the news anchors and reporters of ABS-CBN in colloquial Tagalog, which was entirely different from the formal Tagalog rendering of the news by Lee Andres and Paul Lacanilao of <b><i>BBC Balita </i></b>(BBC News), BBC 2, and Dell Villanueva, Ismael Reyes, and Betsy Enriquez of <b><i>Balita </i></b>(News), Channel 4, and its reformatted evening news in Filipino during the martial law period, then by Andres on <b><i>Headline Trese</i></b> (Headline on 13), IBC 13, or by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a>, Mike Lacanilao, Bobby Guanzon, Rene Jose, Rey Pacheco, and Amado Pineda on <b><i>GMA Balita</i></b> (GMA News), 1986-98. It was still sometime after that GMA adapted to the changing language of broadcast media. <b><i>Saksi: GMA Headline Balita </i></b>(Eyewitness: GMA News Headline), 1995-present, made headway when it kicked off savvier news reporting from its anchors Mike Enriquez, who came from GMA&rsquo;s FM radio, and newcomer Karen Davila, with reporters Jessica Soho, Arnold Clavio, and Susan Enriquez. Mel Tiangco and Jay Sonza, who had issues with ABS-CBN over product endorsement deals on TV, joined GMA&rsquo;s news team in 1996, and Vicky Morales joined <b><i>Saksi </i></b>from GMA&rsquo;s late-night English news program, while Davila moved to ABS-CBN. The early evening newscast in Filipino changed formats, bannered by <b><i>Frontpage: Ulat ni Mel Tiangco</i></b> (Frontpage: News Report by Mel Tiangco), 1999-2004, then to <b><i>24 Oras</i></b> (24 Hours), 2004-present, to rival ABS-CBN&rsquo;s <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, which led the ratings game during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">English newscasts continued to be relegated to the late-night time slot, but all shifted to Filipino in the late 1990s. ABS-CBN produced <b><i>The World Tonight</i></b>, 1986-99, anchored by Angelo Castro, Loren Legarda, and Larry Ng, who were joined by segment reporters Ces Ore&ntilde;a-Drilon, Cathy Yap-Yang, and Dyan Castillejo. It lost to GMA&rsquo;s Filipino late-night newscast <b><i>Frontpage</i></b>. ABS-CBN replaced the show with <b><i>Pulso: Aksyon Balita</i></b> (Pulse: News in Action), 1999-2000, hosted by Sanchez and Failon, who were later replaced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4957\"><strong>Gel Santos-Relos</strong></a> and Erwin Tulfo, then reformatted several times using the Filipino language. GMA had <b><i>GMA Headline News</i></b>, 1986-92, with Monzon Palma, Jose Mari Velez, Morales, and Pineda, which changed to <b><i>GMA Network News</i></b>, 1992-98, this time anchored, at different years, by Leslie Espino, Morales, Jessica Soho, Marga Ortigas, Mari Kaimo, and Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel. It was later reformatted to a full Filipino newscast via <b><i>Saksi</i></b>, which premiered as the network&rsquo;s early evening newscast in 1995 until it was moved to the late evening shift in 2002, this time anchored by Clavio and Pia Arcangel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RPN 9 continued its flagship programs until 2008 when the network was acquired by Solar Entertainment. The early evening news program <b><i>NewsWatch: Evening Cast</i></b> was anchored by Harry Gasser, then by Cielo Villaluna and Cristina Pecson, and the late evening edition, <b><i>NewsWatch Prime Cast</i></b>, by Cathy Santillan and Gasser, who was later replaced by Eric Eloriaga. The early evening edition was replaced by <b><i>RPN Aksyon News</i></b> (RPN News in Action), later by <b><i>NewsWatch Aksyon Balita</i></b> (NewsWatch News in Action), 2004-6, first anchored by Erwin Tulfo, Connie Sison, Aljo Bendijo, Jake Morales, Vikki Sambilay, and Bobby Yan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">English newscasts moved to the networks&rsquo; free UHF channels. Those that were retained on VHF (very high frequency) channels had to face the stiff competition posed by newscasts in the national language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News programming beginning in the 1990s was highly marked by a rigodon of anchors and reporters, a highly flexible movement of primetime slots, and what critics would call the tabloidization of news that skewed the content, format, and style of reporting toward entertainment, all in the rush to attract more viewers, particularly the C-D-E markets, and increase each station&rsquo;s ratings, which spelled the life and death of the programs. The broadcast industry was then becoming the game for the big conglomerates, with news and public affairs programs giving the mass audience the television equivalents of sensational material found in the tabloids. The &ldquo;war of the broadcast networks,&rdquo; mainly between ABS-CBN and GMA, turned fiercer, each trying to outdo the other in selling news and entertainment that favored the bizarre, the absurd, the sexy, the violent, the taboo, and the macabre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In spite of the trend toward sensationalism, serious news reporting also significantly developed beginning in the late 1990s and onward the 2000s with the war coverage of leading broadcast media companies. Both GMA and ABS-CBN sent teams of journalists to cover the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, following the 11 Sep 2001 attacks, for which the American government blamed terrorists coming from the Middle East. The networks faced the arduous process of visa applications, securing permits for coverage, transporting equipment, and protecting their crew, all done in fulfillment of a reporter&rsquo;s dream to do &ldquo;real journalism.&rdquo; It has since become imperative for Philippine media to achieve coverage of several events happening outside the country, present the geopolitical implications of worldwide developments, and analyze the impact of such events on Filipinos scattered all over the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Asia&rsquo;s freest media returned with a vengeance after toppling the Marcos dictatorship. With the viewing public eager to know the different facets of the nation&rsquo;s life, documentary and investigative programs multiplied in the post-EDSA period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few significant documentaries were produced on radio. Examples are <b><i>Kalinangang Pilipino</i></b> (Filipino Heritage), 1994, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4823\"><strong>DZRM</strong></a> Radyo Manila, written by Norma Balaoro-Remo, which showcased the different artistic expressions and cultural heritage of Filipinos; <b><i>Sa Likod ng Balita</i></b> (Behind the News), 1991-95, DXND-Kidapawan, Cotabato, produced by Notre Dame Broadcasting Corporation, written and hosted by Malu Maphytte Roa Cadelina, which critically assessed both local and national political issues through the lens of culture; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a>on nga Kagawasan </i></b>(Golden Liberty), 1994, DYVL-AM Tacloban, which featured the voices of ordinary people about the significance of the 50th anniversary of the historic Leyte landing of Gen Douglas MacArthur; and <b><i>Yaman ng Lahi</i></b> (Bounty of the Race), 1992, DWLC Philippine Broadcasting System, written by Carmencita C. Bodino and hosted by Josie A. Gonzalez and Edgardo M. Driz, which focused on the relevance of regional culture. DYFM Radyo Bombo Iloilo City came out with a series of magazine and public affairs documentaries in the 1990s that tackled issues about history, current events, and art activities of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most politically significant television documentaries during the early years of the Corazon Aquino administration were those produced by IBC 13, which at that time was suffering from legal battles with Marcos loyalists resisting the Aquino government&rsquo;s sequestration of the network. IBC 13 hardly had any public information show before 1986, except for its news programs. <b><i>People Power: The Philippine Experience</i></b>, 1986, was about the February EDSA Revolt. <b><i>Ceasefire</i></b>, 1986, was the first documentary that looked into the possibility of a ceasefire between the military and the leftist National Democratic Front&ndash;New People&rsquo;s Army. <b><i>Keithley Report: The US Bases</i></b>, 1986, presented the different views about the presence of military bases of the United States in the country at a time when the US bases provision was under deliberation by the Constitutional Commission, which was tasked by the Aquino administration to draft the new Philippine constitution. <b><i>Ramut: The Roots of Revolution in the Cordillera</i></b>, 1986, traced the history of the struggle of the people of the Cordillera in northern Philippines. <b><i>Tiempo Muerto: Crisis and Poverty in Negros</i></b> (Downtime: Crisis and Poverty in Negros), 1986, looked into the situation of the sugar workers in central Philippines and the struggle for emancipation from hunger and feudal values. <b><i>Autonomy: No Shortcut to</i> <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></i></b>, 1987, addressed the question of autonomy and the perception of several minority groups about the issue. <b><i>Hamon sa Pamahalaan, Hamon sa Taumbayan</i> </b>(Challenge to the Government, Challenge for the People), 1987, considered the first documentary that used the Filipino language, analyzed the meaning of the plebiscite results in the context of the various crises that have rocked the Aquino administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early years of the post-martial law period, it seemed that everybody wanted to talk, and talk people did, almost unhampered. Among public affairs talk programs, the game changer was <b><i>Truth Forum</i></b>, 1986, IBC 13&rsquo;s first weekly public affairs program and the first talk show that used Filipino as a language of serious discussion about current issues of the country. The show was conceptualized by a team of University of the Philippines (UP) scholars, such as literature professor Teresita G. Maceda, hosted by UP sociology professor Randy David, and directed by filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\"><strong>Marilou Diaz-Abaya</strong></a>, with guests that formed the panel of discussants and a live audience of 15, representing different views and sectors. The program was the television equivalent of the parliament of the streets. <b><i>Truth Forum</i></b> proved that Filipino can be a powerful language for intelligent discourse on television. The program switched networks and changed titles to <b><i>Public Forum</i></b>, IBC, to <b><i>Randy David sa Public Forum</i></b> (Randy David on Public Forum), ABC 5, then to <b><i>Public Life with Randy David</i></b>, GMA, and shifted time slots when entertainment programs began easing public affairs programs out of primetime programming and moving them to the late-night shift. These programming moves compromised the viewership of the show. More public affairs talk shows dealing with political, social, economic, and religious issues that tested the limits of Aquino&rsquo;s democratic space, without fear of repression, came into the picture. GMA and ABS-CBN programs dominated the programming of the genre. Lawyer Ricardo &ldquo;Dong&rdquo; Puno continued with <b><i>Viewpoint</i></b>, which started in 1984, GMA, until his ambition to run for the Senate in 1998 got in the way. He returned to television via <b><i>Dong Puno Live</i></b>, 1995-2000, and <b><i>Insider</i></b>, 2005-6, both on ABS-CBN, <b><i>Viewpoints</i></b>, 2006-7, ABS-CBN News Channel, then moved to Aksyon TV for programs like <b><i>Dong Puno de Kalibre </i></b>(Quality Dong Puno), 2011-14, and <b><i>News5 Debates: Hamon sa Pagbabago</i></b> (News5 Debates: Challenge for Change), which premiered in 2011. Veteran print journalists had their talk shows on TV. Luis Beltran voiced out his opinion on the state of the nation in <b><i>Straight from the Shoulder</i></b>, 1987-94, GMA, which was a revival of his pre-martial TV program of the same title on MBC Channel 11. Teddy Benigno interviewed local and international newsmakers, including Henry Kissinger and Margaret Thatcher, in <b><i>Firing Line</i></b>, 1992-99, GMA, co-hosted first by Oscar Orbos then by Solita Monsod. Both Orbos and Monsod had their <b><i>Debate with Mare at Pare</i></b> (Debate with Mare and Pare), 1998-2006, GMA, an open debate program that discussed various political issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another game changer was Cheche Lazaro&rsquo;s <b><i>The Probe Team</i></b>, 1987-2010, which had initially aired on ABS-CBN, before it moved to different networks. It can be considered the most critically acclaimed weekly public affairs magazine program. It pioneered investigative broadcast journalism in the country and raised Philippine broadcast journalism several notches higher than the prevailing standards of &ldquo;envelopmental&rdquo; journalism of the period when many journalists in both print and broadcast media were reportedly paid cash in envelopes by individuals and institutions in exchange for good publicity. Lazaro&rsquo;s team of young broadcast journalists, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4939\"><strong>Maria Ressa</strong></a>, Luchi Cruz-Valdes, Tony Velasquez, Judy Torres, and Angie Ramos, critically examined the deeper aspects and dimensions of various socially important subjects, such as corruption in public office or profiles of ordinary people or famous personalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another game changer was ABS-CBN&rsquo;s <b><i>Magandang Gabi, Bayan</i></b> (Good Evening, Nation), 1988-2005, which utilized the full, authoritative voice of Noli de Castro, the <i>kabayan<b> </b></i>(fellow countryman) of the mass audience, speaking in crisp Tagalog and exposing government anomalies. Through investigative reports, he taunted officials of the land for their neglect of the masses, which made him highly popular. The program functioned as the critical fourth estate, but toward the mid-1990s, the program tended to focus more on de Castro&rsquo;s image as a mediator between the masses and those in power than the ability of the program&rsquo;s <i>masa</i> audience to rely on their own agency to challenge government ineptness. The program&rsquo;s popularity catapulted de Castro to the vice presidency during Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&rsquo;s administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most important public affairs programs of the period came from the giants ABS-CBN and GMA. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1428\"><strong>The Correspondents</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1998-2010, ABS-CBN, was a documentary program that utilized a number of the network&rsquo;s stable of young journalists in bringing out exciting facets of certain topics. <b><i>Imbestigador</i></b> (Investigator), which premiered in 2000, GMA, hosted by Mike Enriquez, is a documentary-investigative show known for dangerously pursuing hot cases of drugs, arms, and prostitution but has also extended into other investigative issues such as poverty, health, and education. Similarly, <b><i>XXX: Exklusibo, Explosibo, Expos&eacute; </i></b>(XXX: Exclusive, Explosive, Expos&eacute;), 2006-13, ABS-CBN, was a crime-investigative show hosted by Julius Babao, Pinky Webb, and Anthony Taberna. <b><i>Imbestigador</i></b> and <b><i>XXX</i></b> received severe criticisms for baiting suspected malfeasants in order for the crime they are supposed to document to happen and for possibly violating several human rights in the process of the commission, investigation, prosecution, and judgment of cases. <b><i>Che Che Lazaro Presents</i></b>, 1999-2003, GMA, then 2010-present, ABS-CBN, continues the investigative and documentary mission of Probe Productions by tackling complex social and political issues. It later expanded to three- to five-hour broadcast on ABS-CBN, starting past midnight of Sunday up to the early hours of Monday morning. Another important program in this tradition is <b><i>Investigative Documentaries</i></b>, premiered 2011, GMA News TV Channel 11, hosted by print journalist Malou Mangahas, who provides an in-depth analysis of current issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of the investigative-documentary genre, two programs stand out the most: <b><i>i-Witness</i></b>, which premiered in 1999, and <b><i>Reporter&rsquo;s Notebook</i></b>, beginning in 2004, both of GMA. Presented by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4960\"><strong>Howie Severino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4799\"><strong>Kara David</strong></a>, Sandra Aguinaldo, and Jay Taruc, <b><i>i-Witness</i></b> selects topics not usually tackled in other shows, embedding their journalists in excruciating and life-threatening scenarios which are the everyday world of their subjects. Broadcast journalists <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4895\"><strong>Jiggy Manicad</strong></a></strong> and Maki Pulido deal with difficult issues of government neglect and public accountability in child labor, migration, education, and a host of other concerns in <b><i>Reporter&rsquo;s Notebook</i></b>. The two programs received dozens of awards from academic and civic organizations in the country and several recognitions in the New York Festivals for Television, with <b><i>i-Witness</i></b><i> </i>having already won two medals from the George Foster Peabody Awards, said to be the Pulitzer Prize in broadcast journalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recent welcome developments in the documentary genre are <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1497\"><strong>Reel Time</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i>Front Row</i></b>, which both premiered in 2011 on GMA News TV Channel 11. These documentaries challenged broadcast conventions by following a more cinematic approach to broadcast documentaries that cover a wide range of social issues. Unlike most documentaries in which the hosts tended to be the central figure in the analysis of topics covered by the programs, <b><i>Reel Time</i></b> and <b><i>Front Row</i></b> presented and dissected the struggles and triumphs of Filipinos in the context of the country&rsquo;s social and political realities without a host or a narrator. Their episodes have won the Peabody and several other awards from local and international groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Single-airing documentaries were also produced during the period. <b><i>People-Powered Presidency</i></b>, 1987, traced the roots of the EDSA Revolt that catapulted Corazon Aquino to power and examined her first 10 months in office. <b><i>Inside Congress</i></b>, 1987, examined the legislative history of the Philippines from the time it was convened in 1946, its closure in 1972, and its return in 1986. <b><i>Dear Sam &hellip; Sumasaiyo, Juan</i></b> (Dear Sam &hellip;Yours, Juan), 1989, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\"><strong>Joel Lamangan</strong></a>, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\"><strong>Rosalie Matilac</strong></a>, and produced by the Ateneo Center for Social Policy and Public Affairs, highlighted the protest movement and the art forms that critiqued the presence of US military bases in the country. <b><i>Pilipino Ako: Namumuhay sa Europa</i></b> (I Am a Filipino: Living in Europe), 1992, produced by Cheche Lazaro, reported by Luchi Cruz-Valdes, and hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4022\"><strong>Danny Javier</strong></a>, tackled the push and pull factors, through case studies, that bring about the migration of Filipino workers to Europe. <b><i>Anatomy of Rape</i></b>, 1993, GMA, written and hosted by Jessica Soho, intelligently examined the issue of rape at a time when people felt there was a need to bring the issue into the open; <b><i>Kids with Kids</i></b>, 1996, produced by Cheche Lazaro&rsquo;s Probe Productions, hosted by Yas Mapua and Francis M, discussed sex and relationships among teens; <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>: Ang Buhay ng Isang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a></i></b> (Jose Rizal: The Life of a Hero), 1996, produced by Bookmark and the History Department of Ateneo de Manila University, directed by Butch Nolasco and narrated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2956\"><strong>Joonee Gamboa</strong></a>, was about the life of national hero Jose Rizal; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1412\"><strong>Batas Militar</strong></a></i></b> (Martial Law), 1997, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4701\"><strong>Lito Tiongson</strong></a> and Pete Lacaba, produced by the Foundation for Worldwide People Power, was a documentary about martial law in the Philippines; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1235\"><strong>Minsan Lang Sila Bata</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Children Only Once</i></b>), 1997, written and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4317\"><strong>Ditsi Carolino</strong></a> and Sadhana Buxani, produced by the Ateneo Center for Social Policy and Public Affairs, featured children working as laborers in select regions of the country.<b><i> </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A significant progress was the entry of women in news and public affairs, which have long been dominated by men. The roster of broadcast personalities today counts women, now in fact ubiquitous, who have earned as much stature and credibility. Although much more needs to be done, the female perspective has seeped into many broadcast programs that deal with traditionally male subjects, such as politics and foreign relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcast journalism in the Philippines is inextricably linked with the country&#39;s national and local politics. Politicians enter the broadcast industry either in the spirit of public service or to help push forward their career in politics. News and public affairs programs have often been the launching pad for an individual&rsquo;s political career. The most glaring examples of broadcast personalities who were successful in their entry into politics are Noli de Castro, who became senator, then vice president of the country mainly on the merit of his programs on ABS-CBN, especially <b><i>Magandang Gabi, Bayan</i></b> (Good Evening, Nation), 1988-2005, and the segment &ldquo;Hoy, Gising!&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b>(Hey, Wake Up!) of the daily newscast <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, which premiered in 1987; Loren Legarda, whose career as a senator was partly propelled by her public affairs and magazine programs on ABS-CBN, like <b><i>The World Tonight</i></b>, 1986-97, <b><i>Pep Talk</i></b>, 1988-90, and <b><i>The Inside Story</i></b>, 1990-98; and Orlando &ldquo;Orly&rdquo; Mercado, a communication expert whose career in broadcast journalism spanning from the late 1960s to the martial law period, particularly with the popularity of his program on GMA, <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko </i></b>(I Love My Fellowman), which premiered in 1974 and continued on air after martial law, largely contributed to his political career as a senator and defense secretary during the post-EDSA period. Some news reporters also tried to enter local politics; some of them, like Gilbert Remulla, who also comes from a clan of politicians, and Ted Failon, gained the trust of audiences, while others failed in their bid to hold political office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Entertainment programs also significantly helped in increasing the chances of gaining political seats. Joseph &ldquo;Erap&rdquo; E. Estrada, who rose from the ranks of local politics during the martial law period, became president of the country from 1998 to 2001 mainly on account of his popularity as a movie actor whose films were also shown on local broadcasting networks. Fernando Poe Jr, considered the king of Philippine movies and whose films continued to be shown on television, treaded on the political path taken by his friend Estrada to embolden him to run for the presidency, but failed allegedly because of massive cheating committed by his political opponents. The political career of Vicente &ldquo;Tito&rdquo; Sotto depended on the huge popularity of the long-running noontime show <b><i>Eat Bulaga! </i></b>(Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!), which has consistently topped the ratings since 1979. Some popular movie stars whose presence has also been conspicuously felt on television and went into politics are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>, Herbert Bautista, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\"><strong>Ramon Revilla</strong></a>, Jinggoy Estrada, Roderick Paulate, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3349\"><strong>Lou Veloso</strong></a>, Cita Astals, Daniel Fernando, Alfred Vargas, Joey Marquez, and Alma Moreno. Some who originated in broadcast, including the advertising and the recording industries, or those more associated with broadcast than other media platforms, and made it into politics are Connie Angeles, Ted Failon, Isko Moreno, Lucy Torres, Teri Onor, Anjo Yllana, Kring Kring Gonzales, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Papin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Clearly, not only do the broadcast genres of public affairs and entertainment mix or their boundaries blurred; so do the personae of celebrity stars and politicians whose identities swing in the pendulum of the real and the imagined during the uncertainties of the post-EDSA Revolt up to today, which is highly marked by the virtualities of transmedia, the ubiquity of social media, and the heterogeneity of the transnationalization of media ownership and practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"entertainment\" name=\"entertainment\"></a>Variety Programs and Talk Entertainment Programs </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Variety programs continued to be popular among viewers. The format remained a hodgepodge of music, games or contests, and special segments usually sponsored by a product. Unlike in the martial law period when variety shows were aired in the noontime, evening, and weekend programming, variety shows during the post-EDSA period were mainly programmed in the afternoon and broadcast daily until Saturdays. Sunday variety programs also took the noontime slot. Entertainment talk programs, mainly about showbiz personalities, were broadcast during late afternoon weekends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The noontime variety program is an anchor on which the network establishes its ascendancy in the ratings game. Pioneer noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>was revived for a year, 1989-90, RPN 9, with original hosts <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a> and Bobby Ledesma, joined by Malu Maglutac, Jean Garcia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4599\"><strong>Cherry Pie Picache</strong></a>, basketball player Atoy Co, and Ramon Lorenzo, a perennial winner in the program&rsquo;s quiz segment &ldquo;IQ VII&rdquo; during its run during the martial law period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABS-CBN revived in 1987 the noontime show <b><i>Kalatog Pinggan</i></b><i> </i>(Clattering Plates), hosted by Bert &ldquo;Tawa&rdquo; Marcelo, Herbert Bautista, and Joey Marquez. It was with BBC 2 from 1985 to 1986, then moved to ABC 5 in 1989, this time hosted by Randy Santiago, John Estrada, and Bayani Agbayani. <b><i>Kalatog Pinggan</i></b> was replaced by <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!) when the latter moved from RPN 9 to ABS-CBN in 1989. GMA had <b><i>Lunch Date</i></b>, 1986-93, where Willie Revillame started as a host, and <b><i>Salo-Salo Together</i></b> (Lunch Together), 1993-95. <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> finally bowed to rival <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b><i> <b>Student Canteen </b></i>host Eddie Ilarde resurfaced in the noontime show <b><i>Alas Dose sa Trese</i></b> (Twelve at Thirteen), 1998-99, IBC 13, with former <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> host <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a>-Roa and PTV newscaster Chiqui Roa-Puno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> dominated noontime programming and continues to be the most popular noontime variety show, which first aired on RPN 9, 1979-1989, then with ABS-CBN from 1989 to 1994, and finally with GMA from 1995 onward. The program was perhaps at the apex of its popularity in the late 1980s until the 1990s with the hilarious cast graced by the cute and witty <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\"><strong>Aiza Seguerra</strong></a>, a 1987 runner-up in the program&rsquo;s segment &ldquo;Little Miss Philippines.&rdquo; <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> pioneered numerous talent search and game segments that have become the template for the industry, the most popular of which is the guessing game &ldquo;Pinoy Henyo&rdquo; (Filipino Genius), 2004. For the longest time, ABS-CBN tried to beat the show with a succession of programs, to no avail: <b><i>&rsquo;Sang Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i> </i>(APO Now Runs for a Week), 1995-98, which was expanded from a Sunday to a weeklong program hosted by the rather uppity <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>, followed by <b><i>Magandang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b>, 1998-2003, later renamed <b><i>Masayang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b>, 2003-4, and <b><i>MTB: Ang Saya-Saya </i></b>(MTB: So Happy), 2004-5, which carried on the challenge and generated income for the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was not until <b><i>Wowowee</i></b> in 2005 that ABS-CBN finally found the formula to evenly rival <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, with an engaging combination of surprising game segments, dramatic stories by contestants, and sexy dancers driven to scandalous proportion by host Willie Revillame. The show became known for the heart-wrenching stories contestants tell to the public as they compete for prizes and the tremendous talents they exhibit on the worldwide stage. On 4 Feb 2006, a stampede unfortunately happened during its first anniversary celebration at the PhilSports Arena (formerly Ultra) in Pasig City. Seventy-three people died and 700 were injured in the fanatical gathering incited by the show itself. The network and the host were severely criticized for profiting millions through encouraging mendicancy. It ran until 2010 when it had serious conflicts with the public, shareholders, and the management after Revillame criticized the zealous coverage of the funeral of former president Corazon Aquino to the detriment of his show. The show resurrected as <b><i>Wil Time Big Time</i></b> on TV5 from Oct 2010 to Jan 2013 and as <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b><i> </i>(That&rsquo;s So Willy) from Jan to Oct 2013 when it suffered from poor ratings and eventually ceased programming, until GMA revived the show as <b><i>Wowowin</i></b>, 2015, in its Sunday late afternoon program slot. ABS-CBN made a few programs to fill the slot vacated by <b><i>Wowowee</i></b>, first with <b><i>Pilipinas Win na Win</i></b> (Philippines On the Win), 2010, hosted by Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla, and <b><i>Happy Yipee Yehey!</i></b>, 2011-12, emceed by Randy Santiago, John Estrada, Rico Puno, Toni Gonzaga, and Pokwang. The network moved <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b> from its prelunch time slot to challenge <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>&rsquo;s supremacy and offered serious challenge because of its more extensive talent search, fantastic production numbers, and the presence of more popular young personalities. Sometimes <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b> beats <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> in the ratings game with the popularity of its hosts and contests, although it remains to be proven whether a different variety show will be able to topple <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, which has been durable in terms of holding on to the Filipino audience worldwide. <b><i>Eat Bulaga! </i></b>also continues to innovate, with hit segments like &ldquo;Pinoy Henyo&rdquo; (Filipino Genius), &ldquo;All for Juan, Juan for All,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kalye Serye with AlDub&rdquo; (Street Series with AlDub). AlDub stands for the split-screen love team of young star Alden Richards and dubsmash sensation Maine Mendoza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sex became a come-on, particularly for noontime shows. The Sex Bomb Girls, who gyrate, grind, and push their pelvis forward while egging on contestants of &ldquo;Laban o Bawi&rdquo; (Fight or Withdraw), have become a regular fixture in <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> The sexual innuendos by the male hosts of <b><i>Magandang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b>, later renamed <b><i>Masayang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b>, crossed the line separating naughtiness from indecency. In sitcoms, comedy is not measured by the wit of the actors but by the plunging necklines that have become the common practice among the female actors. One can easily and rightfully criticize these incidents as exploitation of women whose bodies are used in the economy of television entertainment, but the irony is that women have occupied the networks&rsquo; top positions. For example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a> was the head of the entertainment division of ABS-CBN and Wilma Galvante was her counterpart in GMA when these variety shows were encouraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Late-night talk entertainment shows during the early post-EDSA period targeted mainly the AB crowd. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4531\"><strong>Edu Manzano</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Not So Late Night with Edu</i></b>, which premiered in 1985, GMA, an evening talk entertainment show, continued airing until 1987 before it moved to ABS-CBN, 1987-93. Aside from becoming a popular game show host, Manzano later hosted similar programs such as <b><i>Late Night with Edu</i></b>, 1992-94, and <b><i>What&rsquo;s Up, Doods?</i></b>, 2013, both on ABC/TV5. <b><i>Oh No, It&rsquo;s Johnny</i></b>, 1987-99, ABS-CBN, hosted by Johnny Litton, is considered a classy late-night talk show that combined wit, elitism, and old-school rambunctiousness. Singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a> put his gift of gab to good use by hosting <b><i>Martin After Dark</i></b> (aka <b><i>MAD</i></b>), 1988-93, GMA, then 1993-98, ABS-CBN, featuring known personalities and with segments of special features. Journalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4992\"><strong>Jullie Yap-Daza</strong></a> continued hosting the late-night talk entertainment&ndash;public affairs show <b><i>Tell the People</i></b>, 1981-97, RPN 9. The show was an original BBC 2 production called <b><i>Tell the City</i></b>, 1980-81, and would become <b><i>Tell the People Now</i></b> when it moved to ANC in 2001 and stayed in the network until 2004. Mel Tiangco and Jay Sonza&rsquo;s <b><i>Mel &amp; Jay</i></b>, 1988-96, ABS-CBN, tackled the most mundane and most social of subjects, from governmental inefficiencies to cultural peculiarities of people. It migrated to GMA after the hosts had a legal tussle with ABS-CBN over commercial rights and was retitled <b><i>Partners Mel &amp; Jay</i></b>, 1996-2004. Tiangco would later on be partnered with Joey de Leon in <b><i>Mel &amp; Joey</i></b>, 2004-11, GMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Daily and weekend variety shows were focused on celebrities, mainly young and upcoming stars. <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4912\"><strong>German Moreno</strong></a></strong></strong></strong>&rsquo;s shows on GMA had a spike during the period, which include the daily late afternoon program <b><i>That&rsquo;s Entertainment</i></b>, 1986-96, which featured Moreno&rsquo;s stable of young stars, and the weekend programs <b><i>Saturday Entertainment</i></b>, 1986-95, <b><i>GMA Supershow</i></b>, 1984-97, and <b><i>Master Showman</i></b>, which debuted in 1997, later renamed <b><i>Walang Tulugan with the Master Showman</i></b> (Awake All Night with the Master Showman), a late-night Saturday program that ends on Sunday morning. ABS-CBN had the daily afternoon show <b><i>Ang TV</i></b> (The TV), which showcased the network&rsquo;s crop of young talents. A curious practice in most variety shows is that of tasking young stars to sing even if they lack the talent or the training to render a musical performance. It has become a staple component in local broadcast programs to the point of marginalizing professional singers, pitting more popular personalities against the more qualified and better-trained artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The heated rivalry between the networks ABS-CBN and GMA showed in the entertainment programs they pitted against each other. ABS-CBN had the weekly variety musical program <b><i>ASAP</i></b>, aka <b><i>All-Star Sunday Afternoon Party</i></b>, which premiered in 1995; the entertainment talk shows on weekday mornings, such as <b><i>Teysi ng Tahanan</i></b> (Tessie of the Home), 1991-97, and <b><i>Morning Girls with Kris and Korina</i></b>, 2002-4; the weekend celebrity talk shows <b><i>Showbiz Lingo</i></b>, 1992-99, and <b><i>The Buzz</i></b>, 1999-2015; the weekend entertainment talk show <b><i>Sharon</i></b>, 1998-2010; and the weekend variety dance program <b><i>Loveli-ness</i></b>, 1987. GMA&rsquo;s equivalent of these programs were <b><i>SOP</i></b>, aka <b><i>Sobrang Okay, Pare!</i></b> (Super Okay, Dude!), 1997-2010; <b><i>Sis: Janice and Gelli</i></b> (Sisters: Janice and Gelli), 2001-10; <b><i>Star Talk</i></b>, which premiered in 1995; <b><i>S-Files</i></b>, 1998-2007; and <b><i>Vilma!</i></b>, 1986-95. IBC produced <b><i>Maricel Live!</i></b>, 1986-89, <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a> Show</i></b>, 1986-88, and <b><i>Lovely Ness</i></b>, 1988-89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Showbiz talk shows had a heyday in the late 1980s up to the 1990s. Inday Badiday&rsquo;s <b><i>See True</i></b>, GMA,<i> </i>ended its run in 1987, but followed it up with <b><i>Eye to Eye</i></b>, 1988-97, and <b><i>The Truth and Nothing but the Truth</i></b>, 2000, both on GMA. Presidential daughter Kris Aquino, at age 15, first appeared as a guest on <b><i>See True</i></b> in 1986 immediately following the ascendancy of mother Corazon Aquino to the presidency. <b><i>Scoop</i></b>, 1988, IBC 13, introduced movie talk show hosts Boy C. de Guia and Lolit Solis. Audiences welcomed weekend celebrity talk shows, such as <b><i>Showbiz Lingo</i></b>, 1992-97, then renamed <b><i>Showbiz Lingo Plus</i></b>, 1997-99, ABS-CBN, hosted by Butch Francisco, Cristy Fermin, Ogie Diaz, and John Lapus, and <b><i>Startalk</i></b>, which premiered in 1995, GMA, and had Kris Aquino and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4750\"><strong>Boy Abunda</strong></a> as initial hosts of the program before they left for ABS-CBN, and later hosted by Lolit Solis, Joey de Leon, Butch Francisco after he left ABS-CBN, and Ricky Lo. <b><i>Startalk</i></b><i> </i>became notorious when it got bold star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4637\"><strong>Rosanna Roces</strong></a> as one of its hosts. Another show hosted by Boy Abunda and Kris Aquino,<i> <b>The Buzz</b></i>, 1999-2015, ABS-CBN, inherited the mantle of <b><i>Showbiz Lingo</i></b> by featuring the latest news on showbiz personalities and having exclusive features of the latest scandals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These celebrity talk programs earned both popularity and criticisms when they featured the latest news on showbiz personalities, peered into the most private aspects of actors&rsquo; lives, offered exclusive features of the latest scandals and controversies, particularly those involving breakups, marital infidelity, gender identity, and sex, and created, maneuvered, or provoked confrontations. Sexual innuendos have also become the trademark of these programs. For example, Rosanna Roces did a song number in her program while suggestively caressing the shaft of the microphone. Also, these tabloid talk shows have virtually become confessional booths for many stars, opening themselves up on national television, making a public revelation, often in tears, of deep personal secrets. <b><i>Private Conversations with Boy Abunda</i></b>, premiered 2001, ANC 21, and <b><i>The Bottom Line with Boy Abunda</i></b>, premiered 2009, ABS-CBN, paved the way for the host&rsquo;s respectability by having a more punching yet empathic and more intimate talk program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a id=\"game\" name=\"game\"></a>Game Shows and Talent Search Contests</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Game shows continued to gain popularity as they served to entice people who wanted to prove their knowledge and skills combined with mettle. <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></strong>&rsquo;s <b><i>Family Kuarta o Kahon</i></b><i> </i>(Family Cash or Box), 1987-2000, RPN 9, was held every Sunday noontime at SM City North EDSA and broadcast live on Channel 9. It was a hilarious show of parlor games and chances, oftentimes ending with ludicrous prizes&mdash;like street food, for instance&mdash;for those who failed in their wager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few educational quiz shows were produced during this period. The most popular was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1414\"><strong>Battle of the Brains</strong></a></i></b>, 1992-99, RPN 9, then 1999-2001, PTV 4, hosted by David Celdran. It was a quiz competition open to students in the primary to tertiary levels. Participants battle with one another from the easy to average and then to the difficult round in weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual tournaments, bagging institutional prestige and personal glory. Viewers elsewhere become contestants themselves as they try to answer the questions for the studio contestants. The show received tremendous support from the public and sponsors. When it folded up,<i> <b>Digital LG Quiz</b></i>, 1999-2005, GMA, tried to resurrect the school &ldquo;brain tournament&rdquo; genre but did not last long. The nearest successor to <b><i>Battle of the Brains</i></b> is the segment &ldquo;Pinoy Henyo&rdquo; of <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, though the contest, while testing the analytical and encyclopedic knowledge of contestants, is non-academic in nature and is open to everyone. <b><i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i></b>, 2000-2002, IBC 13, hosted by Christopher de Leon, was based on the original British game show of the same format and title. It became very popular with a top prize of two million pesos to be bagged by a contestant who passed the ever-increasing level of difficult questions with higher risks. The show was revived on TV5 in 2009 with Vic Sotto as host. ABS-CBN produced interesting quiz game shows with high production value, such as <b><i>Kapamilya: Deal or No Deal</i></b> (Family Member: Deal or No Deal), 2006-9 and 2012-13; <b><i>Ready, Get Set, Go!</i></b>, 1992-97; and the Game Ka Na Ba? (Are You Ready to Play) series: <b><i>Game KNB?</i></b>, 2001-2; <b><i>Milyon-Milyon Na: Game KNB? </i></b>(It&rsquo;s Running in the Millions: Are You Ready to Play?), 2002-3; <b><i>Next Level Na: Game KNB? </i></b>(Onto the Next Level: Are You Ready to Play?), 2003-4; and <b><i>Pilipinas, Game KNB?</i></b> (Philippines, Are You Ready to Play?), 2001-9, hosted by Kris Aquino, 2001-7, then by Edu Manzano, 2007-9. GMA produced the quiz-game show <b><i>GoBingo!</i></b>, 1996-99, hosted by Arnel Ignacio. The music-game show <b><i>K: The 1-Million-Peso Videoke Challenge</i></b>, 2002-4, hosted also by Ignacio, and later reformatted as <b><i>All-Star K: The 1-Million-Peso Videoke Challenge</i></b>, 2004-9, hosted by singer Jaya and comedian Allan K, rode on the popularity of videoke music among Filipinos. Also on GMA, <b><i>Celebrity Bluff</i></b>, which premiered in 2013, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4415\"><strong>Eugene Domingo</strong></a> as host and comedians Boobay, Jose Manalo, and Brod Pete as bluffers, tests celebrity contenders&rsquo; knowledge in all fields, giving sometimes seemingly preposterous explanations for answers that are revealed to be the correct ones in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most important sports program that came out during the post-EDSA period was Probe Productions&rsquo; <b><i>Game Plan</i></b>, 1995-2008, first on GMA, then on Studio 23, and finally on Solar Sports. Some of its hosts over the years included Paolo Abrera, Paolo Bediones, Suzi Entrata, Akiko Thompson, Rovilson Fernandez, and Paulo Soler. Its hosts did stories of many sports across the country, featuring mainly nonprofessional athletes. It was publicly relaunched in 2012 as an online healthy lifestyle sports show. Another interesting show was <b><i>Sports Unlimited</i></b>, 1997-2015, ABS-CBN, hosted by Dyan Castillejo and Marc Nelson, which featured different kinds of sports and ordinary and prominent sports figures. Sports programs appearing in the 2000s started adopting the reality TV format, such as <b><i>Extra Challenge</i></b>, 2003-6, 2012-13, GMA, and <b><i>The Amazing Race Philippines</i></b>, which premiered in 2012, TV5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine entertainment industry has become insatiable in its quest for new and younger talents. <b><i>Starstruck</i></b>, 2003-7, 2009-10, 2015, GMA, reinvigorated the field of talent search when it started in 2003, becoming the launching pad of some promising actors like Jennylyn Mercado, Rocco Nacino, Paulo Avelino, and the Philippines&rsquo; first Miss World title holder Megan Young. Not to be outdone, ABS-CBN launched its <b><i>Star Circle Quest</i></b>, 2004-11, with seasonal editions for kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Singing contests have become a staple part of television programming, and every year tens of thousands join the open call. GMA produced <b><i>Ang Bagong Kampeon</i></b> (The New Champion), 1985-88, <b><i>Search for a Star</i></b>, 2003-4, and <b><i>Pinoy Pop Superstar</i></b>, 2004-7, while ABS-CBN came out with <b><i>Tanghalan ng Kampeon </i></b>(Stage of Champions), 1987-93, <b><i>Search for the</i> <i>Star in a Million</i></b>, 2003-6, <b><i>The Singing Bee</i></b>, premiered 2008, <b><i>X-Factor Philippines</i></b>, premiered 2012, and <b><i>The Voice of the Philippines</i></b>, premiered 2013. These shows churned out admirable singers whose longevity in the music industry will be decided not only by their talent but by market agility. In a nation known for musical prowess, singing contests continue to attract the young and ambitious, though it remains a challenge to impart &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; musicality and to outgrow the imitation of the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; style of singing. Filipinos may be known to produce excellent singers, as displayed in contests in other countries where those with Filipino pedigree win the competition, but it is disappointing that the country has simply become a mini or second-rate Hollywood in this part of the Third World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dance shows, which were mainly contest programs, were <b><i>Shall We Dance?</i></b>, 2005-10, and <b><i>Celebrity Dance Challenge</i></b>, which premiered in 2014, both on ABC/TV5 and both hosted by former Lux shampoo commercial model Lucy Torres. Multi-category talent contests were also produced during the period, which stations intended as a venue to hire diverse entertainers for the networks&rsquo; various programs. Singers, dancers, tricksters, ventriloquists, and jack-of-all-trades performers joined programs such as <b><i>Talentadong Pinoy</i></b><i> </i>(Talented Filipino), 2008-14, TV5, and <b><i>Pilipinas Got Talent</i></b><i> </i>(Philippines Got Talent), 2010-15, ABS-CBN, of the <b><i>British</i></b> <b><i>Got Talent</i></b> franchise. The Filipino shadow play group El Gamma Penumbra won in the 2015 <b><i>Pilipinas Got Talent</i></b> and later emerged the grand winner in <b><i>Asia&rsquo;s Got Talent</i></b>&rsquo;s first season, also in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"comedy\" name=\"comedy\"></a>Comedy Shows </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Comedy programs that were avowedly political in subject matter had become prominent in the early post-EDSA years. Satire became the means of expression of intellectuals and cultural workers who seized the renewed freedom of expression. <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>, 1987-89, IBC 13, a gag show that parodies social issues in the format of a news program, was the most biting in its criticisms of government graft and corruption, foreign domination of the economy and politics, and the character of the nation and its people. The show anchored itself on the previously neglected but critical mass audience but later suffered from the boycott of advertisers because of the show&rsquo;s hard-edged criticism and spoof on current local and international sociopolitical events, even attacking American imperialism. The boycott extended to the other shows of one of the program&rsquo;s actors, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4427\"><strong>Jaime Fabregas</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Political satire, mainly in the form of spoofs in various program formats, continued in spite of occasional threats coming from advertisers. During the early years of the Corazon Aquino administration, these shows mainly came from the reinvigorated IBC 13, under the management of Noel Tolentino, while in the midst of long-drawn-out legal battles against Marcos loyalists who wanted to maintain their hold on sequestered broadcast networks. <b><i>Barrio Balimbing</i></b><i> </i>(A Barrio of Turncoats), 1986, IBC 13, then 1987-88 when it moved to ABS-CBN, made fun of personalities, lambasted politicians, and conveyed the ordinary people&rsquo;s perception of political and social issues, which the characters spoofed in the show. <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>,<i> </i>1990-91, then 1993-95, RPN, featured writer-director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4978\"><strong>Jun Urbano</strong></a>&rsquo;s fictional character of Mr Shooli, based on the film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>, 1952, by his father filmmaker and National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>. With sidekick Kuhol, played by Philip Supnet, Mr Shooli took potshots at politicians and personalities through his &ldquo;grill-and-roast&rdquo; type of interviewing while seated on the mouth of a Buddha statue. Similar to other comedies, <b><i>Mongolian </i></b>featured song-and-dance satirical performances, spoofs of TV advertisements, and &ldquo;laugh-in&rdquo; segments. Urbano resurfaced on <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b> in 2014 on UHF free cable TV Global News Network (GNN).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Similar satirical spoofs were produced in the 2000s. Real-life friends Maveric Relova and Ariel Villasanta anchored ABC 5&rsquo;s pseudo-investigative news-documentary <b><i>Totoo TV: Walang Kinatatakutan, Walang Kinikilingan, Walang Hiya </i></b>(Real TV: Fearless, Balanced, Shameless), 2005, an alliteration of claims of balanced reporting by national broadsheets and broadcast news programs. A recent welcome development in the genre is <b><i>Kontrabando</i></b> (Smuggled), 2015, ABC/TV5, a news satire show hosted by Ramon Bautista, Lourd de Veyra, Jun Sabayton, and RA Rivera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gag shows continued to be the popular format of many comedy programs. <b><i>T.O.D.A.S.</i></b>, IBC 13, a program that started during the martial law period, continued to air until 1989. ABS-CBN revived its pre-martial law gag show <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b>, 1996-99. <b><i>Goin&rsquo; Bananas</i></b>, 1986, BBC 2, 1986-87, IBC 13, then 1988-91, ABS-CBN, starred acclaimed movie actors Christopher de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4476\"><strong>Jay Ilagan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4403\"><strong>Johnny Delgado</strong></a>, and Edgar Marquez playing out macho fantasies about women. The mid-1990s was the heyday of gag shows, marked by the entry of the very popular <b><i>Tropang Trumpo</i></b><i> </i>(Troop of Tops), 1994-99, ABC 5, with its signature parodies of songs, dances, and segments, such as the memorable &ldquo;Battle of the Brainless&rdquo; where nobody wins while contestants state the most stupid and non sequitur answers to questions posed by the segment&rsquo;s quiz master. The program&rsquo;s lead stars, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4905\"><strong>Michael V.</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3860\"><strong>Ogie Alcasid</strong></a>, were pirated by GMA and led the cast of the sketch comedy show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1419\"><strong>Bubble Gang</strong></a></i></b>, which premiered in 1995. The duo&rsquo;s comedic genius and its cast were utilized well in their new show as they made a succession of hilarious segments. Because it subjects almost anything popular to parody, the show has received criticisms on a number of issues such as its portrayal of women, rape, and the insensitive depiction of a special child. With 19 years and counting, <b><i>Bubble Gang</i></b> has surpassed the 10-year run of <b><i>T.O.D.A.S.</i></b> and the 17-year airing of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), and ranks along with <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> (36 years counting) as one of the longest-running shows on Philippine television. A gag show that employed a cast of children, with the exception of the oldest and only adult in the show Dagul, was <b><i>Goin&rsquo; Bulilit</i></b><i> </i>(Goin&rsquo; Kiddie), 2005-15, ABS-CBN, directed by Edgar Mortiz. Patterned after <b><i>Goin&rsquo; Bananas</i></b>, in which Mortiz appeared as a mainstay, the show was not for children, with kids playing adult roles in various funny, but often not-fit-for-children, situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important sketch comedy show was <b><i>Comedy Central Market</i></b>, 2007, GMA, hosted by Arnel Ignacio. It pioneered stand-up comedy on television, but with inoffensive, nondiscriminatory, fairer, and more respectable humor than contemporary variety programs that insensitively and callously make fun of people. The show featured stand-up acts by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4958\"><strong>Romnick Sarmenta</strong></a>, Eugene Domingo, Ai-Ai delas Alas, Ruby Rodriguez, and Vice Ganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps one of the best gag shows that ran from the 1990s to the 2000s was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1452\"><strong>Ispup</strong></a></i></b> (Spoof), 1999-2004, ABC/TV5. It parodied television shows in its program segments, some of which included &ldquo;Alam Morena Clara&rdquo; from the telenovela <b><i>Morena Clara</i></b>, &ldquo;The Cheapest Link&rdquo; from the British game show <b><i>The Weakest Link</i></b>, &ldquo;Gay KNB?&rdquo; (Are You Now Gay?) from the game show <b><i>Game KNB?</i></b>, and &ldquo;Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo sa Puso Ko Iibigin Ka Hanggang sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan&rdquo; (I Promise to Love You from the Bottom of My Heart Forever and Ever) from three popular local soaps.

Examples are <b><i>Wow Mali</i></b> (Oh No, It&rsquo;s a Mistake), 1996-2006, 2009-15, ABC 5, directed by Robert Quebral and hosted by Joey de Leon, a candid-camera-type show that features practical jokes on people on the streets, the funny situations in which some of these people are caught on camera, and video footage of bloopers and bizarre incidents; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1473\"><strong>The </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>dventures of Maverick and Ariel</strong></i></b>, 2003-5, ABC 5, which blurs the line between fiction and reality as the camera follows the lives of hosts Maverick Relova and Ariel Villasanta as they go about their everyday lives and get into a series of real-life and fictional &ldquo;misadventures&rdquo; to pursue their elusive dream of making it big in showbiz; <b><i>Mommy Elvie&rsquo;s Problematic Show</i></b>, 2007-8, ABC 5, a spoof-reality TV program of Mommy Elvie, Ariel Villasanta&rsquo;s real-life mother who regularly had cameo appearances as her wacky self in <b><i>The Misadventures of Maverick and Ariel</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Family-oriented and situational comedies dominated primetime programming of the major networks immediately following the post-EDSA Revolt and on to the 1990s. Interesting situational comedies that had political commentaries include <b><i>Sitak ni Jack</i></b> (Jack&rsquo;s Taxicab), 1987, IBC 13, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4307\"><strong>Cachupoy</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3001\"><strong>Junix Inocian</strong></a>, which featured characters of a taxi company undergoing all kinds of mishaps and utilized the taxi as a venue for political and social commentaries; <b><i>Kwentong Barbero</i></b> (Barber&rsquo;s Story), 1987, IBC 13, directed by Naning Estrella and starring Lou Veloso, Oly de Guzman, Marco Sison, Encar Benedicto, Hero Bautista, and Sabatini Fernandez, which cast a critical eye on the local political scene; and <b><i>Tambayan </i></b>(Hangout), 1993, ABS-CBN, where characters loiter at the neighborhood store, drinking liquor and talking about political topics in the language of the everyday. <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, which started in 1973, continued airing on RPN 9 until 1990. Audiences, however, did not receive well its sequel, <b><i>John en Shirley</i></b>, 2006-7, ABS-CBN, which featured two of the show&rsquo;s original cast, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a> and Maricel Soriano. Dolphy made his presence felt further on TV in <b><i>Home along da <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1272\"><strong>Riles</strong></a></i></b> (Home along the Railroad), 1992-2003, ABS-CBN, a title ripped off from the popular American movie <b><i>Home Alone</i></b>. The sitcom depicted a poor family of informal settlers living alongside the railway tracks. Along with his son Vandolph; grandson Boy 2 Quizon; teen stars <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4286\"><strong>Claudine Barretto</strong></a>, Gio Alvarez, Smokey Manaloto, and Bamba; and veteran stars Nova Villa, Babalu, <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2791\"><strong>Bernardo Bernardo</strong></a></strong></strong></strong>, and Cita Astals. Dolphy solidified his hold on Philippine primetime comedy playing Kevin Cosme. Nova Villa made her mark as the sister of Kevin&rsquo;s deceased wife, devoting herself to helping Kevin&rsquo;s family while also making advances on him. Also noticeable in the program was the continuation of the presence of the <i>kasambahay</i> (housemaid) character as one of the show&rsquo;s lead stars, sometimes being bossy to the real boss only to be put back to her place and always providing a comic relief of her own as chief gossiper and villain-heroine. <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!), 1987-89, IBC 13, 1989-95, ABS-CBN, and 1995-97, GMA, entertained TV audiences with its fantastic premise of a marriage between a human being, Enteng Kabisote, portrayed by Vic Sotto, and a supernatural, Faye, played by Alice Dixson. Veteran actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4688\"><strong>Charito Solis</strong></a> and dancer-comedian <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2424\"><strong>Bayani Casimiro</strong></a></strong> performed their more memorable roles on TV in this program in the twilight of their careers. <b><i>Okay Ka</i></b> followed <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>&rsquo;s format of the perennial fight between a man and his nagging and biased mother-in-law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three popular yet contrasting situational comedy shows became highly popular during the period, all of which were produced by ABS-CBN. <b><i>Palibhasa Lalake</i></b>, 1987-98, <b><i>Chika Chika Chicks </i></b>(Chatty Chicks), 1987-91, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1401\"><strong>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</strong></a> </i></b>(Watch for the Next Chapter), 1991-97, led the ratings and cemented the dominance of ABS-CBN just a few years after it was given back to the Lopez family by the Aquino administration. Directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\"><strong>Jose Javier Reyes</strong></a>, and starring Joey Marquez, Richard Gomez, Miguel Rodriguez, Gloria Romero, Amy Perez, Carmina Villaroel, Arlene Muhlach, and Cynthia Patag, <b><i>Palibhasa</i> </b>showed the naughty foibles of guys out to play tricks on their family, girls, and the rest of the gang. It was known for showing veteran actor Romero as a neighborhood drunkard, the glass-breaking scream of singer Patag, the presence of sexy women as guests, mysterious hands outside the camera frame intruding into the scene, camera shots taken from unconventional angles, and the water douse at the end of the show. It was also one of the pioneers in modeling clothes that are worn by its stars and the guesting of public officials and media showbiz personalities. One memorable moment was the interview made by Korina Sanchez with agrarian reform secretary and presidential candidate Miriam Defensor-Santiago in the heady days of the 1992 presidential campaign. Santiago rebutted from the television studio Joey Marquez&rsquo;s simplistic view of women which he uttered while watching the Santiago interview. Santiago later on entered the program&rsquo;s studio &ldquo;house&rdquo; and mouthed her advocacies to the rest of the cast. The episode was considered one of the first forays of electoral candidates into the TV medium, which was also exploited by actor Marquez when he ran for a public post, and both the show and the politician-guest were criticized for using the broadcast media for electioneering. Prior to <b><i>Palibhasa </i></b>was <b><i>Chika Chika Chicks</i></b>,<i> </i>featuring the husband-and-wife characters of Freddie Webb and Nova Villa. Pirated from IBC 13&rsquo;s <b><i>Chicks to Chicks</i></b>, 1980-86, <b><i>Chika Chika Chicks</i></b> thematized the insecurities of an overweight wife who always rescues her husband from his shenanigans with sexy women. On the other hand, <b><i>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</i></b>, also from the director-writer tandem of Manahan and Javier Reyes, would be etched in Filipino popular memory for having Anjo Yllana play Dino Tengco, a gun-toting special child of corrupt politician Congressman Tengco (<strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></strong>) and his pill-popping Imeldific wife Barbara (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4969\"><strong>Tessie Tomas</strong></a>). The show revolved around the peccadilloes of a morally depraved elite family foisting their whims on the rest of society as other people imitate, repel, fight, praise, and hobnob with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Situational comedy programs that maintained the old-school, clean comedy and clearly avoided the vulgar were <b><i>Hapi House</i></b> (Happy House), 1987-88, IBC 13, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4917\"><strong>Bibeth Orteza</strong></a>, directed by Bert de Leon, and starring Tito Sotto, Helen Gamboa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4563\"><strong>Aga Muhlach</strong></a>, Isabel Granada, Chuckie Dreyfuss, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4848\"><strong>Laura Hermosa</strong></a>, which showed the oddities, ironies, and awkward moments of a typical Filipino family life; <b><i>Buddy en Sol</i></b> (Buddy and Sol), 1991-93, RPN 9, written by Jose Bartolome, Divino Reyes, and Herman Salvador, directed by Leo Martinez, which portrayed friendships and loyalties in the midst of conflicts; <b><i>Ober da Bakod</i></b> (Over the Fence), 1992-97, GMA, starring Janno Gibbs, Anjo Yllana, Leo Martinez, Malou de Guzman, Gelli de Belen, and Donita Rose, which is about two families divided by economic class yet their children managed to develop good personal relations; <b><i>Pepito Manaloto</i></b>, which premiered in 2010, GMA, created by Michael V., starring Michael V., Manilyn Reynes, Nova Villa, Jessa Zaragosa, Ronnie Henares, Jake Vargas, Angel Satsumi, John Feir, Janna Dominguez, Arthur Solinap, and Mosang, about the funny daily experiences of an instant-millionnaire family, their helpers and drivers who are treated as members of its household, and their old-rich and quick-rich neighbors in their gated village; and <b><i>Vampire ang Daddy Ko</i></b> (My Daddy is a Vampire), which premiered in 2013, GMA, written and directed by Bibeth Orteza, starring Vic Sotto, Oyo Boy Sotto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, Jimmy Santos, Anjo Yllana, Sef Cadayona, Bea Binene, Barbie Forteza, Derrick Monasterio, Glaiza de Castro, Ryzza Mae Dizon, and Jacque Oda, about the classic battle between good and evil around which love, honesty, and fairness serve as key to overcome suspicions, mistrust, and paranoia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"children\" name=\"children\"></a>Programs for Children and Teens (and Adults) </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few programs for children were produced by local radio networks. A noteworthy production was <b><i>Daigdig ng mga Bata</i></b> (World of Children), 1994, DZRB Radyo ng Bayan, written by Miles Donguines-Cruz, which emphasized the importance of local culture in the contemporary life of Filipino children. DWRK-FM produced in 1994 dramatized radio plugs in its series called <b><i>Tayong mga Pinoy</i></b> (We, Filipinos) and <b><i>Hoy Bata</i></b> (Hey, Kid), which reminded audiences of decency in everyday life and nationalism among children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A more aggressive programming addressed to kids was initiated by TV networks after the restoration of media companies to their private owners. Some children&rsquo;s programs during the martial law period that continued airing during the post-EDSA Revolt were <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky 7 Club</i></b>, 1961-92, RBS-GMA; <b><i>Kaluskos Musmos </i></b>(Kiddie Noise), 1979-89, RPN 9; and <b><i>Kulit Bulilit </i></b>(Curious Children), 1982-88. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot</i></b>, which means small but strong, continued to gain popularity since its first airing in 1984 to its last broadcast in 2012. It aired on one channel after another, from RPN 9, PTV 4, ABS-CBN to GMA. Its radio version, <b><i>Radyo Batibot</i></b> (Batibot Radio), was broadcast beginning in the 1980s on DZAM, later called DZAR. Created by the Philippine Children&rsquo;s Television Foundation, <b><i>Batibot </i></b>was created to ground Filipino children in the Filipino language, culture, and heritage. It became known for clear and entertaining discussions of a wide range of topics, mostly on literacy, numeracy, interpersonal communication, and basic lessons on good manners and right conduct. It received numerous awards for its pro-Filipino programming and memorable cultural and artistic creations of puppets, songs, and stories. Better-funded and technologically savvier children&rsquo;s TV shows eclipsed <b><i>Batibot </i></b>in the mid-1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A <b><i>Batibot</i></b>-type of program, titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1485\"><strong>Pin-Pin</strong></a></i></b>, 1990-94, PTV 4, ABC 5, RPN 9, ABS-CBN, and GMA, propagated Chinese-Filipino culture in the Philippines, especially addressing the decline of Hokkien (Fukienese) among Filipinos with Chinese roots in the Philippines.

On ABS-CBN, some of the versions of the studio system on television were <b><i>Regal Drama Presents</i></b>,<i> </i>1986-99; <b><i>Seiko TV Presents</i></b>, 1989-90; and <b><i>Star Drama Theatre</i></b>, 1993-2001. On GMA, these were <b><i>Mother Studio Presents</i></b>, 1986-96; <b><i>GMA Telesine Specials</i></b>, 1993-99, 2001; and <b><i>GMA Love Stories</i></b>,<i> </i>1999-2001. Viva&rsquo;s popular daily soap operas were <b><i>Villa Quintana</i></b>, 1995-96, and <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b>, 1996-2002, both on GMA. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4942\"><strong>Coney Reyes</strong></a> on Camera</i></b>, 1984-99, RPN 9 and then ABS-CBN, was the longest-running drama anthology. It was a reformat of her earlier drama anthologies <b><i>Coney Reyes-Mumar Drama Studio</i></b>, 1977-81, and <b><i>Coney Reyes-Mumar on the Set</i></b>, 1981-83, both on GMA. Maricel Soriano had two weekly anthologies, totaling 10 years: <b><i>Maricel Regal Drama Special</i></b>, 1987-90, and <b><i>Maricel Drama Special</i></b>, 1990-97, both on ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Personality-focused daily drama soap serials continued to dominate the format of the drama in broadcast, this time starring a younger generation of performers. The most popular were those in which teen actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\"><strong>Judy Ann Santos</strong></a> appeared. She played the title role of Mara in <b><i>Mara Clara</i></b>, 1992-97, ABS-CBN, a story of two sisters who were switched at birth with one being raised by affluent doting parents while the rich parents&rsquo; real daughter is being abused by poor parents. <b><i>Mara Clara</i></b><i> </i>was notorious for its unbelievable and unduly long plot of the crucial diary that contained the secret, which was lost for years, and the overly dramatic scenes of incredible physical, verbal, and psychological abuse. Santos also played the title role in <b><i>Esperanza</i></b>, 1997-99, ABS-CBN, about a child&rsquo;s search for her biological family. Written by Dado Lumibao, Wali Ching, and Reggie Amigo, directed by Jerry Lopez Sineneng, Rory B. Quintos, and Don Miguel Cuaresma, the soap posted very high ratings and catapulted young actor Judy Ann Santos to superstar status. Other members of the cast include young performers Wowie de Guzman, Piolo Pascual, Angelika Dela Cruz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4252\"><strong>Marvin Agustin</strong></a>. Another young performer who dominated the drama soap serial was Claudine Barretto for her lead roles in consistent top-raters like <b><i>Mula sa Puso</i></b> (From the Heart), 1997-99, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/995\"><strong>Saan Ka Man Naroroon</strong></a></i></b> (Wherever You Are), 1999-2001, <b><i>Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan</i></b> (At Eternity&rsquo;s End), 2001-3, <b><i>Marina</i></b>, 2004, and <b><i>Iisa Pa Lamang</i></b> (Just One), 2008, all on ABS-CBN. Jolina Magdangal was typecast in light drama-comedy serials, such as <b><i>Labs Ko si Babe</i></b> (I Love Babe), 1999-2000, with love team partner Marvin Agustin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To this day, the story line of a young boy or girl separated from parents and raised amiably by kind adoptive relatives or strangers is exploited to the hilt by ABS-CBN as seen in <b><i>Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo</i></b><i> </i>(The Promise), 2000, a hit series that catapulted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4653\"><strong>Jericho Rosales</strong></a> and Kristine Hermosa into superstardom and made them famous in Asia and Africa, and would be remade in 2015 to showcase the career transition of Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo; <b><i>Minsan Lang Kita Iibigin</i></b><i> </i>(I Will Love You Only Once), 2011, which showed the promise of actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4536\"><strong>Coco Martin</strong></a>, who appeared in many independent films, as a mainstream star; <b><i>Walang Hanggan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>My Eternal</i></b>), 2012, a recreation of the blockbuster film <b><i>Hihintayin Kita sa Langit</i> </b>(I Will Wait for You in Heaven), which itself is based on Emily Bronte&rsquo;s <b><i>Wuthering <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5371\"><strong>Heights</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>topbilled by Richard Gomez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4748\"><strong>Dawn Zulueta</strong></a>; <b><i>Ina, Kapatid, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Mother, Sister, Daughter), 2012-13, which starred young sensation Kim Chiu; <b><i>Juan de la Cruz</i></b>,<i> </i>2013, an action-fantasy drama that sealed Martin&rsquo;s domination of the drama <b>teleserye</b> commonly achieved in the past by women actors;<i> </i>and<i> <b>Ikaw Lamang</b> </i>(No Greater Love),<i> </i>2014, which featured the already popular television actors Martin and Chiu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Telenovelas from Mexico and Spanish-speaking countries, chinovelas from Taiwan, and koreanovelas from Korea began flooding television programming beginning in the mid-1990s, local drama productions significantly shifted to the teleserye, a limited-run drama series. Major teleseryes came from ABS-CBN, GMA, and ABC 5. ABS-CBN produced teleseryes that became huge hits, like <b><i>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</i></b> (I Wish This Were Forever), 2003-4, about two star-crossed lovers who suffer from their parents&rsquo; long-forgotten sins; <b><i>Sa Piling Mo</i></b> (With You), 2006, about childhood friends who fall in love with each other; <b><i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i></b> (Whoever You May Be), 2006-7, about filial relationships among the elite and the poor;<b><i> Tayong Dalawa </i></b>(The Two of Us), 2009, about two brothers who joined the military; and <b><i>Be Careful with My Heart</i></b>, 2012-14, a daytime family-romantic comedy. Important GMA teleseryes include <b><i>Kung Mawawala Ka</i></b> (A World Without You), 2002-3, an epic political thriller and love story; <b><i>Amaya</i></b>, 2011-12, an epic series about precolonial Philippines; and <b><i>My Husband&rsquo;s Lover</i></b>, 2013, about gay relationships in contemporary Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, the Philippines has become a major producer of teleseryes, some of which have gained recognition from international award-giving bodies. <b><i>Lobo</i></b> (Werewolf), 2008, ABS-CBN, won the Rockie Award for the Telenovela in the BANFF World Television Festival in Canada in 2009. Teleseryes that were nominated in the International Emmy for the telenovela category were ABS-CBN&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahit Isang Saglit</i></b><i> </i><b>(</b>A Time for Us<b>), </b>2008, and <b><i>Dahil May Isang Ikaw </i></b>(Destined Hearts), 2009-10, and GMA&rsquo;s <b><i>Magdusa Ka </i></b>(You Suffer), 2008, and <b><i>My Husband&rsquo;s Lover</i></b>, 2013. <b><i>Eva Fonda</i></b>, 2008-9, ABS-CBN, was nominated as Best Drama Series at the Seoul International Drama Awards in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of these local drama soaps, serials, anthologies, and teleseryes, either for general audiences or geared toward the youth, exploited female stereotypes: &ldquo;the woman, martyr, <i>femme fatale</i>, as sacrificial lamb, as the faithful shadow, as the manipulator&rdquo; (Reyes 1991, 188). Their world revolves around the confines of the family. The themes lack the social context in which to situate their private and personal concerns, such as mother-daughter conflicts, sibling rivalry, extramarital affairs, teen delinquency, which all convey conventional images and orthodox representations of women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">TV dramas also drew critical attention from an observant public. Some praise the excitement in their ever-twisting narrative, saying that shows have become addictive and that to miss an episode would derail a viewer from the story&rsquo;s development. On the other hand, the confusing and convoluted plot is also a cause of irritation, with many chastising the implausibility of both turn of events and character transformation. Suspension of disbelief is not anymore reserved for fantasy but also applies to television dramas in which the <b>bida</b> (protagonist) possesses unusual kindness, even to the degree of stupidity, while the <b>kontrabida</b> (antagonist) demonstrates an incredible capacity to evade punishment and death. Drama shows also usually end with the spectacular kill-all-the-evil-antagonists that are the vehicle for the costly action genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first few years of the post-martial law period, however, progressive cultural workers engaged in television drama productions on top of their involvement with other media and art forms. Cecile Guidote-Alvarez resurrected the social realist drama anthology <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye) on PTV 4 beginning in 1987 and continues to this day with occasional runs of new episodes. Its stable of writers included Rolando Tinio, Dodi Anzures, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3329\"><strong>Ronaldo Tumbokon</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\"><strong>Lualhati Bautista</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2825\"><strong>Lito Casaje</strong></a>, Henry Nadong, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2833\"><strong>Mars Cavestany</strong></a>, while its pool of directors included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4884\"><strong>Nick Lizaso</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2757\"><strong>Jose Mari Avellana</strong></a>, Jose Gruta, Maryo J. de los Reyes, Orlando Nadres, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4766\"><strong>Lupita Aquino-Kashiwahara</strong></a></strong>. <b><i>Radyo Balintataw</i></b> (Radio Balintataw) continues to air daily on DZRH under a new format: a combination of drama, poetry, music, storytelling, and reports and commentaries on sociocultural issues. The Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) created <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> ng PETA</i></b> (An Offering of PETA), 1990-92, alternately directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\"><strong>Ishmael Bernal</strong></a>, Soxy Topacio, Joel Lamangan, Beth Mondragon, Beth Quindara, and Ellen Ongkeko. The anthology examined relevant sociopolitical issues that most drama programs of the period rarely or were afraid to tackle. From PETA also came <b><i>PETA-bisyon</i></b> (PETA Vision), 1993, PTV 4, then RPN 9 and ABC 5, which portrayed social issues that depicted the agency of characters and provided solutions that were grounded more realistically than the conventions of escapism that characterize the genre. <b><i>Dear Teacher</i></b>, 1991, Islands TV 13, presented the lives of teachers by not romanticizing their situation. Episodes of the weekly anthology were written by Chris B. Millado, Lualhati Bautista, Soxy Topacio, and Amado Lacuesta Jr, and directed by Ishmael Bernal, Gil Portes, and Rey Bato. Activist filmmaker Lino Brocka had his own <b><i>Lino Brocka Presents</i></b>, 1986, IBC 13, and <b><i>Sa Direksiyon ni Lino Brocka </i></b>(Under the Direction of Lino Brocka), 1990, GTV 4. Mario O&rsquo;Hara had <b><i>Hilda</i></b>, 1989, RPN 9, with co-director Soxy Topacio and writer Rusty Sangalang, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a></i></b>, IBC 13, with scriptwriter Lualhati Bautista. Joel Lamangan directed <b><i>Spotlight</i></b>, 1990-98, GMA, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4500\"><strong>Armando Lao</strong></a> and Frank Rivera. Armida Siguion-Reyna produced the drama special <b><i>Taghoy ng Dagat</i></b> (Lament of the Sea), 1993, written by Bibeth Orteza and directed by Jose Mari Avellana. The Task Force Detainees of the Philippines produced <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1470\"><strong>Melinda</strong></a></i></b>, 1995, GMA, directed by Joel Lamangan, written by Ricky Lee, about the rape of young student activists by the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These drama productions by progressive groups and individuals interrogated the status quo, presented more realistic and contextualized nuances of national social and political issues, conveyed clearly delineated personas of characters, introduced innovative narrative plots that either enriched or deviated from the conventions of the genre, critically examined networks of human relations, and offered progressive alternatives and potentials for a just and humane society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Significant socially oriented drama anthologies were also produced by commercial networks beginning in the 1990s. ABS-CBN came out with <b><i>Japayuki</i></b>, 1992-96, detailing the lives of Filipina entertainers in Japan, and <b><i>Mga Lihim ng Ermita</i></b> (The Secrets of Ermita), 1992-96, which explored the salacious nooks and crannies of an old district in an old city. The drama serial <b><i>Angkan</i> </b>(Clan), 1986-89, ABS-CBN, was epic in scope as it sought to dramatize in microcosm the lives of people in a sugar hacienda. GMA News TV came out with important drama serials like <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong></i></b> (The Politician), 2013, a drama about politicians in a Philippine town; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1517\"><strong>Titser</strong></a></i></b> (Teacher), 2013, a drama about the state of public education in the Philippines; and <b><i>Katipunan</i></b>, 2014, about the lives of ordinary Filipinos during the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"commercials\" name=\"commercials\"></a>Commercials </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A longtime component of programming and a crucial requirement of any successful show that has received significant popular and critical attention since the late 1980s are commercial advertisements. Commercials are the primary source of income that sustains TV and radio programs and also the measure of success of any show, with top-rating shows receiving more ads than less popular ones. In 1988, a San Miguel Corporation advertisement titled <b><i>Bilmoko</i></b><i> </i>(contraction of &ldquo;<i>ibili mo ako</i>&rdquo;<i> </i>or &ldquo;buy it for me&rdquo;) was criticized for portraying a materialistic woman who always asks her man so many things for herself. A Pepsi raffle of winning numbers written on the bottle cap once ignited public outrage and faced legal and governmental battles when it once picked a set of numbers which was placed in countless bottle caps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many ads received commendations, such as those of McDonald&rsquo;s which have continually featured specially or differently abled people tendering affectionate gestures to their loved ones. It has become a template of food and beverage advertisements in which happy moments are shared with the product as the indispensable element, from noodles to soda to fastfood. One lotion commercial funnily yet affirmatively portrayed two men in a relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"emerging\" name=\"emerging\"></a>Emerging Programs, Digital Technology, and Convergence </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New program types evolved during the post-martial law period, with some programs branching out to other media platforms or fusing multiple formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the mid-1980s, some television programs had radio counterparts. The popular children&rsquo;s program <b><i>Batibot </i></b>(Small but Strong), 1984-2000, produced by the Philippine Children&rsquo;s Television Foundation headed by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4772\"><strong>Lyca Benitez-Brown</strong></a></strong> and Feny de los Angeles-Bautista, had <b><i>Radyo Batibot</i></b> (Radio Batibot), a 30-minute daily radio version which began to air in the late 1980s until 2000 on DZAM, later called DZAR. <b><i>Woman Watch</i></b>, produced by the Women&rsquo;s Media Circle, 1986-94, PTV 4, hosted by Nikki Coseteng, also aired on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4825\"><strong>DZSR</strong></a> Sports Radio, 1985-86; PTV 4&rsquo;s Radyo ng Bayan, 1986-88; DWWW, 1988-90; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4816\"><strong>DWIZ</strong></a>, 1990-93.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mid-1980s and the 1990s saw radio stations utilizing programming software that simplified and hastened the creation of the radio station&rsquo;s daily playlist. For example, City Lite 88.3 utilized Selector, an imported software that enabled programmers to input pertinent data of certain songs into the computer, including their pace, tempo, and sound texture. The computer, in turn, took care of sorting out the songs and matching them based on their similarities. The result is a smooth flow in the transition of the songs contained in each playlist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s also signaled the advent of the Internet, which served as source for news, information, and updates on new music. Developments during the period include the use of mobile phones, which later took on functions to accommodate more media platforms. With these came free music-sharing sites, such as Napster and Limewire, as well as the iPod and MP3 players which enabled music enthusiasts to download music from the Web for free and input them into their gadgets for their personal consumption. This proved to be more of a threat to radio than a helpful tool, as FM radio was suddenly relegated to being a mere source of information for new music. This applies particularly to the young segment of the listening market, who are said to have switched to other music media. Apparently, music lost its place as the unique selling product of FM radio stations. Advertisers started looking for more innovative concepts in which they could invest their money, and were no longer settling for basic spot buys. Stations turned to events as their primary product, while radio spots became mere add-ons to publicize events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some radio stations have started to embrace the Internet and use it to their advantage by linking their company profiles into the Web and making them accessible not just to listeners but to their potential advertisers as well. These websites have links that grant access to the station&rsquo;s webcasts, and are used as add-ons in radio station sales departments&rsquo; advertising packages. Others took matters to the extreme by adopting unconventional program concepts or by completely overhauling their station&rsquo;s format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The turn of the 21st century witnessed advancements in technology and telecommunication facilities that facilitated the combination of media platforms. A new development is <b>teleradyo</b> (television radio), the merging of radio and television. A radio or a television program is simultaneously broadcast on radio and television. Broadcast stations also began tapping emerging technologies for their media platforms. They tapped into the Internet for more interactivity in their programs, allowing live streaming of some, if not yet all, of their terrestrial programs. Broadcast stations linked up with print organizations, sharing websites, and interactive platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most prominent genre of the period was reality television. The most popular reality show is the local franchise of the TV hit <b><i>Big Brother</i></b><i> </i>of Dutch company Endemol, titled <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother </i></b>(Filipino Big Brother), which premiered in 2002 and continues to run to this day, ABS-CBN. It presents the day-to-day life of individuals from different walks of life put together inside an Orwellian house. Each &ldquo;housemate,&rdquo; as a contestant is called, is expected to obey house rules and perform household chores and special tasks as instructed by Kuya, the unseen Big Brother who commands their attention. Housemates, either picked from auditions held all over the archipelago and from some parts of the world or handpicked by management, vie for their housemates&rsquo; acceptance and public approval as they vote who should remain inside the house. Nominations by Big Brother and the housemates are decided upon by viewers through text votes. The show had several editions, including ones with teens as housemates and one that housed already-known personalities. It received countless criticisms from televiewers concerning the proper conduct of its participants and has been meted disciplinary actions by the MTRCB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the 2000s, reality television has become the approach in both game and talent search programs. It is a format that puts contestants in real-life situations, awaiting their &ldquo;real&rdquo; reactions to challenges. Adventure series <b><i>Extra Challenge</i></b>, 2003-6, 2012-13, GMA, and <b><i>The Amazing Race Philippines</i></b>, 2012 and 2014, ABC 5, test the participants&rsquo; physical and psychological strength and endurance, from swimming to running and from haggling with vendors to knowing the local culture, in a variety of challenges held in different parts of the archipelago. A whole gamut of contests has also emerged in recent years. <b><i>Pinoy Fear Factor</i></b>, 2008-9, and <b><i>I Dare You</i></b>, 2011 and 2013, both on ABS-CBN, focus on participants overcoming their fears and inhibitions. <b><i>Junior Master Chef</i></b>, 2011-12, and <b><i>MasterChef Pinoy Edition</i></b>, 2012, both on ABS-CBN, test culinary skills and are also promoted to develop the food industry in the country. <b><i>The Biggest Loser</i></b>, 2011 and 2014, ABS-CBN, was launched to challenge the growing number of overweight people to lose weight and take care of their health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"televisual\" name=\"televisual\"></a>Televisual Power and Politics</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A corollary of tabloidization is the phenomenon of entertainment becoming news and news becoming entertainment or what others call &ldquo;infotainment&rdquo; where information is inextricably packaged with entertainment. Media becomes king and now sets the agenda in government policy and public discourse as public officials are forced to react and bow to what is reported and commented upon by big conglomerate media. Aggrieved persons report their grievances to television and radio stations in order to draw attention to their plight, testifying to the breakdown of governmental accountability and the haughty power of celebrated media personalities, themselves taking up certain causes against government officials. In this case, media, meant to be a neutral provider of information and arbiter of truth, becomes a political weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the mid-1980s, when media freedom was restored and there was an exponential growth in TV and radio appliance ownership, broadcast media&rsquo;s power has tremendously increased in the sociopolitical field. Programs formatted as complaints desk fortified the media&rsquo;s bargaining power. &ldquo;Hoy Gising!&rdquo; (Hey, Wake Up!), 1992-2001, a segment of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s flagship news program <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>Isumbong Mo kay Tulfo</i></b><i> </i>(Report It to Tulfo), 1991-2006 and 2012 to present, DWIZ, which also aired in 2010-12 on DZIQ, were two popular shows that helpless citizens approached for a range of problems, from erring government officials to public infrastructure. Their prodding and investigation of concerned public and private institutions compelled higher-ups to address the people&rsquo;s complaints, knowing that their actions would not be left unreported, thereby giving the public some form of welfare protection. But the way the programs&rsquo; hosts lambasted authorities without prior check on the nature of the complaint and the high-handed, even personal, treatment of each and every issue was rightly criticized. A more important concern not highlighted in the often sensational treatment of grievances is that institutional corrective mechanisms are not harnessed, reaching the hopeless point of begging the media to broadcast what should have been basic matters of citizen and consumer rights. Aptly described as &ldquo;media as messiah,&rdquo; mass media&rsquo;s image points come at the expense of the reputation of public institutions and amicable civic relations. Popular programs that followed this format are <b><i>Imbestigador</i></b> (Investigator), which has been running on GMA since 2000, hosted by Mike Enriquez, and <b><i>T3</i></b>, which premiered in 2011 on ABC 5, hosted by Tulfo brothers Ben, Raffy, and Erwin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most notable manifestation of mass media&rsquo;s power is the electoral success of some of its most notable personalities. The phenomenon is a testament to the drawing power of the television medium and has been taken as formula by a growing number of media personalities for their political ambitions. Regardless of whether they were thinking of a political career when they first set into jobs as reporters and hosts, it has made the broadcast media profession suspect as the media audience-citizen voters realize that those they watch and listen to are only out to exploit what used to be a respectable industry as a platform for political candidacy. Appallingly, media have been gradually used as a revolving door from and to politics. This puts into question the ethical practices of broadcast media personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A remarkable development in the operation of mass media is the coverage of impeachment trials of the country&rsquo;s leaders, most popularly Estrada in 2000-2001 and Chief Justice Renato Corona in 2012, and legislative hearings on the scandalous corruption and violence perpetrated by top government officials. It has become regular for media networks to air their coverage of such procedures, with the viewing public avidly following the progress of those cases. Media have also become an effective and staple vehicle for citizen mobilization during times of emergency. Coverage of investigative proceedings and philanthropic crusades has, in turn, been criticized for focusing on simplistic issues of personalities, weakness in the explanation of technical and legal processes and their wider social and historical implications, waning reportage when the issues drag on, and the opportunistic use of natural disasters for the station and its roster of reporters and showbiz stars&rsquo; popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The status of political reporting in the country is still reprehensible as it remains personality-based and is made more problematic by the personal ties of newspersons with government officials, if not being involved themselves in the bureaucracy prior to or after their service in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"language\" name=\"language\"></a>Language</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ascendancy of Tagalog-based Filipino in news broadcasting demonstrates the necessity of using a language more comprehensible to the widest audience possible in order to inform, to be patronized, and to earn. It also shows that English remains the language of the more educated and the upper class, a still tiny segment of the viewing and listening public. Serious and uppity business, global politics, talk, lifestyle, and investigative shows in English migrate to the networks&rsquo; secondary and/or cable channels catering to small niches of the Filipino audience. In spite of the claim that English can be a national and unifying language for Filipinos, the fact that the money-savvy entertainment divisions of media companies spend money on the Tagalog/Filipino language instruction of their upcoming stars, singers, and athletes in order to be accepted and gain following affirms the tenacity of Filipino and other local languages in the field of cultural production. Aside from imported telenovelas from Latin America, Taiwan, and Korea, a growing number of Hollywood movies and Japanese anime cartoons are also dubbed in Filipino and are shown in late morning, early afternoon, and late evening time slots. These shows are popular in public transportation terminals all throughout the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"transnationalization\" name=\"transnationalization\"></a>Transnationalization </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It has become a necessity for Philippine media networks to engage the transnational audience. Transnationalization began in the Marcos regime when crony companies had to tie up with foreign conglomerates because of the capital-intensive building of mass media and telecommunications infrastructures. Before, Filipino firms had to partner with big multinational corporations for financial capital and technological expertise. Now foreign companies have to affiliate with local firms in the target countries of broadcast, with the foreign firms paying them for the exclusive right to distribute popular and profitable Filipino shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, the transnational turn is spearheaded by the biggest television networks which largely aim to cater to the Filipino audience worldwide. ABS-CBN Global Limited&rsquo;s The Filipino Channel, formed in Sep 1994 and based in Redwood City, California, is the Lopez company&rsquo;s response to the ever-growing demand of overseas Filipinos for news on the Philippines and Filipino television and film productions. Through its partnership with DirectTV of the United States for the exclusive DTH (direct-to-home) distribution, the network is able to export ABS-CBN News, Cinema One films, and radio channel reports, and now has more than two million subscribers. GMA Pinoy TV, under GMA Worldwide Inc, broadcasts GMA shows to North America, East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Its most lucrative market is Southeast Asia where Filipino TV drama productions are avidly followed. TV5 Network Inc has formed Kapatid TV5 to distribute Kapatid TV and Aksyon TV shows to its clients in the United States, Middle East, North Africa, and Guam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Noteworthy about this development is that Filipino TV productions, which originally catered to Filipino viewers in host countries, have become popular with foreign audiences as well. The television drama <b><i>Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo</i></b> became a hit in Southeast Asia and East Africa, making its actors Jericho Rosales and Kristine Hermosa popular in these regions. Foreigners have come to admire the looks of Filipino performers, the themes and plots, and even the language itself, as shows were only given subtitles and not dubbed, unlike the showing of imported Latin and Asian telenovelas in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcasting has witnessed and chronicled the most important milestones in the history of the Philippines in the last century, particularly in the struggle of Filipinos against colonization, war, dictatorship, and natural and human-induced tragedies that had chanced upon each other in rapid succession. It has mirrored the various paths that Filipinos and Filipino cultures have taken and has served as a deep reservoir of the significant experiences shared by the country&rsquo;s diverse communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More than a reflection and a repository of the struggles and vision of a people, radio and television, in several instances, have been direct players in the people&rsquo;s journey toward the creation of a nation, as happened during the Japanese occupation, the revolt against the dictatorship of Marcos, and the condemnation of vertiginous political corruption that has jarred the foundations of the country&rsquo;s political institutions. The ravaging consequences of these sociopolitical tragedies continue to haunt the present. During these instances, radio and television have provided the people with a sense of a larger, common community and an imagination of a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio and television have contributed to the progress and maturation of Filipinos and their cultures, and to the way those cultures see themselves, particularly as expressed in the fields of popular culture and the practice of journalism. Perhaps, more than the political structure of the educational system, radio and television have been effective avenues for the spread of a common language among a people fragmented, yet connected, by diverse geographies, cultures, and tongues. Perhaps, more than the traditional transmitters of a culture&rsquo;s values, ideologies, and sentiments&mdash;such as the church, the state, the school, and the family&mdash;radio and television, almost throughout the 20th century, have provided the platform for the negotiation of changes and adjustments that cultures assume in the course of their movement in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As broadcast personalities continue to become household names, with some approaching the status of cultural icons, Philippine broadcasting at the beginning of the third millennium endures as a cultural force. While much of radio and television&rsquo;s form and substance is often criticized as Western, degraded and degrading, commercialized and debilitating, Filipinos have appropriated these broadcast platforms as their own. Both radio and television inform and entertain, articulate the values and attitudes of a people, move the nation to action when the situation demands them, interpret and transmit contemporary history, and afford their audiences a sense of connection to the rest of the nation and the world.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by Eulalio R.

Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was in Camp Aguinaldo and AFP Vice Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos was in Camp Crame when they broke away from Marcos, initiated by the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) led by Lt Col Gregorio Honasan on 22 Feb 1986. When Orly Punzalan declared in the afternoon of 24 Feb 1986, &#x201C;Channel 4 is back on the air to serve the people. Now, you will get the truth from this channel,&#x201D; it was very clear that ousting the dictatorship necessitated capturing the very medium of its propagation. Punzalan&#x2019;s statement was both a critique of the media of lies that was the convention during the time of Marcos and a reaffirmation of the responsibility to truth of the broadcast media. It was the ultimate successor to a series of memorable mass media audiovisual moments: Marcos&#x2019;s announcement of the imposition of martial law on television, radio, and print on 23 Sep 1972; the announcement of the breakaway from Marcos by Enrile and Ramos; and the four-day EDSA Revolt, which, in its climax, witnessed the TV blackout during Marcos&#x2019;s press conference and the near-simultaneous oath-taking of Marcos and Aquino as the country&#x2019;s president, and culminated on 25 Feb 1986 with Marcos, his family, and cronies fleeing the country."

Tussles between the government and private media companies ensued when the Aquino administration sequestered the broadcast companies Marcos snipped for his cronies. The new government took over broadcast networks RPN 9, IBC 13, and BBC 2, which dominated the industry in terms of local entertainment productions and was considered the top networks during the martial law years (Tolentino 1987). IBC 13 suffered the most from complicated legal matters; it became a <a href=\"/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> percent government-owned station in the 1990s by virtue of a compromise agreement between former owner Roberto Benedicto and the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Marcos&#x2019;s Maharlika Broadcasting System was renamed People&#x2019;s Television Network Channel 4, which, like Channel 9, continued operations but later suffered from the intensely competitive field of commercial broadcasting. The Lopezes recovered one station, Channel 2, and relaunched <a href=\"/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>. The company held a show, <b><i>Pagbabalik ng mga Bituin</i></b> (Return of the Stars), in Mar 1987 to signal its return to the media industry. ABS-CBN resumed broadcasting on 14 Sep 1986. The network, however, continued to struggle with the new government for nearly a decade over ownership of the station. GMA&#x2019;s triumvirate owners Gilberto M. Duavit Sr, <a href=\"/8/69/4845\"><strong>Felipe L. Gozon</strong></a>, and <strong><strong><a href=\"/8/69/4861\"><strong>Menardo R. Jimenez</strong></a></strong></strong> changed the network&#x2019;s name from Greater Manila Area Radio Television Arts to Global Media Arts, with the same acronym. Both ABS-CBN and GMA would lord it over in the ratings game, which defined the character of commercial broadcasting of the post-EDSA period. The Elizaldes continued the broadcast of their radio network, the Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>."

In 2005, the Supreme Court decided in favor of PWU, citing that a public affairs program such as that by Legarda is not exempt from review by the MTRCB. A number of episodes in 1992 of the weekly TV program <b><i>Iglesia ni Cristo</i></b> (INC, Church of Christ), produced by the INC, received an X rating from the MTRCB because of the program&#x2019;s criticisms of the veneration by Roman Catholics of the Virgin Mary. In 1994, the Supreme Court held MTRCB&#x2019;s X rating as a prior restraint on the freedom of religious speech. The MTRCB slapped several suspensions of varying durations on Willie Revillame, Randy Santiago, and John Estrada, hosts of the daily noontime show <b><i>Magandang Tanghali, Bayan</i></b> (Good Afternoon, Nation), 1998-2005, ABS-CBN, because of their sexist remarks and jokes. The show itself was suspended for one week in 2001 because of a similar offense, which led to the ouster of Revillame as host of the program. Eli Soriano&#x2019;s <b><i>Ang Dating Daan</i></b> (The Old Road) went off the air in 2004 when MTRCB suspended it for three months following complaints by INC ministers, who were the target of invectives by Soriano on national television. The Supreme Court affirmed MTRCB&#x2019;s decision, explaining that personal attacks on persons cannot be considered part of freedom of religious speech. The MTRCB also suspended the television documentary <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1447\"><strong>i-Witness</strong></a></i></b> for two weeks in 2006 because of its airing of the episode &#x201C;Lukayo: Hindi Ito Bastos&#x201D; (Lukayo: This Is Not Obscene), which is about <i>lukayo</i>, a wedding ritual involving old women dancing with wooden phalluses in the town of <a href=\"/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan in Laguna.

However, much caution was exercised by broadcast journalists as the country was still under a climate of censorship and control despite Marcos&#x2019;s lifting of martial law in 1981.

Most stations either strengthened their news programming or completely shifted from entertainment to news and public affairs. For example, DZRH, acknowledged as the pioneer of radio dramas and musical variety shows since its founding in 1939 until the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986, began focusing on news and public affairs. GMA&#x2019;s DZBB, which started as news, public affairs, and entertainment during its early broadcasts beginning in 1955 and focused on music and personality-oriented programs during the martial law period, reoriented its programming to news after the ouster of Marcos, relaunching DZBB as &#x201C;Radyo Bisig Bayan&#x201D; (Radio with the People) in 1989, then recast it as &#x201C;Super Radyo&#x201D; (Super Radio). ABS-CBN&#x2019;s DZMM brought back its pre-martial law type of news programming, revived <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> (Patrol Radio), which would dominate the airwaves during the early years of the Corazon Aquino administration. These stations expanded the running time of their major newscast programs both in the morning and in the early evening slots. Unlike in the 1960s until the early 1970s when announcers read news straight from newspaper articles, wire copies from local and foreign news agencies, and syndicated reports coming from the government-owned Philippine News Agency, the post-EDSA newscasts were enhanced with more voice clips, spot reports, and live or phone-patched interviews. Even the stations&#x2019; weather reports, which also used to be read from newspapers, were now coming straight from the weather agency Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Stations would call and put on-air interviews with PAGASA personnel for the weather updates, with some of the meteorologists eventually becoming regular announcers for these programs, such as Amado Pineda in the 1970s and the 1980s and Nathaniel &#x201C;Mang Tani&#x201D; Cruz in the 1990s and the 2000s for GMA&#x2019;s news programs.

The show became known for the heart-wrenching stories contestants tell to the public as they compete for prizes and the tremendous talents they exhibit on the worldwide stage. On 4 Feb 2006, a stampede unfortunately happened during its first anniversary celebration at the PhilSports Arena (formerly Ultra) in Pasig City. Seventy-three people died and 700 were injured in the fanatical gathering incited by the show itself. The network and the host were severely criticized for profiting millions through encouraging mendicancy. It ran until 2010 when it had serious conflicts with the public, shareholders, and the management after Revillame criticized the zealous coverage of the funeral of former president Corazon Aquino to the detriment of his show. The show resurrected as <b><i>Wil Time Big Time</i></b> on TV5 from Oct 2010 to Jan 2013 and as <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b><i> </i>(That&#x2019;s So Willy) from Jan to Oct 2013 when it suffered from poor ratings and eventually ceased programming, until GMA revived the show as <b><i>Wowowin</i></b>, 2015, in its Sunday late afternoon program slot. ABS-CBN made a few programs to fill the slot vacated by <b><i>Wowowee</i></b>, first with <b><i>Pilipinas Win na Win</i></b> (Philippines On the Win), 2010, hosted by Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla, and <b><i>Happy Yipee Yehey!</i></b>, 2011-12, emceed by Randy Santiago, John Estrada, Rico Puno, Toni Gonzaga, and Pokwang. The network moved <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i></b> from its prelunch time slot to challenge <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>&#x2019;s supremacy and offered serious challenge because of its more extensive talent search, fantastic production numbers, and the presence of more popular young personalities. Sometimes <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i></b> beats <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> in the ratings game with the popularity of its hosts and contests, although it remains to be proven whether a different variety show will be able to topple <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, which has been durable in terms of holding on to the Filipino audience worldwide. <b><i>Eat Bulaga! </i></b>also continues to innovate, with hit segments like &#x201C;Pinoy Henyo&#x201D; (Filipino Genius), &#x201C;All for Juan, Juan for All,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Kalye Serye with AlDub&#x201D; (Street Series with AlDub).

The program&#x2019;s lead stars, <a href=\"/8/69/4905\"><strong>Michael V.</strong></a> and <a href=\"/5/42/3860\"><strong>Ogie Alcasid</strong></a>, were pirated by GMA and led the cast of the sketch comedy show <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1419\"><strong>Bubble Gang</strong></a></i></b>, which premiered in 1995. The duo&#x2019;s comedic genius and its cast were utilized well in their new show as they made a succession of hilarious segments. Because it subjects almost anything popular to parody, the show has received criticisms on a number of issues such as its portrayal of women, rape, and the insensitive depiction of a special child. With 19 years and counting, <b><i>Bubble Gang</i></b> has surpassed the 10-year run of <b><i>T.O.D.A.S.</i></b> and the 17-year airing of <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), and ranks along with <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> (36 years counting) as one of the longest-running shows on Philippine television. A gag show that employed a cast of children, with the exception of the oldest and only adult in the show Dagul, was <b><i>Goin&#x2019; Bulilit</i></b><i> </i>(Goin&#x2019; Kiddie), 2005-15, ABS-CBN, directed by Edgar Mortiz. Patterned after <b><i>Goin&#x2019; Bananas</i></b>, in which Mortiz appeared as a mainstay, the show was not for children, with kids playing adult roles in various funny, but often not-fit-for-children, situations."

Audiences, however, did not receive well its sequel, <b><i>John en Shirley</i></b>, 2006-7, ABS-CBN, which featured two of the show&#x2019;s original cast, <a href=\"/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a> and Maricel Soriano. Dolphy made his presence felt further on TV in <b><i>Home along da <a href=\"/4/24/1272\"><strong>Riles</strong></a></i></b> (Home along the Railroad), 1992-2003, ABS-CBN, a title ripped off from the popular American movie <b><i>Home Alone</i></b>.

Directed by <a href=\"/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, written by <a href=\"/4/26/4631\"><strong>Jose Javier Reyes</strong></a>, and starring Joey Marquez, Richard Gomez, Miguel Rodriguez, Gloria Romero, Amy Perez, Carmina Villaroel, Arlene Muhlach, and Cynthia Patag, <b><i>Palibhasa</i> </b>showed the naughty foibles of guys out to play tricks on their family, girls, and the rest of the gang. It was known for showing veteran actor Romero as a neighborhood drunkard, the glass-breaking scream of singer Patag, the presence of sexy women as guests, mysterious hands outside the camera frame intruding into the scene, camera shots taken from unconventional angles, and the water douse at the end of the show. It was also one of the pioneers in modeling clothes that are worn by its stars and the guesting of public officials and media showbiz personalities. One memorable moment was the interview made by Korina Sanchez with agrarian reform secretary and presidential candidate Miriam Defensor-Santiago in the heady days of the 1992 presidential campaign. Santiago rebutted from the television studio Joey Marquez&#x2019;s simplistic view of women which he uttered while watching the Santiago interview. Santiago later on entered the program&#x2019;s studio &#x201C;house&#x201D; and mouthed her advocacies to the rest of the cast. The episode was considered one of the first forays of electoral candidates into the TV medium, which was also exploited by actor Marquez when he ran for a public post, and both the show and the politician-guest were criticized for using the broadcast media for electioneering. Prior to <b><i>Palibhasa </i></b>was <b><i>Chika Chika Chicks</i></b>,<i> </i>featuring the husband-and-wife characters of Freddie Webb and Nova Villa. Pirated from IBC 13&#x2019;s <b><i>Chicks to Chicks</i></b>, 1980-86, <b><i>Chika Chika Chicks</i></b> thematized the insecurities of an overweight wife who always rescues her husband from his shenanigans with sexy women. On the other hand, <b><i>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</i></b>, also from the director-writer tandem of Manahan and Javier Reyes, would be etched in Filipino popular memory for having Anjo Yllana play Dino Tengco, a gun-toting special child of corrupt politician Congressman Tengco (<strong><strong><a href=\"/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></strong>) and his pill-popping Imeldific wife Barbara (<a href=\"/8/69/4969\"><strong>Tessie Tomas</strong></a>).

On the other hand, the confusing and convoluted plot is also a cause of irritation, with many chastising the implausibility of both turn of events and character transformation. Suspension of disbelief is not anymore reserved for fantasy but also applies to television dramas in which the <b>bida</b> (protagonist) possesses unusual kindness, even to the degree of stupidity, while the <b>kontrabida</b> (antagonist) demonstrates an incredible capacity to evade punishment and death.

Episodes of the weekly anthology were written by Chris B. Millado, Lualhati Bautista, Soxy Topacio, and Amado Lacuesta Jr, and directed by Ishmael Bernal, Gil Portes, and Rey Bato. Activist filmmaker Lino Brocka had his own <b><i>Lino Brocka Presents</i></b>, 1986, IBC 13, and <b><i>Sa Direksiyon ni Lino Brocka </i></b>(Under the Direction of Lino Brocka), 1990, GTV 4.

Their prodding and investigation of concerned public and private institutions compelled higher-ups to address the people&#x2019;s complaints, knowing that their actions would not be left unreported, thereby giving the public some form of welfare protection. But the way the programs&#x2019; hosts lambasted authorities without prior check on the nature of the complaint and the high-handed, even personal, treatment of each and every issue was rightly criticized. A more important concern not highlighted in the often sensational treatment of grievances is that institutional corrective mechanisms are not harnessed, reaching the hopeless point of begging the media to broadcast what should have been basic matters of citizen and consumer rights. Aptly described as &#x201C;media as messiah,&#x201D; mass media&#x2019;s image points come at the expense of the reputation of public institutions and amicable civic relations.

Moreover, social realities experienced by the broadcasters and their audiences pervade radio and television shows, such as true-to-life events, religion, and legal cases. Furthermore, broadcasters and production staff, as well as the structure of programming, production designs and the conventions and practices of production, and the technological foundations of Philippine broadcasting are shaped by internal and external forces, such as the effects of radio and television on each other, and the impact of foreign broadcasting on the manner in which Filipino broadcasters craft Philippine radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Such sources and influences, and even appropriations as in the case of foreign broadcasting, do not occur singularly in each program, but combine and clash in the daily radio and television productions, often with imaginative results. For example, a character may be an amalgam of a mythical Filipino deity and fictional Western superhero, whose story is reinterpreted locally with a Filipino brand of folk fantasy, melodramatic narrative, or comedic satire. Neither are the influences and appropriations linear. Traditionally, the route of adaptation had been from a source like literature, to radio, to film, and then television. In recent decades, the path of adaptation has taken any course and even simultaneously. All these as broadcast technologies and production methods change, and as Filipino social realities and experiences evolve and shift.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"folklore\" name=\"folklore\"></a>Folklore and Literature</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folklore, as a body of indigenous knowledge, is so deeply intertwined with daily life that it predictably influences any permutation of mass and popular culture, both relatively recent phenomena. While there are economic and political factors at play in the broadcast industry, popular media, such as radio and television, to a certain extent inherently embody and articulate the aspirations of common folk, as it &ldquo;indiscriminately absorb[s] all folk themes, both rural and urban, then feed[s] them back to millions of audiences in a mass cultural feedback&rdquo; (Lopez 2006, 66).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk literature, such as riddles, myths, legends, and tales, and other literary forms, such as epics, novels, short stories, and poetic forms, permeate radio and television in varied ways. These include the straightforward adaptation of content, such as the eponymous radio drama featuring the stories in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1471\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Basyang</strong></i></b><i> </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Grandma Basyang); the recurrence of tropes and archetypes, as in the prevalence of melodrama and Maria Clara&ndash;type characters in modern soap operas; the influence in format, such as the serial radio drama in the heels of serialized novels in popular magazines; and the continuation of a broader folk sensibility, as in the humorous, didactic spirit of numbskull tales featuring Juan Tamad (Lazy Juan), still evident in the heroes of 1990s sitcoms like <b><i>Home along da <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1272\"><strong>Riles</strong></a></i></b> (Home along the Railroad).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is a symbiotic relationship. Beginning in the 1950s with the introduction of television to Filipino homes and radio&rsquo;s growing popularity, mass media became instrumental in the preservation of folklore and literature in the popular imaginary. In some ways, this development is but an extension of folklore&rsquo;s characteristic orality. In 1959, when then president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong></a> facilitated the donation of a few thousand transistor radios to the barrios, they became a &ldquo;towering presence&rdquo; in areas where the only method of transmitting information was by word of mouth (Fernandez 1981, 35). This phenomenon would further evolve in the coming decades with the advent of urbanization, on the one hand, and mobile technology and the Internet, on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest known foray of literature into the broadcast medium was in the 1950s, with DZPI&rsquo;s child-oriented <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/612\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</strong></a></strong></i></b>, based on the eponymous stories by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a> which first appeared in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> magazine in the 1920s. The show&rsquo;s success has been attributed to the intimacy that it created, how it &ldquo;encapsulated not only society&rsquo;s [oral] mode of retelling but stressed the importance of the narrator&rdquo; (Reyes 2005, 47). The titular character has since been immortalized in the popular imagination, the image of &ldquo;an old bespectacled woman wearing her native saya seated in her silyon (a native chair), surrounded by her grandchildren&rdquo; (Reyes 2009, 402). The retellings popularized numerous folk narratives such as &ldquo;Maryang Makiling,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a> na Naging Prinsesa&rdquo; (The Mountain Lass Who Became a Princess), and &ldquo;Ang Sirena sa Uli-Uli ng Pasig&rdquo; (The Mermaid at the Eddy of Pasig). A 2007 television update on GMA 7 features Lola Basyang&rsquo;s strong-willed granddaughter, played by Manilyn Reynes, traveling with a mobile library van to share what by then were &ldquo;classic&rdquo; tales by her grandmother.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also in the 1950s, the DZRH radio horror drama <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> (Night of Terror) began to appropriate figures from folk mythology, often rendering them as malevolent creatures of the dark. However, the negative portrayal, which endures to this day, continued the successful demonization of indigenous lore by the propagators of the new Catholic faith. In the 1980s, with urban folk&rsquo;s experience of unbridled urbanization and attendant terrors like crime and grinding poverty, the horror mode became all the more germane, seen in the weekly GMA horror serial <b><i>Regal Shockers</i></b>, 1985-91; the highly anticipated annual All Souls&rsquo; Day specials of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Magandang Gabi, Bayan</i></b> (Good Evening, Nation), 1988-2005; and the weekly quasi-investigative shows featuring paranormal stories like <b><i>Verum Est: Totoo Ba Ito?</i></b> (Verum Est: Is This True?) 2001, and <b><i>Misteryo </i></b>(Mystery), 2009. While urban legends still spread through word of mouth, the transmission is accelerated by something as pervasive as television and radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fantasy genre offered more positive renditions of the same source material, as in the primetime sitcom <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!), 1987-89, IBC 13, 1989-95, ABS-CBN, and 1995-97, GMA. The show followed the marriage of mortal Enteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) and the &ldquo;fairy&rdquo; Faye (Alice Dixson). While the two &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; could be seen as a stand-in for social classes and there was unmistakable Western influence in the construction of the magical beings, they were nevertheless imbued with divine qualities, hewing close to their indigenous origins. The GMA 7 series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1436\"><strong>Encantadia</strong></a> </i></b>(Fairyland), 2005, expanded this canvas with an enchanted realm divided into four kingdoms where lived different mythical entities. The Cebuano radio series <b><i>Mga Asoy ni Teban ug Goliat</i></b> (Stories of Teban and Goliat), DHYP (Radio Mindanao Network Cebu), starring the comedy duo Julian Bacus &ldquo;Teban&rdquo; Daan and Allan &ldquo;Goliat&rdquo; Nacorda, mixed comedy with fantasy and often drew on Visayan folkloric creatures. Daan and Nacorda are also known for their popular comedy skits &ldquo;Mga Pakatawa ni Teban ug Goliat&rdquo; (The Jokes of Teban and Goliat), some of which use humorous wordplays and folk beliefs. In one in which a character&rsquo;s mental illness is attributed to spirits, the phonemic difference between &ldquo;<i>gitiawan</i>&rdquo; (played a joke on) and &ldquo;<i>gitinuod</i>&rdquo; (taken seriously) is the source of the humor. Another AM radio series is <b><i>Mutya sa Saging Minantikan</i></b> (Jewel of Banana Fritter), about Maria&rsquo;s amulet extracted from a banana bud. The success of these radio programs spawned the hit television series <b><i>Si Goot da Wanderpol</i></b> (Goat the Wonderful) in the 1990s. Produced by Marcos Sacol, the picaresque featured Teban and Goliat who look after a magical goat that defecates gold coins, a local spin on a Western fairy tale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This indigenous precolonial world captured in the country&rsquo;s epics is the inspiration behind the so-called <b>epic-serye</b> <b><i>Amaya</i></b>, 2011-12, which followed the titular character as a princess and <i>binukot</i> (kept maiden) who, through a series of events, became an <i>uripon</i> (slave), a <i>baybayin</i> (ancient Philippine script) teacher in exile, and eventually a warrior leader who helped save from tyrannical rule an unnamed kingdom in Central Visayas. To a certain extent, some of the tropes used in the series, like the fall from grace and the drawn-out quest for revenge, are soap opera staples, but the show&rsquo;s world admirably drew on indigenous lore, in particular on social order, cosmology, and even Visayan epic conventions. Amaya&rsquo;s sequel <b><i>Indio </i></b>(Christianized Native), 2013, which opened with the death of Amaya and followed her demigod son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>, continued the use of epic tropes, this time set against the backdrop of oppressive Spanish colonization. Adopted by an abusive encomendero, Malaya was renamed Simeon, an undisguised nod to <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Subversion), 1891.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Programs designed for children are another popular platform for this material. The individual episodes of the children&rsquo;s show <b><i>Hiraya</i></b> <b><i>Manawari</i></b> (Reaching <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>&rsquo;s Dreams), 1995-2003, ABS-CBN, revolve around one value, like self-discipline or humility, sometimes dramatized through journeys to mystical lands populated by magical creatures. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4268\"><strong>Carlo Aquino</strong></a> starrer <b><i>Pahina</i></b> (Pages), 2000-2001, was a weekly drama anthology that features and dramatizes noted Filipino literary works that also promoted values necessary in the character development of the youth. Finally, the weekly anthology <b><i>Ang Mahiwagang Baul</i></b> (The Enchanted Chest), 2005-7, showcased Philippine myths, legends, and folklore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Short stories and novels also became material for television dramas early on. Some of the most notable episodes of ABC Channel 5&rsquo;s drama anthology <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye) in the 1960s were &ldquo;Isang Gabi ng Tagsibol&rdquo; (A Night in Spring); Alberto Florentino&rsquo;s adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\"><strong>Nick Joaquin</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/167\"><strong>May Day Eve</strong></a>;&rdquo; &ldquo;Kabalyerong Tanso&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/545\"><strong>Fake</strong></a> Knight), based on Wilfrido Nolledo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rice Wine;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kudyapi&rdquo; (Two-Stringed Lute), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>&rsquo;s adaptation of Bienvenido Santos&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Day the Dancers Came.&rdquo; Featuring productions of the Philippine Educational Theater Association, the program&rsquo;s directors include stalwarts such as Brocka, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4598\"><strong>Elwood Perez</strong></a></strong></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4462\"><strong>Joey Gosiengfiao</strong></a>. RPN 9&rsquo;s <b><i>Malayo Pa ang Umaga</i></b> (The Morn Is Yet So Far), 1979, is based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5400\"><strong>Stevan Javellana</strong></a>&rsquo;s World War II novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1829\"><strong>Without Seeing the Dawn</strong></a></i></b>, 1947. Produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>, it is the first known miniseries on Philippine television, the precursor to the telenovela format in the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In terms of form, a radio program in 1934 featured the form of the <b>balagtasan</b>, a poetic exchange or joust on a social issue. Interrupted by World War II, it returned in the 1950s on DZRH, hosted by the poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5045\"><strong>Emilio Mar Antonio</strong></a>. Every Sunday, he engaged a guest poet in a debate in Tagalog verse on the burning issue of the day, such as divorce or statehood for the Philippines under the United States. The format of other forms of folk poetry, like riddles and proverbs, have today evolved into fodder for jokes in sketch comedies like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1419\"><strong>Bubble Gang</strong></a></i></b>, which also pioneered a segment on &ldquo;fliptop,&rdquo; the modern, if raunchy and less socially relevant, incarnation of the balagtasan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The format of the radio drama and, eventually, telenovelas, also follows a literary form, in particular the serialized novels in the massively popular chain of Liwayway Publications that flourished in the decades leading to World War II. These include the Tagalog <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, 1922; the Cebuano <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a></i></b>, 1930; the Ilocano <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5087\"><strong>Bannawag</strong></a></i></b>, 1934; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a></i></b>, 1934. Sometimes criticized for being lowbrow (especially vis-&agrave;-vis English publications), the stories, from melodramas to sitcoms and satires, nevertheless played a key role in cultivating a popular appetite for literature and in shaping popular sensibilities. The first postwar soap is Liwayway Arceo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (Light of the Home), which aired on DZRH in Mar 1949, followed shortly by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a> </i></b>(Wheel of Fate), also on DZRH. The daily 15-minute programs chronicled the highs and lows in the life of ordinary Filipino families. Other notable ones include Fundador Soriano&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday) and <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, which first aired in Cebu radio and translated to Tagalog in the late 1970s. <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b> also became the pioneer daily serialized drama on television in 1977, which aired on BBC 2 from 1977 to 1985. Soon, <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> was also adapted to television, which ran from 1979 to 1984 with Janice de Belen in the title role. These pioneers would be revisited in recent times, occasionally remade with a more contemporary twist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from formal similarities with serialized novels, soap operas routinely resound with characteristics that are directly traceable to centuries-old literary forms like metrical romances, such as <i>awit</i> or <i>korido</i>. These include conventions, such as the emotional intensity of Balagtas&rsquo;s lyric poems manifesting as pervasive melodrama, or the ubiquitous archetype of the perpetually martyred and suffering woman. His <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> at Laura</i></b> (Florante and Laura) had utilized emotion between the titular lovers to unpack its themes. As an element, melodrama has remained a staple in radio and television, from the pioneering radio counseling drama <b><i>Ito ang Inyong Tiya Dely</i></b> (This Is Your Aunt Dely) in the 1950s to the long-running television drama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4942\"><strong>Coney Reyes</strong></a> on Camera</i></b> in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The satirical spirit of folktales, often humorous accounts that are also oblique social commentaries, finds echoes in modern satirical comedies, including the pioneering radio show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), which first aired in 1938 and became widely popular in the 1950s and 1960s. In the same way that the numbskull tales featuring Juan Tamad cautions against laziness, <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> spoofed Filipino manners, politics, customs, and government officials. Conceptualized by Horacio de la Costa and James Reuter, who would both become Jesuit priests, the show&rsquo;s format was successfully replicated in provincial stations and, in the 1960s, as a television sitcom on ABS-CBN Channel 3. Other notable satires are <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>, 1987-89, IBC 13, which parodied social issues in the format of a news program; the sitcom <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1401\"><strong>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</strong></a></i></b> (Watch for the Next Chapter), 1991-97, ABS-CBN, which poked fun at social stratification with stock characters from politics and normal folk; and <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>, 1990-91 and 1993-95, RPN, which used the &ldquo;grill-and-roast&rdquo; interview format to make fun of politicians and personalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The trickster trope also survives. Some of the exploits of Kevin Kosme (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>), the protagonist of family-oriented sitcom <b><i>Home along da Riles</i></b>, render him as a trickster hero in the tradition of Juan Pusong. A regular source of humor are Kevin&rsquo;s often successful attempts to outsmart or trick someone in a position of power, from his rich and devoted admirer Ason (Nova Villa) to his boss Steve (<strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2791\"><strong>Bernardo Bernardo</strong></a></strong></strong></strong>) and the neighborhood <i>sari-sari</i> (variety) store owner Tomas (Tommy Angeles).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The influence of folklore and literature on radio and television is sometimes direct, as in adaptations of legends and short stories, and sometimes more oblique, in terms of a broader folk sensibility. That many urban legends still feature entities from Philippine lower mythology prove the survival of the folk literary tradition and the folk memory despite the shift in milieu. Even folk poetry, such as riddles and proverbs, continue to find modern incarnations, such as in jokes and punch lines commonly heard in the stingers of so-called masa radio stations and recurring gags in television comedies. There is little doubt that this intimate link will persist in the years, perhaps decades, ahead.<em><strong>Written by Glenn Diaz w</strong> </em><em><strong>ith notes from Julian dela Cerna and John Bengan</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"theater\" name=\"theater\"></a>Theater</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Long before the advent of radio in the 1920s and television in the 1950s, Filipino audiences of different classes had enjoyed what were then the only sources of public entertainment: the Spanish-influenced <i>komedya</i>, <i>sinakulo</i>, <i>sarsuwela</i>, and <i>drama</i>; and the American-influenced <i>bodabil</i>. Through theater directors, artists, producers, and even technicians who were hired to work in the new broadcast media, the themes, characters, plots, and even style of performance and production design of these Filipino dramatic genres survived the onslaught of the new media, precisely by migrating to and taking root in the electronic media of radio and television themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The centuries-old komedya, which flourished in the 19th century and declined in the 20th, revolved around themes of love and war between royal characters in the kingdoms of medieval Europe (like Espa&ntilde;a, Francia, Alemania, Italia) and the Middle East (like Persia, Turkiya, Arabia, and Marruecos). Taking their stories from the orally transmitted or printed verse narratives called awit and korido, the komedya developed a production style marked by a stylized delivery of verse dialogue, choreographed fighting, and magical effects. Cristianos and Moros were characterized as heroes and villains, respectively, and identified as such by their marches, acting style, and costumes (dark colors for Christians, red for Moors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the komedya tradition derived the stories of Severino Reyes, which were serialized more than once on radio and television as <b><i>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</i></b> (Stories of Grandma Basyang); as well as the episodes of royal fantasy in radio serial dramas like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1489\"><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong></a></i></b> (Prince Amante) and <b><i>Zimatar</i></b>, and stories of magical swords as in the television series <b><i>Juan dela Cruz</i></b>. On both radio and television, the characters of the ailing father/king, the young, kindhearted prince, the princess in distress, the jealous or conspiring courtiers, the irreverent but delightful trickster, and the old <i>ermitanyo</i> (hermit) who turns out to be Christ or a person with powers, replicate the komedya&rsquo;s own dramatis personae. Scenes of swordplay, tournaments for the hand of a princess, and royal romance that ends in a royal wedding are also straight out of the komedya, although the influence of children&rsquo;s stories and films about royal characters from the West cannot be discounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sinakulo or passion play began as a dramatization of the <i>pasyon</i>, the verse narrative of the story of Christian salvation, from genesis to the coronation of the Virgin Mary in heaven, with particular emphasis on the sufferings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. As the pasyon is chanted on the Sundays of Lent and all throughout Holy Week, so the sinakulo may be performed anytime in Lent, but especially during Holy Week. If the Christians and Moors are the <b>bida</b> (heroes) and <b>kontrabida</b> (villains) respectively in the komedya, in the sinakulo the bida are the <i>banal</i> or holy people, including Christ, the Virgin and their followers, while the kontrabida are the <i>hudyo</i>, the generic name applied to all who persecuted Christ whether Jews or Romans. While the banal are meek and gentle, the hudyo are pompous and violent, as further emphasized by their respective styles of chanting, acting, and marches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sinakulo theme of the oppression and eventual triumph of the underdog, as well as the characters of the virtuous but destitute hero, the ever-suffering and maudlin mother, the repentant vamp, the hard-hearted traitor, is very much evident not only in Lenten presentations like <b><i>Kalbaryo ni Hesus</i></b> (Calvary of Jesus) on radio but also in regular radio dramas like <b><i>True Confessions </i></b>and <b><i>Lumipas na Madaling Araw</i></b> (Forgotten Morn) and in telenovelas like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1469\"><strong>May Bukas Pa</strong></a></i></b> (There&rsquo;s Still Tomorrow) and <b><i>Nathaniel</i></b>. In fact, even scripts supposedly based on &ldquo;real stories&rdquo; of letter writers, as in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a></i></b> (Will You Remember) and <b><i>Magpakailanman</i></b> (Forever) on television, tend to pattern their characters after those of the sinakulo, and to conclude their stories with moralistic themes that assure audiences that those who suffer shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Introduced by Spanish troupes in the 19th century, the drama and sarsuwela, as written by Filipinos from the 1900s to the 1940s, presented issues, characters, and stories, no longer from foreign narratives like the komedya and sinakulo but from contemporary Philippine society. The drama and sarsuwela are two different dramatic genres&mdash;the first is a straight play in prose, while the second is a prose play with songs and dances&mdash;but they pursue identical or at least similar sociocultural themes, like the conflict between the rich and the poor in love and business, the colonial mentality of Filipinos, the corruption of politicians, vote-buying during elections, cockfighting and other vices, infidelity of husband or wife, divorce, social climbing, and misunderstandings between parents and children. Such themes may be treated in comic or satirical fashion in the <i>drama comico</i> or sarsuwela, or in tragic mode in the melodrama, also called <i>drama tragico</i>. Characters in the drama and sarsuwela are based on real social types (politicians, gamblers, peasants, workers, parents, children, lovers), but they are so idealized that they may also be categorized as bida and kontrabida. Heroes and heroines as well as villains and vixens are identified as such by their costumes and makeup, style of acting and dialogue delivery, and types of songs. So are the witty servant-comedians. Lastly, drama and sarsuwela most commonly have plots whose conflicts are resolved gratuitously by coincidences and other dei ex machina and whose narrative closure must always affirm the political, social, and moral values of the ruling establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The black-and-white characters (the bida who sacrifice everything for love of parents and partners and the kontrabida who connive at every point to take what is not rightfully theirs), the stylized manner of speaking (soft vs harsh) and acting (gentle vs violent), the stereotyped costume design (prettily conservative for heroes and heroines and modish and daring for villains and villainesses), the manipulated plots (sworn enemies turn out to be brothers or sisters after all) and coincidences (the villain accidentally falls into a cliff during a fight), and the reconciliatory endings of the drama and sarsuwela (the rich and the poor marry each other in the end) are very much alive and evident in radio dramas like <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b> (Wheel of Fate), <b><i>24 Oras</i></b> (24 Hours), <b><i>Habang May Buhay</i></b> (While There Is Life) and television dramas like <b><i>Mga Kuwento ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Stories of Love). They are also found in drama episodes of weekly radio shows like <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b> and <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday), as well as in the seasons-long telenovelas like <b><i>Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo</i></b> (<b><i>The Promise</i></b>), <b><i>Tayong Dalawa</i></b> (The Two of Us), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1466\"><strong>Mara Clara</strong></a></i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Introduced from the USA in the 1920s, bodabil was a variety show that combined solo, duo, or trio singing, pair or chorus dancing, comedy skits, magician tricks, and even animal acts in a wildly entertaining performance, usually alternating with the screening of local or foreign movies in theaters. Although bodabil drew heavily from American popular culture, bodabil artists managed to indigenize the form through the use of topical or issue-based humor, local adaptations of American songs, locally conceptualized production numbers, local variations or modifications of foreign dances and costumes, popularization of local counterparts of foreign singers, and creation of original Filipino songs using the musical template of American pop songs. The bodabil stage trained and built up some of the most famous singers, dancers, and comedians who, because of their popularity and talent, were sought out by the first producers and writers in broadcast media, who in many cases also had roots in or were exposed to bodabil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On radio, the bodabil traditions are found in the variety shows like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>The San Miguel Brewery Hour</i></b>, and even in famous song competitions like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage), especially because these are hosted by former bodabil performers. On the other hand, bodabil humor, dancing, and even magical acts were carried over into television by shows like <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b> (Happy Hour), <b><i>Showbiz with the Salvadors</i></b>, and <b><i>Germspesyal</i></b>. <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b> (Actor&rsquo;s Life) became famous for its opening numbers where Dolphy and Panchito transliterate English songs into Tagalog with hilarious results. Other bodabil-type TV shows are the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>VIP</i></b> or <b><i>Vilma in Person</i></b>, <b><i>Loveli-ness</i></b>, and <b><i>Superstar</i></b>, which showcase not only the dancing and singing talents of their stars but create production numbers with lavish costumes and sets like those in bodabil. Descended from both the drama comico and the bodabil or stage show are the situation comedies or sitcoms, like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a></i></b> (John and Marsha), <b><i>Home along da Riles</i></b> (Home along the Railroad), <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, and <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b> (School Bumps) where humor comes from play on words, mistaken identities, and wacky characters like a moralizing mother-in-law, a gay antagonist, a goofy man-child, a crusty old teacher, and a band of ne&rsquo;er-do-well students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All in all, the influence of traditional theater on radio and television may be seen in the following aspects of script and production: the division of idealized characters into bida and kontrabida, with their corresponding styles of acting, speaking, and dressing; the chronologically arranged plots with highly colorful events whose conflicts are resolved by extrinsic forces and end by affirming the validity of the establishment&rsquo;s beliefs and values; a directorial style that merely strings together episodes and veers away from innovation or radical change; photography work where the camera is a recorder and rarely an interpreter of scenes being shot; and editing that is invisible, leisurely, and predictable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the radio and television mainstream shows continue to use and propagate the practices of traditional theater to this date, a few artists, mostly associated with theater and film, have produced a few programs on television that were influenced by another type of theater that came into the country after World War II. Through literature classes, the younger generation of directors in the 1960s and 1970s encountered modernism in the plays of European playwrights like Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg and American writers like Arthur Miller and Tennessee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s. Writing in the mode of realism favored by these foreign playwrights, Filipino writers like Nick Joaquin, Alberto Florentino, and Nestor Torre Jr wrote plays in English which were translated into Filipino and produced for television in shows like <b><i>Balintataw</i></b>. Later, film directors trained in literature and theater directed drama anthologies with realistic plots and characters, such as <b><i>Hilda</i></b>, <b><i>Lino Brocka Presents</i></b>, and <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b>. In these productions, realism permeates the choice of costumes, sets, and, most of all, the internalized acting which gives life to highly individualized characters. Because such stories usually had endings that were often open-ended or downright tragic, TV producers have avoided such narratives, preferring the feel-good, if unrealistic and escapist, closures typical of traditional theater.<em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

Adapted from the English illustrated comics, the Filipino komiks is magazine in format. Published weekly, each issue is composed of 5-10 illustrated stories framed in panels arranged in chronological sequences. Each story covers at least four pages. A story can be a serial, which may run for over a year. Some stories are <i>wakasan</i> in format; they begin and end in one installment. Elements such as narrative flow, scenes, temporal settings, characters, emotions, thoughts, dialogues, and sound effects are presented in framed illustrations, balloons, panels or captions. The comic strip, on the other hand, is a single-tier panel of a vignette of life that is regularly published in the entertainment or editorial section of a daily broadsheet or tabloid, or in its weekend edition or magazine supplement. The comic strip is often a brief and humorous commentary on current issues or morals or a caricature of personalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The comic strip is a preferred source of material for the comedy in Philippine broadcast. Komiks materials, especially adventure-fantasy and the melodramatic love story, are borrowed often by film and sometimes by radio, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, and then adapted for television beginning in the late 1970s. Some adventure-fantasy stories from komiks are turned into animation productions, specifically in the 1980s. The turn of the 21st century saw some komiks materials and foreign graphic novels being directly adapted for television and, more recently, into independent productions, mainly in digital animation, that are primarily circulated in emerging media platforms, such as the Internet, personal blog sites, and social media. In the 20th century, adaptations of komiks followed a more or less predictable route: from komiks to radio, to film, and finally television. Radio was a testing ground for the acceptability of komiks characters and narratives on the big screen. Once tested, many such characters and narratives are reproduced for the small screen. Since the late 1990s, the sequence has become unpredictable. For example, some komiks characters and stories have been adapted straight into television, bypassing radio and film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the early komiks characters was illustrated by Jose Zabala Santos and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\"><strong>Francisco Reyes</strong></a> for the 1955 Purico advertisement of the Philippine Manufacturing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (now Procter &amp; Gamble). They produced <b><i>Juan Tamad </i></b>(Lazy Juan), a six-minute 35 mm film intended for TV, but it was never aired. Juan Tamad was used as part of a political satire on TV in the 1960s until the declaration of martial law in 1972, on Channel 13. It was resurrected in 1979 on GTV 4, both of which were directed by now National Artist for film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>, who also portrayed the legendary lazybones hero&mdash;a caricature of the Filipino&mdash;with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a> and Aurora Salve.

The cartoon strip, on the other hand, was based on the comic strip <b><i>Pytik</i></b>, which Marcelo, while a student, created for <b><i>The Advocate</i></b>, the student paper of Far Eastern University. It is a social satire on the beatnik culture of the restless urban youth of the 1960s. <b><i>Tisoy</i></b> was turned into a movie, first in 1979, directed by Lauro Pacheco, and then in 1977, directed by now National Artist for film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\"><strong>Ishmael Bernal</strong></a>. <b><i>Baltic &amp; Co.</i></b>, 1974-76, GMA 7, starring Nanding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> as Baltic, who was later replaced by Prospero Luna, then by Bert Marcelo, and directed by Ricky Manalo, was from Roni Santiago&rsquo;s cartoon strip that started to appear daily in the<i> <b>Manila Bulletin</b></i> in the 1970s and continues until the present.

The main reason for the late and intermittent exploration of the genre on television was the lack of broadcast technology and facilities, combined with the prohibitive cost of producing a program in this genre. Notable examples are the classic komiks superhero characters created by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\"><strong>Mars Ravelo</strong></a>, especially <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong>, Varga, Kapitan Boom, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><strong>Dyesebel</strong></a>, Captain Barbell, and Lastikman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Darna</i></b>, a <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b> serial on the exploits of a titular flying wonder woman character created in 1950 and illustrated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3732\"><strong>Nestor Redondo</strong></a>, for<b><i> Pilipino Komiks</i></b>, was turned into a TV series in 1977 on RPN 9 starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4703\"><strong>Lorna Tolentino</strong></a>, in 2005 on GMA 7 starring Angel Locsin, and in 2009-10, again on GMA 7, starring Marian Rivera. The character of Darna also made cameo appearances in a series of Toyota Tamaraw FX television commercials in 1993, played by Anjanette Abayari, Alma Concepcion, and Daisy Reyes, and in the dream sequence of the 2010 drama series <b><i>Trudis Liit</i></b> (Small Trudis), with Jillian Ward portraying the roles of the child character and the child Darna defeating the snake-headed villain Valentina. Before TV, <b><i>Darna</i></b> was made several times into a movie, the first of which was as early as 1951 starring Rosa del Rosario and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Sr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The character Darna was a reconceptualization of an earlier komiks character, Varga, also by Ravelo, that first appeared in <b><i>Bulaklak Magazine</i></b> in 1947. Varga made her first TV appearance in a cameo role, portrayed by Mariel Rodriguez, in <b><i>Kapitan Boom</i></b> (Captain Boom), 2008, ABS-CBN 2. <b><i>Varga</i></b> was made as a TV series by ABS-CBN 2 immediately following the run of <b><i>Kapitan Boom</i></b> in Aug 2008, with the character portrayed again by Rodriguez. Varga is like Darna, but unlike Darna whose human alter ego is a person with disability, Varga is already a human possessing superhero qualities, including the ability to fly, which she would only find out later in her life. Ravelo&rsquo;s fumbling hero Kapitan Boom, on the other hand, first appeared in <b><i>United Komiks</i></b> in 1966, and the character in the 2008 TV series was played by Bench model Jon Avila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, the story of a mermaid, illustrated by Elpidio E.

It was produced by GMA 7 in 2008 starring Marian Rivera and by ABS-CBN 2 in 2014 starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4358\"><strong>Anne Curtis</strong></a>. Before all these, Premiere Productions first popularized the comics mermaid in <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, 1953, a film directed by Gerardo de Leon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Captain Barbell, a muscular hero whose alter ego is a lanky and asthmatic person, appeared in <b><i>Pinoy</i> <i>Komiks</i></b>, 1963-65, and in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, 1966, both illustrated by Jim Fernandez; in <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>, 1985-86, illustrated by Clem Rivera; and in the online fan-comics <b><i>Digmaan</i></b> (War), 2005, recreated and illustrated by Gilbert Monsanto. Captain Barbell first appeared on television in a cameo role in the final episode of <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 2005, GMA 7. The character then had his own series in 2006-7 with a remake in 2011, both on GMA 7 and both starring Richard Gutierrez. The two TV serials were expanded versions of the original story, presenting more details of the main character and introducing more villains. Like other Mars Ravelo characters, film versions of <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b> came earlier and more in number than broadcast adaptations, the first of which was in 1964 starring Bob Soler and directed by Herminio Bautista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Lastikman</i></b>, patterned after DC comics hero Plastic Man, first appeared in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a>an Komiks</i></b><i> </i>in 1964-65, revived in 1995 by <b><i>Aliwan</i></b> publisher Graphics Arts Service Inc with new stories by new writers in a magazine of its own called <b><i>Lastikman Komiks</i></b>, went back to <b><i>Aliwan Komiks</i></b> in 1996-97, and was reworked into a 56-page issue of Mango Comics in 2004 by writer Gerry Alanguilan and artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5062\"><strong>Arnold Arre</strong></a> and Edgar Tadeo. It was turned into a TV series in 2007 by ABS-CBN, starring Vhong Navarro and directed by Chito Ro&ntilde;o. The TV series won the Silver World Medal for the Action-Adventure category in the New York Festivals, 2009. Like most Ravelo creations, Lastikman was earlier seen in three film versions, the first of which was in 1968 starring Von Serna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are other superhero characters that were created first for either radio or film, recreated as a komiks material, then transported to a television series. One is <b><i>Kapitan Kidlat</i></b> (Captain Lightning), created in the 1950s by Leonardo P. Abutin Sr for a radio series of the same title on DZRH, transported to film in 1953 starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4463\"><strong>Armando Goyena</strong></a> and directed by Oscar del Rosario, rewritten as <b><i>Kidlat</i></b> by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5339\"><strong>Pablo S.

The trend was spearheaded by ABS-CBN in its anthology serial titled <b><i>Mars Ravelo&rsquo;s Komiks Presents</i></b>. Each series of the anthology ran for 13-15 episodes. Some komiks materials that were included in the anthology were <b><i>Kapitan Boom</i></b> and <b><i>Varga</i></b>, both in 2008, and <b><i>Flash <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\"><strong>Bomba</strong></a></i></b>, 2009, which first appeared in <b><i>Tagalog Klasiks</i></b>, 1967-68. One of the anthology&rsquo;s most interesting series is <b><i>Isang Lakas</i></b> (One Force), 2011, which unites all the Mars Ravelo superheroes into one team, called Sanlakas (United Front), to battle the evils of the human world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also included in the <b><i>Mars Ravelo&rsquo;s Komiks Presents</i></b>, although not about a superhero but about mediums, ghosts, and reincarnations, was <b><i>Nasaan Ka, Maruja</i></b> (Where Are You, Maruja), 2009, from Ravelo&rsquo;s <b><i>Gumising Ka &hellip; Maruja</i></b> (Wake Up &hellip; Maruja), with the character role played by Kristine Hermosa. <b><i>Gumising Ka &hellip; Maruja</i></b> was first published in <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b> in 1966, illustrated by Rico Rival, and had three film adaptations: in 1966 and 1978, both starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\"><strong>Susan Roces</strong></a>, and in 1996, with Carmina Villaroel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Komiks heroes have not only been made into live-action television series. Some have been produced as single-airing animation productions on television, such as Darna and Captain Barbell, both illustrated for the animation by Gerry Garcia and produced by RPN 9, both in 1986. One highly popular komiks hero that was rendered both in animation and live-action feature and broadcast as a television series was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\"><strong>Ang Panday</strong></a></i></b> (The Blacksmith), who has superior swordsmanship skills whose dagger is made of ore from a meteorite that fell from the sky. The character was created by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\"><strong>Carlo J. Caparas</strong></a> and illustrated by Steve Gan. <b><i>Ang Panday</i></b> was first serialized in <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b> beginning in 1976 and republished as a serial in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, 1979, and as a strip in <b><i>People&rsquo;s Journal</i></b>, 1979. The animated <b><i>Ang Panday</i></b>, RPN 9, 1986-87, was created by cartoonist Gerry Garcia and is considered the first Filipino animated series. The title role in the action-drama <b>teleserye</b> <b><i>Ang</i></b> <b><i>Panday</i></b>, ABS-CBN, 2005-6, was played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4653\"><strong>Jericho Rosales</strong></a>. <b><i>Ang</i></b> <b><i>Panday</i></b> had several film adaptations, the most popular of which were the four-part series by Fernando Poe Jr in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other popular komiks characters created by Caparas that were made into a daily serials on television were <b><i>Bakekang</i></b>, from <b><i>Bondying Komiks</i></b>, 1976-78, illustrated by Mar T. Santana, aired on GMA, 2006-7; <b><i>Kamandag</i></b> (Venom), from the komiks section of the daily tabloid <b><i>People&rsquo;s Journal</i></b>, mid-1980s, illustrated by Karl Comendador, aired also on GMA, 2007-8; and <b><i>Joaquin Bordado</i></b> (Joaquin, the Tattooed), a graphic novel, late 1970s to early 1980s, also on GMA, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television comedy also derived some of its material from komiks. The comic character of Bondying, played by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\"><strong>Bentot</strong></a></strong>, in the television sitcom <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, 1960s, BBC 2, was from <b><i>Bondying</i></b>, a komiks series created by Mars Ravelo and illustrated by Elpidio Torres. <b><i>Prinsipe Abante</i></b> (Prince Abante), 1979, GMA 7, directed by Ading Fernando and featuring Bert Marcelo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4941\"><strong>Tina Revilla</strong></a>, Dely Atay-atayan, Gene Palomo, and Prospero Luna, is a modern spoof of <b><i>Prinsipe Amante</i></b> (Prince Amante), 1949-53, a radio komedya by Clodualdo del Mundo Sr, broadcast live on DZRH from 1949 to 1953, adapted into a komiks serial by Mario del Mar in the 1950s, adapted into a movie in 1950 and a sequel movie in 1951, both produced by LVN and both starring Rogelio de la Rosa and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4621\"><strong>Delia Razon</strong></a> and directed by now National Artist for film Lamberto Avellana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The broadcast drama, especially the teleserye, derives some of its materials from the komiks, often the romance novels written by women authors. Examples include <b><i>Bituing Walang Ningning </i></b>(Star without Sparkle), 2006, ABS-CBN, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5146\"><strong>Nerissa Cabral</strong></a>, from <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>, 1984; <b><i>Blusang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Beauty Within</i></b>), 2011, GMA, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5577\"><strong>Elena M.

Lately, an emerging trend is the introduction of major changes in the narrative, settings, character traits, character history and development, costume designs, and visual effects, as well as the inception of new characters and new forms of superpower and human weaknesses. For example, the muscular Captain Barbell was given a new look when first adapted for film and later for TV. He was shirtless as a superhero, with an eye mask, in the komiks, but donned a yellow muscle-accentuated costume to highlight the build of the actors, who were not bodybuilders, in the character&rsquo;s appearances on film and TV. In the 2006 and 2011 <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b> TV series, the logo &ldquo;CB&rdquo; was added on the chest of the hero&rsquo;s redesigned costume, and given a new weakness, which is exposure to the mineral element Askobar. In the 2005 <b><i>Darna</i></b> TV series, the heroine was shown possessing a heat vision as an addition to her arsenal of weapons, such as bracelets to deflect bullets, the ruby stone to augment her strength, and the white stone that she swallows to transform herself into a superhero. Darna&rsquo;s two-piece bikini suit has likewise undergone several changes, which is becoming skimpier in later broadcast adaptations. Kapitan Kidlat&rsquo;s red costume in komiks became primarily black in the 2013 TV series. Varga in the komiks is a violet-colored ghost, while she is an original human in the 2008 TV series.<em><strong>Written by Eulalio R.

It has provided local television and radio programming with a source of revenue, content, artists, and formats. While film&rsquo;s influence on radio has diminished, television, to a certain degree, has become an extension of film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Part of radio programming from the beginnings of radio in the Philippines in the 1920s during the American period up to the 1950s or a decade after World War II were dramatizations of portions of Filipino movies that were showing or about to be shown in cinema houses. The model was American radio&rsquo;s <b><i>Lux Theater of the Air</i></b>, while the local prewar version was the <b><i>Lux Toilet Soap Theater of the Air</i></b>. The movie actors as well as some radio personalities read live the radio version of the film script, with adoring fans inside the studio. This was a way to encourage radio listeners to watch the movies and to boost the popularity of the movie stars. Radio personalities were considered brighter stars than movie actors; the former were heard on the air every day while the latter appeared in just a few movies a year. Consequently, radio and its voices also enjoyed more newspaper and magazine publicity than film and its actors. Among the movie actors who reprised their film performances in the 1930s on radio were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\"><strong>Carmen Rosales</strong></a>, and Rogelio de la Rosa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war the format of live reenactments of Filipino movies continued, with <b><i>Camay Theater of the Air</i></b> as the most popular one. The show aired for an hour on Sunday nights first on DZRH, then on DZBB, with the film actors reenacting the movie live before a studio audience, complete with theme music, background music, and music bridges provided by a live full orchestra, and live sound effects. Film actor Jaime de la Rosa hosted the show. It was an acid test for many of the movie actors who, unlike radio drama actors, were not used to live performances and who had the luxury of retakes if a scene did not go well. However, some passed the test and earned radio program hosting and acting jobs, which increased their public presence. Among them was Gloria Romero, who hosted the drama series <b><i>Ang Inyong Lingkod</i></b>, <b><i>Gloria Romero </i></b>(At Your Service, Gloria Romero),<b><i> </i></b>DZRH, 1959-60, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\"><strong>Genoveva Edroza-Matute</strong></a>. Apart from hosting the show, Romero also performed the lead roles in the episodes, with guest actors from film including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4461\"><strong>Luis Gonzales</strong></a>, Juancho Gutierrez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4723\"><strong>Romeo Vasquez</strong></a>, Carmen Rosales, Daisy Romualdez, Carlos Salazar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4552\"><strong>Mario Montenegro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4559\"><strong>Oscar Moreno</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4451\"><strong>Eddie Garcia</strong></a>, Jose Mari, Van de Leon, Jose de Villa, and the comedians Dolphy, Panchito, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>, and Matimtiman Cruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When more Filipinos began to acquire television sets in the 1960s, television began to overtake radio as the more effective platform for promoting movies and movie actors and as an additional outlet for screening old movies. Film&rsquo;s presence on radio waned, save for the occasional movie ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On television, Filipino movies are broadcast as trailer commercials to promote film producers&rsquo; latest offerings. Movie excerpts are often shown between television programs as paid promotional materials or as short features in a talk entertainment program, especially when film stars are invited as guests to ask TV audiences to support a movie project. Some TV segments of these entertainment programs are paid by film companies to provide their stars a slot to talk about the movie, increasing the visibility of the movie and its stars to the captive audiences of television, increasing the chances of the movie&rsquo;s success in the box office. In some instances, film producers sponsor contests or games as an occasional segment of a TV program, such as acting competitions in which live studio audiences reenact a selected sequence, usually the film&rsquo;s most dramatic part, and deliver the movie dialogue of the film&rsquo;s lead stars. In the 1970s, one television program format was the movie guide, a daily 30-minute program, usually programmed before a major show, that featured excerpts of movies currently showing or about to be shown in movie houses in Manila and clips of movies-in-the making. Examples of programs of this format were <b><i>Movie Parade</i></b> and <b><i>Movie Date</i></b>, IBC 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film has also provided television with a regular programming material, such as daily or weekly reruns of movies, especially in the TV station&rsquo;s regular afternoon or evening programming. Examples in the 1970s include <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\"><strong>Sinehan</strong></a> Dos</i></b> (Movie Theater on Two) and <b><i>Sunday Super Sine</i></b> (Sunday Super Movie) on BBC 2; <b><i>Tagalog Movie</i></b> on GTV 4; <b><i>Aliwang Pang-umaga</i></b> (Morning Entertainment), <b><i>Sine Siete</i></b> (Cinema Seven), and <b><i>Sine Espesyal</i></b> (Special Movies) on GMA 7; and <b><i>Cine Pinoy</i></b> (Pinoy Cinema), <b><i>Piling-Piling Pelikula</i></b> (Well Selected Movies), <b><i>IBCinema 1</i></b>, and <b><i>Roadshow Pilipino</i></b> on IBC 13. Beginning in the 1980s and on through the 2000s, television networks have creatively packaged movie reruns, providing a one-season programming series of hit movies by big stars. An example was <b><i>FPJ sa GMA</i></b> (FPJ on GMA), 1987-92, Channel 7, a weekly series of 200 film hits by movie box-office king Fernando Poe Jr, who was reportedly paid 10 million pesos by GMA for the first-run rights to his movies. This was followed up by ABS-CBN in 1988 through its <b><i>Cinema FPJ: Da King on ABS-CBN</i></b> (Cinema FPJ: The King on ABS-CBN). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a> featured its hit movies in <b><i>Regal Presents</i></b>, 1986, ABS-CBN, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\"><strong>Viva Films</strong></a> showed the studio&rsquo;s movies on <b><i>Viva Box Office</i></b>, 1988, IBC 13, <b><i>Viva Sinerama</i></b>, 1990-91, GMA, and <b><i>MVP: Monday Viva Presentations</i></b>, 1994, GMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film retrospectives are also produced by television networks to pay tribute to industry achievers, such as Gerardo de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\"><strong>Lamberto V. Avellana</strong></a>, Lino Brocka, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>. Annual film awarding ceremonies have also become regular features of television stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Documentary films from different embassies based in Manila are also shown on local television, often as program fillers. One example in the 1970s was <b><i>Embassy Film</i></b>, GMA 7. Hollywood movies are also regularly shown on local television. Lately, these Hollywood movies, together with Korean and Japanese movies, are dubbed in Filipino, and shown on free VHF television. Movies from various countries are shown on UHF television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film producers are also blocktimers on television. Movie outfits Regal Films, Viva Films, and Seiko Films produce weekly primetime shows, mainly drama anthologies for their stable of movie actors. Regal Films had drama anthologies like <b><i>Maricel Regal <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> Special</i></b>, 1987-90, ABS-CBN, and <b><i>Mother Studio Presents</i></b>, 1986-96, GMA, and the weekly sitcom <b><i>Palibhasa Lalake</i></b> (Because They Are Guys), 1987-98, ABS-CBN. To complement Regal&rsquo;s <b><i>Shake, Rattle and Roll </i></b>movie series, it produced the weekly horror serial <b><i>Regal Shockers</i></b>, 1985-91, GMA. Viva Television produced regular programs on GMA, such as the weekly drama anthology <b><i>Spotlight</i></b>, 1993-98; the daily soap operas <b><i>Villa Quintana</i></b>, 1995-96, and <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b>, 1996-2002; the comedy shows <b><i>Ober da Bakod</i></b> (Over the Fence), 1992-96, <b><i>Haybol Rambol</i></b> (Rumble in the House), 1993-95, and <b><i>Si Manoy at si Mokong</i></b> (Manoy and Mokong), 1997-98; and the youth-oriented shows <b><i>T.G.I.S. </i></b>(Thank God It&rsquo;s Sabado [Saturday]), 1995-99, and <b><i>Growing Up</i></b>, 1997-98.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some films were also remade into television drama series, which came to be known as teleseryes or telenovelas, but with changes in characters, settings, or narrative plots. In some cases, the teleserye used only the film&rsquo;s title and completely changed the narrative of the original film. ABS-CBN was a frontrunner in this format, particularly with its <b><i>Sine Serye</i></b> (Movie Serialized TV Series), 2005-9, which included hit serials based on movies like <b><i>Kampanerang Kuba </i></b>(Hunchbacked Lady Bell Ringer), 2005; <b><i>Bituing Walang Ningning</i></b>; 2006; <b><i>Palimos ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Begging for Love), 2007; <b><i>Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara </i></b>(Kill Barbara with Fright), 2008; <b><i>Maligno</i></b> (Evil Spirit), 2008; and <b><i>Florinda</i></b>, 2009. GMA had TV adaptations of <b><i>Bakekang</i></b>, 2006-7, and <b><i>Machete</i></b>, 2011. TV5 adapted the film <b><i>Batang X</i></b> (Child X), 2008, into television. Some of these works first came out in komiks, then made into films before they were adapted for TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Movies are also a rich source of artists for television. Movie actors serve as performers of television programs in all formats and genres, such as drama, comedy, variety shows, talk entertainment shows, magazine programs, and even documentaries, public affairs programs, and news. Some big film actors spent a huge part of their career on television, such as Nora Aunor in the long-running weekly variety show <b><i>Superstar</i></b>, 1971-89, RPN 9, and the weekly drama anthology <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b> (The Colorful World of Nora); Vilma Santos in the weekly teen musical <b><i>The Sensations</i></b>, 1971-72, ABS-CBN, the weekly drama anthology <b><i>Dulambuhay ni Rosa Vilma</i></b> (Life Story of Rosa Vilma), 1974, BBC 2, and the weekly variety show <b><i>V.I.P: Vilma in Person</i></b>, 1986-95, GMA; and Dolphy in the weekly sitcoms <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, 1973-90, RPN 9, and <b><i>Home along da Riles</i></b>, 1992-2003, ABS-CBN. Film directors, like Ishmael Bernal, Lino Brocka, Lupita Concio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\"><strong>Marilou Diaz-Abaya</strong></a>, Mario O&rsquo;Hara, Maryo J. de los Reyes, Soxy Topacio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\"><strong>Jose Javier Reyes</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\"><strong>Peque Gallaga</strong></a>, and film scriptwriters, such as O&rsquo;Hara, Javier Reyes, Ricky Lee, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\"><strong>Tony Perez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\"><strong>Lualhati Bautista</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4705\"><strong>Jake Tordesillas</strong></a>, and Roy Iglesias, wrote drama programs and documentaries. Film critics, such as Isagani Cruz, Mario Hernando, and Butch Francisco, served as in-house critics or hosts of some entertainment talk shows on television. Film viewers are also mainly the audience of television programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television has also drawn on film for some aesthetics, such as techniques of cinema verit&eacute; in documentaries, like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1497\"><strong>Reel Time</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i>Front Row</i></b>, 2012, both on GMA News TV, and experimental narratives, like those employed in the weekly horror-suspense drama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/937\"><strong>Malikmata</strong></a></i></b> (Illusion), 1972, ABC 5, directed by Lupita Concio, then by Lino Brocka; the historical drama <b><i>Katipunan</i></b> (Brotherhood), 2013, GMA News TV, directed by King Marc Baco; and some episodes of the drama anthology <b><i>Wagas</i></b> (Sincere), 2014, GMA News TV. Artists from the independent film movement have also hugely contributed to emerging television program aesthetics in direction, script, camera, and performance. Some of these artists are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\"><strong>Jon Red</strong></a>, Adolf Alix Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4984\"><strong>Ian Victoriano</strong></a>, Alvin Yapan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4536\"><strong>Coco Martin</strong></a>, Mercedes Cabral, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4518\"><strong>Sid Lucero</strong></a>.<em><strong>Written byEulalio R.

It has affected program content, the adaptation and creation of genres and formats, the way shows are programmed, production practices, and the performance styles of Filipino broadcasters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early radio and television programming relied heavily on foreign canned programs, particularly those imported from the United States. It was cost-efficient especially for a broadcast industry that had yet to establish itself in terms of programming and program production. Importing programs has been inexpensive as such are actually rebroadcasts of shows that have already been produced for another market, consumed by it, and thus have already paid off such that selling it to another market is simply a bonus. This process of importation and exhibition may be considered the first form of appropriation of foreign broadcasting for the Filipino market. As canned programs were imported, programming modes were similarly imported and appropriated to suit the length, format, and schedule of such programs. What local production shows made, in turn, appropriated the same production aesthetics and performance styles of broadcasters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This trend started in radio from the time radio broadcasting began in the Philippines in the 1920s. With the development of a more sophisticated recording technology after World War II as well as the growth of the song recording industry, this influence intensified as Western music was the most inexpensive source of radio music programming. Moreover, the introduction of other program formats from American radio, such as the soap opera, contoured both the format and the content of radio programs in the Philippines. Counseling programs, for example, like those inspired by advice columnist Dorothy Dix in the United States, in turn inspired <b><i>Ito ang Inyong Tiya Dely</i></b> and a score of other counseling programs on radio and television such as <b><i>Napakasakit, Kuya Eddie</i></b> (It Hurts, Brother Eddie) and <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>. This counseling influence is still present in more contemporary programs like <b><i>Maalaala Mo Kaya</i></b> and <b><i>Magpakailanman</i></b>. Early Philippine television programming reflected this same tendency by exhibiting a significant proportion of canned American television programs, and then adapting the same formats and genres to local productions. American programming structure has also been evident in the organization of local programming, determining which shows should occupy primetime and premium slots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine television program genres have also been influenced by foreign, particularly American, genres. This is evident in a range of television formats that have developed through time. Philippine comedies, for example, have focused on a studio production practice with a more static set, with content that usually deals with the subjects&rsquo; familial or group dynamics. While adapting the 30-minute American situational comedy as a genre, however, there is a twist in the Filipino television sitcom, stretching to an hour or even an hour and a half, which also improves the production cost per hour of programming while increasing the advertising income of the program. Successful comedy formats include <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b> and <b><i>Home along da Riles</i></b>. Noticeable in the sitcoms is the slapstick style of comedy that is influenced by the physical comedy of American actor Charlie Chaplin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Children&rsquo;s and youth programming have been similarly influenced by American formats as well as content. A common practice is to fill with American cartoons the daily late morning slots and entire Saturday morning lineups of television with American cartoons, such as <b><i>The Flintstones</i></b> and <b><i>Scooby Doo</i></b>. Other children&rsquo;s programs from the United States have also been shown locally. The very popular <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b> was shown in the Philippines for decades, impacting the lives of generations of Filipino viewers. <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b> influenced local children&rsquo;s programs like the iconic <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot</i></b> (Small but Strong) and <b><i>Pen Pen de Sarapen</i></b>. These educational children&rsquo;s programs also adapted the use of puppets and mascots, much like the <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b> model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1990s, youth programming became a focus in the United States when the WB (Warner Bros.) Channel started producing and airing programs targeted at the young, particularly the adolescent market. This led to the production of the hits <b><i>Dawson&rsquo;s Creek</i></b>, 1998; <b><i>Charmed</i></b>, 1998; and the extremely popular <b><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></b>, 1997. The practice of adapting American trends continued when Studio 23, the UHF station of ABS-CBN, was launched in 1996 and targeted a similar adolescent market, airing programs that mostly came from the WB Channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Local VHF programming also produced more programs targeting the youth. While programs with fantasy and supernatural plots like <b><i>Charmed</i></b> and <b><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></b>, which required expensive production design, were not initially made, the format of <b><i>Dawson&rsquo;s Creek</i></b> was embraced through its local counterpart and almost near-namesake <b><i>Tabing Ilog</i></b> (Riverside), 2000. The fantasy influence was more evident in the <b>pantaserye</b> (portmanteau of &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo; and &ldquo;series&rdquo;) themes of primetime soap operas in 2000s as production practices and budgets accommodated such genres in the primetime slot. It is important to note, however, that a distinctly Filipino youth programming trend may have already started in 1996 with <b><i>T.G.I.S.</i></b> However, most local youth programming in the country, like <b><i>Click</i></b>, 1999, and <b><i>G-mik</i></b> (Gimmick), 1999, started after the airing of <b><i>Dawson&rsquo;s Creek</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most evident foreign influence on Philippine television programming is found in the dramatic genres, particularly the soap opera. The Filipino soap opera, however, both on radio and television, is infused with a more melodramatic feel. The initial influence in the local soap opera is the American model, which was and still is primarily sponsored by soap companies and targeted at female audiences. As with the American model, Philippine soap operas also initially aired in time slots that were presumed &ldquo;feminine,&rdquo; such as the afternoon hours when husbands and children were at work and school, respectively, and housewives were home. Soap operas on radio in the 1950s and the 1960s ran for several years before coming to a conclusion, much like their American counterparts. Such was the case with <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, and <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b>. However, the American model was not the only soap opera influence on the current dramatic genres on Philippine television. Two distinct developments in programming likewise directed the evolution of dramatic genres in the Philippines. Pivotal in the development of the genres were the telenovela (term used for Spanish soap operas, portmanteau of &ldquo;television&rdquo; and &ldquo;novel&rdquo;) <b><i>Marimar</i></b> and the <b>chinovela</b> (Chinese telenovela) <b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1996, only four months after the initial airing of the program on RPN Channel 9, <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, imported from Mexico, rose to number one in ratings. The impact was industry-wide. The adjustments the networks made, particularly the leading network ABS-CBN, to address the competition also shifted the face of primetime programming. ABS-CBN Channel 2&rsquo;s one-hour news program <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, which aired at the same time as <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, 6:00-7:00 pm, was reduced to 30 minutes, 6:00-6:30 pm, and its top-rating afternoon soap opera <b><i>Mara Clara</i></b> was moved to the pre-primetime slot of 6:30-7:00 pm. The transfer led to the eventual shift of the soap opera genre to the primetime schedule and the adoption of stripping, or scheduling the same program on a daily basis instead of the usual once-a-week programming approach with soaps, also and this became the principal strategy on Philippine prime time. The success of <b><i>Marimar</i></b> opened up the programming of several stations to the importation and placement of Latin American telenovelas in both primetime and non-primetime schedules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b>, on the other hand, did to chinovelas and <b>koreanovelas</b> (Korean telenovelas), collectively called <b>asianovelas</b> (Asian telenovelas), what <b><i>Marimar</i></b> did to the telenovela. Filipino audiences equally embraced the telenovela and the East Asian imports in their primetime and non-primetime viewing habits. Even the aesthetic and content of local soap operas were influenced by the Asian soaps. East Asian-looking Filipino actors like Kim Chiu, Enchong Dee, and Xian Lim rose in popularity. A later influence of both telenovelas and asianovelas was the local remakes of the popular imports, thus the Filipino versions of the telenovelas <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, <b><i>Maria la del Barrio</i></b>, and <b><i>Rosalinda</i></b> and the asianovelas <b><i>Kim Sam Soon</i></b>, <b><i>Lovers in Paris</i></b>, and <b><i>Stairway to Heaven</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A strong and direct influence of foreign broadcasting on Filipino broadcasting is the television franchise, which involves programs usually airing in the United States or Europe that are sold to markets in other countries. Unlike the exported canned program, the television franchise producers sell the concept and the right to produce a similar program in another country rather than a canned copy of the original program. The franchiser supervises the local conceptualization and execution of the franchised program to ensure that the look and feel of the original material is retained in the local production. Most franchised materials are reality programs as they are easier to translate to local counterparts, such as <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b>, <b><i>Kapamilya</i></b> <b><i>Deal or No Deal</i></b>, <b><i>Survivor Philippines</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>The Voice Philippines</i></b>. The first successful franchise was the production of the global phenomenon <b><i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i></b> on IBC Channel 13 in 2000, but it was discontinued in 2002. IBC also successfully produced the franchised program <b><i>The Weakest Link</i></b> during the period. The game show franchises inspired the production of local game shows and reality formats, such as the original and long-running <b><i>Game KNB?</i></b> (Are You Ready to Play?). Recent developments indicate that networks are more inclined to produce franchised programs instead of developing original shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine broadcasting in this time of global circulation of popular culture continues to be influenced by foreign media products.

Drama programs on both radio and television use true-to-life or reality and everyday events in order to make fiction more realistic, easy to relate to, and even popular, while historical fiction uses actual people, places, and events to weave interesting stories. Sometimes, drama programs feature fictional characters with actual historical events as backdrops or devices. The same is true for comedy. Current events, trends, and common knowledge are some of the most effective components of comedy. Political satire uses comedy and entertainment to criticize both political situations and politicians. It has always been popular in the Philippines, except during World War II and martial law. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><strong>Horror</strong></a> programs on radio and television are often fictitious but usually draw on folklore and people&rsquo;s accounts, whether firsthand or as told to them by others. In counseling and outreach programs, audiences share their stories by writing letters or calling (if aired live) and experts are invited to give advice. Outreach programs feature stories of the destitute, terminally ill, or those whom the program producers can help in some way. Some provide help directly while others appeal to the public or solicit donations. Biographical and inspirational programs often ask viewers to send in their stories or research on lives of celebrities to dramatize their struggles and triumphs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Drawing from true-to-life events, the drama serial has attracted a loyal audience since the first soap operas in 1949: <b><i>Ilaw ng Tahanan</i></b> (Light of the Home) and <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b> (Wheel of Fate). From 1949 to 1957, <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b> aired over KZRH (later DZRH). Sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble (now Philippine Manufacturing Company), the show was written by society columnist Lina Flor, whose sister Loida Flores Viri&ntilde;a, then a working student, played the lead character Luisa. Viri&ntilde;a later wrote the enormously popular original TV version of <b><i>Gulong ng Palad </i></b>from 1977 to 1985, which starred Marianne dela Riva and Ronald Corveau and aired first over BBC Channel 2 and later on RPN Channel 9. In 2006, ABS-CBN Channel 2 revived the serial, this time starring Kristine Hermosa and TJ Trinidad. Soap became the most popular TV format in 1996 when RPN Channel 9 aired the Mexican telenovela <b><i>Marimar</i></b> starring Thalia Sodi Miranda. True-to-life events remained the main source of drama material, but situations were treated in various degrees or types of dramatization, from melodrama to romance-comedy or &ldquo;romcom.&rdquo; By the 1990s, television had become much more accessible to the masses. A significant demographic group among the audiences was the lower middle class, who avidly watched <b><i>Marimar</i></b>. When the show topped the ratings in 1996, it was a cue for the networks to produce more drama serials that depict the lives of ordinary people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As more and more soap operas were produced and aired not just on prime time but on other time slots as well, other subgenres, such as historical fiction, emerged. As early as 1992, the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> produced a 13-episode TV series of Jose Rizal&rsquo;s novel <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not) under the direction of National Artist for film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\"><strong>Eddie Romero</strong></a>. This was shown on TV5 (then ABC 5). But it was GMA&rsquo;s <b><i>Amaya</i></b>, which aired from 2011 to 2012, that was billed as the first epic-serye or epic drama on Philippine television. <b><i>Amaya</i></b> was set in the 1500s, at the time of the Spanish colonization. While the story was fictitious, its creator Suzette Doctolero conducted intensive research and consulted historians to ensure that <b><i>Amaya</i></b>&rsquo;s portrayal of Philippine society and local lore during the said period was as accurate as possible. Based on ancient descriptions, a legendary warship known as the <i>karakoa</i> was built for the production at the cost of two million pesos. A year later, GMA Network produced another big-budget primetime &ldquo;historical&rdquo; soap titled <b><i>Indio</i></b>. Loosely picking up from where <b><i>Amaya</i></b> left off, <b><i>Indio</i></b>, according to Doctolero, was a combination of Philippine history and mythology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The dramatization of true-to-life and everyday events has merged with other formats such as counseling, inspiration, or outreach. Advice programs dramatize stories of letter senders, who often sought guidance on how to deal with a dilemma or predicament. After the dramatization, the program host offers an opinion or a suggestion to the letter sender. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kasaysayan sa mga Liham kay Tiya Dely</i></b> (Stories in Letters to Aunt Dely), 1950s, DZRH, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday), 1976-86, GMA Channel 7, were among the first advice programs. Ilarde became a popular radio personality by hosting <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> beginning in the 1950s, first on radio then later on television. When <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> ended, Ilarde joined rival network ABS-CBN and hosted <b><i>Napakasakit, Kuya Eddie </i></b>(It Hurts, Brother Eddie), also an advice program that aired between 1986 and 1988. A similar program was the vastly popular <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>, 1980-84 and 1986-96 on GMA Channel 7, and 1984-86 on BBC City Channel 2, which started as a daily counseling program on radio over DZBB (GMA&rsquo;s AM station).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Often referred to as <b><i>MMK</i></b> for short, <b><i>Maalaala Mo Kaya </i></b>(Will You Remember), ABS-CBN Channel 2, 1991 to present, hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a>-Concio, is described as inspirational dramatization. <b><i>MMK</i></b> features stories ranging from true-to-life accounts of letter senders to composite stories from different sources. <b><i>MMK</i></b> has also spawned a radio program, 2007 to present, <b><i>Maalaala Mo Kaya sa DZMM</i></b> (Will You Remember on DZMM). GMA Channel 7 produces a similar drama anthology, <b><i>Magpakailanman </i></b>(Forever), 2002-8 and 2012-present, hosted by Mel Tiangco. Likewise featuring inspiring true-to-life stories, <b><i>Magpakailanman</i></b> includes an interview of the featured person during the episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The legal drama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1449\"><strong>Ipaglaban Mo</strong></a></i></b> (Fight for It), hosted by lawyer Jose C. Sison, IBC Channel 13, 1988-92, dramatized actual legal cases settled in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. The show transferred to ABS-CBN Channel 2 in 1992, this time with lawyer Jopet Sison as co-host. Initially a blocktimer, it aired the following year as an ABS-CBN production until 1999. In 2013, the legal drama made a comeback on ABS-CBN with the shortened title <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo</i></b> (Fight for It). Other legal dramas include legal counsel by the host. An example is <b><i>Compa&ntilde;ero y Compa&ntilde;era</i></b> (in Spanish, literally, &ldquo;companion&rdquo; or &ldquo;colleague&rdquo;), which featured legal experts who answered questions from the audience in the studio. The program aired from 1994 to 1997 on DZMM, then 1997-98 on ABS-CBN Channel 2, 1998-2000 on GMA Channel 7, and finally 2000-1 on RPN Channel 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The public service program includes dramatized situations as well as talk. Much of the segments in Noli de Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>Magandang Gabi, Bayan</i></b> (Good Evening, Nation) exposed anomalies in government. Its highest-rating episodes, however, were Halloween specials that featured dramatized &ldquo;true-to-life&rdquo; ghost stories, complete with special effects and scary musical scoring. <b><i>Isumbong Mo kay Tulfo</i></b> (Report It to Tulfo), initially a blocktimer on RPN 9 and since 1994 heard on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4816\"><strong>DWIZ</strong></a>, helps listeners obtain service especially from government agencies. A spin-off of Ramon Tulfo&rsquo;s segment on Action 9, <b><i>Isumbong Mo kay Tulfo</i></b> dramatizes cases with cinematic value weekly on television, interspersed with actual footage of the <i>sumbong </i>(report), confrontation scenes in the presence of the host, and the resolution of the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other public service TV programs post-EDSA are based on true-to-life grievances of the public, such as those aired on <b><i>Hoy Gising </i></b>(Hey, Wake Up), 1992-2001, ABS-CBN Channel 2. <b><i>Hoy Gising</i></b> started as a segment in the ABS-CBN flagship news program <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>. <b><i>Imbestigador</i></b> (Investigator), 2000 to present, GMA Channel 7, is another public service program that exposes anomalies, investigates crimes and public issues, and provides assistance to viewers. It has an action center that accommodates people requesting various types of help. <b><i>Imbestigador</i></b> has a radio counterpart that airs over DZBB. More recent episodes of the program have also adopted the docudrama format. Outreach programs that grant wishes and provide assistance include GMA Channel 7&rsquo;s <b><i>Wish Ko Lang!</i></b> (Just My Wish!), since 2002, initially hosted by Bernadette Sembrano before her move to rival network ABS-CBN and later taken over by Vicky <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es; ABS-CBN Channel 2&rsquo;s <b><i>Willingly Yours</i></b>, 2002-3, hosted by Willy Revillame; and Karen Davila&rsquo;s short-lived <b><i>Simpleng Hiling</i></b> (Simple Request) also on Channel 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Highlighting the incongruencies of true-to-life day-to-day situations makes comedy effective. During the early days of Philippine television, comedy programs were imported from radio. First produced by Horacio de la Costa and aired on radio before World War II, Epifanio Matute&rsquo;s <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> (Tall Tales) was directed in the 1950s and the 1960s by Narciso Pimentel, first on stage, then on radio, and later on TV. A production of Pimentel&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2908\"><strong>Dramatic Philippines</strong></a>, it was a precedent-setting radio satire that spoofed politicians and government officials with humorous episodes that delighted radio audiences. <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>, <b><i>Buhay Artista </i></b>(Actor&rsquo;s Life), and <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b>, which all started on radio before going on television, were fictional comedy programs but depicted and made references to everyday events and issues. Dolphy and Panchito&rsquo;s <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b> always ended with a song translation from English to Tagalog, often with references to current issues and events. <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b>, 1969-72, ABS-CBN, directed by Rollie Grande, was a takeoff from the US sketch comedy <b><i>Rowan &amp; Martin&rsquo;s</i></b> <b><i>Laugh In</i></b>. Its cast included Balot, Babalu, <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>June Keithley</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>, Mitch (then known as Maya) Valdez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4744\"><strong>Ramon Zamora</strong></a> who came up with memorable Hitler sketches. ABS-CBN revived the show in the 1990s (1996-99), this time with Redford White, Norman Mitchell, Diether Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> Agbayani, Vhong Navarro, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Mylene Dizon</strong></a></strong>, Regine Tolentino, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4545\"><strong>Glydel Mercado</strong></a>, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The media landscape drastically changed when martial law was declared but comedy programs quickly came back without the political innuendos. The most successful and memorable comedy program during the martial law era was RPN 9&rsquo;s <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, 1973-90, starring Dolphy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a> and written and directed by Ading Fernando. Fernando used common situations as a starting point in <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>. Divino Reyes, one of the show&rsquo;s writers, recalls that Fernando often treated the production staff to drinking sessions so he could hear them talk about their everyday lives, episodes of which were often written into the show&rsquo;s story lines. Though politically repressed, media managed to air social commentary. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4856\"><strong>Nanette Inventor</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Buding&rdquo; segment in the Sunday night variety show <b><i>Penthouse Live</i></b>, 1982-87, GMA Channel 7, was a parody of the nouveau riche. Using monologues, commentaries, impersonations, and spoofs, other stand-up comics poked fun at anything and everyone. For example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4969\"><strong>Tessie Tomas</strong></a> appeared as Amanda Pineda, a caricature of PAGASA weatherman Amado Pineda in the gag show <b><i>Champoy</i></b> (name of a salty-sweet dried fruit, a popular snack). Outright criticism and condemnation of the rich and powerful became possible only after the 1986 EDSA Revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The restoration of press freedom after the ouster of then president Ferdinand Marcos in Feb 1986 ushered in several new programs that tackled politics and other contentious issues. No-holds-barred discussions and features found their way on the airwaves while newscasts presented all sides of issues confronting the public. Many hard-hitting public affairs programs and documentaries were produced, making research an important part of such productions. Even comedy programs tackled highly sociopolitical issues of the day, among them <b><i>Barrio Balimbing</i></b> (A Barrio of Turncoats), 1986-87 on IBC Channel 13 and 1987-88 on ABS-CBN Channel 2. Many of the discussions and conflicts developed and took place at the usual <i>tambayan</i> (hangout), Mang Akong&rsquo;s sari-sari store. Another hard-hitting comedy program was the wittily titled <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>, 1987-90, IBC Channel 13. Patterned after <b><i>Not Necessarily the News</i></b>, a satirical sketch comedy series on the US cable channel HBO, it had the format of a newscast with anchors Lilian Polly Katubusan Labaybay (Ces Quesada) and Sonny Esguerra (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4427\"><strong>Jaime Fabregas</strong></a>) under the direction of Marilou Diaz-Abaya. Another political satire that used the talk show format was <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>, 1980s, IBC Channel 13 and RPN Channel 9, anchored by Mr Shooli (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4978\"><strong>Jun Urbano</strong></a>) with his assistant Kuhol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Horror has always attracted viewers and listeners. A characteristic wail of a dog opens each episode of the <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> (Night of Terror) radio show over DZRH that has been airing since the 1950s. Like urban legends, stories featured on <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> about encounters with ghosts and mythical creatures seem true-to-life, its viewers and listeners claiming to know of people who have had such experiences. Several varieties of the horror program have aired on television. In the 1980s, <b><i>Pinoy Thriller</i></b>, IBC Channel 13, and <b><i>Regal Shockers</i></b>, GMA Channel 7, rated well. They featured works of fiction inspired by scary local stories and some foreign influence. TV5 revived <b><i>Regal Shockers</i></b> in 2011 until 2012. <b><i>Okatokat</i></b> (reverse spelling of <i>Takot ako!</i> [I&rsquo;m scared!]) was a weekly series on ABS-CBN Channel 2 that starred Agot Isidro and Ricky Davao from 1997 to 2002. The show had a sitcom feel to it as there were many funny, light moments in the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other shows based on &ldquo;true&rdquo; ghost stories and paranormal phenomena were the weekly ABS-CBN Channel 2&rsquo;s <b><i>Nginiiig</i></b> (Tremor), 2003, and GMA Channel 7&rsquo;s <b><i>Huwag Kang Kukurap</i></b> (Do Not Blink), 2004-6. Horror as a theme was also used in soaps like <b><i>Spirits</i></b>, 2004-5, and the 15-episode <b><i>Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara</i></b>, 2008, both on ABS-CBN Channel 2. The latter was a spin-off of a Susan Roces movie in 1974 of the same title, which was also remade as a movie in 1995 and starred Lorna Tolentino. From 2008 to 2009, TV5 came up with the reality horror-suspense program <b><i>Philippines&rsquo; Scariest Challenge</i></b>, which featured ghost stories and other strange phenomena. The show featured celebrities who were dared to complete tasks in haunted places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Few historical programs were aired on commercial television as it was not as popular as other genres like drama and comedy. Nonetheless, several programs narrating historical events or featuring historical figures have been aired. ABS-CBN Channel 2 produced a children&rsquo;s program about Filipino heroes titled <b><i>Bayani</i></b> (Hero), 1995-2001, one of a few produced in cooperation with the Department of Education, aligned with elementary students&rsquo; curriculum. RPN Channel 9 produced a series called <b><i>Alab ng Lahi</i></b> (Ardor of the Race) in the 1980s, which featured historical highlights in each episode. GMA Channel 7 produced two historical series shown on prime time: <b><i>Katipunan</i></b> (name of Filipino revolutionary movement against Spain in the late 1800s), 2013, a 10-episode miniseries on the history of the Katipunan, Bonifacio, and the internal struggles of the revolutionary movement; and <b><i>Ilustrado</i></b> (Educated Native), a 20-episode docudrama on the life of Jose Rizal. In 2013, TV5 produced <b><i>History with</i></b> <b><i>Lourd de Veyra: Tsismis Noon, Kasaysayan</i></b> <b><i>Ngayon</i></b> (History with Lourd de Veyra: Rumor Then, History Now), a different take on historical events and trivia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">True-to-life events, such as historical and everyday realities, are said to be often stranger than fiction. The audience interest, fascination, and wonder that they generate will continue to inspire content on radio and television.<em><strong>Written by Jose Bartolome</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"religion\" name=\"religion\"></a>Religion</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippines became predominantly Roman Catholic due to the forced imposition of the faith during the Spanish colonization. However, with the coming of the Americans in 1898, freedom of religion was allowed while Protestant denominations were introduced. It was during the American colonial period when a few new religious groups were established, among them the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and the Philippine Independent Church, also known as the Aglipayan Church, named after its founder Gregorio Aglipay. With the introduction of radio broadcasting in the 1920s, religious groups began to make a small presence on the air by producing programs like <b><i>Tagalog Gospel Hour</i></b> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>KZRF</strong></a> in 1941. In an effort to appeal culturally to Filipinos, even the Japanese-controlled radio station PIAM aired the program <b><i>Time for Church in the Morning </i></b>during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war, the first religious radio station KZAS, later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4820\"><strong>DZAS</strong></a>, was established in Jun 1948 by Protestant missionaries through the Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC). FEBC continues to operate DZAS on the AM band as well as DZFE on FM and other radio stations in Isabela, Albay, Iloilo, South Cotabato, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. Programs on FEBC stations include bible studies, prayers, exhortations, phone-ins for prayer requests or spiritual advice, and worship songs, apart from classical music on DZFE and news and information on DZAS. By the 2000s, at least 20 radio stations were owned and/or operated by religious groups. Most assume standard or commercial radio formats, broadcasting news and popular music while inserting religious messages within regular programming. Others are overtly religious such as DZEM of the INC and DWXI of El Shaddai, whose operation is described as religious broadcasting. El Shaddai, considered the largest charismatic movement in the country, started as a radio station or &ldquo;radio apostolate.&rdquo; It has flourished into a full-fledged movement and has a number of radio, TV, and online shows that are used to reach out to both members and the general public, to showcase miraculous healings or preaching, and to evangelize (Kessler and Ruland 2006, 73). Religious stations and programs are also using online technology to expand their reach. The Jesuit Communications of the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus, for instance, produces interactive video reflections of Gospel readings such as <b><i>The Word Exposed</i></b>, shown both on television and social media formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the rise of new religions such as Ang Dating Daan, whose founder, Eli Soriano, is a former member of the INC, religious programs and stations have become a platform to refute each other&rsquo;s doctrines. Ministers of the INC and Ang Dating Daan are constantly engaged in a vigorous debate through their respective radio and television stations. The INC lectures through its Eagle Broadcasting Corporation, which owns DZEC-TV Net 25, DZEC radio on the AM band, DWDM radio on the FM band; and the Christian Era Broadcasting Service, which owns INC-TV Channel 49 on VHF. On the other hand, Ang Dating Daan responds through its Progressive Broadcasting Corporation, which owns DWAO-TV <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4977\"><strong>UNTV Channel 37</strong></a> on the VHF band and DWUN on the AM band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from evangelization, several religious stations have included public and community service in their main agenda. The Catholic Media Network (CMN) uses radio to reach remote and impoverished communities. CMN is the largest religious media network in the country. It operates 30 AM and 32 FM stations across the Philippines, including areas in Sulu. It also operates TV Maria as its television network, whose signals are delivered via satellite broadcasting and cable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcast content to expand their respective congregations and strengthen the faith of their members is expected of radio and television stations owned and operated by religious groups. However, commercial radio and television stations also include religious programs into their regular schedules, such as the Catholic programs <b><i>Salitang Buhay</i></b> (Living Word) and<b><i> Light Moments </i></b>on DZMM, the Catholic Sunday mass broadcast on ABS-CBN Sports+Action Channel 23, and the Protestant program <b><i>Diyos at Bayan</i></b> (God and Country) on GMA News TV Channel 11. ABS-CBN Channel 2 and DZMM also air devotionals such as the three o&rsquo;clock prayer, and produce segments and programs in the observance of Christmas and Lent. Solar Entertainment Channels, which include cable channels ETC, Jack TV, Jack City, and 2nd Avenue, produce public materials in commemoration of Christmas and Lent. Free-to-air television stations ABS-CBN, GMA Channel 7, and TV5 produce special Christmas station identification plugs, and co-produce or broadcast Catholic shows during the Holy Week, such as GMA&rsquo;s airing of the theatrical production <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/474\"><strong>Siete Palabras</strong></a></i></b> (Seven Last Words) from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a>. ABS-CBN has been airing religious shows hosted by Fr Jerry Orbos, S.V.D., and Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Religious activities have always been included in news programs. Regular celebrations like All Saints&rsquo; Day, Christmas, Lent, the Black Nazarene Quiapo Festival, the Muslim Ramadan, and other religious observances are reported on in the news. Other events of religious significance that are covered in the newscasts include papal conclaves; papal visits to the Philippines by Paul VI in 1970, John Paul II in 1981 and 1995, and Francis in Jan 2015; the canonization and beatification of Lorenzo Ruiz, Pedro Calungsod, and John Paul II; the abdication of Benedict XVI from the papacy in 2013; and massive public gatherings of religious denominations such as those of Jesus Is Lord (JIL) Movement and the INC. Moreover, religious flavor is infused in some standard commercial program formats. For example, opening and closing prayers are included in <b><i>Failon Ngayon</i></b> (Failon Now) on DZMM and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1271\"><strong>Relasyon</strong></a></i></b> (Relationship) on Radyo Singko (Radio 5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A Catholic station, DZRV (RV stands for Radyo Veritas, meaning Truth Radio), is memorable for the roles it played in the country&rsquo;s recent history. The station began as the campus radio of the University of Santo Tomas in 1950. In 1969, it was transferred to the supervision of the Archdiocese of Manila, under the official name Radio Veritas and the call letters DZRV. In Aug 1983, at the height of public discontent with the Marcos regime and the hope of many to find a new leader in the person of former senator Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr, DZRV was the only radio station that aired the coverage of Aquino&rsquo;s assassination and the mammoth crowd that attended his burial, forming a funeral cortege cum protest march from the Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City to the Manila Memorial Park in Para&ntilde;aque that took at least 12 hours. DZRV was also the medium used by Jaime Cardinal Sin in Feb 1986 to call on the public to troop to EDSA to support Marcos defectors, then defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) vice chief of staff Fidel Ramos and their men. Around a million heeded Sin&rsquo;s appeal, which led to the bloodless overthrow of the Marcos government following what is now described as a display of People Power. In Jan 2001, Sin again went on the air on DZRV to rally the people to what was dubbed People Power II to overthrow the government of then president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>, which ended in the succession to the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Religions have contributed to radio and television not only in terms of content but also in the sociopolitical role of broadcasting. Combined with online media, radio and television are a site for religious expression, worship, ritual, and experience.<em><strong>Written byGian Carlo C.

In the first category, the cases range from highly publicized ones to those virtually unknown outside of law schools and law firms. Under the second category, the fictional cases are the products of the creativity and imagination of the scriptwriter, but echo the premises of real-life legal cases. Deriving program content from actual cases is less challenging than sourcing them from fiction writers, for several reasons. First, actual cases or jurisprudence belong to the public domain because they are based on existing judicial records, which are public records that are, by law, accessible to the public. For this reason, anybody may use them without being required to pay any royalties. Since no copyright exists in decisions rendered by courts of law, no copyright infringement takes place even if the name of the actual case is not mentioned in the program credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Second, there are many actual cases to choose from in existing jurisprudence. One does not even need to be a lawyer to understand these cases. Almost all cases, particularly those that are resolved by the Supreme Court, are written for the easy understanding of lay persons. Moreover, case texts and case digests (simplified summaries of cases) are available in many books and online. Third, there is no need for expensive legal research when a producer, director, or scriptwriter chooses to source the program from an actual case. All that has to be done is to rewrite the case into a teleplay. There is nothing inherently original in the rewritten material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b> (Madam Judge) was the first legal drama on radio formatted like a soap opera. Its episodes, aired on DZRH in the 1950s, were based on cases decided by Philippine courts. Like many other soaps of the period, it became so popular that it inspired a movie of the same title produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures, starring Luis Gonzales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4447\"><strong>Amalia Fuentes</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4467\"><strong>Eddie Gutierrez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4644\"><strong>Lolita Rodriguez</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Estrada. Veteran film star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4547\"><strong>Rosa Mia</strong></a> played the title role. It was some time after <b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b> folded up before legal cases again became a source of content on radio. In the 1990s, programs like <b><i>Compa&ntilde;ero y Compa&ntilde;era</i></b> and <b><i>Usapang de Campanilla</i></b> dispensed legal advice to callers faced with minor legal issues. <i>Compa&ntilde;ero</i> is a Spanish word which means colleague. Lawyers in the Philippines call a colleague in the legal profession either a compa&ntilde;ero (for males) or a compa&ntilde;era (for females). The Spanish phrase <i>de campanilla</i> is taken from <i>abogado de campanilla</i> (literally meaning a lawyer with a small bell), which means a high-end, high-charging lawyer. In turn, <i>usapang de campanilla</i> means a discourse between high-end, expensive lawyers. Both programs aired on DZMM and had television versions on ABS-CBN Channel 2. <b><i>Compa&ntilde;ero y Compa&ntilde;era</i></b> has ended its run while <b><i>Usapang de Campanilla</i></b> is still on the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On television, legal drama programs imported from the United States preceded similar local productions. Almost as soon as television became available in the Philippines, dramatizations of fictional legal cases were seen in such programs as <b><i>Perry Mason</i></b>, 1957-66, IBC Channel 13; <b><i>The New Perry Mason</i></b>, 1970s, KBS Channel 9; and <b><i>The Fugitive</i></b>, 1960s and 1980s, ABS-CBN Channel 2. The shows had a lot of courtroom drama seasoned with suspenseful cat-and-mouse adventures outside the courtroom. Imported canned legal drama continues to be seen on local television and cable channels in programs like <b><i>L.A. Law</i></b>, <b><i>Law and Order</i></b>, and <b><i>Suits</i></b>, which dramatize not only the legal cases but also the personal lives and moral dilemmas faced by the characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On local television, <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo </i></b>(Fight for It), which has been airing on and off since 1988 on IBC Channel 13, GMA Channel 7, and ABS-CBN Channel 2, was the first to dramatize actual legal cases on prime time. Hosted by lawyer Jose C. Sison, it was based on Sison&rsquo;s column in the daily <b><i>Philippine Star</i></b>, A Law Each Day, which narrates cases and explains actual decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Although Sison&rsquo;s column covered different kinds of legal cases, including land registration disputes, paternity and filiation litigations, adoption suits, and insurance claims, <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo </i></b>focused on murder, rape, robbery, and kidnapping. The strategy worked and audiences watched while similar programs were also on the air, including <b><i>Calvento Files</i></b>, 1995-98, ABS-CBN Channel 2; <b><i>S.O.C.O. (Scene of the Crime <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tives)</i></b>, 2005-11, DZMM <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1370\"><strong>Teleradyo</strong></a>; <b><i>Crime Klasik</i></b> (Crime Classic), since 2012, Aksyon TV Channel 5; and <b><i>Case Unclosed</i></b>, 2008-10, GMA Channel 7. <b><i>Crime Klasik</i></b>, whose style was copied by <b><i>Case Unclosed</i></b>, drew on more recent as well as historical cases like the separate cases of the murders of freedom fighters <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a> and Diego Silang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Inspired by American programs like <b><i>The People&rsquo;s Court</i></b>, <b><i>Judge Alex</i></b>, <b><i>Family Court with Judge Penny</i></b>, and <b><i>Street Court</i></b>, where legal arbitration instead of adversarial litigation of actual small claims and disputes is conducted on television, ABC Channel 5 experimented with <b><i>Public Atorni: Asunto o Areglo? </i></b>(Public Attorney: Lawsuit or Amicable Settlement) beginning in 2010, where lawyer Persida Rueda-Acosta of the Public Attorney&rsquo;s Office under the Department of Justice presided over the resolution of domestic quarrels and similar disputes before a live audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Legal cases continue to fascinate audiences and provide material for program content in various formats.

It was a strategy that worked for the fledgling medium. The broadcast hours had to be filled seven days a week with programs but television production is far more capital intensive than radio production, so creating television versions of tried-and-tested radio shows was less risky than gambling on new and unproven program concepts for the small screen. Besides, the first television stations were established by those already in the radio business, so migrating shows from radio to TV was unproblematic. Moreover, most of these radio shows came with performers who already had a following, thus partly guaranteeing the appeal of the television versions to TV audiences. Used to performing before live studio audiences, the radio performers adjusted nicely to performing before a camera. Having already internalized the commercial program structure of American radio and television, which follow the same logic in terms of flow from sign-on to sign-off, many of the first local television production staff were also migrants from radio, taking with them the production conventions and discipline of producing for radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Variety shows were the first radio programs that migrated successfully to television. Many shows retained the original radio titles while others modified the titles but kept the basic format. Continuing with the radio practice of airing the program live before a studio audience, <b><i>Oras ng Ligaya</i></b> and <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> are among the more memorable ones. <b><i>Oras ng Ligaya </i></b>(Happy Hour), Monday to Saturday, 5:30-7:00 pm, 1960s to early 1970s, ABS-CBN Channel 3, took off from <b><i>Tuloy ang Ligaya</i></b> (On with the Fun) on DZRH, 1960s. Of the regular hosts of <b><i>Tuloy ang Ligaya</i></b>, Sylvia La Torre and Oscar Obligacion also hosted <b><i>Oras ng Ligaya</i></b>. Eddie San Jose, who hosted <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> (Edong the Dreamer), which began as a variety show and pitted against <b><i>Tuloy ang Ligaya</i></b>, aired at around the same time on DZFM, left the said show to join La Torre and Obligacion in <b><i>Oras ng Ligaya</i></b>. Directed by film veteran actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4674\"><strong>Tony Santos</strong></a> Sr, the show included amateur song-and-dance competitions, comic skits, on-air acting auditions for kids, quizzes, and running gags. <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, on the other hand, was a daily noontime show on CBN&rsquo;s DZXL, 1950s, hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Leila Benitez, Bobby Ledesma, and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></strong>. It was aired from the canteen of CBN (before it merged with ABS) at the Manila Chronicle building on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a> St, Manila, which was visited by many students, hence the title. When it launched on CBN&rsquo;s Channel 9 in 1958, it became the first daily noontime variety show on Philippine television. It stopped airing when Ilarde entered politics in 1965, then went back on air on GMA Channel 7 from 1975 to 1986 and on RPN Channel 9 from 1989 to 1990. It had the same formula of short comic skits, running gags, quizzes, and various competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Variety show variants that adapted well to television include the amateur singing contest and the game show, both mixed with hilarious gags and comic repartees. Among these were <b><i>Tawag ng Tanghalan </i></b>(Call of the Stage), perhaps the most unforgettable amateur singing contest on Philippine radio and television, producing several notable singing stars such as Nora Aunor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\"><strong>Diomedes Maturan</strong></a>, Cenon Lagman, Novo Bono, Jonathan Potenciano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> Jr, and Ofelia Dayrit. The show first went on the air in the 1950s moving from one radio station to another until it was put on television in the 1960s. From RBS&rsquo;s DZBB, it transferred to MBC&rsquo;s DZRH, then to ABS&rsquo;s DZAQ, then CBN&rsquo;s DZXL, and finally on ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Channel 3. Among its various hosts were comedians Dolphy and Panchito while it was on radio, and Patsy and Lopito on television. In the 1950s, <b><i>Kuarta o Kahon</i></b> (Cash or Box) became the model of early game shows, the format of which is still seen in such game shows as <b><i>Deal or No Deal</i></b>. Contestants were asked relatively easy questions, and those who gave correct answers chose between a box, the contents of which was unknown, and an amount of money. It was originally the weekly show <b><i>Mahiwagang Kahon</i></b> (Mysterious Box) on DZRH in the mid-1950s when it moved to Channel 3, while at the same time it continued a radio version on DZAQ. Originally hosted by Jaime de la Rosa, the name most associated with it is Pepe Pimentel, who produced and hosted it on and off for almost four decades from the early 1960s, taking the show with him from one TV station to another (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto 2007, 510-11). Children&rsquo;s variety shows that began on radio were reproduced for television, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\"><strong>Eskuwelahan</strong></a>g Munti</i></b> (Little Schoolhouse), which first aired on RBS&rsquo;s DZBB before it aired on RBS&rsquo;s Channel 7 in the 1960s. Produced by Tinno Lapus, the show nurtured young talents, some of whom graduated to a music recording career, or film careers, or to other television shows, such as Vilma Santos, Edgar Mortiz, Esperanza Fabon, and Ike Lozada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitcoms followed variety shows in migrating to television while soaps took longer. The pioneering <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero </i></b>(Tall Tales), a situational comedy spiked with political satire, aired before World War II on KZRM, 1938-41. After the war, it was on DZBB before it moved to RBS Channel 7 in the 1950s until the early 1960s. The sitcoms <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b> (a play on &ldquo;Tatang,&rdquo; a variant of Father in Tagalog) and <b><i>Sebya Mahal Kita</i></b> (Sebya, I Love You) were evolutions of the same radio program, <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> (Edong the Dreamer) on KZFM (later DZFM) in the 1940s, which moved to DZRH in the 1950s. Written by Beer Flores, the stories progressed from <b><i>Edong Mapangarap </i></b>to <b><i>Sebya Mahal Kita</i></b> and, by the time it went on television in the 1960s, <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang</i></b>. It had the same characters portrayed by Sylvia La Torre, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a>, Bentot, and Eddie San Jose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was simple to move sitcoms from radio to television due to less complicated, static studio sets that the genre requires. Soaps were different. Writing for the ear and relying on the audience&rsquo;s imagination, writers of radio soaps did not have to bother with the visual demands of writing for the small screen. Thus, scripts that demanded simpler production designs, such as sets that could be set up in studios rather than on location, had to be written into the soaps that were reproduced for television. This was the convention until digital technology made possible the manipulation of moving images beginning in the 2000s without the need for expensive sets, costumes, and special effects, allowing more imaginative teleplays, especially in dramas that involved fantasy and horror. Nevertheless, some radio soaps were successfully reproduced for television from radio, such as <b><i>Prinsipe Amante</i></b> (Prince Amante) in the 1960s on ABS-CBN Channel 2, and the memorable <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, 1978-82 on RPN Channel 9, 1982-86 on BBC Channel 2. <b><i>Prinsipe Amante</i></b> was a soap on KZRH in the late 1940s while <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> was first a soap on Cebu radio before it was translated to Tagalog and aired from a Manila radio station, until its move to television. Of late, with the proliferation of the soap variant teleserye, some television soaps have been borrowing titles or story premises from iconic radio soaps that have defined the genre for radio, such as <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b>, on ABS-CBN Channel 2 in 2006, and the various melodramas that reflect the struggles of Filipino families, often incorporating current social realities that have traditionally been the thesis of the Philippine radio soap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most straightforward translations of radio to television were the news, commentary, and sports programs. Sports programs almost completely migrated to television, allowing audiences to visually enjoy athletic events, an experience that cannot be derived from radio. The visual character of television is its strength, and now that digital technologies continue to enhance the visual experience of audiences, radio may no longer be the principal source and influence of television.<em><strong>Written byElizabeth L.

This is the main reason why a lot of radio shows are adapted into TV. Some examples of these are the hit radio series <b><i>Sebya Mahal Kita </i></b>(Sebya, I Love You), <b><i>Gulong ng Palad </i></b>(Wheel of Fate), <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, and <b><i>Annaliza</i></b>. TV, however, has also been a rich source of material for radio and has had considerable influence on radio as a platform for art, a medium of communication, and an industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since radio has a wider reach in rural places as compared to television, creating a radio version of the TV program increases the number of its potential audience. The children&rsquo;s educational program <b><i>Batibot</i></b>, 1984-2002, aired on television stations RPN 9, PTV 4, ABS-CBN 2, and GMA 7, targeting children aged four to six, is one of the famous TV shows adapted into radio. <b><i>Radyo Batibot</i></b> was broadcast on DZAM 1026, 4:00-4:30 pm, targeting children audiences aged 7-12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DZMM 630 broadcasts many programs adapted from TV as well. One of these is <b><i>Maalaala Mo Kaya </i></b>(Will You Remember), the longest-running drama anthology in the Philippines and in Asia. It tackles and reenacts the stories of Filipinos who send their entries to the program. Its radio counterpart, <b><i>MMK sa DZMM</i></b> (MMK on DZMM), was first aired on 8 Mar 2007 at the 12:30-1:00 pm time slot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A dominant field in the TV-to-radio adaptation is the broadcast of news. Some programs aired on DZMM 630 include <b><i>TV Patrol sa DZMM</i></b> (TV Patrol on DZMM), <b><i>Failon Ngayon</i></b>, and <b><i>S.O.C.O. sa DZMM</i></b> (Scene of the Crime Operatives on DZMM). <b><i>TV Patrol sa DZMM</i></b> first aired in 2001. It is a simulcast of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s news and current affairs program <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> and <b><i>DZMM Teleradyo</i></b>. <b><i>Failon Ngayon</i></b> is a public service program that discusses present and specific issues in the country. It first aired in 2011 and runs from Monday to Friday at 8:00-10:00 am. <b><i>S.O.C.O. sa DZMM</i></b> is also a public service program that portrays crime investigation. It first aired in 2011 and runs every Thursday, 6:00-7:00 pm. GMA 7 has its television news programs <b><i>24 Oras</i></b> and <b><i>Saksi</i></b> (Witness) on its AM radio station DZBB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not only do some TV programs have their respective versions or are broadcast simultaneously on radio, television networks have also reconfigured their operations of radio broadcasting to get a bigger share of the audience. A significant development on Philippine radio broadcasting was the entry of Media Quest Holdings Inc, led by telecommunications mogul Manuel &ldquo;MVP&rdquo; Pangilinan, into FM radio on 28 Nov 2010. Pangilinan&rsquo;s group acquired the frequency 92.3 on FM and launched Radyo Singko, a news and talk-oriented radio component of TV5 of the Associated Broadcasting Company. It positioned itself as &ldquo;Ang Bagong Tunog ng FM&rdquo; (The New Sound of FM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps one of the most important indicators of television&rsquo;s close link with radio is the emergence of the <b>teleradyo</b> (television-radio), the merging of radio and television, with television transporting radio into the former&rsquo;s platform, making visible radio programs and personalities, especially those on news, talk shows, and public service programs, whose identities to audiences used to be exclusively formed by sound. Radio personalities now have to perform not just before the microphone but also in front of the camera while broadcasting from the radio booth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">TV is also a rich source of talents for radio. Many radio talents also served the artistic and industry needs of television. The reverse has also become true: personalities who first worked on television are now also asked to serve as radio voice actors, news anchors and commentators, and entertainment talk hosts.<em><strong>Written by Claudine Keith V.

Social network sites have enabled anyone with Internet access to create various user profiles that can connect and interact with other users across the globe. As of Jan 2015, the Philippines had 44.2 million Internet users and 40 million active social media accounts. The mobile platform&mdash;cellular phones and tablets&mdash;had 114.6 million connected users, about 13.7 percent more than the country&rsquo;s listed population of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>.8 million. A typical Filipino Internet user spent an average of 6 hours and 17 minutes on the Internet, and 4 hours and 15 minutes on social media daily. The top three social media platforms preferred by Filipinos in 2015 were (1) Facebook, (2) Twitter, and (3) Google+. Facebook also tops the list of the most popular mobile applications downloaded and used by Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to the popularity of the Internet and social media in the Philippines, some television and radio shows already had attempts of fostering a social media character. Beginning in 1953, Dely Magpayo, named &ldquo;First Lady of Philippine Radio&rdquo; (San Diego 2008), read letters sent from all over the Philippines and provided on-air counseling in the show <b><i>Mga Liham kay Tiya Dely</i></b> (Letters to Aunt Dely). Similarly, DWTM, known as Magic 89.9, featured DJ Joe D&rsquo; Mango and his show <b><i>Love Notes</i></b> during the late 1980s. <b><i>Love Notes</i></b> started as a 15-minute counseling program, reading letters from lovelorn listeners and pairing love advice with popular love songs of the time. Initially conceptualized as a gimmick, <b><i>Love Notes</i></b> became a hit for office workers during Friday mornings, and was later developed as a TV show and a movie. ABS-CBN&rsquo;s <b><i>Maalaala Mo Kaya </i></b>(Will You Remember), which premiered in 1988, was originally a 13-part miniseries to be written and directed by Lino Brocka. Brocka managed to finish only three episodes before his death in 1991. When aired, the episodes received rave reviews from critics, prompting the network to continue the show. <b><i>Maalaala Mo Kaya</i></b> then followed the format of another popular show, GMA&rsquo;s <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>, replacing fictional stories with stories sent by viewers. The noontime variety show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!) has incorporated the idea of a &ldquo;home partner&rdquo; in some of its segments. This allowed home viewers to share cash prizes with in-studio contestants. These types of shows offered a sense of interactivity and participation, albeit limited, among the content creators and the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advancements in telecommunications opened more opportunities for innovation. Short message service (SMS) or texting was the platform used by the youth-oriented drama show <b><i>K2BU</i></b> on ABS-CBN Channel 2 to allow viewers to affect the outcome of an episode by texting keywords to the show (Johnston 2002). SMS voting was utilized to determine the series finale of the teleserye <b><i>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</i></b> (I Wish This Were Forever). The teleserye production team filmed two alternate episodes, one with a grand wedding between the characters Christian and Arabella (played by Jericho Rosales and Kristine Hermosa), another a grand wedding between Arabella and Leo (played by Diether Ocampo). The voting ended an hour before the last episode. The winning finale, the wedding of Christian and Arabella, was aired simultaneously on ABS-CBN Channel 2 and its radio arm DZMM, with a live viewing event held at Plaza Miranda. The next evening, the other finale was shown as a special. <b><i>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</i></b> also facilitated an online voting through abs-cbn.com to cater to their international viewers, particularly subscribers of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s The Filipino Channel, which is based in San Francisco, California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Utilizing social media meant faster and more efficient user-centered interaction between content creators and target audience. Pop station DWRX 93.1 expanded its reach by adding station Facebook and Twitter accounts in 2009. Its early morning radio talk show <b><i>The Morning Rush</i></b>, which first aired in 1996, increased its popularity when it established <b><i>The Morning Rush</i></b> Facebook and Twitter pages in 2011. The show&rsquo;s most popular segment, the &ldquo;Top 10,&rdquo; involves listeners who respond via Twitter to a post by the hosts, who then pick the 10 best entries submitted within the duration of the show. Through the use of hashtags, the audience sees the contributions updated in real time, including the contributions that were not picked and announced as part of the Top 10 list. Seeing the trends set by the show also meant seeing and possibly interacting with the show&rsquo;s listeners via their respective social media handles. The Facebook page complements this interactivity, providing a space to post contributions to the daily Top 10 list, as well as upload additional multimedia content such as posters, video links, event photos, in-studio concert videos, and greetings from the show&rsquo;s fans. The use of social media not only influences content but also amplifies the sense of community between producers, hosts, and the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2007, GMA through its digital news arm GMA News TV, launched YouScoop, an online space that allowed Internet users to share photographs and video clips, allowing the public to make their own news &ldquo;scoop.&rdquo; Submitted entries from registered YouScoop users are featured regularly on the GMA news programs <b><i>Saksi</i></b> (Witness) and <b><i>24 Oras </i></b>(24 Hours), and are also shared on their respective Facebook and Twitter pages. ABS-CBN launched a more specialized news campaign in 2010 through <b><i>Boto Mo Ipatrol Mo</i></b> (Guard Your Vote). The campaign tapped the ordinary Filipino netizen, dubbed Boto Patrollers, to provide coverage and assessment of the 2010 national elections. The project received reports through a daily average of 500 e-mails, 103 calls, and 3,058 texts during the electoral campaign. <b><i>Boto Mo Ipatrol Mo</i></b> peaked with 87,419 Boto Patrollers in its database, 125,487 fans on Facebook, 23,111 supporters on Twitter, 6,960 members on its microsite, and 3,701 members on the now-defunct platform Multiply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 2011, &ldquo;trending&rdquo; had become a way of feeling the public pulse (Calonzo 2011). Searching and developing trending social network topics had become important aspects of TV and radio content. Vice Ganda, host of the television shows <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b> and <b><i>Gandang Gabi Vice</i></b> (Good Evening, Vice) on ABS-CBN Channel 2, coined and popularized &ldquo;Vice Ganda-isms&rdquo; such as <i>boom panes</i> (flop), <i>push mo &rsquo;yan, teh</i> (Go, sister), and <i>eksaherada</i> (exaggerated), with the help of Twitter and Facebook (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\"><strong>Star Cinema</strong></a> 2014). Some of these buzzwords have inspired hit songs, recorded and performed by Vice Ganda himself, such as &ldquo;Push Mo Yan &rsquo;Teh&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boom Panes&rdquo; (<i>ABS-CBN News</i> 2014). The platform Instagram was tapped by <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b> following a segment where Vice Ganda interviewed 16-year-old Pamela Reyes. A victim of bullying, Reyes sought advice from Vice Ganda. Vice Ganda, who identifies as gay, responded by removing his contact lens and wig on the air and enjoining the audience to post pictures of themselves without makeup or the use of a camera filter. Vice Ganda uploaded a photo of his bare face on Instagram with the hashtag #ProudToBeMe. It went viral, quickly and massively spreading among social media users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Social media have become a platform for local artists to gain celebrity status by participating in online campaigns that go viral. <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> hosts Wally Bayola, Jose Manalo, Paolo Ballesteros, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\"><strong>Aiza Seguerra</strong></a> have famously joined the &ldquo;makeup transformation challenge,&rdquo; where challengers post step-by-step pictures of makeup application to look like a totally different person (<b><i>Summit Express</i></b> 2014). Popular love team Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla joined the &ldquo;ALS Ice Bucket Challenge,&rdquo; a campaign where people post pictures or videos of themselves being doused with ice-cold water to raise awareness and gather research funds for the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS (<b><i>Rappler </i></b>2014). Charice Pempengco, Arnel Pineda, Zendee Rose Tenerefe, Aldrich Lloyd Talonding, and James Walter Bucong all had viral videos of their song performances on YouTube, which landed them in the American talk show <b><i>Ellen</i></b>. The mobile application Dubsmash, which enables users to record videos of themselves mimicking lines from popular movies and songs, became a venue for local actors and ordinary netizens to compete for local and global celebrity. The Indonesian magazine <b><i>Sumatera Ekspres</i></b> featured actors Teejay Marquez and Miguel Tan Felix after they posted their Dubsmash lip-synching of the song &ldquo;Twerk It Like Miley,&rdquo; while Maine Mendoza&rsquo;s Dubsmash impressions of Kris Aquino captured not only the interest of online netizens but also the eyes of the <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> producers. The video, gaining a million views in just 24 hours, was Mendoza&rsquo;s key to an interview on the program, which gave her the character name Divina Ursula Bukbukova Smash or Yaya Dub, the assistant of Wally Bayola&rsquo;s Lola Nidora in <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Juan for All, All for Juan&rdquo; segment. Yaya Dub subsequently became half of the phenomenal love team AlDub, with GMA artist Alden Richards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Currently, network stations such as TV5 create and develop content sourced from social media and shared through all the station&rsquo;s platforms. Programs such as <b><i>Wattpad Presents</i></b> tap the mobile application Wattpad&mdash;a literary platform founded in 2006 that houses writings from registered users, with a majority of material focused on romantic stories&mdash;for its content. The TV5 website offers live streaming, video on demand, uploads of previously aired TV episodes, and content designed specifically for online users. Tagged as TV5 Originals, the featured shows range from 2 to 10 minutes and are uploaded simultaneously on the network&rsquo;s social media accounts. Initially, the shows featured in TV5 Originals were aired only in social media and in the TV5 website. Lately, programs such as <b><i>Tanods</i></b> (Guards) and <b><i>Phenoms</i></b> are aired both online and on analog and cable TV. TV5 Originals also hosts the radio podcast show <b><i>Good Times with Mo</i></b>, allowing the Filipino audience to interact with now US-based DJ Mo Twister. Having tie-ups with online streaming services for desktop and mobile tools, such as iFlix for television and Spotify for radio, and affordable mobile promos for Internet social media usage prepares the stations for the plan to shift broadcasting in the country from analog transmissions to 100 percent digital frequencies by 2020. Creating websites like the news portal Interaksyon.com&mdash;online portals dedicated to social media content management and distribution&mdash;not only proves social media&rsquo;s viability as a main source and influence in the creation and management of broadcast content but also as a possible alternative medium to experience TV and radio.<em><strong>Written byVladimeir B.

Moreover, social realities experienced by the broadcasters and their audiences pervade radio and television shows, such as true-to-life events, religion, and legal cases. Furthermore, broadcasters and production staff, as well as the structure of programming, production designs and the conventions and practices of production, and the technological foundations of Philippine broadcasting are shaped by internal and external forces, such as the effects of radio and television on each other, and the impact of foreign broadcasting on the manner in which Filipino broadcasters craft Philippine radio and television."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Such sources and influences, and even appropriations as in the case of foreign broadcasting, do not occur singularly in each program, but combine and clash in the daily radio and television productions, often with imaginative results. For example, a character may be an amalgam of a mythical Filipino deity and fictional Western superhero, whose story is reinterpreted locally with a Filipino brand of folk fantasy, melodramatic narrative, or comedic satire. Neither are the influences and appropriations linear. Traditionally, the route of adaptation had been from a source like literature, to radio, to film, and then television. In recent decades, the path of adaptation has taken any course and even simultaneously. All these as broadcast technologies and production methods change, and as Filipino social realities and experiences evolve and shift."

The drama and sarsuwela are two different dramatic genres&#x2014;the first is a straight play in prose, while the second is a prose play with songs and dances&#x2014;but they pursue identical or at least similar sociocultural themes, like the conflict between the rich and the poor in love and business, the colonial mentality of Filipinos, the corruption of politicians, vote-buying during elections, cockfighting and other vices, infidelity of husband or wife, divorce, social climbing, and misunderstandings between parents and children. Such themes may be treated in comic or satirical fashion in the <i>drama comico</i> or sarsuwela, or in tragic mode in the melodrama, also called <i>drama tragico</i>. Characters in the drama and sarsuwela are based on real social types (politicians, gamblers, peasants, workers, parents, children, lovers), but they are so idealized that they may also be categorized as bida and kontrabida. Heroes and heroines as well as villains and vixens are identified as such by their costumes and makeup, style of acting and dialogue delivery, and types of songs. So are the witty servant-comedians. Lastly, drama and sarsuwela most commonly have plots whose conflicts are resolved gratuitously by coincidences and other dei ex machina and whose narrative closure must always affirm the political, social, and moral values of the ruling establishment."

Although bodabil drew heavily from American popular culture, bodabil artists managed to indigenize the form through the use of topical or issue-based humor, local adaptations of American songs, locally conceptualized production numbers, local variations or modifications of foreign dances and costumes, popularization of local counterparts of foreign singers, and creation of original Filipino songs using the musical template of American pop songs. The bodabil stage trained and built up some of the most famous singers, dancers, and comedians who, because of their popularity and talent, were sought out by the first producers and writers in broadcast media, who in many cases also had roots in or were exposed to bodabil."

Through literature classes, the younger generation of directors in the 1960s and 1970s encountered modernism in the plays of European playwrights like Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg and American writers like Arthur Miller and Tennessee <a href=\"/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s. Writing in the mode of realism favored by these foreign playwrights, Filipino writers like Nick Joaquin, Alberto Florentino, and Nestor Torre Jr wrote plays in English which were translated into Filipino and produced for television in shows like <b><i>Balintataw</i></b>. Later, film directors trained in literature and theater directed drama anthologies with realistic plots and characters, such as <b><i>Hilda</i></b>, <b><i>Lino Brocka Presents</i></b>, and <b><i>Ang Makulay na Daigdig ni Nora</i></b>. In these productions, realism permeates the choice of costumes, sets, and, most of all, the internalized acting which gives life to highly individualized characters. Because such stories usually had endings that were often open-ended or downright tragic, TV producers have avoided such narratives, preferring the feel-good, if unrealistic and escapist, closures typical of traditional theater.<em><strong>Written by<a href=\"/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

The turn of the 21st century saw some komiks materials and foreign graphic novels being directly adapted for television and, more recently, into independent productions, mainly in digital animation, that are primarily circulated in emerging media platforms, such as the Internet, personal blog sites, and social media. In the 20th century, adaptations of komiks followed a more or less predictable route: from komiks to radio, to film, and finally television. Radio was a testing ground for the acceptability of komiks characters and narratives on the big screen. Once tested, many such characters and narratives are reproduced for the small screen.

Lately, an emerging trend is the introduction of major changes in the narrative, settings, character traits, character history and development, costume designs, and visual effects, as well as the inception of new characters and new forms of superpower and human weaknesses. For example, the muscular Captain Barbell was given a new look when first adapted for film and later for TV. He was shirtless as a superhero, with an eye mask, in the komiks, but donned a yellow muscle-accentuated costume to highlight the build of the actors, who were not bodybuilders, in the character&#x2019;s appearances on film and TV. In the 2006 and 2011 <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b> TV series, the logo &#x201C;CB&#x201D; was added on the chest of the hero&#x2019;s redesigned costume, and given a new weakness, which is exposure to the mineral element Askobar. In the 2005 <b><i>Darna</i></b> TV series, the heroine was shown possessing a heat vision as an addition to her arsenal of weapons, such as bracelets to deflect bullets, the ruby stone to augment her strength, and the white stone that she swallows to transform herself into a superhero. Darna&#x2019;s two-piece bikini suit has likewise undergone several changes, which is becoming skimpier in later broadcast adaptations. Kapitan Kidlat&#x2019;s red costume in komiks became primarily black in the 2013 TV series.

Radio personalities were considered brighter stars than movie actors; the former were heard on the air every day while the latter appeared in just a few movies a year.

Sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble (now Philippine Manufacturing Company), the show was written by society columnist Lina Flor, whose sister Loida Flores Viri&#xF1;a, then a working student, played the lead character Luisa. Viri&#xF1;a later wrote the enormously popular original TV version of <b><i>Gulong ng Palad </i></b>from 1977 to 1985, which starred Marianne dela Riva and Ronald Corveau and aired first over BBC Channel 2 and later on RPN Channel 9. In 2006, ABS-CBN Channel 2 revived the serial, this time starring Kristine Hermosa and TJ Trinidad. Soap became the most popular TV format in 1996 when RPN Channel 9 aired the Mexican telenovela <b><i>Marimar</i></b> starring Thalia Sodi Miranda. True-to-life events remained the main source of drama material, but situations were treated in various degrees or types of dramatization, from melodrama to romance-comedy or &#x201C;romcom.&#x201D; By the 1990s, television had become much more accessible to the masses. A significant demographic group among the audiences was the lower middle class, who avidly watched <b><i>Marimar</i></b>. When the show topped the ratings in 1996, it was a cue for the networks to produce more drama serials that depict the lives of ordinary people."

It was a strategy that worked for the fledgling medium. The broadcast hours had to be filled seven days a week with programs but television production is far more capital intensive than radio production, so creating television versions of tried-and-tested radio shows was less risky than gambling on new and unproven program concepts for the small screen. Besides, the first television stations were established by those already in the radio business, so migrating shows from radio to TV was unproblematic. Moreover, most of these radio shows came with performers who already had a following, thus partly guaranteeing the appeal of the television versions to TV audiences. Used to performing before live studio audiences, the radio performers adjusted nicely to performing before a camera. Having already internalized the commercial program structure of American radio and television, which follow the same logic in terms of flow from sign-on to sign-off, many of the first local television production staff were also migrants from radio, taking with them the production conventions and discipline of producing for radio."

Writing for the ear and relying on the audience&#x2019;s imagination, writers of radio soaps did not have to bother with the visual demands of writing for the small screen. Thus, scripts that demanded simpler production designs, such as sets that could be set up in studios rather than on location, had to be written into the soaps that were reproduced for television. This was the convention until digital technology made possible the manipulation of moving images beginning in the 2000s without the need for expensive sets, costumes, and special effects, allowing more imaginative teleplays, especially in dramas that involved fantasy and horror. Nevertheless, some radio soaps were successfully reproduced for television from radio, such as <b><i>Prinsipe Amante</i></b> (Prince Amante) in the 1960s on ABS-CBN Channel 2, and the memorable <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, 1978-82 on RPN Channel 9, 1982-86 on BBC Channel 2. <b><i>Prinsipe Amante</i></b> was a soap on KZRH in the late 1940s while <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> was first a soap on Cebu radio before it was translated to Tagalog and aired from a Manila radio station, until its move to television. Of late, with the proliferation of the soap variant teleserye, some television soaps have been borrowing titles or story premises from iconic radio soaps that have defined the genre for radio, such as <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b>, on ABS-CBN Channel 2 in 2006, and the various melodramas that reflect the struggles of Filipino families, often incorporating current social realities that have traditionally been the thesis of the Philippine radio soap."

Creating websites like the news portal Interaksyon.com&#x2014;online portals dedicated to social media content management and distribution&#x2014;not only proves social media&#x2019;s viability as a main source and influence in the creation and management of broadcast content but also as a possible alternative medium to experience TV and radio.<em><strong>Written byVladimeir B.
