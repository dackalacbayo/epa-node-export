		"text": "<p>Acting is the art of representing a character. The manner of representing character has developed through history and changed with the different traditions&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432\">ethnic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/433\">Hispanic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/434\">American</a>&mdash;that prevailed in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ethnic communities, acting was seen in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">dances</a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>. Dances about folk occupations, for example, would have dancers representing tuba gatherers, orange pickers, fishers, honey gatherers, rice planters, harvesters, winnowers, pounders. Dances&mdash;often comic&mdash;about animals would have the actor-dancers representing various kinds of birds (hawks, sandpipers, woodpeckers, etc.), fish, monkeys, flies, and monitor lizards&mdash;with movements that show the dancers&rsquo; degree of sensitivity to the animals around them. In these dances, the dancer can choose to present the animal quite graphically, as in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/60\">itik-itik</a>, where the arms and the feet move quite literally as a duckling does; or symbolically, as in the Higaonon banog-banog, in which the moving tubao or kerchief is held with two hands and waved continuously in opposite directions to represent a bird in flight. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> pangasik, the man&rsquo;s arm movements, the rippling of his muscles, and the intensity of his purpose represent the mating rooster, this in turn being a metaphor for the encounter of man and woman. Other dances narrate episodes from epics. In the singkil, the main female dancer plays the role of the beautiful Princess Gandingan who avoids the earthquake and falling trees represented by the clashing bamboos and is saved by the principal male dancer who represents Prince Bantugan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In rituals, the principal actor, the babaylan (high priest or priestess), not only represents but also takes on the person of the god or spirit, and his/her dance, chant, actions, or mime come from a vision&mdash;deep within a trance, sometimes&mdash;of the action of the spirit. This kind of acting has no conventions, and cannot be acquired from training. It wells up from the faith and ethos of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Spanish colonial theater, acting is determined by the characters to be played: the <strong>personahe</strong> (literally, &ldquo;character&rdquo; in Spanish) and how they are perceived by the folk. This is the first intimation of an acting style, which is directly and simply representational, aimed at communicating the perceived qualities of each character.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the personahe may be divided into the <strong>bida</strong> (protagonist) and the <strong>kontrabida</strong> (antagonist). Bida comes from Spanish&nbsp;<em>vida</em>, meaning &ldquo;life,&rdquo; probably derived from the various&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>) whose titles identified the main character in the narrative&mdash;for example, <strong><em>Vida de Atamante</em></strong> (Life of Atamante), ca. 1887. The bida is depicted as ideally good, moral, and refined; the kontrabida as absolutely bad, immoral, and uncouth. Other subsidiary personahe are good or bad, depending on the principal character with whom they align themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, the personahe are divided into the <strong>banal</strong> (holy characters), which include Christ, the Virgin, the Apostles, and all who believe in Christ; and the <strong>hudyo</strong> (literally, Jews), who interestingly enough include not only Herod, Annas, and Caiaphas but also Pontius Pilate, the Roman soldiers, and all who persecute Christ. The banal, who are the bida, chant or speak in languid tones, march to a funereal one-step&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><em>marcha</em></a>, and move their hands meekly, if at all; while the hudyo, the kontrabida, speak in crisp tempo, march to a double-step<em>paso doble</em>, and act arrogantly and cruelly toward those they oppress. The comedic <strong>dimonyo</strong> (devil) is a class to himself. In the modern sinakulo, in which chanting has been eliminated, actors tend to speak and move like the stereotyped heroes and villains of popular cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, which most commonly features epic conflicts between royal personages and their courts in medieval Europe and the Middle East, characters are usually divided into <strong>cristianos</strong> who belong to European kingdoms, like Espanya, Portugal, Alemanya, Italia, Francia, Dinamarka, Napolis, and Albania; and Moros who belong to Persia, Turquia, or Arabia. The bida in a komedya is always a Christian noble, brave in battle, loyal to the ruler, obedient to parents, and constant in love, and the princess, modest and feminine, obedient to an even greater degree, faithful in the extreme. The personahe of Christian kingdoms follow a clear hierarchy: from <strong>hari</strong> (king), <strong>reyna </strong> (queen), <strong>prinsipe </strong> (prince), <strong>prinsesa</strong> (princess), to <strong>duque </strong> (duke), <strong>duquesa</strong> (duchess), <strong>markes </strong> (marquis), <strong>markesa</strong> (marquise), <strong>konseheros</strong> (counselors), <strong>heneral </strong> (general), <strong>soldados</strong> (soldiers), to the <strong>bilyanos </strong> (peasants) and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> (shepherds). Similarly, the personahe of Moro kingdoms range from <strong>kalip </strong> (caliph), <strong>visir</strong> (vizier), <strong>emir </strong> and <strong>sultan</strong>, to the prinsesa, prinsipe, konseheros, and soldados. In addition to these, each kingdom has an <strong>embahador </strong> (ambassador) and a <strong>pusong</strong> or <strong>lokayo </strong> (jester, clown), while <strong>torneos </strong> (tournaments) require a <strong>mantenedor </strong> (referee, tournament master). All characters in a komedya are supposed to be fierce and valiant in the face of the enemy. However, the Christians are distinguished by their nobility, strict sense of justice and polished manners, while the Moors, in contrast, are shown as tyrannical, murderous, and coarse.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, the personahe are no longer as foreign as those in the komedya or sinakulo. They are types drawn from contemporary Philippine society: cockfighters, usurers, gamblers, conservative se&ntilde;oritas, aristocratic dons and do&ntilde;as, &ldquo;Americanized&rdquo; girls, peasants, workers, fishermen, servants, flower vendors, law students, money-minded or lustful priests, and more recently, overseas Filipino workers. Although these are familiar characters in Philippine society, they are not depicted as individuals but as idealized types who are still classified as bida or kontrabida depending on their stances regarding the issue at hand. Thus, if the play is against usury, the usurers and their cohorts are villains, while those against the vice are heroes. The <strong>bagongtao</strong> (young man), the stereotyped bida, is usually brave, softhearted, long-suffering, loyal and obedient to family, and forever faithful, while the <strong>dalaga</strong> (young lady) is beautiful and modest, obedient to parents, pious and kind, stronghearted, and absolutely faithful in love. Either one may be rich or poor, unlettered or educated. The kontrabida is usually sleek, sophisticated, and scheming if a man, while seductive, wily, and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; if a woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>&mdash;especially straight melodrama&mdash;which also focuses on Filipino types and contemporary issues, characterization is similar to that of the sarsuwela, although the melodrama tends toward characters marked for tragedy, and are therefore played to be given to sighs and prone to tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comic roles among the above deserve attention. In the komedya, the clown may be a royal character&rsquo;s lackey, sympathizing with an unhappy prince, or accompanying a disguised princess into battle, doing battle himself with a too-short or too-long sword, tricking the enemy, complaining about hunger, weariness, or low pay. In the sinakulo, he may be an invented character or a comic interpretation of a standard character, like a drunken, dancing Judas, or one trying to cheat in the counting of 30 pieces of silver; or a shepherd or a Roman soldier; or Samuel Belibet, the wandering Jew, weary of walking through eons, and growing shorter because he is so worn-out; or the Dimonyo, who is often played as a trickster. In the sarsuwela, the comic is usually a servant who carries messages to and fro; announces meals and happenings, such as an elopement or a quarrel; is scolded and made fun of for being inept, ignorant, or a bumpkin; complains about the master/mistress, or about food rations, hunger, state of life, or low salary. In komedya, the <strong>pusong</strong> (also called <strong>lokayo</strong>, <strong>alikayo</strong>, <strong>pusong-pusongan</strong>, <strong>bol-bollagao</strong>, <strong>grasyoso</strong>, <strong>komedyano</strong>) is free to improvise upon the lines, which in some cases are not written down at all, as well as to inject commentary on the characters of the play, the real-life characters in town, or the audience. They are also free to improvise their acting style&mdash;playing down, playing themselves, talking and acting bawdy, mimicking other important characters, and bringing them down to earth, or all of the above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the American colonial and post-World War II periods, modern stage acting became informed and enriched by Western acting styles. This is when an acting style with a philosophy behind it entered Philippine theater. At first, the styles explored by the actors were simply for the purpose of following the instructions and interpretations of the directors: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3005\">Henry Lee Irwin</a>, SJ, with the Ateneo Drama Guild; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3207\">James B.

Regional theaters, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3183\">Portal Players</a> of Silliman University, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a>, Cebu Central Colleges Theater Workshop Company, Dramatic Arts Guild of Iloilo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2751\">Arts Research and Training Institute in Southern Tagalog Inc</a>, also exercised training with specific acting styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The craft of Stanislavsky&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the work of grasping the true nature of each emotion through one&rsquo;s own powers of observation, of developing one&rsquo;s attention for such a task, and of consciously mastering the art of entering the creative circle&rdquo;&mdash;became the guides for most actors of English-language and &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stanislavsky&rsquo;s style was already visible in the Barangay Theater Guild production of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong><em>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</em></strong></a>, 1955, and was exemplified in the famous &ldquo;blackout&rdquo; scene by Daisy Hontiveros-Avellana and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2855\">Naty Crame-Rogers</a>. It was also evident in the PETA production of Loy Arcenas&rsquo;s <strong><em>Arbol de Fuego</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>&rsquo;s 2015 Filipino adaptation of Anton Chekhov&rsquo;s <em>Cherry Orchard</em>, and epitomized in the final scene when the old servant, played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4640\">Bembol Roco</a>, slumps on the floor after realizing he is left behind in the estate as Arbol de Fuego trees get cut around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other strong influence on acting style in the modern theater is Brecht, who created a theater of instruction that sought a critical rather than an emotional reaction to the social ideas discussed on stage. Brecht proposed a style of theater that &ldquo;alienated&rdquo; the audience: &ldquo;The aim of this technique, known as the alienation effect &hellip; [is] to create a distance between the actor and the spectator that will encourage the audience to be critical of what the play is saying.&rdquo; Its method is for the actor not to &ldquo;become&rdquo; but to &ldquo;present&rdquo; the character and its meaning. Rolando S. Tinio did this in his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a></em></strong> (Reason Has Its Reason), 1972, with actors not only presenting the archetypal landlord and <strong>kasama</strong> (sharecropper) but also facing the audience and quizzing them in song. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/444\">Brechtian</a>&nbsp;style has been especially effective in political plays, such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/607\"><strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong></a> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977, about Valentin de los Santos and the Lapiang Malaya massacre, and even in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/576\"><strong><em>Kabesang Tales</em></strong></a> (Cabeza Tales), 1975, in which the trials of a whole family were presented not to evoke tears but criticism. Similarly, in recent times, the Sipat Lawin Ensemble actors are informed by Grotowski, and practice Steiner&rsquo;s pedagogy of feeling, thinking, and willing, addressing the concern from performance to performative everyday within our culture&rsquo;s context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restraint and spirituality of Japanese Noh drama has also been studied and attempted&mdash;for example, in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/633\"><strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni&nbsp;<strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Sisa&rsquo;s Quest), 1976. So has the comic quality of kyogen been Filipinized in Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Madyik na Sombrero</em></strong> (The Magic Hat), 1976. More recently, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3245\">Dexter Santos</a> fused principles of Indian dances with his movement style when he choreographed and directed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3193\">Floy Quintos</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Nawalang Kapatid</em></strong> (The Missing Sibling), 2013, adapted from the Indian epic <strong><em>Mahabharata</em></strong>. In the updated sinakulo and sarsuwela there has been an effort to mediate between the representational style of tradition and a more contemporary interpretation of character. The komedya, for which there are few new texts or directors, and which has therefore not been updated or changed much, has absorbed some influence from the movies, and is no longer as mannered as it once was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As productions explored different acting styles, formal actor&rsquo;s training for actors who do not go abroad was established in the Philippines. Two of the most well-known institutions for acting training are UP Diliman&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2899\">Department of Speech Communication and Theater Arts</a> and its production arm, Dulaang UP, founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3065\">Antonio Mabesa</a> in 1976; and Tanghalang Pilipino&rsquo;s Actor&rsquo;s Company, founded by Nonon Padilla in 1987. Institutions and theater companies such as the above were able to produce strong actors and actresses. Dulaang UP produced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2834\">Shamaine Centenera-Buencamino</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2721\">Irma Adlawan</a>, both of whom became members of the Actor&rsquo;s Company. The Actor&rsquo;s Company was the formal training ground for the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4292\">Angeli </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\">Bayani</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2811\">Roeder Cama&ntilde;ag</a>. PETA birthed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2960\">CB Garrucho</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3042\">Connie Lauigan</a>, among others; and Repertory Philippines headlined <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3041\">Menchu Lauchengco-Yulo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\">Lea Salonga</a>.

Dances about folk occupations, for example, would have dancers representing tuba gatherers, orange pickers, fishers, honey gatherers, rice planters, harvesters, winnowers, pounders. Dances&#x2014;often comic&#x2014;about animals would have the actor-dancers representing various kinds of birds (hawks, sandpipers, woodpeckers, etc.), fish, monkeys, flies, and monitor lizards&#x2014;with movements that show the dancers&#x2019; degree of sensitivity to the animals around them. In these dances, the dancer can choose to present the animal quite graphically, as in the <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> <a href=\"/6/46/60\">itik-itik</a>, where the arms and the feet move quite literally as a duckling does; or symbolically, as in the Higaonon banog-banog, in which the moving tubao or kerchief is held with two hands and waved continuously in opposite directions to represent a bird in flight. In the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> pangasik, the man&#x2019;s arm movements, the rippling of his muscles, and the intensity of his purpose represent the mating rooster, this in turn being a metaphor for the encounter of man and woman. Other dances narrate episodes from epics. In the singkil, the main female dancer plays the role of the beautiful Princess Gandingan who avoids the earthquake and falling trees represented by the clashing bamboos and is saved by the principal male dancer who represents Prince Bantugan."

The banal, who are the bida, chant or speak in languid tones, march to a funereal one-step&#xA0;<a href=\"/5/35/784\"><em>marcha</em></a>, and move their hands meekly, if at all; while the hudyo, the kontrabida, speak in crisp tempo, march to a double-step<em>paso doble</em>, and act arrogantly and cruelly toward those they oppress. The comedic <strong>dimonyo</strong> (devil) is a class to himself. In the modern sinakulo, in which chanting has been eliminated, actors tend to speak and move like the stereotyped heroes and villains of popular cinema."

The bida in a komedya is always a Christian noble, brave in battle, loyal to the ruler, obedient to parents, and constant in love, and the princess, modest and feminine, obedient to an even greater degree, faithful in the extreme. The personahe of Christian kingdoms follow a clear hierarchy: from <strong>hari</strong> (king), <strong>reyna </strong> (queen), <strong>prinsipe </strong> (prince), <strong>prinsesa</strong> (princess), to <strong>duque </strong> (duke), <strong>duquesa</strong> (duchess), <strong>markes </strong> (marquis), <strong>markesa</strong> (marquise), <strong>konseheros</strong> (counselors), <strong>heneral </strong> (general), <strong>soldados</strong> (soldiers), to the <strong>bilyanos </strong> (peasants) and <a href=\"/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> (shepherds). Similarly, the personahe of Moro kingdoms range from <strong>kalip </strong> (caliph), <strong>visir</strong> (vizier), <strong>emir </strong> and <strong>sultan</strong>, to the prinsesa, prinsipe, konseheros, and soldados. In addition to these, each kingdom has an <strong>embahador </strong> (ambassador) and a <strong>pusong</strong> or <strong>lokayo </strong> (jester, clown), while <strong>torneos </strong> (tournaments) require a <strong>mantenedor </strong> (referee, tournament master). All characters in a komedya are supposed to be fierce and valiant in the face of the enemy.

Although these are familiar characters in Philippine society, they are not depicted as individuals but as idealized types who are still classified as bida or kontrabida depending on their stances regarding the issue at hand. Thus, if the play is against usury, the usurers and their cohorts are villains, while those against the vice are heroes. The <strong>bagongtao</strong> (young man), the stereotyped bida, is usually brave, softhearted, long-suffering, loyal and obedient to family, and forever faithful, while the <strong>dalaga</strong> (young lady) is beautiful and modest, obedient to parents, pious and kind, stronghearted, and absolutely faithful in love. Either one may be rich or poor, unlettered or educated. The kontrabida is usually sleek, sophisticated, and scheming if a man, while seductive, wily, and &#x201C;modern&#x201D; if a woman."

In the sinakulo, he may be an invented character or a comic interpretation of a standard character, like a drunken, dancing Judas, or one trying to cheat in the counting of 30 pieces of silver; or a shepherd or a Roman soldier; or Samuel Belibet, the wandering Jew, weary of walking through eons, and growing shorter because he is so worn-out; or the Dimonyo, who is often played as a trickster. In the sarsuwela, the comic is usually a servant who carries messages to and fro; announces meals and happenings, such as an elopement or a quarrel; is scolded and made fun of for being inept, ignorant, or a bumpkin; complains about the master/mistress, or about food rations, hunger, state of life, or low salary. In komedya, the <strong>pusong</strong> (also called <strong>lokayo</strong>, <strong>alikayo</strong>, <strong>pusong-pusongan</strong>, <strong>bol-bollagao</strong>, <strong>grasyoso</strong>, <strong>komedyano</strong>) is free to improvise upon the lines, which in some cases are not written down at all, as well as to inject commentary on the characters of the play, the real-life characters in town, or the audience. They are also free to improvise their acting style&#x2014;playing down, playing themselves, talking and acting bawdy, mimicking other important characters, and bringing them down to earth, or all of the above."

				"value": "The other strong influence on acting style in the modern theater is Brecht, who created a theater of instruction that sought a critical rather than an emotional reaction to the social ideas discussed on stage. Brecht proposed a style of theater that &#x201C;alienated&#x201D; the audience: &#x201C;The aim of this technique, known as the alienation effect &#x2026; [is] to create a distance between the actor and the spectator that will encourage the audience to be critical of what the play is saying.&#x201D; Its method is for the actor not to &#x201C;become&#x201D; but to &#x201C;present&#x201D; the character and its meaning. Rolando S. Tinio did this in his <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a></em></strong> (Reason Has Its Reason), 1972, with actors not only presenting the archetypal landlord and <strong>kasama</strong> (sharecropper) but also facing the audience and quizzing them in song. The <a href=\"/7/55/444\">Brechtian</a>&#xA0;style has been especially effective in political plays, such as <a href=\"/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/607\"><strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong></a> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977, about Valentin de los Santos and the Lapiang Malaya massacre, and even in <a href=\"/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/576\"><strong><em>Kabesang Tales</em></strong></a> (Cabeza Tales), 1975, in which the trials of a whole family were presented not to evoke tears but criticism. Similarly, in recent times, the Sipat Lawin Ensemble actors are informed by Grotowski, and practice Steiner&#x2019;s pedagogy of feeling, thinking, and willing, addressing the concern from performance to performative everyday within our culture&#x2019;s context."

So has the comic quality of kyogen been Filipinized in Lape&#xF1;a-Bonifacio&#x2019;s <strong><em>Ang Madyik na Sombrero</em></strong> (The Magic Hat), 1976. More recently, <a href=\"/7/60/3245\">Dexter Santos</a> fused principles of Indian dances with his movement style when he choreographed and directed <a href=\"/7/60/3193\">Floy Quintos</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Ang Nawalang Kapatid</em></strong> (The Missing Sibling), 2013, adapted from the Indian epic <strong><em>Mahabharata</em></strong>. In the updated sinakulo and sarsuwela there has been an effort to mediate between the representational style of tradition and a more contemporary interpretation of character. The komedya, for which there are few new texts or directors, and which has therefore not been updated or changed much, has absorbed some influence from the movies, and is no longer as mannered as it once was."

		"text": "<p>Audience in theater consists of the viewers and spectators, those who are not performers. The time for theater is the occasion or time/times set aside for performance as well as the length of performance. The space for theater is that&mdash;indoor or outdoor, enclosed or open&mdash;in which the performance takes place. Together, they define the context of theater and to some extent shape it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The occasions for early Philippine theater rose out of the landmarks of daily life: birth, illness, rites of passage, occupations, battle, courtship, marriage, death. This theater was therefore not set on stages, since rituals and song/dance dramas were enacted in clearings or in fields, and ceremonies and verbal jousts at wakes or other community gatherings. The space was defined by the occasion: a rice field for a rice-planting <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a>; a river for a fishing ritual; the space around a house (clearing, yard, roof) for such rituals as healing the sick, naming a child, bidding the dead farewell; a village clearing for a war dance or the installation of a leader. The space also shaped the performance: was it a body of water or grass-filled area, on a hill slope or enclosed? The action took shape as demanded by the place; perhaps even the number of performers/participants was decided by the contours of space.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience was drawn and thus determined by the occasion, since it was not a show but part of life. The audience was therefore everyone, and everyone was or could be in the audience except the performers. Such presentations as a dance drama of betrothal or the celebration of a victory in battle had audiences who did not consider themselves spectators, however, but participants. They watched, they fully understood, they participated in body or spirit, and they knew that they were performers, too&mdash;actually in spirit, or potentially in the future. The audience therefore was the community, and there was no dividing line between performer and viewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/433\">Hispanic colonial theater</a>, performance spaces came to be set apart, elevated as on a stage, demarcated as in a church plaza, marked off in some definite way. For religious dramas and dramatizations, the occasions were the religious feasts on the liturgical calendar, all the way from Advent and Christmas, through Lent and Holy Week, the Maytime feasts of Mary, All Souls&rsquo; Day in November, and the feasts of patron saints throughout the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The performance space might be the church itself, where a Palm Sunday procession might start, and wend outward toward the plaza. It might be the plaza, where&nbsp;<em>kubol&nbsp;</em>(makeshift balconies) are sometimes built for an <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a>, or a <strong>galilea</strong> (tall four-posted structure) might be erected from which to lower the angel for a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>. Or it might be the streets, where the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>via crucis</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> are enacted, or parts of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>. Or there might, as for the full-length sinakulo, actually be an outdoor stage, an <strong>entablado</strong>, a temporary structure built in field, open space, street crossing, church patio, or town plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entablado is usually made of bamboo or wood&mdash;sometimes supported by empty oil drums&mdash;or occasionally of concrete, when it is conceived of as permanent. It is mainly a platform, raised for greater visibility, the front part for performance, the back serving as limited dressing area, and the structural framework for hanging the painted <strong>telones</strong> (backdrops or curtains), and eventually the lights and microphones. It is usually built by the town carpenters, with materials lent or donated by the lumber dealers or the wealthy. There being no seats for these stages, the audiences bring their own stools or benches, or sit on mats on the ground. The seating area is usually ringed by food vendors, whose trade flourishes in the casual atmosphere of outdoor community theater. Cockpits have also been used as stages, the performance in the pit and the audience in the bleachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The entablado has also served as space for the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, although for this there might be a two-tiered stage: the higher one to represent mountains or castles; the lower, the ground on which occur battles or encounters with animals and other menaces, gardens in which love scenes are enacted, or forests in which lovers lose or find each other. The occasions for the komedya are usually town fiestas, for which the <strong>comite de festejos</strong> (fiesta committee) raises funds with which to build stages, commission telones, and buy costumes and props.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience for both religious dramatizations and komedya is the community: for the former, especially the older, more religious townsfolk; for the latter, especially the children, but also the old people who had &ldquo;wakened&rdquo; to the form, and watched it almost from birth. Although they might never participate as directors, actors, curtain handlers, stage builders, costume makers, or prompters, their viewership is a form of participation, of bonding with the rest of the community who fund, direct, or act in the play. It is an active viewing, to which they bring their memories of past <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> or komedya, their knowledge of the stories and the conventions, their awareness of the identities of the participants, their sense of it as part of community bonding and identity. They might get up during the play to go home and feed the baby, or buy food in the stalls surrounding, but they continue to be part of the audience in attention and spirit. They might not applaud at all, since religious dramatizations often end in church or in processions, and komedya performers may end the play by going down to mingle with the audience. But they express their approbation by sighs and exclamations, and cheers for the marching and battle scenes. The community audience, nurtured in the same matrix as the writers and performers, view the performances with an unspoken bonding that makes their role more than viewing, being a confirmation of a shared past, present, and future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>, both inherited from the Spanish theater, entered the Philippine stage toward the end of the 19th century and of the Spanish regime, when indoor theaters had been built. Their spaces, therefore, are transitional. In the provinces they may still have occupied the entablado, but in some towns and cities, there were <strong>dulaan</strong>, even <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>teatro</strong></a>, stages with other amenities besides an elevated performance platform. These were indoors, and permanent. They had <strong>bambalinas</strong> or teasers to decorate the heading and hide the theater ceiling and mechanisms; <strong>bastidores</strong> or tormentors of painted canvas (angled or perpendicular to the walls) to hide the wings; other stage machinery or <strong>tramoyas</strong> that the <strong>tramoyista</strong> might devise; a prompter&rsquo;s box called kubol or <strong>concha</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here the telones later gave way to box sets; and the outdoor and palace scenes of the sinakulo and komedya were replaced by interior settings, usually living rooms called <strong>sala rica</strong> for the house of the rich, and <strong>sala pobre</strong> for the house of the poor, in which were placed borrowed furniture and stage props. <strong>Palcos</strong> or boxes were <strong>principales</strong> or <strong>segundas</strong> (i.e., first or second class), seats preferential and costing more than the <strong>butacas</strong> or armchairs, <strong>bancos corridos</strong> or benches, and <strong>entrada general</strong> or general admission. Graduated or tiered seats were called <strong>plateas</strong>, while the gallery, the highest and cheapest seats, were called <strong>tertulia</strong> or <strong>paraiso</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the sarsuwela and drama are performed within communities&mdash;on entablado or sometimes in movie theaters&mdash;the audiences might still be neighbors, relatives, and friends, or at least acquaintances. Although there are definite performers and definite onlookers, they know each other outside the theater, and the audience&rsquo;s perception of the actors is of their nonstage selves as well as of the characters they play, while the actors are aware that those watching them are not strangers. They are the audience for whom the play was written and staged. They are duly appreciative; they have kept sinakulo, komedya, and sarsuwela alive for decades. They are onlookers but not bystanders, being friends and neighbors, semi-participants in and, perhaps, contributors to the production. They are involved beyond audienceship; their awareness extends beyond the stage. Backstage, onstage, and at the foot of the stage the people in a folk production are one world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When, however, sarsuwela and drama are performed in buildings built especially for theater, they become audiences in the modern sense of the word, attendant at a performance in order to hear, see, absorb, but not participate. The indoor theaters assume that the audience come in from outside, have to buy tickets or pay some admission fee, enter and take seats. Because they pay, they have expectations as well as responsibilities. They expect a performance in which they have no part. In return they are quiet and listen. Because the seats are indoors, they cannot wander around to buy food, cannot go home to cook dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The occasion for theater changes as well. It is no longer a religious feast or a town fiesta; it is on a date and at a time decreed by the show&rsquo;s producers, chosen for such reasons as the availability of the theater, the convenience of the performing group, the location or size of the venue. The time for the performance conforms to convention: 7:00 or 7:30 to 9:00 or 9:30 pm, with one-act plays lasting for 30-40 minutes; full-length plays two hours or a bit more. No longer can performances stretch in time, as with komedya and sinakulo whose time is flexible. The prompt and scheduled curtain, the predictable length, the definite ending have become part of theater practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transition from folk or community theater to indoor theater marks the transition as well toward theater as profession rather than community activity. The audience of folk theater is as varied as the community: grandmothers and grandchildren; housewives and farmworkers; market vendors and stevedores; butchers and fishermen; the rich, who may be patrons and financiers; and the poor, who may include participants&rsquo; families, those who made the costumes and props, and people of the street. Since entrance is free, all are equally able to attend the performance. Seating is free as well, with no divisions according to prestige or to prices paid. The audience of indoor theater, however, is less varied, since it is determined by paying ability&mdash;from boxes to cheap seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the folk plays, no education is needed in order to understand the play. For indoor theater&mdash;sarsuwela and drama, then <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a>, then &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; theater in English, and so forth&mdash;education soon came to be expected and needed, and a director would complain that the audience had to be educated, since drama is often beyond the understanding of the lowbrows or &ldquo;bakya crowd.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contemporary Philippines, one can still find the folk entablado at feasts, fairs, and special events. Plays may still be staged in cockpits&mdash;effectively theater in the round, with an arena stage and raked seats&mdash;although rarely, since cockpits are busy year-round with their own business. Most towns and small cities do not have theaters, and use school auditoriums or audiovisual rooms and movie theaters, or outdoor spaces like athletic fields and plazas&mdash;thus arena stages with the audience surrounding the playing area partially or completely. Some of the outdoor stages are open or roofed cement platforms, which are also used for holding outdoor masses, viewing military parades, and staging dance and musical programs. When pressed into service for plays, they are wired for light and sound, but are difficult to dress, because only freestanding sets are possible. San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, has a large concrete sand-covered stage built especially for its yearly komedya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In movie theaters were staged many of the first sarsuwela of the century. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/597\"><strong><em>Ing Managpe</em></strong></a> (The Patcher), 1900, for example, the first Pampango sarsuwela on record, was staged in the Teatro Sabina of Bacolor, reputed to have had excellent acoustics because of a well beneath the stage. Movie theaters do not usually have flies or wings, nor provision for lighting equipment, nor are they particularly eager to give up evenings to plays that bring in fewer people and less revenue. They were and are, however, the only real theaters in many a town or city. Even Manila used the Avenue (movie) Theater for stage shows during the Japanese occupation. The postwar Rizal Theater was built for both stage productions and films (it had a revolving stage), but was demolished to give way to a hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila, of course, has always had theaters, but although 19th-century Manila could boast of some 26 theaters built especially for plays, including the grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>, which seated more than a thousand, Manila in the 1950s had only the Far Eastern University Auditorium, the Girl Scout Auditorium, and later the Philamlife Auditorium, which has excellent acoustics but no space above or below the stage, and varnished walls to which scenery cannot be attached. It was only in 1969, when the <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> was built, that Manila acquired a theater seating more than a thousand. The CCP Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, the Main Theater, seats 1,800, and is built for symphony concerts, operas, and large-scale theater productions. The small Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> seats 402 and is built for plays and intimate concerts; the experimental Tanghalang <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Huseng Batute</a> seats 300, and is a flexible space adaptable to theater in the round and to various variants of thrust stages. The Folk Arts Theater seats 10,000, and is largely used for pop concerts, although it has been used for plays, with its floor area adjusted and reduced. The Manila Film Center has been used as the venue of the female impersonation musical revue <strong><em>Amazing Philippine Theater</em></strong> since 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, built 1931 and renovated 1978, seats 1,800, and has been used largely for musical plays with large casts, although it has a small Tanghalang Dalubdulaan for smaller plays. The Meralco Theater, owned by the electric company, seats 1,010, is large, elegant, and well equipped, but has acoustical problems that must be met with the use of microphones. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\">Insular Life</a> Company Theater seats 250, and was the home of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a> until it built its own William J. Shaw Theater in Shangri-La Plaza mall which seats 500. The Philippine International Convention Center has a Plenary Hall seating 5,000, with equipment of recent vintage and high technology. The Armed Forces of the Philippines Theater in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City seats 1,074 people. Onstage Theater at Greenbelt 1 mall and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a> Auditorium at Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation Tower have both been used by different theater and performance groups for plays, dance productions, and musicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dulaang Rajah Sulayman at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> seats anywhere from 550 to 600, and was the home of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>. A former Spanish garrison, it is open to the skies and has a T-shaped stage around which the company designed its multispaced productions. In 2005, PETA transferred to its new home, the PETA Theater Center, located at New Manila, Quezon City. PETA Center houses the &ldquo;Black Box&rdquo; or the PETA-PHINMA Theater, an intentionally skewed box theater that is adaptable to numerous stage and audience arrangements suited for PETA&rsquo;s exploratory and nonconventional aesthetics. Other cities may have cultural centers and stages, but with less advanced equipment and facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of theater buildings, as well as the development of more diverse theater forms and types suitable to the aims of the performers, has driven Philippine theater to create venues in unconventional spaces. The streets, first used by protest theater, provide an endless venue, in which players must first carve out a space, establish a performance space, and then gather an audience. Plays have been staged in rice and cane fields like rituals of old, in front of factories, in barangay meeting places and churches as were the folk plays, on seashores, in homes, in slum areas&mdash;anywhere an audience can gather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Counting as well the auditoriums of foreign cultural centers, like the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center, Goethe House, the British Council, and the Centro Cultural de Espa&ntilde;a, the various open-air stages, like the Luneta, Paco Park, Puerta Real, restaurant and hotel stages, school auditoriums and gymnasiums, and the streets, parks and plazas, there are obviously many spaces&mdash;call them entablado, dulaan, tanghalan, or teatro&mdash;in which theater can happen in Manila. In the provinces, there is the Luce Auditorium in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> and the University of San Carlos Buttenbruch College Auditorium. The provincial picture is more limited as to buildings, but more flexible as to places. The spaces&mdash;the range and variety of dulaan&mdash;match the energy and flexibility of the theater groups that use them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The times and occasions for theater today range as widely as the spaces. There still are religious feasts and town fiestas, perhaps celebrated with contemporary as well as folk plays. There are also school occasions&mdash;now not only foundation days and civic occasions, but whatever students may wish to celebrate or mark with a play: a historical date to commemorate, a cause or issue to expose, an aspect of life or culture to express. Then there are civic occasions and activities&mdash;Rizal Day, Independence Day, among others. Theater groups like PETA, the CCP <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, Repertory Philippines, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a> have seasons, pre-announced, with tickets presold to subscribers, and available at box offices. Theater festivals are also organized in the local, regional, national, and international levels to allow various theater groups and artists to interact. Thus it is not community life that sets the times for performance, but the performers. The season is no longer in tune with the rhythm of ordinary life, but with the exigencies of planning, schedules, and objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to those mentioned above, new theater venues with modern facilities and equipment emerged, such as Resorts World Manila, Solaire Theater in Paranaque, and PowerMac Center Spotlight in Circuit Makati. These venues showcase mostly musicals to cater to the demands of their patrons. Tickets for the productions mounted on these spaces are relatively more expensive. This defines its audiences as those belonging to the upper classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audiences of this contemporary theater are no longer known to the performers, and do not usually come from the world to which they belong. Anyone can buy, be sold, or be given a ticket. Tickets can be priced as the producer wishes, and thus reach or limit an audience. Audiences may be made of special interest groups (e.g., a play commissioned for a company anniversary), particular age groups (plays for schools), or widely varied assortments of people united only in their decision to watch a play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater competes with other popular forms, such as films and concerts, for these audiences. Some theater groups have adapted marketing strategies to ensure that there will be audiences for their productions. For example, school and university-based theater groups link with academic departments or directly with teachers and professors within and outside their academic communities to make them require or at least encourage their students to watch plays, especially those that are relevant to courses in theater, literature, or history, or other courses in the humanities and the social sciences. Theater groups offer hefty discounts to encourage more students to watch the productions. Some theater groups, especially those in Manila, offer their productions to show buyers. These buyers in turn tap their own contacts for sponsorships and ticket distribution. For example, PETA&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 2013, currently considered the longest-running Filipino musical, was farmed out to different show buyers&mdash;usually their loyal patrons, affiliated institutions, and even artists themselves. These buyers then became responsible for ensuring that their show dates be well attended. With this practice, the tasks of sales, marketing, and even promotions are decentralized and shared, thus ensuring a bigger audience. Moreover, as a marketing strategy, some theater groups choose materials based on Filipino films and popular music, and cast popular actors. While these practices may have been pursued to ensure profitability, it nonetheless brings into the theater audiences who are familiar with the material and who idolize the actors in the cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional, national, and international theater festivals provide venues for the development of audiences who are exposed to and appreciative of various theater traditions, themes, and aesthetics from different places and cultures. For example, in Feb 1992, the CCP held Unang Tagpo: The First National Theater Festival (NTF) at the CCP Complex. The festival featured nine productions from various theater groups in the country. There were also performances from <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>, Dulaang UP, PETA, Repertory Philippines, Tanghalang Pilipino, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a>, all from Metro Manila. The NTF was conducted again in 1996, 2004, and 2012. Theater groups participating in the NTF perform to a different type of audience: the national audience. This kind of festival is CCP&rsquo;s way of recognizing the best that various theater groups from the regions can offer, bringing these to the attention of the rest of the Filipino people, hopefully contributing to a greater imagination of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There still exist today, however, examples and survivors of all the above combinations of audience, time, and space. Rice-planting rituals are still conducted in some communities. Sinakulo and komedya are still staged in some parishes and towns, on entablado. Sarsuwela and drama are more rarely found in the provinces, but are being revived or written anew in the cities, and staged in dulaan or tanghalan. The indoor stages of the past coexist with the modern, high-tech theaters of the present. Holy Week may still feature salubong and osana, Christmas pastores in the street, and panunuluyan that ends in church. Audiences are, fortunately, no longer composed only of English-speaking teachers and students. Because of the wide variety of theater occasions and spaces, they include workers, the urban poor, ethnic groups, academic groupings, church organizations, people in the street, the young of all ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audiences are, however, divided and stratified and not found in the same spaces. The upper class join the expatriates in patronizing English-language theater, like that of Repertory Philippines. It is the middle class and the students who crowd the PETA, Dulaang UP, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, and CCP stages. The lower class can be found in the spaces where community and people&rsquo;s theater are staged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audience, time, and space have thus developed together, with and through the periods of Philippine theater, providing its social context, and reflecting its range, energy, and concerns.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

This theater was therefore not set on stages, since rituals and song/dance dramas were enacted in clearings or in fields, and ceremonies and verbal jousts at wakes or other community gatherings. The space was defined by the occasion: a rice field for a rice-planting <a href=\"/7/55/469\">ritual</a>; a river for a fishing ritual; the space around a house (clearing, yard, roof) for such rituals as healing the sick, naming a child, bidding the dead farewell; a village clearing for a war dance or the installation of a leader. The space also shaped the performance: was it a body of water or grass-filled area, on a hill slope or enclosed? The action took shape as demanded by the place; perhaps even the number of performers/participants was decided by the contours of space."

Although they might never participate as directors, actors, curtain handlers, stage builders, costume makers, or prompters, their viewership is a form of participation, of bonding with the rest of the community who fund, direct, or act in the play. It is an active viewing, to which they bring their memories of past <a href=\"/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> or komedya, their knowledge of the stories and the conventions, their awareness of the identities of the participants, their sense of it as part of community bonding and identity. They might get up during the play to go home and feed the baby, or buy food in the stalls surrounding, but they continue to be part of the audience in attention and spirit. They might not applaud at all, since religious dramatizations often end in church or in processions, and komedya performers may end the play by going down to mingle with the audience. But they express their approbation by sighs and exclamations, and cheers for the marching and battle scenes. The community audience, nurtured in the same matrix as the writers and performers, view the performances with an unspoken bonding that makes their role more than viewing, being a confirmation of a shared past, present, and future."

				"value": "When, however, sarsuwela and drama are performed in buildings built especially for theater, they become audiences in the modern sense of the word, attendant at a performance in order to hear, see, absorb, but not participate. The indoor theaters assume that the audience come in from outside, have to buy tickets or pay some admission fee, enter and take seats. Because they pay, they have expectations as well as responsibilities. They expect a performance in which they have no part. In return they are quiet and listen. Because the seats are indoors, they cannot wander around to buy food, cannot go home to cook dinner."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The occasion for theater changes as well. It is no longer a religious feast or a town fiesta; it is on a date and at a time decreed by the show&#x2019;s producers, chosen for such reasons as the availability of the theater, the convenience of the performing group, the location or size of the venue. The time for the performance conforms to convention: 7:00 or 7:30 to 9:00 or 9:30 pm, with one-act plays lasting for 30-40 minutes; full-length plays two hours or a bit more. No longer can performances stretch in time, as with komedya and sinakulo whose time is flexible. The prompt and scheduled curtain, the predictable length, the definite ending have become part of theater practice."
			},

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The transition from folk or community theater to indoor theater marks the transition as well toward theater as profession rather than community activity. The audience of folk theater is as varied as the community: grandmothers and grandchildren; housewives and farmworkers; market vendors and stevedores; butchers and fishermen; the rich, who may be patrons and financiers; and the poor, who may include participants&#x2019; families, those who made the costumes and props, and people of the street. Since entrance is free, all are equally able to attend the performance. Seating is free as well, with no divisions according to prestige or to prices paid. The audience of indoor theater, however, is less varied, since it is determined by paying ability&#x2014;from boxes to cheap seats."

				"value": "In contemporary Philippines, one can still find the folk entablado at feasts, fairs, and special events. Plays may still be staged in cockpits&#x2014;effectively theater in the round, with an arena stage and raked seats&#x2014;although rarely, since cockpits are busy year-round with their own business. Most towns and small cities do not have theaters, and use school auditoriums or audiovisual rooms and movie theaters, or outdoor spaces like athletic fields and plazas&#x2014;thus arena stages with the audience surrounding the playing area partially or completely. Some of the outdoor stages are open or roofed cement platforms, which are also used for holding outdoor masses, viewing military parades, and staging dance and musical programs. When pressed into service for plays, they are wired for light and sound, but are difficult to dress, because only freestanding sets are possible. San Dionisio, Para&#xF1;aque, has a large concrete sand-covered stage built especially for its yearly komedya."

Movie theaters do not usually have flies or wings, nor provision for lighting equipment, nor are they particularly eager to give up evenings to plays that bring in fewer people and less revenue. They were and are, however, the only real theaters in many a town or city. Even Manila used the Avenue (movie) Theater for stage shows during the Japanese occupation. The postwar Rizal Theater was built for both stage productions and films (it had a revolving stage), but was demolished to give way to a hotel."

It was only in 1969, when the <a href=\"/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> was built, that Manila acquired a theater seating more than a thousand. The CCP Tanghalang <a href=\"/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, the Main Theater, seats 1,800, and is built for symphony concerts, operas, and large-scale theater productions. The small Tanghalang <a href=\"/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> seats 402 and is built for plays and intimate concerts; the experimental Tanghalang <a href=\"/9/9/5225\">Huseng Batute</a> seats 300, and is a flexible space adaptable to theater in the round and to various variants of thrust stages. The Folk Arts Theater seats 10,000, and is largely used for pop concerts, although it has been used for plays, with its floor area adjusted and reduced. The Manila Film Center has been used as the venue of the female impersonation musical revue <strong><em>Amazing Philippine Theater</em></strong> since 2001."

The Meralco Theater, owned by the electric company, seats 1,010, is large, elegant, and well equipped, but has acoustical problems that must be met with the use of microphones. The <a href=\"/2/8/309\">Insular Life</a> Company Theater seats 250, and was the home of <a href=\"/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a> until it built its own William J. Shaw Theater in Shangri-La Plaza mall which seats 500. The Philippine International Convention Center has a Plenary Hall seating 5,000, with equipment of recent vintage and high technology. The Armed Forces of the Philippines Theater in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City seats 1,074 people. Onstage Theater at Greenbelt 1 mall and <a href=\"/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a> Auditorium at Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation Tower have both been used by different theater and performance groups for plays, dance productions, and musicals."

A former Spanish garrison, it is open to the skies and has a T-shaped stage around which the company designed its multispaced productions. In 2005, PETA transferred to its new home, the PETA Theater Center, located at New Manila, Quezon City. PETA Center houses the &#x201C;Black Box&#x201D; or the PETA-PHINMA Theater, an intentionally skewed box theater that is adaptable to numerous stage and audience arrangements suited for PETA&#x2019;s exploratory and nonconventional aesthetics. Other cities may have cultural centers and stages, but with less advanced equipment and facilities."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The lack of theater buildings, as well as the development of more diverse theater forms and types suitable to the aims of the performers, has driven Philippine theater to create venues in unconventional spaces. The streets, first used by protest theater, provide an endless venue, in which players must first carve out a space, establish a performance space, and then gather an audience. Plays have been staged in rice and cane fields like rituals of old, in front of factories, in barangay meeting places and churches as were the folk plays, on seashores, in homes, in slum areas&#x2014;anywhere an audience can gather."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Counting as well the auditoriums of foreign cultural centers, like the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center, Goethe House, the British Council, and the Centro Cultural de Espa&#xF1;a, the various open-air stages, like the Luneta, Paco Park, Puerta Real, restaurant and hotel stages, school auditoriums and gymnasiums, and the streets, parks and plazas, there are obviously many spaces&#x2014;call them entablado, dulaan, tanghalan, or teatro&#x2014;in which theater can happen in Manila. In the provinces, there is the Luce Auditorium in <a href=\"/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> and the University of San Carlos Buttenbruch College Auditorium. The provincial picture is more limited as to buildings, but more flexible as to places. The spaces&#x2014;the range and variety of dulaan&#x2014;match the energy and flexibility of the theater groups that use them."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The times and occasions for theater today range as widely as the spaces. There still are religious feasts and town fiestas, perhaps celebrated with contemporary as well as folk plays. There are also school occasions&#x2014;now not only foundation days and civic occasions, but whatever students may wish to celebrate or mark with a play: a historical date to commemorate, a cause or issue to expose, an aspect of life or culture to express. Then there are civic occasions and activities&#x2014;Rizal Day, Independence Day, among others. Theater groups like PETA, the CCP <a href=\"/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, Repertory Philippines, and <a href=\"/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a> have seasons, pre-announced, with tickets presold to subscribers, and available at box offices. Theater festivals are also organized in the local, regional, national, and international levels to allow various theater groups and artists to interact. Thus it is not community life that sets the times for performance, but the performers. The season is no longer in tune with the rhythm of ordinary life, but with the exigencies of planning, schedules, and objectives."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In addition to those mentioned above, new theater venues with modern facilities and equipment emerged, such as Resorts World Manila, Solaire Theater in Paranaque, and PowerMac Center Spotlight in Circuit Makati. These venues showcase mostly musicals to cater to the demands of their patrons. Tickets for the productions mounted on these spaces are relatively more expensive. This defines its audiences as those belonging to the upper classes."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The audiences of this contemporary theater are no longer known to the performers, and do not usually come from the world to which they belong. Anyone can buy, be sold, or be given a ticket. Tickets can be priced as the producer wishes, and thus reach or limit an audience. Audiences may be made of special interest groups (e.g., a play commissioned for a company anniversary), particular age groups (plays for schools), or widely varied assortments of people united only in their decision to watch a play."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Theater competes with other popular forms, such as films and concerts, for these audiences. Some theater groups have adapted marketing strategies to ensure that there will be audiences for their productions. For example, school and university-based theater groups link with academic departments or directly with teachers and professors within and outside their academic communities to make them require or at least encourage their students to watch plays, especially those that are relevant to courses in theater, literature, or history, or other courses in the humanities and the social sciences. Theater groups offer hefty discounts to encourage more students to watch the productions. Some theater groups, especially those in Manila, offer their productions to show buyers. These buyers in turn tap their own contacts for sponsorships and ticket distribution. For example, PETA&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 2013, currently considered the longest-running Filipino musical, was farmed out to different show buyers&#x2014;usually their loyal patrons, affiliated institutions, and even artists themselves. These buyers then became responsible for ensuring that their show dates be well attended. With this practice, the tasks of sales, marketing, and even promotions are decentralized and shared, thus ensuring a bigger audience. Moreover, as a marketing strategy, some theater groups choose materials based on Filipino films and popular music, and cast popular actors. While these practices may have been pursued to ensure profitability, it nonetheless brings into the theater audiences who are familiar with the material and who idolize the actors in the cast."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Regional, national, and international theater festivals provide venues for the development of audiences who are exposed to and appreciative of various theater traditions, themes, and aesthetics from different places and cultures. For example, in Feb 1992, the CCP held Unang Tagpo: The First National Theater Festival (NTF) at the CCP Complex. The festival featured nine productions from various theater groups in the country. There were also performances from <a href=\"/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>, Dulaang UP, PETA, Repertory Philippines, Tanghalang Pilipino, <a href=\"/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a>, and <a href=\"/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a>, all from Metro Manila. The NTF was conducted again in 1996, 2004, and 2012. Theater groups participating in the NTF perform to a different type of audience: the national audience. This kind of festival is CCP&#x2019;s way of recognizing the best that various theater groups from the regions can offer, bringing these to the attention of the rest of the Filipino people, hopefully contributing to a greater imagination of the nation."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "There still exist today, however, examples and survivors of all the above combinations of audience, time, and space. Rice-planting rituals are still conducted in some communities. Sinakulo and komedya are still staged in some parishes and towns, on entablado. Sarsuwela and drama are more rarely found in the provinces, but are being revived or written anew in the cities, and staged in dulaan or tanghalan. The indoor stages of the past coexist with the modern, high-tech theaters of the present. Holy Week may still feature salubong and osana, Christmas pastores in the street, and panunuluyan that ends in church. Audiences are, fortunately, no longer composed only of English-speaking teachers and students. Because of the wide variety of theater occasions and spaces, they include workers, the urban poor, ethnic groups, academic groupings, church organizations, people in the street, the young of all ages."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Audiences are, however, divided and stratified and not found in the same spaces. The upper class join the expatriates in patronizing English-language theater, like that of Repertory Philippines. It is the middle class and the students who crowd the PETA, Dulaang UP, <a href=\"/7/7/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, and CCP stages. The lower class can be found in the spaces where community and people&#x2019;s theater are staged."

Individual students, groups, or whole classes write plays and present them with their classmates as cast, crew, composers, singers, among others. The monetary prize is not valued as much as the triumph and the learning experience. Among the early winners were playwrights <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a> for <strong><em>Hoy, Boyet</em></strong> (Hey, Boyet), and Paul Dumol for <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong>Ang Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</strong></a></em></strong> (The Trial of Old Serapio).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP Literary Awards for full-length plays were established in 1969, the year of the inauguration of the CCP. Prizes were then at 5,000 pesos, 3,000 pesos, and 2,000 pesos, with 1,500 pesos for honorable mention later added. These were later upgraded. The rules provided for the production of winning entries; CCP had the option to produce the winning plays without further payment, within a year of the awards. Partial fulfillment came about in 1978, with the establishment of the production arm called Gantimpala, and eventually the theater and the theater group that staged the winning plays were called <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>. Audiences were composed mainly of students, up to 1987. Marketing the plays to teachers and their classes developed new audiences for theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first winners of the CCP Playwriting Contest were <strong><em>In Frailty&rsquo;s Grace</em></strong> by Elsa V. Martinez, first prize; <strong><em>And the Day but <strong>One</strong></em></strong> by Jose Ma. Hernandez, second; and <strong><em>The <strong>Onyx</strong> Wolf</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a>, third; <strong><em>Tabak at Tanikala</em></strong> (Bolo and Chain) by Dionisio S. Salazar, <strong><em>Status Quo</em></strong> by Angel R. Makiling, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/554\"><strong><em><strong>Halik</strong> sa Kampilan</em></strong></a> (Kiss on the Sword) by Cipriano V. Ilagan got honorable mentions. (No work was qualified for a major prize in Pilipino.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979, the first and so far only volume of <strong><em>Gantimpala</em></strong> (Awards), meant to be the official publication of the contest, was published. In the same year, the Special Adaptation category was introduced for plays adapted from existing materials. Winners were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2942\">Jomar Fleras</a> for <strong><em>Kanser</em></strong> (Cancer), adapted from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s novel <strong><em><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></em></strong> (Touch Me Not), honorable mention, and Dory Robles for <strong><em>Mando Plaridel</em></strong>, from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\">Amado V. Hernandez</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1750\"><strong>Mga Ibong Mandaragit</strong></a></em></strong> (Birds of Prey), honorable mention. The category was only opened again in 1984 to coincide with the CCP&rsquo;s 15th anniversary. The winner was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3079\">Dennis Marasigan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Silang Nalugmok sa Gabi</em></strong> (Those Who Fell in the Night), adapted from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5400\">Steven Javellana</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1829\"><strong>Without Seeing the Dawn</strong></a></em></strong>. In 1981, a distinction was made between new playwrights and former prizewinners, the idea being to encourage and teach new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986, Bulwagang Gantimpala became a separate foundation and transferred its base to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>. Under the reorganized Coordinating Center for Dramatic Arts of the CCP, the rules were revised. Judges still chose the best plays, and these nominees went into production under the guidance of theater directors. The playwrights cooperated in the production and revised as needed; only after production did the judges choose the winners, who then received their prizes. Thus, the production phase allowed for the training of playwrights through the experience of production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1987, the CCP, with its new coordinating centers, started the Gawad CCP Para sa Panitikan, conducted by the CCP Coordinating Center for Literature, with poetry, short story, and drama categories. First winners for the full-length play are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Anay sa Kahoy</em></strong> (Termite in the Wood), first; Butch Concepcion&rsquo;s <strong><em>Batang Hiroshima</em></strong> (Hiroshima Child), second; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2825\">Lito Casaje</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Terminal</em></strong> and Rodena Santos Mendoza&rsquo;s <strong><em>Etsetera &hellip; Etsetera &hellip; Etsetera &hellip;</em></strong> (Et Cetera &hellip; Et Cetera &hellip; Et Cetera &hellip;), third. For the one-act play, the winners were Rene O. Villanueva and Rolando de la Cruz&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kaaway sa Sulod</em></strong> (Enemy Within), first; Raul Regalado&rsquo;s <strong><em>Magkaibang Klase</em></strong> (Of Different Class), second; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\">Luna Sicat</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Maternal</em></strong>, third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1970, the Gawad Tanglaw ng Lahi has been given by Ateneo de Manila University to individuals or organizations that have succeeded in steering the national consciousness toward clarification, development, and enhancement of the essential Filipino image. Among its recipients for theater are Lamberto Avellana, Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, Atang de la Rama, Bienvenido N. Noriega Jr, Rolando S. Tinio, and Rodolfo Vera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Artist Award, created by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 1001 dated 27 Apr 1972, has been given to artists who have produced a body of works that have enhanced the Filipino&rsquo;s cultural heritage. Elevated to the status of an Order by virtue of Executive Order 236 on 19 Sep 2003, the National Artist Award for theater has been conferred on Lamberto Avellana, 1976; Atang de la Rama, 1987; Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, 1997; Rolando S. Tinio, 1997; Daisy H. Avellana, 1999; Severino Montano, 2001; and Salvador Bernal, 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3144\">Palihang Aurelio V. Tolentino (PAVT)</a>, established in 1974 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a> with the help of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\">Doreen G. Fernandez</a> and Jonas Sebastian, and whose prizes were sponsored by Loyola Memorial Parks, sought to give playwrights not only award money but also training and the experience of seeing their plays in production. It started with a playwriting workshop, in which experienced writers and directors spoke on various aspects of drama, and academics guided the workshop through the reading of various types of plays. In the second phase, the workshop fellows wrote their plays and the winners were chosen. In the third phase, each winning play was assigned to a theater group for production, with the playwright in residence to make revisions when needed, and to learn from the production process. The fourth phase was to have been publication, but was not reached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PAVT lasted for four years, and among the plays it produced were <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3148\">Manuel Pambid</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Buhay <strong>Bati</strong>lyo, Hindi Kami Susuko</em></strong> (Batilyo Life: We Will Not Surrender), 1976; <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3186\">Nonilon Quea&ntilde;o</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/502\"><strong>Alipato</strong></a></em></strong> (Spark), 1976; Bonifacio Ilagan&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/638\"><strong><em><strong>Pagsamba</strong>ng Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&rsquo;s Worship), 1977; Richie Valencia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Juan Obrero</em></strong> (Juan the Worker), 1977; Reuel Aguila&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/563\"><strong>In Dis Korner</strong></a></em></strong> (In This Corner), 1978; and Rene Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em>Entresuelo</em></strong> (The Mezzanine), 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gawad CCP para sa Sining (CCP Awards for the Arts) in theater has been given to Wilfrido Ma.

The yearly creative workshop held at the University of the Philippines usually ends in modest prizes for the best work by the participants, who are chosen on the basis of works submitted, and are given fellowships (free board and lodging and some transportation allowance). Each year, the workshop focuses on a genre chosen by the organizers: fiction, poetry, children&rsquo;s literature, and occasionally drama. In recent years, the UP workshop has chosen to focus on veteran writers. The Silliman Writers Workshop, held yearly in summer, also awards fellowships, which are sought by both new and experienced writers. They are given transportation to and from Silliman, and expenses during their stay, but it is the camaraderie with other new writers and the experienced ones on the teaching staff that is a large part of the reward. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5390\">Iligan National Writers Workshop</a>, founded in 1994, lays claim to being the only one that publishes its proceedings each year, and promotes the writing of literatures of the regions. The other national workshops are organized by the University of Santo Tomas and by the De La Salle University, both of which began in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UP Creative Writing Center also appointed a national and a local fellow for drama each year. Among those who have been named national fellows are Alberto Florentino, 1980; Wilfrido Nolledo, 1983, 1984; Jose Y. Dalisay Jr, 1984-85; Rene O. Villanueva, 1985-86; Bienvenido Noriega Jr, 1986-87; Antonio Perez, 1987-88; Bonifacio Ilagan, 1988-89; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>, 1989-90; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>, 1990-91; Wilfrido Ma.

		"text": "<p>Costume for theater refers to the distinctive dress used by an actor in order to identify or authenticate a role in a performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ethnic <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, the babaylan or shaman usually wore special costumes. This may have consisted of animal guises, symbols of power or magic, or ceremonial robes to portray the babaylan&rsquo;s power and authority to call on the spirits, draw them or their power into his/her person, and enact his/her role in the community, as healer, shaman, anointer, and mediator with the spirit world. In 1521, Pigafetta described the two shamans performing the ritual in the Visayas. One wore a kerchief with two horns on her forehead, and waved another kerchief in her hands as she danced. The other took one of the standards and danced with it (Pigafetta 1969).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic</a> jousts, games, and dances, the appropriate tribal dress was the performance costume. When one celebrated, or prepared for war or the hunt, courtship or marriage, planting or harvest, one used the clothes and properties appropriate to the activity and occasion. Armor, shield, spear, and sword constitute the attire for the war dances. Bamboo poles for making holes in the ground, baskets with rice seedlings, winnowing baskets, and rice pestles are some of the props used for the rice planting dances of the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>. It is only now that enactment of these is done outside the rhythm of daily life, that tribal wear has become only stage costume.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In folk drama, the costume was dictated by the material of the drama. Since saints&rsquo; statues and their&nbsp;<em>estampitas&nbsp;</em>(holy pictures) were the most accessible pictorial sources for costuming, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> characters are generally costumed like the images of Lenten processions. Christ is often in maroon velvet with gold appliques or embroidery, wearing white lace at his neck and wrists, a brunette wig, and three thin rays called <strong>potensiya</strong>, like the Quiapo Nazareno. Mary may be in a blue and purple gown with a white or purple veil tucked under a <strong>rostrillo</strong> (thin rays around her face), a heart with seven daggers traced in sequins on her breast. San Juan is in red and green; Maria Magdalena in purple/red and yellow; Veronica in blue and white. For the Holy Thursday washing of the feet, the&nbsp;<em>apostoles&nbsp;</em>or apostles wear long robes, sometimes borrowed priests&rsquo; soutanes, with capes in the brightest colors available, giving rise in Silay, Negros Occidental, to the expression &ldquo;<em>kulay&nbsp;</em>apostoles&rdquo; (color of the apostles).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characters without corresponding images in church may be dressed by the folk imagination, thus Claudia, Herod&rsquo;s wife, in the Philippine Carnival Queen&rsquo;s terno with train, collar, and crown; Barabbas in knee-length pants, T-shirt, and balanggot (farmer&rsquo;s straw hat); and Roman soldiers in knee-length pants and puff-sleeved waisted shirts with Viking headgear and Roman helmets, as seen in various movies. Folk directors, dressmakers, and actors were not concerned with realism; they only cared about conveying character identification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costumes in the <strong><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a></strong> are usually made of rich materials (velvet, satin) and decorated with embroidery, sequins, beads, plumes, and feathers, thus befitting, in folk estimation, the royal characters portrayed. The costumes help to externalize the komedya&rsquo;s ideological messages. Thus Christians are dressed in black or dark colors (green, blue, purple), while Moors are attired in red or orange. To underscore the hierarchy of authority, the king wears the longest cape and the only crown; the queen dons a long cape and a long gown; the prince, a small cape and a<strong> tres picos</strong> (three-cornered) hat; the soldiers, tiny capes and small hats. All male characters usually carry swords and daggers, and the ladies fans, unless they are costumed as men, in which case they also carry weaponry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> and the<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"> <strong>drama</strong></a>, since they draw plots and characters from Philippine life, were the first to present characters in the clothing of their time. The costumes were part of character identification, in effect the first indication of their roles. The don wore the <strong>Americana cerrada</strong> or <strong>abierta</strong> (male wear of the early American period) and carried hats and canes; the do&ntilde;a wore the <strong>baro&rsquo;t saya</strong> or <strong>terno</strong> and carried handbag and fan. The young girls (heroine included) wore the <strong>saya</strong> with <strong>tapis</strong> (overskirt), and carried fans and handkerchiefs, unless they were &ldquo;modern girls,&rdquo; in which case they wore the <strong>vestido</strong> or <strong>bestida</strong>, the American-style dress of the period. Girls from the province and women of lower social stature wore the <strong>balintawak</strong> or <strong>patadiong</strong>/<strong>kimona</strong>, usually with <strong>alampay</strong> and/or <strong>tapis</strong>. The farmer or fisherman was recognized by his rolled-up pants and <strong>camisa chino</strong>; the cockpit aficionado by the kerchief round his neck or more often round his head, and by the fighting cock he carried. Ingenues wore the sailor costume that boys and girls invariably wore at the time to have their pictures taken at photo studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contemporary theater, costume design has gradually grown into both an art form and a profession. The costume designer is now a creative artist, like the playwright, actor, or director. He studies, analyzes, and interprets the dramatic text in order to find its essence or primary theme. He then creates a visual incarnation of this theme through the costumes (Tiongson 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visual concept a designer chooses for a play comes from a long process that involves careful study of the dramatic text and consultation with other members of the production. After the designer has analyzed the themes and elements of the text, he and the director discuss the possible interpretations they see for the play. The discussion usually begins with the director describing his understanding and approach to the text and his thoughts on possible styles for the production. The designer then suggests a few design possibilities until they reach some sort of consensus (Tiongson 2007). Once they decide on the vision and visual metaphor on which to anchor the visual design, the designer makes the preliminary sketches. Afterward, the designer and director hold another consultation with the lighting designer and technical staff, to ask for inputs and reach another consensus. Only after this shall the designer implement and execute his design. In this way, the costume becomes part of the performance&mdash;even a performance in itself&mdash;and is a necessary element to push the message of the play to the forefront. To do this, the costume designer exerts a huge amount of creativity to complement and elevate the overall artistry of the production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As much as it is an art form, costume design is also a profession. The professionalization of costume design is a product mainly of the establishment of theater groups and programs in some schools and the education of theater artists abroad. Most of the prominent theater designers are products of theater organizations based in schools, like the University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, Ateneo de Manila University, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>. They have hands-on experiences of campus theater where they honed their creativity and resourcefulness, often having to design and mount productions with very limited budgets. Later on, theater design became a course taught in some campuses. Some designers who sharpened their skills abroad include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3050\">Amiel Leonardia</a> (master of fine arts, University of Hawaii), <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a> (master of fine arts, Northwestern University), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2893\">Ludendorffo Decenteceo</a> (master of fine arts, Tulane University),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2999\">Mio Infante</a> (master of arts in scenography, Wimbledon School of Art), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2973\">Gino Gonzales</a> (master of fine arts, New York University). These designers returned to the country and shared their expertise with theater design students. The circle of professional theater designers even became more solidified with the establishment of the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3168\">Philippine Association of Theater Designers and Technicians</a> in 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a wide variety of styles, the costume designer chooses and decides which one best expresses the vision, objective, and statement of the play. In period plays, costumes are indispensable in recreating the particular period of a play. Such are the costumes of the sarsuwela <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907), 1992, which include baro&rsquo;t saya of the <strong>serpentina</strong> period for the women, and camisa chino or americana abierta for the men. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/670\"><strong>Stageshow</strong></a></em></strong>, 2012, dressed the female characters in bestida with bright yellow, red, and blue, flaunting the balloon skirts for dancing around the stage. The male characters were in the usual white Americana of stage show performers. Even periods of foreign lands can be emulated through costumes. Germany during the Nazi regime was revived in <strong><em>Der Kaufmann</em></strong> (<strong><em>The Merchant of Venice</em></strong>), 2013, an adaptation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s classic set in the German holocaust during World War II. Even in period plays that require a specific look, the costume designer still makes sure that the characters are not just identified but also delineated from each other through different cuts, colors, and trimmings. To do his job properly, the designer does a lot of research in order to recreate the precise look and texture of a particular period in full detail. More importantly, he must exemplify resourcefulness itself in reconstructing clothing of the past using readily available, indigenous, and inexpensive materials. Salvador Bernal became prominent for transforming cheap materials, like&nbsp;<em>katsa&nbsp;</em>and abaca into beautiful costumes, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pagkahaba-haba Man ng Prusisyon, Sa <strong>Simbahan</strong> Din ang Tuloy</em></strong> (<strong><em>Much Ado about Nothing</em></strong>) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costumes are also used to convince the audience that the characters they are watching are real, that the characters share the same reality they are living in. In <strong><em>Mga Buhay na Apoy</em></strong> (A Breath of Fire), 2015, the audience easily identified a contemporary Manila-based family in the clothing they wore. This realistic portrayal of the characters aided in stressing the conflict between their new traditions and their utter denial of their indigenous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a> cultural roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some plays use stylized costume designs, playing with existing conventional patterns in order to create new ones. In Dulaang UP&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira), 2010, and <strong><em>Sintang Dalisay</em></strong> (Pure Love), 2011, traditional ethnic clothing from different parts of the Philippines was used and at the same time stylized in order to give distinct characterization to each of the warring kingdoms or clans in the stories. <strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong> &rsquo;s base color for its costumes was white, with red slivers and accessories for the kingdom of Marruecos and blue for Tedenst. The two adversary clans in <strong><em>Sintang Dalisay</em></strong> both wore clothing from Southern Philippines, with the Kalimuddin clan primarily in red versus the Mustapha clan in blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong><em><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong>: Ang Banog ng Sanlibutan</em></strong></a> (Labaw Donggon: Hawk of the Universe), 2013, the costumes were used to symbolically express the major theme of the play, the building and uniting of a nation. While highlighting elements of Bisayan Philippine ethnic clothing, the costumes&rsquo; red, blue, or yellow color scheme for each of the three kingdoms and their princesses helped in the play&rsquo;s attempt to symbolically represent the three major islands of the Philippines that Labaw Donggon unites throughout his journey. A symbolic use of costume was also showcased in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1995. It played with the image of an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>-type fish skeleton and incorporated it as the main motif in the set and costumes, together with a light design that used a lot of greens and blues, to visualize the conflict between the local loan sharks and the poor peasants they victimize (Tiongson 2007). In <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (Hundred Dreams), 2007, a stylized version of traditional komedya costumes was used. The characters wore colorful, gold-laden robes true to the form of komedya but styled differently, like the gown of Reyna Leona, a bright red terno heavily decorated with gold sequins and accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plays that use an improvised style for their costumes, most of the time to perform a function, not to create the milieu of the story. In <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/549\"><strong>Games People Play</strong></a></em></strong>, 2014, the three characters carry the audience from scene to scene by announcing each scene&rsquo;s title, already consciously referring to the play as a play. While wearing an all-black base costume, the three characters shift to other characters by adding pieces from their toy box. Julio easily transforms to Luna&rsquo;s religious mother by wearing an alampay over his head and clinging on to a rosary; Diego shifts to Julio&rsquo;s nosy sister by just holding a fan. In <strong><em>Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</em></strong>, 2011, an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s <strong><em>Caucasian Chalk Circle</em></strong>, the play used Maranao-inspired costumes in order to adapt the issues discussed in the play to the Philippine setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some plays showcase costumes from foreign cultures. In <strong><em>Haring Lear</em></strong> (<strong><em>King Lear</em></strong>), 2012, black Japanese kimonos were used as base costumes for every character save for Cordelia, who wore a white shirt and pants ensemble. The play&rsquo;s shaven all-male cast were differentiated through their makeup, headdresses, and accessories. In <strong><em>Ang Nawalang Kapatid</em></strong> (The Missing Sibling), 2014, an adaptation of the Indian epic <strong><em>Mahabharata</em></strong>, ancient Indian fashion was recreated not just in the cut of the characters&rsquo; inner and outer garments but also in their hairstyles and makeup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there are plays that use a nonrealistic or fantastic style. The enormous capes and headresses used in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/591\"><strong>Luna: An Aswang Romance</strong></a></em></strong>, 2006, helped in establishing and pushing forward the fantastical nature of the play. In <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/682\"><strong><em>Umaaraw, Umuulan Kinakasal ang <strong>Tikbalang</strong></em></strong></a> (Sun Shining, Rain Pouring, Horse Demons Wed), 2012, masks and fanciful costumes were worn to create the&nbsp;<em>tikbalang</em>, dwarves,&nbsp;<em>santelmo&nbsp;</em>(ball of fire),&nbsp;<em>tiyanak&nbsp;</em>(changeling),&nbsp;<em>kapre&nbsp;</em>(tree demon), snakes, dogs, and rats residing in the enchanted forest. The costumes in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/561\"><strong><em>Ibalong</em></strong></a>, 2013, invested the monster characters with a frightening grotesqueness through the use of imaginatively designed plastic and industrial-based materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costume design in Philippine theater has thus profited from the wardrobes of the past, the lifestyles of the present, and the visions of playwrights and designers.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

Since saints&#x2019; statues and their&#xA0;<em>estampitas&#xA0;</em>(holy pictures) were the most accessible pictorial sources for costuming, <a href=\"/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> characters are generally costumed like the images of Lenten processions. Christ is often in maroon velvet with gold appliques or embroidery, wearing white lace at his neck and wrists, a brunette wig, and three thin rays called <strong>potensiya</strong>, like the Quiapo Nazareno. Mary may be in a blue and purple gown with a white or purple veil tucked under a <strong>rostrillo</strong> (thin rays around her face), a heart with seven daggers traced in sequins on her breast. San Juan is in red and green; Maria Magdalena in purple/red and yellow; Veronica in blue and white. For the Holy Thursday washing of the feet, the&#xA0;<em>apostoles&#xA0;</em>or apostles wear long robes, sometimes borrowed priests&#x2019; soutanes, with capes in the brightest colors available, giving rise in Silay, Negros Occidental, to the expression &#x201C;<em>kulay&#xA0;</em>apostoles&#x201D; (color of the apostles)."

The costumes help to externalize the komedya&#x2019;s ideological messages. Thus Christians are dressed in black or dark colors (green, blue, purple), while Moors are attired in red or orange. To underscore the hierarchy of authority, the king wears the longest cape and the only crown; the queen dons a long cape and a long gown; the prince, a small cape and a<strong> tres picos</strong> (three-cornered) hat; the soldiers, tiny capes and small hats. All male characters usually carry swords and daggers, and the ladies fans, unless they are costumed as men, in which case they also carry weaponry."

The costumes were part of character identification, in effect the first indication of their roles. The don wore the <strong>Americana cerrada</strong> or <strong>abierta</strong> (male wear of the early American period) and carried hats and canes; the do&#xF1;a wore the <strong>baro&#x2019;t saya</strong> or <strong>terno</strong> and carried handbag and fan. The young girls (heroine included) wore the <strong>saya</strong> with <strong>tapis</strong> (overskirt), and carried fans and handkerchiefs, unless they were &#x201C;modern girls,&#x201D; in which case they wore the <strong>vestido</strong> or <strong>bestida</strong>, the American-style dress of the period. Girls from the province and women of lower social stature wore the <strong>balintawak</strong> or <strong>patadiong</strong>/<strong>kimona</strong>, usually with <strong>alampay</strong> and/or <strong>tapis</strong>. The farmer or fisherman was recognized by his rolled-up pants and <strong>camisa chino</strong>; the cockpit aficionado by the kerchief round his neck or more often round his head, and by the fighting cock he carried. Ingenues wore the sailor costume that boys and girls invariably wore at the time to have their pictures taken at photo studios."

				"value": "In contemporary theater, costume design has gradually grown into both an art form and a profession. The costume designer is now a creative artist, like the playwright, actor, or director. He studies, analyzes, and interprets the dramatic text in order to find its essence or primary theme. He then creates a visual incarnation of this theme through the costumes (Tiongson 2007)."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The visual concept a designer chooses for a play comes from a long process that involves careful study of the dramatic text and consultation with other members of the production. After the designer has analyzed the themes and elements of the text, he and the director discuss the possible interpretations they see for the play. The discussion usually begins with the director describing his understanding and approach to the text and his thoughts on possible styles for the production. The designer then suggests a few design possibilities until they reach some sort of consensus (Tiongson 2007). Once they decide on the vision and visual metaphor on which to anchor the visual design, the designer makes the preliminary sketches. Afterward, the designer and director hold another consultation with the lighting designer and technical staff, to ask for inputs and reach another consensus. Only after this shall the designer implement and execute his design. In this way, the costume becomes part of the performance&#x2014;even a performance in itself&#x2014;and is a necessary element to push the message of the play to the forefront. To do this, the costume designer exerts a huge amount of creativity to complement and elevate the overall artistry of the production."

				"value": "As much as it is an art form, costume design is also a profession. The professionalization of costume design is a product mainly of the establishment of theater groups and programs in some schools and the education of theater artists abroad. Most of the prominent theater designers are products of theater organizations based in schools, like the University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, Ateneo de Manila University, and <a href=\"/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>. They have hands-on experiences of campus theater where they honed their creativity and resourcefulness, often having to design and mount productions with very limited budgets. Later on, theater design became a course taught in some campuses. Some designers who sharpened their skills abroad include <a href=\"/7/60/3050\">Amiel Leonardia</a> (master of fine arts, University of Hawaii), <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a> (master of fine arts, Northwestern University), <a href=\"/7/7/2893\">Ludendorffo Decenteceo</a> (master of fine arts, Tulane University),&#xA0;<a href=\"/7/60/2999\">Mio Infante</a> (master of arts in scenography, Wimbledon School of Art), and <a href=\"/7/60/2973\">Gino Gonzales</a> (master of fine arts, New York University). These designers returned to the country and shared their expertise with theater design students. The circle of professional theater designers even became more solidified with the establishment of the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3168\">Philippine Association of Theater Designers and Technicians</a> in 1994."

				"value": "From a wide variety of styles, the costume designer chooses and decides which one best expresses the vision, objective, and statement of the play. In period plays, costumes are indispensable in recreating the particular period of a play. Such are the costumes of the sarsuwela <a href=\"/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907), 1992, which include baro&#x2019;t saya of the <strong>serpentina</strong> period for the women, and camisa chino or americana abierta for the men. <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/670\"><strong>Stageshow</strong></a></em></strong>, 2012, dressed the female characters in bestida with bright yellow, red, and blue, flaunting the balloon skirts for dancing around the stage. The male characters were in the usual white Americana of stage show performers. Even periods of foreign lands can be emulated through costumes. Germany during the Nazi regime was revived in <strong><em>Der Kaufmann</em></strong> (<strong><em>The Merchant of Venice</em></strong>), 2013, an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x2019;s classic set in the German holocaust during World War II. Even in period plays that require a specific look, the costume designer still makes sure that the characters are not just identified but also delineated from each other through different cuts, colors, and trimmings. To do his job properly, the designer does a lot of research in order to recreate the precise look and texture of a particular period in full detail. More importantly, he must exemplify resourcefulness itself in reconstructing clothing of the past using readily available, indigenous, and inexpensive materials. Salvador Bernal became prominent for transforming cheap materials, like&#xA0;<em>katsa&#xA0;</em>and abaca into beautiful costumes, as in <a href=\"/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Pagkahaba-haba Man ng Prusisyon, Sa <strong>Simbahan</strong> Din ang Tuloy</em></strong> (<strong><em>Much Ado about Nothing</em></strong>) and <a href=\"/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong>."

In <strong><em>Mga Buhay na Apoy</em></strong> (A Breath of Fire), 2015, the audience easily identified a contemporary Manila-based family in the clothing they wore. This realistic portrayal of the characters aided in stressing the conflict between their new traditions and their utter denial of their indigenous <a href=\"/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a> cultural roots."

The two adversary clans in <strong><em>Sintang Dalisay</em></strong> both wore clothing from Southern Philippines, with the Kalimuddin clan primarily in red versus the Mustapha clan in blue."

While highlighting elements of Bisayan Philippine ethnic clothing, the costumes&#x2019; red, blue, or yellow color scheme for each of the three kingdoms and their princesses helped in the play&#x2019;s attempt to symbolically represent the three major islands of the Philippines that Labaw Donggon unites throughout his journey. A symbolic use of costume was also showcased in <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1995. It played with the image of an <a href=\"/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>-type fish skeleton and incorporated it as the main motif in the set and costumes, together with a light design that used a lot of greens and blues, to visualize the conflict between the local loan sharks and the poor peasants they victimize (Tiongson 2007). In <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (Hundred Dreams), 2007, a stylized version of traditional komedya costumes was used. The characters wore colorful, gold-laden robes true to the form of komedya but styled differently, like the gown of Reyna Leona, a bright red terno heavily decorated with gold sequins and accessories."

In <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/549\"><strong>Games People Play</strong></a></em></strong>, 2014, the three characters carry the audience from scene to scene by announcing each scene&#x2019;s title, already consciously referring to the play as a play. While wearing an all-black base costume, the three characters shift to other characters by adding pieces from their toy box. Julio easily transforms to Luna&#x2019;s religious mother by wearing an alampay over his head and clinging on to a rosary; Diego shifts to Julio&#x2019;s nosy sister by just holding a fan. In <strong><em>Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</em></strong>, 2011, an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&#x2019;s <strong><em>Caucasian Chalk Circle</em></strong>, the play used Maranao-inspired costumes in order to adapt the issues discussed in the play to the Philippine setting."

In <strong><em>Haring Lear</em></strong> (<strong><em>King Lear</em></strong>), 2012, black Japanese kimonos were used as base costumes for every character save for Cordelia, who wore a white shirt and pants ensemble. The play&#x2019;s shaven all-male cast were differentiated through their makeup, headdresses, and accessories. In <strong><em>Ang Nawalang Kapatid</em></strong> (The Missing Sibling), 2014, an adaptation of the Indian epic <strong><em>Mahabharata</em></strong>, ancient Indian fashion was recreated not just in the cut of the characters&#x2019; inner and outer garments but also in their hairstyles and makeup."

The enormous capes and headresses used in <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/591\"><strong>Luna: An Aswang Romance</strong></a></em></strong>, 2006, helped in establishing and pushing forward the fantastical nature of the play. In <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/682\"><strong><em>Umaaraw, Umuulan Kinakasal ang <strong>Tikbalang</strong></em></strong></a> (Sun Shining, Rain Pouring, Horse Demons Wed), 2012, masks and fanciful costumes were worn to create the&#xA0;<em>tikbalang</em>, dwarves,&#xA0;<em>santelmo&#xA0;</em>(ball of fire),&#xA0;<em>tiyanak&#xA0;</em>(changeling),&#xA0;<em>kapre&#xA0;</em>(tree demon), snakes, dogs, and rats residing in the enchanted forest.

		"text": "<p>Drama criticism is the written evaluation of play texts and of theater performances by informed and schooled critics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a time and place where potential audiences need not only information (what, where, and when) about the production, but especially an informed evaluation that tells them whether the performance is worth attending and what they might expect when they do attend, the drama critic is a key person in the theater world. Critics educate by informing and interpreting; they set texts in context, performances within social and historical parameters. Their impact is on both performer and audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drama criticism is a phenomenon of modern Philippine theater. Ethnic drama had no critics, only a critical audience that understood all that the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, ceremonies, verbal jousts, songs, and dances meant, but did not need to weigh their quality, because they were seen as life rather than performance. Folk drama, like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\">sinakulo</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a>, had informed audiences who had participated in the production&mdash;perhaps even the writing of the play. Audiences might make oral comments, such as &ldquo;<em>Talagang maganda itong sarsuwela</em>&rdquo; (This sarsuwela is truly beautiful), because, according to folk aesthetics, it is &ldquo;<em>nangangaral</em>&rdquo; (it teaches a lesson) or &ldquo;<em>parang tunay na buhay</em>&rdquo; (it is like real life).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Two works by Spaniards on Philippine theater history, however, also include some criticism in the form of commentary on plays of the period that they viewed or heard of. Vicente Barrantes in <strong><em>El <strong>Teatro&nbsp;</strong></em></strong><strong><em>Tagalo</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> Theater), 1889, has a long and scathing review of a komedya, <strong><em>Do&ntilde;a Ines Cuello de Garza y el Principe Nicanor</em></strong> (Lady Ines with the Swan Neck and the Prince Nicanor). The scholarly Wenceslao Retana in <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/729\"><strong><em>Noticias Historico-Bibliograficas&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>de&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>El Teatro en Filipinas&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>desde Sus Origenes hasta 1898</em></strong></a> (Historico-Bibliogaphical Notes on the Theater in the Philippines from Its Beginnings to 1898), 1909, collects all historical and bibliographical information on Philippine theater to that date, and comments as well on plays read, heard of, and viewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the later years of the sarsuwela and the drama, however, journalists in cities like Manila and Iloilo began to write not just announcements of forthcoming plays but also commentaries that reflected the day&rsquo;s values. A writer in Iloilo&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Tiempo</em></strong>, for example, wrote in 1903 that <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2859\">Valente Cristoba</a>l&rsquo;s plays were based on &ldquo;actual customs and real Philippine life &hellip; [and this is] one of the golden steps by which one climbs to the Temple of Art.&rdquo; The superiority of the sarsuwela over the komedya (&ldquo;the komedya has no truth and no lessons to teach&rdquo;) was also debated in the newspapers, which were just beginning to become the venue for drama criticism. Notable are the defense of the komedya as a Filipino drama by I<a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5237\">sabelo delos Reyes</a> in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/702\"><strong>Ang Comediang Tagalog</strong></a></em></strong> (The Tagalog Comedia), 1904, and the attack on the komedya as benighted theater by <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/712\"><strong><em>Ang <strong>Dulang Tagalog</strong></em></strong></a> (The Tagalog Theater), 1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\">drama simboliko</a>, called &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; by the Americans, elicited considerable mileage in the press, not necessarily about its artistic quality but more often about its political meaning and effect. Arthur S. Riggs, editor of the daily newspaper <strong><em>The Manila Freedom</em></strong>, left comments and condemnations, as well as historical information. He went on to write a manuscript, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/713\"><strong><em>The&nbsp;Filipino Drama</em></strong></a>, 1905, which precedes Retana&rsquo;s <strong><em>El&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Teatro en Filipinas</em></strong> as the earliest work on Philippine theater history, and which may also be called criticism, because of its commentary that <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at&nbsp;Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow), 1903, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> is &ldquo;lurid and fantastic, grisly and forbidding, tragic and horrible in even its lighter parts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drama criticism, the way it is understood today, begins properly with such schooled writers as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5491\">Ignacio Manlapaz</a>, a University of the Philippines professor who wrote on drama in the <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></strong></em></strong> in the 1930s. Teachers like <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2919\">Jean Garott Edades</a> not only directed plays and collected them in anthologies, but later wrote theater history and commentary as well, as did journalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5388\">Francisco B. Icasiano</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1950s saw in the newspapers of the era reviews by what one might call &ldquo;almost full-time&rdquo; critics who were not teachers or directors. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5256\">Morli Dharam</a> is known mainly as drama critic, although he has written a play; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3039\">Jose Lardizabal</a>, who wrote two plays himself, covered dance as well as theater. J. Zulueta da Costa was an impresario who wrote music criticism, and occasionally commented on plays. National Artist for dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a> wrote drama and dance reviews for various publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very important critic was <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D. Perez III</a> (later Dom Bernardo Perez, OSB). He reviewed music, dance, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a>, and drama according to the professional standards. He attended first nights, never applauded or showed his reaction, then headed straight for the newspaper office to write his objective, knowledgeable, and insightful reviews, so that they could be read the next day, in time for readers to catch other performances. Contemporary to Perez was Bienvenido Lumbera, then a poet and professor of literature and drama, later literary historian and critic, lyricist, and playwright. In reviewing plays for the <strong><em>Weekly Graphic</em></strong>, he was impelled by the wish to help audiences understand the form as well as the play, and educate them in the appreciation of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Drama criticism from the 1970s to the 1980s was engaged in by academicians who are either literature or drama professors, like <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5278\">Silvino V.

Because of the closeness, the critic is generally at least an acquaintance of the writer, director, or actor who is the subject of criticism. More often, he or she is colleague, peer, or friend. Because of the personalism of Filipino society, in which interdependence makes frank speech something to be avoided as potentially painful (indirection is kinder), it is difficult for the critic to speak directly, and equally difficult for the subject to accept even constructive criticism objectively.

		"text": "<p>Directing refers to the overall supervision and coordination of the elements of theatrical production, including acting and the design of sets, props, costumes, lights, and sounds. The person responsible for the actual staging of a theatrical production is called <strong>direktor</strong> in a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, or other folk plays, or the director as defined and understood in Western theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> and ceremonies of the<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432\"> indigenous theater</a>, the directorial role was taken by the master of ritual, who drew from tradition and occasion to ordain and oversee the process. Very often that person was the principal shaman who closely monitored the preparation of offerings, setting, and process to ensure the efficacy of the ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In folk theater, the direktor supervises casting, calls rehearsals, gives instructions about acting and staging. However, because this is carried out in the context of a town or community preparing for Holy Week or a fiesta, or within a <strong>samahan</strong>, a group brought together by the desire to stage a play as fund raiser or communal activity (not by a job contract), the direktor differs from the director. The <strong>direktor</strong> usually has no formal training, only experience (usually as an actor) in the form they are directing. They are often the authors of the plays&mdash;and perhaps also the <strong>apuntador</strong> (prompter), stage manager, and producer. Casting they carry out, often with the help of others supervising the production, in a way that will not disrupt community relationships&mdash;no auditions or blunt rejections, but a subtle process of evaluation and choosing that is conducted almost as one would ask for a girl&rsquo;s (actor&rsquo;s) hand in marriage (participation in the play). They do not so much interpret the play or evolve a directorial concept, as teach traditional stage movements and gestures, and indicate feeling. They conduct rehearsals and discipline the actors. They may prepare the <strong>apuntacion</strong> (prompt book), if they are not themselves prompters. They also list the props, perhaps purchase them (the notebooks in which sarsuwela scripts are written usually have props and prices listed in the back pages), or describe them to the <strong>comite de festejos</strong> (fiesta committee) or the impresario, if any.They specify and borrow costumes, or have them made. As director de escena (scene director), they may see to the building of the <strong>entablado</strong> (temporary stage), its lighting, and sets (<strong>telones</strong> or painted backdrops, furniture, stage props). As <strong>director de magia</strong> (director of magic), they would have charge of the stage machinery and special effects (apparitions, waterfalls, magic transformations), unless they have a <strong>tramoyista</strong> (machinery person) in charge. As <strong>director compositor</strong> (director of composition), they may also be the composer of the music, perhaps even the conductor. During the performance, they attend actively to various functions&mdash;backstage, participating in the stage management; at the foot of the stage, perhaps prompting from the prompter&rsquo;s box called <strong>concha</strong> or <strong>kubol</strong>, just below the stage (with earphones on and/or assistants beside them); or even onstage, playing a character part. They may have assistants&mdash;their families, other former actors, possibly a committee, and they may act virtually single-handedly. The direktor is, in effect, at the helm of the production, in a time before training and specialization, when involvement with theater was passion rather than profession, community commitment rather than calling.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many directorial practices find their roots in the theater of Europe, which were brought by the Spanish to the Philippines. Thus, the komedya, sinakulo, and sarsuwela companies or samahan operated within this framework since the Spanish period, and continue to do so through contemporary community-based theater groups doing folk theater today (2015). For komedya for instance, Tropang Komedya ng Baler in Baler, Aurora, headed by Juan Valenzuela Sr, Antonino Ramos, and Jaime Bernardino, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3238\">San Antonio Cultural Group</a> in Antique, headed by Corazon Ballo-allo Cataluna, keep the komedya form vibrant and alive. In Manila, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3028\">Komedya ng San Dionisio</a>, headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2984\">Herminio Hernandez</a>, and <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3026\">Komedya ng Don Galo</a>, of Marilou DC Macatuggal and Macaria Espiritu, continue the tradition even in urbanized areas. The sinakulo is given life every Holy Week in Metro Manila by groups such as the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3234\">Samahan ng Sinakulista ng Pio del Pilar</a>, based in Makati, headed by Aristotle Garcia, son of Ariston Garcia who was one of the key personalities that revived the tradition which began as early as the 1920s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3236\">Samahang Nazareno Inc</a> in Cainta, Rizal, of Romarico &ldquo;Omar&rdquo; Cruz; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3287\">Tanghalang Santa Ana</a> in Manila by actor-director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3349\">Lou Veloso</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While the komedya remained relatively unchanged over time, the Spanish zarzuela evolved from its colonial origins to the vernacular sarsuwela, which eventually paved the way for its modernization and professionalization, especially in Manila. In the Iloko zarzuela, Isaias R. Lazaro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3139\">Barbaro Paat</a>, and Pascual Guerrero Agcaoili were leading directors. Agcaoili was especially significant in the form&rsquo;s evolution from the traditional to the modern style. The representative playwrights of the Lineyte-Samarnon sarsuwela tradition, many of whom were directors, include <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3063\">Iluminado Lucente</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2731\">Francisco Alvarado</a>, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2737\">Emilio Andrada Sr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2995\">Jesus Ignacio</a>, Margarita Nonato, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3253\">Pedro Separa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2717\">Pedro Acerden</a>, Eduardo Hilbano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2948\">Moning Fuentes</a>, Generoso Nuevas, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3132\">Augustin El.

Nava</a> (Hiligaynon).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The directors in modern Philippine theater are a departure from the more communal, literal, and ritualistic practice of the traditional direktor. Indeed, some contemporary directors control set, stage, costumes, lights, and the actors&rsquo; voices and bodies. They may be autocratic and authoritarian, or may direct as part of a team. They provide the vision, as well as the moment-by-moment expression in terms of speech and movement, direction, and production. They may also make actual contributions to the development or revision of the script, as when they help playwrights flesh out action, or make concepts more stageable. Like his historical counterpart, the direktor, the modern director may have his or her hand in all aspects of staging and creation. However, also like his Western peer&mdash;and potentially because of Western influence in the education of many contemporary Filipino directors&mdash;the director in modern Philippine theater is highly individualistic, intent on creating a unique interpretation and expression of the dramatic material at hand. The contemporary Filipino director can bring tools, such as perspective, ideology, and methodology, to interpret, reinterpret, deconstruct, and reimagine a dramatic text for the audience. The director&rsquo;s vision can be the foundation for the work, and from that stems the design and execution of the creative piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several ways by which potential modern directors gain training and experience. While many universities offer theater subjects and some ostensibly offer theater programs under either a humanities or communications umbrella, the University of the Philippines (UP) is still the only university that offers the most comprehensive theater program in the country, offering courses in acting, directing, design, management, and technical theater. Potential directors benefit greatly from learning from a faculty roster that is composed primarily of practicing artist professionals, trained both here and abroad&mdash;directors, actors, designers, etc.&mdash;who direct for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>, the production arm of the theater program. Still, most Filipino directors learn their craft through involvement in most or all aspects of theater (from stagehand to principal) through apprenticeship to other directors; through training-workshops offered in schools, by theater groups, by institutions like the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, and by foreign embassies or cultural agencies; through training in schools abroad; and through interest, self-study, and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial group of influential &ldquo;modern&rdquo; directors in the Philippines were the first generation of American or mostly (if not all) American-educated artists, students, writers. They came or returned to the Philippines and began to establish theater programs, offer theater-related courses, and form theater companies, which were primarily based in various universities. Although coming from diverse (educational) backgrounds and theatrical exposure, these artists began to introduce formally Western theatrical traditions and practices, while also adapting to local conditions. These pioneers include the following: Fr <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3005\">Henry Lee Irwin</a>, SJ (Ateneo de Manila), and <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2919\">Jean Garrot Edades</a> (UP) of the prewar and immediate postwar era; and those who flourished in the postwar era to the 1970s, like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> (<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a> of the Philippine Normal University), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma.

The schools and companies that were developed or created by these early influentials came with an artistic vision and tradition, either a particular methodology or worldview that influenced the training of the artists who were involved. Directors identified with particular companies embody the principles&mdash;whether artistic or political&mdash;on which the company was originally founded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the university-based companies in Manila, the most prominent are Dulaang UP and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, in terms of regularity of seasons, media coverage, and employment of professionals. Arguably, UP, and specifically Dulaang UP, perhaps because it is the production arm of the university&rsquo;s theater program and through the mentorship of its founding artistic director Tony Mabesa, has produced the most diverse breed of directors in terms of approaches or style. Among the more prominent directing alumni of UP are <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2985\">Jorge Hernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3045\">Jorge Ledesma</a>, and <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2854\">Alexander Cortez</a>, followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3079\">Dennis Marasigan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3019\">Ogie Juliano</a>, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2925\">Josefina &ldquo;Jose&rdquo; Estrella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2541\">Paul Morales</a>, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2969\">Herbert &ldquo;Herbie&rdquo; Go</a>, <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3228\">Armando &ldquo;Tuxqs&rdquo; Rutaquio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3245\">Dexter Santos</a>. These alumni, aside from continuing to direct, are in such diverse but related fields, such as teaching, arts management, film, and events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ateneo de Manila University has produced several generations of directors through the various companies based there. Rolando Tinio, then head of the Ateneo Experimental Theater, mentored <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a> and <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2712\">Ricky Abad</a> of Tanghalang Ateneo, and was a major influence on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3211\">Leo Rialp</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3062\">Ella Luansing</a>.

Repertory Philippines, the bastion of English language theater in Manila, focuses especially on Broadway and West End musicals, while developing new generations of English language musical performers.

Their work used theater as a vehicle to promote local culture by mounting original plays based on the stories of their respective tribes or communities. Much of their work have also tackled issues critical to their constituencies&mdash;human rights, peace and conflict, and environmental conservation. These plays promoted awareness and understanding of their diverse but intertwined cultures and histories, as well as elevated the artistic standard and developed the regional aesthetic.

Sarabosing and Owen Jaen (The <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2750\">Artists&#39; Quarter</a>, later renamed Artists Quarter Educational Movement).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably, the directors in the regional theaters can be said to be closest to the voice of &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; theater, with their intimate connection to their communities and willingness to address civic issues at the grassroots level. They may represent a literal amalgamation of the historical direktor&rsquo;s traditional and communal practices, as well as the more formalized methods of the contemporary director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the principal problems of the director in the Philippines were a lack of opportunities and venues, since there were few professional theaters, and few theater groups outside schools; a lack of exposure to various types of theater, and an excess of exposure to film and television; a lack of good materials and writers, and the difficulty of locating extant materials since there are no script bureaus or services and few publications; and the lack of a training center, or of a forum in which directors can evaluate the Philippine theater landscape, and consider the evolution of directorial styles to suit its many facets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While most of these problems still exist today in various degrees, there have been some changes. In terms of opportunities and venues, the Virgin Labfest, the festival of untried and untested one-act plays held annually at the CCP since 2005, has contributed to the discovery of new directing talent. It has provided opportunities not just for promising young playwrights to be discovered but also to budding and (established) directors, who just need the right material to truly shine and gain recognition. Directors such as Rutaquio and Lacson are proof of this. The festival is a great training ground for directors as the existing setup and parameters&mdash;low budget, cramped rehearsal spaces, etc.&mdash;test one&rsquo;s creativity and ingenuity. Aside from the older regional/national theater festivals, like Dayaw and the CCP-initiated national theater festival, other recent alternative festivals, such as Karnabal, fringe manila, and short&amp;sweet, have provided directors, either as independents or with their respective companies, occasions for showcase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, while more theater companies&mdash;professional, university-based, community-based&mdash;have been formed, sustainability in terms of securing funding, marketing, and sponsorship are perennial challenges. Only the CCP since 1986 and the NCCA since 1992 have regularly provided production, venue, or touring grants to theater companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While funding for the arts continues to be limited, a new generation of artists are using technology to promote their work. Technology, especially the Internet and cellular phones, have played very important roles in gaining exposure for artists and theater companies. Social media and cellphones have helped tremendously in providing very inexpensive (if not free) publicity&mdash;through Facebook, blogs, websites, blast texts, YouTube, among other&mdash;for all kinds of performances from all types of companies and artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased opportunity and exposure call for an increase in content. Directors can devise original work or envision a classic, but new dramatic texts capturing the contemporary Filipino experience are always in demand. In terms of a database of materials, the Virgin Labfest (VLF), like its predecessors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3144\">Palihang </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> and CCP Bulwagang Gantimpala, has contributed significantly to the creation of written content for Filipino theater. The VLF has published two volumes of the best plays in the festival, providing theater students, professionals, and enthusiasts with new local texts that have had the advantage of a production. Some companies, like PETA, came out with their own script series. Other publishers, both commercial and university-based, have also printed several play anthologies in the past decade. The Internet has also helped to make playwrights and their works more accessible to both readers and practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the landscape of Filipino theater has been enriched by the directors from numerous schools and regions that have created, nurtured, and formed the many themes and aesthetics of that theater. The future is even more promising because these directors continue to nurture their principal assets: a readiness to learn from others, local or foreign, and to adapt knowledge gained to local conditions; the availability of the repertory of the past, especially Philippine indigenous and folk theater, which offers texts, dramaturgy, and styles rooted in the culture; and a creative ingenuity that makes them deal flexibly with different materials, conditions, and problems. The Filipino director is heir to the community-rooted direktor, a product of exposure to theater from East and West, and an artist whose creativity has been sharpened by urgency and adversity.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

However, because this is carried out in the context of a town or community preparing for Holy Week or a fiesta, or within a <strong>samahan</strong>, a group brought together by the desire to stage a play as fund raiser or communal activity (not by a job contract), the direktor differs from the director. The <strong>direktor</strong> usually has no formal training, only experience (usually as an actor) in the form they are directing. They are often the authors of the plays&#x2014;and perhaps also the <strong>apuntador</strong> (prompter), stage manager, and producer. Casting they carry out, often with the help of others supervising the production, in a way that will not disrupt community relationships&#x2014;no auditions or blunt rejections, but a subtle process of evaluation and choosing that is conducted almost as one would ask for a girl&#x2019;s (actor&#x2019;s) hand in marriage (participation in the play). They do not so much interpret the play or evolve a directorial concept, as teach traditional stage movements and gestures, and indicate feeling. They conduct rehearsals and discipline the actors. They may prepare the <strong>apuntacion</strong> (prompt book), if they are not themselves prompters. They also list the props, perhaps purchase them (the notebooks in which sarsuwela scripts are written usually have props and prices listed in the back pages), or describe them to the <strong>comite de festejos</strong> (fiesta committee) or the impresario, if any.They specify and borrow costumes, or have them made. As director de escena (scene director), they may see to the building of the <strong>entablado</strong> (temporary stage), its lighting, and sets (<strong>telones</strong> or painted backdrops, furniture, stage props). As <strong>director de magia</strong> (director of magic), they would have charge of the stage machinery and special effects (apparitions, waterfalls, magic transformations), unless they have a <strong>tramoyista</strong> (machinery person) in charge. As <strong>director compositor</strong> (director of composition), they may also be the composer of the music, perhaps even the conductor. During the performance, they attend actively to various functions&#x2014;backstage, participating in the stage management; at the foot of the stage, perhaps prompting from the prompter&#x2019;s box called <strong>concha</strong> or <strong>kubol</strong>, just below the stage (with earphones on and/or assistants beside them); or even onstage, playing a character part. They may have assistants&#x2014;their families, other former actors, possibly a committee, and they may act virtually single-handedly. The direktor is, in effect, at the helm of the production, in a time before training and specialization, when involvement with theater was passion rather than profession, community commitment rather than calling."

However, also like his Western peer&#x2014;and potentially because of Western influence in the education of many contemporary Filipino directors&#x2014;the director in modern Philippine theater is highly individualistic, intent on creating a unique interpretation and expression of the dramatic material at hand. The contemporary Filipino director can bring tools, such as perspective, ideology, and methodology, to interpret, reinterpret, deconstruct, and reimagine a dramatic text for the audience.

It has provided opportunities not just for promising young playwrights to be discovered but also to budding and (established) directors, who just need the right material to truly shine and gain recognition. Directors such as Rutaquio and Lacson are proof of this. The festival is a great training ground for directors as the existing setup and parameters&#x2014;low budget, cramped rehearsal spaces, etc.&#x2014;test one&#x2019;s creativity and ingenuity.

		"text": "<p>Lighting in theater involves the use of lights and other related equipment for the purpose of illuminating the stage, creating atmosphere and mood, producing special effects, and highlighting character and action. Stage lighting includes the utilization of footlights, sidelights, overhead illumination, spotlights, and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illumination&mdash;so that the audience could see the actors and the stage&mdash;was the primary and, for a long time, the only purpose of stage lighting in traditional theater. In the sinakulo of Malolos, Bulacan, ingenious folk lighting included a well-dried ring of carabao manure, soaked in kerosene then ignited, and lasting just about as long as the evening&rsquo;s performance. Torches, too, were used&mdash;in one instance in Malolos, ensconced in the spreading branches of a papaya tree, creating a chandelier-like effect. A collection of parol (kerosene lanterns) also served to light the stage, and eventually brighter illumination was provided by Coleman and other brands of kerosene lamps. The only special lighting was created by the lusis (sparklers) used to highlight scenes depicting miracles: angels descending, Mary ascending, the resurrection of Christ. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, too, used candlelight then lamplight (kerosene) to light outdoor stages (Tiongson 1975).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When electricity became available, the folk stage used incandescent or fluorescent bulbs for general illumination. This lighting was generally static, with no light changes and no focusing, simply on and off switching. The indoor stages that came later had the advantage of footlights and some other equipment used for the sarsuwela and the drama; outdoor stages generally had only overhead lighting and occasional spotlights. Exposure to filmmaking and its equipment, and the availability of more advanced stage equipment, however, eventually showed folk production crews the possibilities of creating mood by the use of lights and filters. In the early days, this was done by simply covering the lights with colored cellophane.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater and production workshops, traveling groups, courses in theater production, lectures and seminars, available and higher technology, eventually influenced folk and outdoor as well as urban and indoor theater, such that now even a barrio komedya may hire spotlights and a light crew, or even build its own fixed lights and control board for lights that include illumination, mood, character enhancement, and special effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1950s, when lighting technology became increasingly available in Manila and in some provincial theaters, as well as lighting equipment for rental to schools and theater groups, the personnel for lighting developed alongside the technology. Technicians who learned to handle, link, and create effects with the new equipment were mostly self-taught at first, using common sense and native ingenuity. Others learned from the movies, from directors, from other lighting staff, and from visiting troupes; others developed their own innovative techniques. Vic Lopez, who was responsible for lighting many of the plays of Fr <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3207\">James B .Reuter, SJ</a>, started as stagehand, became lightsman, acquired and developed his own equipment and expertise as contractor for stage lighting, and has since trained others. Tom Borromeo, who rented out lights for stage and for parties in the 1950s, learned by lighting his sisters <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2418\">Julie</a> and <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a>&rsquo;s dance performances. The tiny <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a> Theater at the Ateneo de Manila High School is lit by the boys, who created the lighting system: control board, and overhead lights made from bulbs and empty pineapple juice cans. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2956\">Joonee Gamboa</a>, who trained the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinanga</a>n theater group, taught them as well how to light their stages with homemade equipment. <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2990\">Teddy L.

Shaw Theater, Resorts World in Newport City in Manila, and Solaire in Para&ntilde;aque. The opportunity for lighting design is therefore almost necessarily limited to Manila. Here, lighting designers can practice and refine their craft, learn from visiting lighting designers, and profit from grants given by embassies and cultural agencies for more training abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most other groups use simple equipment&mdash;such as par lamps, locally assembled dimmers, or even just bulbs switched on and off, perhaps with voltage regulators&mdash;and have little opportunity for training. With the introduction of the bachelor of arts in theater arts program at UP in 1979, a course in stage lighting afforded student formal training in the field. Similar courses are also taught at the College of Saint Benilde and the Meridian International College of Business, Arts and Technology, both of which offer degree programs in theater arts. In-service training may also be had with such groups as PETA and with the CCP Theater Operations Department, involving representatives from the regions. PETA credits the interaction between its in-house technical staff and guest designers and technical directors with helping them improve their craft. It also considers as a strong influence Japanese master lighting designer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3091\">Shoko Matsumoto</a>, who established Sinag Arts Foundation in 1998, a training center for theater technicians. Occasional workshops are conducted by the CCP and other groups to help theater groups and lighting designers in areas outside Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creative ingenuity born of need, however, has enabled some provincial groups&mdash;like the Barasoain Kalinangan of Malolos, Bulacan; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> of Marawi; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild</a>; Negros Theater League; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3022\">Kaliwat Theater Collective</a>; and others&mdash;to create effective lighting design with available and improvised equipment and facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first local publication on stage lighting is Katsch SJ Catoy&rsquo;s <strong><em>Some Thoughts on Lighting a Performance: The Making of a Salt Solution Dimmer Prototype</em></strong>, 1992. It was inspired by a sarsuwela performance in Talisay, Negros Occidental, staged by the Katilingban Santa Catalina Tuburan Community Theater Company, lit by an effective homemade salt solution lighting dimmer made from hardware and household materials. The book not only gives instructions on the making of the prototype of such a dimmer, but also surveys stage lighting in the Philippines, discusses lighting in general, and provides a glossary of terms. It also demonstrates that technology is not all, since ingenuity and imagination can light up any stage anywhere. In 1994, the Technical Guild for Entertainment, an organization composed of technical suppliers and practitioners in live performance, began publishing a magazine called <strong><em>Stagepro</em></strong>, which featured articles on current industry trends and technical theater history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3170\">Philippine Legitimate Stage Artists Group Inc</a>, which includes professional theater, dance, and music companies, began giving out awards honoring outstanding achievements in the performing arts from among productions of its members. Winners for Outstanding Lighting Design were Dennis Marasigan, <strong><em>Kudeta</em></strong> (The Coup), 2009; Katsch SJ Catoy, <strong><em>Neo-Filipino</em></strong>, 2010, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/160\"><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></a></em></strong> (The Philippine Revolution), 2015; John Neil Batalla, <strong><em>Equus</em></strong>, 2011, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchanted), 2012; and Jimmy Villanueva, <strong><em>Alamat: Si Sibol at Gunaw</em></strong> (Legend: Sibol and Gunaw).

Torches, too, were used&#x2014;in one instance in Malolos, ensconced in the spreading branches of a papaya tree, creating a chandelier-like effect. A collection of parol (kerosene lanterns) also served to light the stage, and eventually brighter illumination was provided by Coleman and other brands of kerosene lamps. The only special lighting was created by the lusis (sparklers) used to highlight scenes depicting miracles: angels descending, Mary ascending, the resurrection of Christ. The <a href=\"/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, too, used candlelight then lamplight (kerosene) to light outdoor stages (Tiongson 1975)."

This lighting was generally static, with no light changes and no focusing, simply on and off switching. The indoor stages that came later had the advantage of footlights and some other equipment used for the sarsuwela and the drama; outdoor stages generally had only overhead lighting and occasional spotlights. Exposure to filmmaking and its equipment, and the availability of more advanced stage equipment, however, eventually showed folk production crews the possibilities of creating mood by the use of lights and filters. In the early days, this was done by simply covering the lights with colored cellophane."

Technicians who learned to handle, link, and create effects with the new equipment were mostly self-taught at first, using common sense and native ingenuity. Others learned from the movies, from directors, from other lighting staff, and from visiting troupes; others developed their own innovative techniques. Vic Lopez, who was responsible for lighting many of the plays of Fr <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3207\">James B .Reuter, SJ</a>, started as stagehand, became lightsman, acquired and developed his own equipment and expertise as contractor for stage lighting, and has since trained others.

It also demonstrates that technology is not all, since ingenuity and imagination can light up any stage anywhere. In 1994, the Technical Guild for Entertainment, an organization composed of technical suppliers and practitioners in live performance, began publishing a magazine called <strong><em>Stagepro</em></strong>, which featured articles on current industry trends and technical theater history."

		"text": "<p>Theater organizations are groups of theater enthusiasts and/or artists formed for the purpose of producing plays, training members in the arts and crafts of theater, creating support groups for theater, or mounting plays to raise social awareness or advance specific political agenda. It also refers to government institutions that support the theater activities of theater groups, as well as theater networks that are formed by various theater organizations in the provincial, regional, or national level as they recognize the importance of a larger body to advance their artistic and sociopolitical interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ethnic communities, groups are informally constituted, coming together almost only for the occasion and its need: <strong>babaylan</strong> (priests and priestesses) and their assistants for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>; dancers and singers for rites and ceremonies; poets, extemporaneous versifiers, and performers for mimeticjousts and games. Although such groups are not usually given names, their roles and membership are known to all, and their existence and function thus confirmed by the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Spanish colonial period, the folk dramas produced by the communities called for a measure of organization, thus the formation of the <strong>samahan</strong>. A <strong>samahang sinakulista</strong>, <strong>komedyante</strong>, or <strong>sarsuwelista</strong> is a group organized for the purpose of presenting a particular form of folk theater: <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>. The organization is informal and the meetings irregular, usually called only when there is a prospective production. It is generally convened and headed by an author, a director, or an author-director. It meets to make decisions relative to the staging of a play on its own, or as commissioned by a <strong>comite de festejos</strong> (fiesta committee) of its own town or of other towns or some other contracting agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The decisions include the play to present; the actors to play the parts; the number, schedule, and place of rehearsals; the telones (backdrops), sets, and props needed; the costumes and hand props to be made, borrowed, or rented; the rental of the theater; the amount to be charged the contracting agency; the transportation and housing to be provided; fees to be paid the actors and staff; and prospects of other productions. The rationale for a samahan is, in folk theater, rarely profit. More likely, it is sheer interest, or past participation in the theater form. It may also be the fact that playwrights want their plays staged, and call on their friends and relatives to help them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, the present-day komedya group, organized into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3028\">Komedya ng San Dionisio</a>, includes the director, actors, and members of the production staff. They run the production, mediating between the patrons who provide the funding, the actors, and the town, which is the source of funds, actors, support, and audience. They choose the play in conjunction with the <strong>hermano/hermana mayor</strong> (male/female sponsors); they form the cast and run rehearsals; they bring together all production needs; and they run the performance, including hiring chairs and disciplining the children in the audience. For none of them is the motive profit, or the involvement a profession; for all of them it is an active love for the komedya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important reason for staging folk theater by the samahan is the&nbsp;<em>panata&nbsp;</em>or devotion to a particular saint. Such is the case of Komedya ng Barbaza, which in 1995 was reorganized as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3238\">San Antonio Cultural Group</a>. The group produced a komedya as one of the highlights of the town fiesta of Barangay San Antonio, Barbaza, Antique. The fiesta was celebrated as a devotion to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Salvacion whom the community believed saved them from a calamity sometime in the 1890s, as evidenced by a statue of the Virgin Mary recovered from the great flood. The annual staging of the komedya up to the present is spearheaded by the Marquez clan. Other examples of theater groups whose main purpose of producing plays is their spiritual devotion are Tropang Komedya ng Baler, a komedya group based in Barangay Buhangin, Baler, Aurora, and Samahan ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3234\">Sinakulista ng Pio del Pilar</a>, a community theater group in Barangay Pio del Pilar, Makati City. Both theater groups sustain their annual theater activities through the support of the communities they serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the last few decades of the Spanish period, there were theater groups that presented mainly Spanish zarzuela. One such group is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2850\">Compa&ntilde;ia Zarzuela de la Torre</a>. It was established sometime in 1894 by the&nbsp;<em>gobernadorcillo&nbsp;</em>(mayor) of Albay, Hugo de la Torre, who had been in charge of staging komedya but later decided to present <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> sarsuwela after watching the performances of Spanish zarzuela troupes during his visits to Manila and Naga. There were other similar performing groups that existed since there were a number of theater venues during that time. In Manila, there were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3293\">Teatro de Binondo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3294\">Teatro de Variedades</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3295\">Teatro del Principe Alfonso</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3296\">Teatro Filipino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3292\">Teatro Circo de Bilibid</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3301\">Teatro Sibacon</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>; and in Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3297\">Teatro Junquera</a>. These theater groups may be considered the precursor of the professional theater groups that would develop and become popular during the early decades of the American period, and much later, the contemporary period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the years of American colonization, the first groups devoted to theater as a kind of profession were formed. This means that artists pursue the art as their career and so they are paid for it. Examples are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2973\">Gran Compa&ntilde;ia dela Zarzuela Tagala</a>, which staged mostly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> sarsuwela and drama; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3235\">Compa&ntilde;ia Zarzuela Ilagan</a> or Samahang Ilagan, which mounted sarsuwela written by Ilagan himself; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5707\">Vicente Sotto</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2848\">Compa&ntilde;ia de Aficionados Filipinos</a>, which aspired to create a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> theater that would be an alternative to Spanish zarzuela and Cebuano linambay; and Anacleto Solano&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2849\">Compa&ntilde;ia Zarzuela de Camalig</a>, which presented Spanish plays in Camalig, Albay. These theater groups were composed of writers, composers, actors, musicians, and backstage staff. They cast, rehearsed, and staged plays and presented them at different theaters in different towns. Their members derived income from this work, but were not fully supported by these part-time, seasonal jobs. Still, the large and small theater troupes (in Meycauayan, Bulacan, for example, there were eight such groups coexisting in the 1950s) added up to the beginnings of professional theater. Their members were recognized as belonging to the profession&mdash;notably, such luminaries as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2936\">Praxedes (Yeyeng) Fernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2818\">Maria Carpena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3198\">Nemesio Ratia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2823\">Jose Carvajal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang&nbsp;dela Rama</a>&mdash;and their productions filled the Manila and provincial theaters. Support services also grew around them&mdash; <strong>telon</strong> and set painters, costume makers, orchestras. It is said that in Pandacan, one could hire all the personnel and materials needed to mount a production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the American years, when the English language entered Philippine theater and pushed vernacular theater out of its central position, the organizations came to be quite naturally based in schools, which is where people learned and spoke English. This is the reason for the continuing importance of campus theater in the Philippines: the school as theater center and source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English-language theater began in the English classrooms, where recitations, declamations, readings, dialogues, skits, and short plays were used to reinforce the teaching of the new language. From there it was a natural step to the staging of plays in English in schools&mdash;with English teachers usually assigned the teaching of drama, the direction of drama groups, and the directing of plays&mdash;on such occasions as foundation days, feast days, Rizal Day, and Independence Day. The programs that used to contain music and songs from sarsuwela and recitations in Spanish now contained declamations, speeches, and playlets in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school and university setting produced such groups as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3335\">University of the Philippines (UP) Dramatic Club</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3336\">UP Mobile Theater</a>, both directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>. The UP Dramatic Club presented plays in English by foreign authors from within and outside the UP Campus. The UP Mobile Theater, on the other hand, brought Philippine plays in English, and later in translation into the major Philippine languages, to many provincial audiences around the country. These two theater groups established a strong tradition of campus theater at UP that continued in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\">Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3166\">Peryante</a>, UP Tropa, and others. The exposure and experience produced many theater personalities, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, Teddy Yabut, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3353\">Cris Vertido</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3065\">Antonio Mabesa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2902\">Celia Diaz-Laurel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3359\">Joy Gamboa-Virata</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2956\">Joonee Gamboa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Ateneo de Manila University, the group directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3005\">Henry Lee Irwin</a>, SJ, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3207\">James B. Reuter, SJ</a>, and others was called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2754\">Ateneo Players Guild</a>, which later spawned directors, writers, and actors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3177\">Narciso Pimentel Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a>, Vic Diaz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4682\">Vic </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1004\">Silayan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5655\">Francisco Rodrigo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5349\">Leon Ma. Guerrero</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5226\">Horacio dela Costa</a>, SJ. The tradition of drama as pedagogical tool, started by the Jesuits when they opened schools in the Spanish era, continued in such groups as the former Ateneo Dramatics Society, Ateneo Experimental Theater, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2753\">Ateneo Children&rsquo;s Theater</a> (grade school), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a> (high school), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2921\">Enterteynment para sa Tao, Bayan, Lansangan, at Diyos</a> or ENTABLADO (college). While most of these theater groups started with mounting Shakespearean and other foreign plays in English, a number of them would eventually venture into translations in Filipino and, later, produce original Filipino plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Philippine Normal College (now University), theater was an instructional tool for the teachers-to-be, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a>, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3106\">Severino Montano</a>, trained teachers to perform in any available space in Manila and the provinces. It developed a number of original plays in English, most of which were written by Montano. At the University of Santo Tomas (UST) there were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3302\">Teatro Tomasino</a> and the Aquinas Theater Guild; at St. Paul College, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3159\">Paulinian Players Guild</a> directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2991\">Daisy Hontiveros-Avellana</a>; at the Far Eastern University, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2932\">Far Eastern University Theater Guild</a> led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3013\">Sarah Kabigting-Joaquin</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2836\">Chamber Theater</a> directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2724\">Nick Agudo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were school-based theater groups in the regions that similarly presented foreign plays in English to supplement language and literature pedagogy. El Teatro, which later became <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3088\">Maskara Theater Ensemble</a>, was based in La Salle High School in Bacolod; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3183\">Portal Players</a> emerged from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> community; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3340\">USA Little Theater</a> was established in the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plays staged by campus theater organizations constituted the major activities in English-language theater at that time, attended by the president of the Philippines, diplomats, lawmakers, and other prominent citizens, and figuring prominently in audience development as well as in the training of theater artists; the auditoriums of UP and Ateneo were important theaters of the day. In many provinces, schools were the only venues for theater in English, their drama groups the only troupes. The komedya, sinakulo, and sarsuwela were still being staged but were not noticed by the schools or their organizations and audiences, since they were not in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of &ldquo;legitimate theater&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, plays not folk, not school-based, not church-related&mdash;sprouted from these organizations, as being professional or at least semiprofessional theater, certainly away from the campus, and not staffed by students. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2769\">Barangay Theater Guild</a>, for example, was organized by Lamberto and Daisy Avellana, and presented readings and plays in English&mdash;notably, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong><em>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</em></strong></a>, 1955. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3077\">Manila Theater Guild</a>, based in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a>, absorbed the energies of expatriate residents, and staged American and British plays. The Circulo Hispanico staged Spanish-language theater, often also at the Army-Navy Club. Other smaller groups sprung up as well, not usually lasting too long: the Penmouth Players, the Community Players, the Tambuli Playhouse. Heir to this tradition is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>, which today offers English-language plays at its own home theater, the William J. Shaw Theater, as well as professional training and experience to theater people through productions of Broadway and London West End plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the nationalist movement influenced and changed the orientation and activities of theater groups and organizations. Theater was perceived as&mdash;and definitely proved to be&mdash;effective in the raising of consciousness about national issues. Some school groups shifted their focus from &ldquo;academic&rdquo; plays to political, awareness-raising productions. An example is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3338\">UP Repertory Company</a>, a student theater organization based at the College of Arts and Letters at UP Diliman. It was established by Behn Cervantes in 1968 to raise the social consciousness of the Filipino audience through theater. It started with productions that featured works by Filipino writers in English and with adaptations of foreign plays in English. But after martial law was declared, the group presented plays in Filipino, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5698\">Rogelio Sicat</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/619\"><strong><em>Moses, Moses</em></strong></a>, 1974; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pagbibinyag sa Apoy at Dugo</em></strong> (Walking Canes and Fans), 1975; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/638\">Pagsambang Bayan</a></em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Worship), 1977; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Panahon ni Cristy</em></strong> (The Times of Cristy), 1979, among others. The group is also credited for popularizing the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/481\">tula-dula</a> (play-poem) street plays as exemplified by <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/569\"><strong>Iskolar ng Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (Scholar of the People), <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/611\"><strong><em>Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz</em></strong></a> (The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz), and <strong><em>Juan Obrero</em></strong> (Juan the Worker).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the height of student activism, other groups were formed, which may be characterized as political theater organizations because of their political agenda and commitment. Among these groups are Kamanyang Players, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3150\">Panday Sining</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>. Their plays were political in orientation, tackling issues such as the worsening economic situation, imperialism, militarization, colonial education, and suggesting solutions such as armed struggle. They performed not only in schools but also in urban poor communities, factories, rallies, strikes, and other mass assemblies in Manila and the provinces. They employed a wide range of theater styles appropriate to the context and nature of their productions. Among these theater repertoire are agitprop skits, mobile street theater, choreographed music and poetry, vignettes, and one-act plays. They also drew influences from the proletarian Chinese theater of Jiang Jing and Bertolt Brecht. After the declaration of martial law, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/showArticleEditor/7/56/491\">Babaylan Theater Group</a> was formed by theater scholars, teachers, directors, and actors to awaken interest in Philippine traditional theater, and turn artists and audiences away from colonial-minded theater and back to the native aesthetic and repertory. Through its production of Philippine plays, staging of authentic revivals of traditional plays, study and documentation of traditional drama, and publication of research outputs on Philippine theater, Babaylan demonstrated that tradition can be a rich source for contemporary theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater and theater organizations undoubtedly played parts in the conscientization and activization of the people, whose collective power effected the change in government in 1986. In the contemporary theater scene, therefore, the above organizations, formed by community, school, professional, and national/political interests, all have their successors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School-based theater groups constitute one of the major categories of contemporary theater organizations in the Philippines. They may be classified according to (1) groups that are directly linked to the academic programs of schools and universities; (2) interest groups that are open to all students who want to experience theater work; and (3) sociopolitical theater groups. One example that belongs to the first category is the Dulaang UP, which is the theater and production arm of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2899\">Department of Speech Communication and Theater Arts (DSCTA)</a> of UP Diliman. It supports the DSCTA&rsquo;s theater programs in the certificate, undergraduate, and graduate level with practical work in theater. Other examples are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3291\">Teatro Baguntao</a>, which serves as the arm of the Filipino Department of the Ateneo de Manila High School in mounting plays that will expose the students further to Filipino language, culture, and society; as well as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2913\">Dulaang Sipat Lawin</a>, the official theater company of the Philippine High School for the Arts, which complements the curricular offerings of the school with various theater activities for its theater majors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Majority of the school-based theater organizations can be characterized as interest groups whose membership is open to all interested students on campus, or even other members of the school community who do not necessarily pursue a degree in theater. Artistic growth or self-expression is usually the aim of these groups, although some may present productions carrying sociopolitical messages, depending on the orientation of their leadership or the current membership. Since the productions and other activities of the groups may supplement the course offerings of the school specifically in the fields of language, literature, arts, and culture, the groups are usually supported by the school administration in the form of financial assistance for productions, venue grants, or even scholarships for the members. Examples of these groups are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3334\">UP Manila&rsquo;s Anak-Tibawan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2910\">Dulaang Atenista</a> ng Xavier University, University of Makati&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2846\">Collective Arts of Students and Thespians</a>, University of the East&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3333\">University of the East Drama Compan</a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3333\"><strong>y</strong></a></strong>, De La Salle College of Saint Benilde&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2911\">Dulaang Filipino</a>, University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Arts and Letters&rsquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2749\">Artistang Artlets</a>, University of Santo Tomas&rsquo;s Teatro Tomasino, Philippine Normal University&rsquo;s The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3311\">Thespian Society</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2904\">De La Salle University&rsquo;s Harlequin Theatre Guild</a>. Some of these groups cultivate a definite theater form, such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a>, which specializes in puppetry and children&rsquo;s theater, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2752\">Ateneo Blue Repertory</a>, which focuses on western Broadway musicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some campus-based theater groups have a definite sociopolitical orientation. Their members also usually come from the school community, mostly students, whose commitment to theater is both artistry and purpose. Their objective is to utilize theater as a tool to promote sociopolitical awareness and involvement. Their audience is not limited to schools; they perform also for the masses on the streets, factories, rallies, strikes, marches, and other similar venues and mass gatherings not only in Manila but also in the provinces. Because of the necessities of their performances, these groups have also developed forms and types of mounting plays that are suitable to the various contexts of their productions. UP Diliman-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3166\">Peryante</a> concentrated on the production of street plays, which they termed <strong>dulansangan</strong>, and consciously adapted various traditional and foreign forms, such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>, Noh play, <strong>kilos-awit</strong>, radio-drama, <strong>dulang-bayan</strong>, rock opera, image theater, and newspaper theater. Ateneo de Manila University&rsquo;s ENTABLADO initially mounted their plays in the walkways of the campus, their version of street theater, and eventually performed in real streets of Manila, specifically during the pre-1986 EDSA mobilizations, to tackle urgent issues such as agrarian reform and urban resettlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campus-based theater groups from the region may also exhibit the characteristics of the groups belonging to the three categories. However, these groups also have a definite objective of promoting regional culture in terms of using the local language and incorporating traditional cultural forms and artistic expressions in their repertoire. This is evident in the productions of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3286\">Tanghalang Saint Louis University</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3332\">University of Cebu Theatre Workshop Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3310\">Theatre Arts Guild of the University of the Philippines College Iloilo</a>, West Negros University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3021\">Kalingaw: Ang Teatro Hiligaynon</a>, Marawi State University-Maguindanao&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3264\">Sining Kandidilimudan</a>, and Mindanao State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3109\">MSU Kabpapagariya Ensemble</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Community-based theater groups are groups whose membership comes from the community&mdash;barangay, municipality, town, city&mdash;and whose productions primarily serve the community. These organizations may be categorized as (1) groups that nurture traditional forms, (2) groups whose plays are shaped by the community, and (3) sociopolitical theater groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Groups that belong to the first category may be considered heirs to the samahan of the latter part of the Spanish colonial period. These groups concentrate on a traditional theater form, specifically sinakulo or komedya. They usually perform during town fiestas and religious feasts like the Holy Week. They sustain their activities through the financial support of wealthy members of the community, local government units, and government cultural institutions, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, and Department of Tourism. Some theater groups adhere to the presentation of authentic traditional forms while some try to contemporize the folk with modifications in form and content to attract more audiences, especially the younger members of the community. Examples of these groups are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3028\">Komedya ng San Dionisio</a> based in San Dionisio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3029\">Kudyapi Community Theater League</a> (which is also partly school-based), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3026\">Komedya ng Don Galo</a>, all based in Para&ntilde;aque; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3236\">Samahang Nazareno Inc</a> based in Cainta, Rizal; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3287\">Tanghalang Santa Ana</a> based in Santa Ana, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the community-based theater groups belong to the second category. Most of their plays are original and are deeply rooted in the culture and realities of the community or region. In form, they use local motifs, language, styles, movements, instruments, and other elements; in content, they tackle local issues and concerns against the backdrop of local, regional, and national histories. They partner with nongovernment institutions, local government units, government cultural institutions to mount their productions and implement other theater-related activities. Some of these theater groups are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3130\">Obon Di Malayad Inc</a> based in Lubon, Mountain Province; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation Inc</a> based in Malolos, Bulacan; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3022\">Kaliwat Theater Collective</a>, the performing arm of the Mindanao Community Theater Network; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3024\">Kathara Dancetheater Collective Inc</a> based in Davao; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2868\">Dagway Sigmahanon Inc</a> based in Sigma, Capiz; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2750\">Artists Quarter</a> Educational Movement based in Butuan City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some community-based theater groups belong to the sociopolitical group category. Their aesthetics may be similar to that of the second category but the sociopolitical content of their plays may be more pronounced. Also, their involvement in the community may not be limited to theater but may encompass cultural organizing or the establishment and strengthening of community or sectoral organizations. Some of these organizations are<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2920\"> Educational Discipline in Culture and Arts for Development and Services Inc</a>, based in the Agusan-Surigao Provinces; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3030\">Kulturang Atin Foundation Inc</a>, based in Davao; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3153\">Pantanghalang Sining ng Laguna</a>, based in Laguna; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3268\">Sorsogon Community-Based Theater Group</a>, based in Sorsogon City; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2751\">Arts Research and Training Institute in Southern Tagalog Inc</a>. Some of these theater groups conduct research into local history and indigenous cultural forms, and maintain a resource center. They have a more elaborate organizational structure as a result of their more diverse involvements in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sector-based groups are groups that emerged from very specific sociopolitical contexts or are formed or supported by nongovernment organizations or cause-oriented groups and commissioned to present plays reflecting the sentiments and aspirations of the sector. Membership comes from the sector and/or individuals in solidarity with it. These groups usually perform during mass actions or gatherings of sectoral organizations. They usually develop their own materials, or even their own forms and types of theater. They are quite often in need of artistic guidance, and members work at other tasks within the larger sectoral organization. Examples of such groups are Dukha-Dulaang Habagat, composed of urban poor/fishport workers; Tanghalang Silangan and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3299\">Teatro Pabrika</a> of the workers; Tanghalan ng Maralitang Tagalunsod of the urban poor; and Gabriela Cultural Group and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3289\">Teatro Akebono</a> of the women&rsquo;s sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional and semiprofessional groups are those that give professional fees to their artists. Professional groups have members who consider theater acting and theater work as their main career and are paid for it. Semiprofessional groups have members that are paid and not. Steady performance seasons, corporate sponsorships, and advertisements give these groups financial stability, which enables them to provide honoraria to theater artists and production staff. Most of these are based in the commercial districts of Metro Manila and perform in modern or large auditorium accessible to the paying public. Repertory Philippines, a theater company founded in 1967 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2735\">Zeneida Amador</a>, mounts yearly seasons of foreign plays, mostly from Broadway and London&rsquo;s West End. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala Theater Foundation</a>, which started as the production arm of the CCP Literary and Playwriting Contest under the initiative of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2923\">Tony Espejo</a>, became a totally independent theater foundation in 1987, and since then, produced curriculum-oriented plays. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3328\">Triumphant People&rsquo;s Evangelistic Theater Society Inc</a> is a gospel professional theater group that infuses modernized gospel music in their musicals to impart the word of God. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3119\">New Voice Company</a>, founded in 1994 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3366\">Monique Wilson</a>, is a Makati-based theater group that gained prominence for staging provocative plays dealing with sociopolitical issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association&rsquo;s (PETA)</a> theater experience transcends these categories. It can be classified as a community-based theater group that serves a larger community. It can also be considered a sociopolitical theater group because of its committed plays, its concept of the aesthetics of poverty, and its various organizing activities. It can also be considered a semiprofessional group because of its ability to provide honoraria to most of its artists and other theater personnel after the establishment of the PETA Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National cultural institutions-based theater groups are groups that are based in a national institution for culture, like the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Teatro Pilipino and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> are both resident theater companies of the CCP. Teatro Pilipino was founded in 1976 by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a> and produced world classics in Filipino translation as well as some original Filipino plays for CCP until 1986. As a resident company of CCP, Teatro Pilipino mounted six plays per season, each play with a run of eight performances at the CCP Little Theater. Tanghalang Pilipino was established in 1987. Under the leadership of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\">Felix (Nonon) Padilla</a> as artistic director, the group produced mostly original Filipino plays and some world theater pieces translated into Filipino. As both theater groups were based in CCP, they enjoyed sustained institutional support for all their productions and other theater activities geared toward artists and audience development, collaboration of theater practitioners, linkages, and theater arts management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater networks began to be formed in the mid-1980s when theater groups, recognizing the advantage of bonding, began forming provincial, regional, and national networks, alliances, or federations. The largest was BUGKOS, a network of some 200 cultural groups involved in theater, literature, dance, music, and visual arts nationwide, from small towns to provincial cities to regions, and whose national secretariat was in Metro Manila. Its regional networks were TADEC in the Cordillera, BUSLO in Central Luzon, SINING in Metro Manila, MASA-TK in Southern Tagalog, Kaborongan in Bicol, Mindanao Center for People&rsquo;s Culture, and Mindanao Community Theater Network. BUGKOS had a clear political and cultural program, and a vision to promote a national and democratic culture and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater groups continue to see the importance of forging alliances with other organizations and institutions to broaden the base and strengthen the impact of their theater work and sociopolitical action. Some of the more prominent networks that were formed after BUGKOS are region-based as they see the need to cultivate their own aesthetics rooted in the culture of the region and the need to formulate programs and projects that respond to their immediate and specific realities. In most cases, alliances were formed after preliminary consultations and meetings, conferences, training-workshops, joint productions, festivals, and other collaborative activities. Some of these networks are DUNGOG Alliance of Cultural Organizations in the Visayas, Teatrokon: West Visayas Theater Network, Mindulani, and ALYANSA Inc. Generally, the establishment of these networks resulted in more frequent consultations and dialogue, comprehensive and organized training-workshops, effective exchange of information among theater groups and other institutions, regular conduct of conferences and festivals, programmatic research and publications, organization of new groups or strengthening of existing groups, linkages with national and international organizations and institutions, and more vigorous mass campaigns and actions in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest theater organizations are the cultural institutions. These may be government institutions or nongovernment organizations. They have been in existence for a considerable length of time and have taken as one of their prime objectives to support the cultural groups and networks, usually providing basic and specialized training, conducting cultural research and documentation, and assisting in the funding of groups. The government institutions that provide direct assistance to theater groups and networks are the CCP and its various Arts Councils nationwide, and the NCCA through the National Committee on Dramatic Arts. Philippine theater, therefore, is made up of groups and organizations that range from small community samahan to campus troupes, to sectoral groups and networks, to cultural institutions. Individually and collectively, they develop theater as an art form, and serve various communities and Philippine society.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Malou M.

The rationale for a samahan is, in folk theater, rarely profit. More likely, it is sheer interest, or past participation in the theater form.

Repertory Philippines, a theater company founded in 1967 by <a href=\"/7/60/2735\">Zeneida Amador</a>, mounts yearly seasons of foreign plays, mostly from Broadway and London&#x2019;s West End. <a href=\"/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala Theater Foundation</a>, which started as the production arm of the CCP Literary and Playwriting Contest under the initiative of <a href=\"/7/60/2923\">Tony Espejo</a>, became a totally independent theater foundation in 1987, and since then, produced curriculum-oriented plays. <a href=\"/7/7/3328\">Triumphant People&#x2019;s Evangelistic Theater Society Inc</a> is a gospel professional theater group that infuses modernized gospel music in their musicals to impart the word of God. The <a href=\"/7/7/3119\">New Voice Company</a>, founded in 1994 by <a href=\"/7/60/3366\">Monique Wilson</a>, is a Makati-based theater group that gained prominence for staging provocative plays dealing with sociopolitical issues."

It can be classified as a community-based theater group that serves a larger community. It can also be considered a sociopolitical theater group because of its committed plays, its concept of the aesthetics of poverty, and its various organizing activities. It can also be considered a semiprofessional group because of its ability to provide honoraria to most of its artists and other theater personnel after the establishment of the PETA Center."

Teatro Pilipino and <a href=\"/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> are both resident theater companies of the CCP. Teatro Pilipino was founded in 1976 by <a href=\"/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a> and produced world classics in Filipino translation as well as some original Filipino plays for CCP until 1986. As a resident company of CCP, Teatro Pilipino mounted six plays per season, each play with a run of eight performances at the CCP Little Theater. Tanghalang Pilipino was established in 1987. Under the leadership of <a href=\"/7/60/3141\">Felix (Nonon) Padilla</a> as artistic director, the group produced mostly original Filipino plays and some world theater pieces translated into Filipino. As both theater groups were based in CCP, they enjoyed sustained institutional support for all their productions and other theater activities geared toward artists and audience development, collaboration of theater practitioners, linkages, and theater arts management."

				"value": "Theater networks began to be formed in the mid-1980s when theater groups, recognizing the advantage of bonding, began forming provincial, regional, and national networks, alliances, or federations. The largest was BUGKOS, a network of some 200 cultural groups involved in theater, literature, dance, music, and visual arts nationwide, from small towns to provincial cities to regions, and whose national secretariat was in Metro Manila. Its regional networks were TADEC in the Cordillera, BUSLO in Central Luzon, SINING in Metro Manila, MASA-TK in Southern Tagalog, Kaborongan in Bicol, Mindanao Center for People&#x2019;s Culture, and Mindanao Community Theater Network. BUGKOS had a clear political and cultural program, and a vision to promote a national and democratic culture and society."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Theater groups continue to see the importance of forging alliances with other organizations and institutions to broaden the base and strengthen the impact of their theater work and sociopolitical action. Some of the more prominent networks that were formed after BUGKOS are region-based as they see the need to cultivate their own aesthetics rooted in the culture of the region and the need to formulate programs and projects that respond to their immediate and specific realities. In most cases, alliances were formed after preliminary consultations and meetings, conferences, training-workshops, joint productions, festivals, and other collaborative activities. Some of these networks are DUNGOG Alliance of Cultural Organizations in the Visayas, Teatrokon: West Visayas Theater Network, Mindulani, and ALYANSA Inc. Generally, the establishment of these networks resulted in more frequent consultations and dialogue, comprehensive and organized training-workshops, effective exchange of information among theater groups and other institutions, regular conduct of conferences and festivals, programmatic research and publications, organization of new groups or strengthening of existing groups, linkages with national and international organizations and institutions, and more vigorous mass campaigns and actions in the region."

				"value": "The largest theater organizations are the cultural institutions. These may be government institutions or nongovernment organizations. They have been in existence for a considerable length of time and have taken as one of their prime objectives to support the cultural groups and networks, usually providing basic and specialized training, conducting cultural research and documentation, and assisting in the funding of groups. The government institutions that provide direct assistance to theater groups and networks are the CCP and its various Arts Councils nationwide, and the NCCA through the National Committee on Dramatic Arts. Philippine theater, therefore, is made up of groups and organizations that range from small community samahan to campus troupes, to sectoral groups and networks, to cultural institutions. Individually and collectively, they develop theater as an art form, and serve various communities and Philippine society.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span> <em><strong>Written by Malou M.

		"text": "<p>Research into Philippine drama and theater, and the publication of such research, comprise drama scholarship in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drama in the Philippines rose spontaneously in communities, as indigenous <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>&nbsp;and ceremonies, song and dance, or verbal jousts and games; later as religious dramatizations, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> in the Spanish colonial period. It was so much a part of community life that neither observers nor participants did much about recording it, much less about studying or commenting on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is only in the late 19th century that the first studies begin. The first one on record is not even, strictly speaking, a study. Vicente Barrantes shows in <strong><em>El <strong>Teatro</strong> Tagalo</em></strong> (The Tagalog Theater), 1889, that he was looking for what might resemble the drama he knew in Spain. Seeing the passion plays and komedya, and not understanding their context or indigenization, he concluded that it was impossible to investigate the origins of Philippine theater, the Filipinos being a &ldquo;<em>raza sin historia</em>&rdquo; (race without history), with no evidence of &ldquo;<em>potencia intellectual</em>&rdquo; (intellectual ability). These statements <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> took vigorous exception to, and refuted in &ldquo;Barrantes y El Teatro Tagalog&rdquo; (Barrantes and the Tagalog Theater), published in <strong><em>La&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Solidaridad</em></strong>, 5 Jun 1889.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Wenceslao E. Retana&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/729\"><strong><em>Noticias Historico-Bibliograficas de el Teatro en Filipinas desde Sus Origenes hasta 1898</em></strong></a> (Historico-Bibliographic Notes on the Theater in the Philippines from Its Origins to 1898), 1909, is the first serious scholarly study of Philippine drama. Retana carefully collected evidence from early 17th-century Spanish chroniclers like Antonio de Morga and Pedro Chirino, early 19th-century writers like Joaquin Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga, and early 20th-century scholars like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5238\">Epifanio delos Santos</a>. He admits to finding no evidence of dramatic literature before Spanish conquest, but records the de los Santos data on the native oral poetic tradition, which included &ldquo;<em>una especie de farsas y sainetes</em>&rdquo; (a form of farce and sketch). The special value of Retana is the accurate recording, always in historical perspective, of the development in drama in the Spanish colonial period. Trends are traced from their Spanish origins to their Filipino adaptation and expression; dates and data provided; wrong information (e.g., Barrantes&rsquo;s) set right; hypotheses presented; and critical comment made on the themes, writing, and presentation of plays. It is the first important documentation of Philippine drama and theater, and can still serve as a model for careful scholarship conducted with an open and inquiring mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antedating Retana is <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5237\">Isabelo delos Reyes</a>, whose <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/702\"><strong>Ang Comediang Tagalog</strong></a></em></strong> (The Tagalog Comedia), 1904, was written to defend the komedya against the advocates of the sarsuwela. The author sets down his thoughts about the komedya, its indigenization, its possible influences and improvements, and its superiority over the sarsuwela. The information and insights come from an actual witness of the komedya at the height of its popular acceptance, one equipped by sensibility and language to see it in context, and to respond to it as one of the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1906, Hermenegildo Cruz published his full length <strong><em>Kung Sino ang Kumatha ng &ldquo;<strong><strong>Florante</strong></strong>&rdquo;</em></strong> (On the Author of &ldquo;Florante&rdquo;) on the most admired local poet and dramatist of the 19th century, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>, asserting the native scholars&rsquo; capacity, in his very own native language, to sift through his country&rsquo;s history and culture, set and affirm his own standards and frameworks, and formulate agendas and projections for development of local scholarship.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is in Rizal, de los Santos, de los Reyes, and Cruz that a solid beginning for scholarship on Philippine theater commenced. These four saw and validated the creative impulse for theater and poetry of the natives beyond influence of colonial rule. In the larger perspectives, they were affirming the agenda of nation building as defined by a local culture that included dramatic literature and theater practice. Considering that their efforts were done on individual capacities, when the colony was still ravaged by Spanish and later American empires, all the more underline their worth. Later studies on Philippine theater would also project the same direction toward solidifying the cultural component of nation building, coming from individuals and the institutions supporting their endeavors, particularly from the Surian ng Wikang Pambansa (Institute of National Language or INL, 1936-87). The data gathering, annotations, and studies done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3215\">Jose Ma. Rivera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, Concepcion S. Javier, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5332\">Teodoro E. Gener</a> were recognized, and eventually sponsored by the INL as public lectures and mainstreamed through folio editions. Significantly, they were all delivered in the vernacular language, running counter to the mainstream English language being propagated by the colonial state under American tutelage generally during the first half of the twentieth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Severino Reyes&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/712\"><strong>Ang Dulang Tagalog</strong></a></em></strong> (The Tagalog Theater), 1938, asserted that there was Philippine drama before the arrival of the Spaniards. Reyes traces its origins to songs and dances, rituals led by high priests, and mimetic enactments designed to portray the deeds of ancestors. He focuses on the sarsuwela, of which he was one of the foremost writers. His work has the authority of an eyewitness and a stellar participant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jose Ma. Rivera&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mga Manunulat sa Wikang Tagalog</em></strong> (Tagalog Writers), 1938, gathered biographical and literary data on <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> writers, including dramatists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2711\">Juan Abad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>. The rich tapestry and lush cover particularly of theater and literature at the turn of the century were initially documented and surveyed, set in biographical and historical frames. Jose Ma. Rivera has written as early as 1907 the introduction to the published version of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/673\"><strong>Tanikalang Guinto</strong></a></em></strong> (Golden Chain), and written a folio on Jose de la Cruz (1933).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is system and historical sense in Julian Cruz Balmaseda&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/711\"><strong>Ang Dulang Pilipino</strong></a></em></strong> (The Filipino Drama), 1947. He starts with a working definition of drama, then goes on to a historical survey from <strong>katutubong dula</strong> (native drama) to colonial and contemporary drama. He mentions translations and adaptations from foreign plays into Tagalog, and ends with a listing of some contemporary plays in Spanish and English. Since Balmaseda&rsquo;s own career spans the period, his insight as writer, observer, mover, and participant in the theater of his times gives his work authority and credibility as record of an epoch of much change in Philippine drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other publications of the INL bear mentioning: Concepcion S. Javier&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang mga Dula ni <strong><strong>Patricio Mariano</strong></strong></em></strong> (The Plays of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>), 1940, and Teodoro E. Gener&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Duplo</strong>&rsquo;t <strong>Balagtasan</strong></em></strong> (Duplo and Balagtasan), 1949. The Javier work is one of the first to focus on a single playwright&mdash;his life, works, themes, and techniques&mdash;and to assess his contribution to Filipino drama. Since both the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>balagtasan</strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><strong>duplo</strong></a> have dramatic elements, Gener&rsquo;s work is an important record of forms that started in the oral tradition and are not often seen in their natural settings in present times, although both have moved on&mdash;to radio and TV, in the case of the balagtasan, and to stage adaptation, in the case of the duplo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, higher educational institutions like colleges and universities served as production houses for studies and research on Philippine theater and the popularization of these for students and eventually the general public. The graduate programs slowly accumulated a body of research material on Philippine theater. Simultaneously, occasional textbooks and reading materials for drama and theater courses appeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s, when little vernacular drama could be seen on Manila stages, and drama in English was in ascendance, two anthologies were published, which qualify as drama scholarship because of introductory material. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2919\">Jean Garrot Edades</a>&rsquo;s and Carolyn Fosdick&rsquo;s <strong><em>Drama of&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>the East and West</em></strong>, 1956, has a section on drama of the orient introduced by a survey of pre-English drama from religious plays to the moro-moro, zarzuela, propaganda plays, and nonmusical drama, ending with a fairly detailed account of dramatic activity (performance and performers) in English. Federico B. Sebastian&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Dulang Tagalog</em></strong> (The Tagalog Drama), 1951, puts together plays like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong></a> (No Wounds) and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/684\"><strong>Veronidia</strong></a></em></strong> with notes on what he calls the first plays, the religious dramas, the revolutionary and nationalist plays, plays of everyday life, and plays of 1942 to the present. For almost two decades this was the only work that paid attention to the texts and history of vernacular drama. Its bibliography is worth noting, although the listing of plays does not include dates nor publication data.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1950s, theses on Philippine drama appeared, such as Asuncion Siao&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Study of the Moro-Moro Plays of Catanduanes,&rdquo; 1952; Leonila R. Llenos&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Study and Evaluation of the Works in Drama of Florentino E. Borromeo&rdquo; and Iluminada Magno&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Critical Study of the Zarzuela in Pangasinan of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3146\">Catalino Palisoc</a>,&rdquo; both 1954; Irene T. Ordo&ntilde;a&rsquo;s &ldquo;An Evaluative Study of the Dramas of Piux Kabahar,&rdquo; 1956; Lilia M. Cinco&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Significance of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3221\">Buenaventura Rodriguez</a> in the History of Sugbuanon Drama,&rdquo; 1959; and Ely Javillonar&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Significance of Mariano Proceso Pabalan in Capampangan Dramatic Literature,&rdquo; 1961. This early, the rich harvest of studies on Philippine theater in the universities clearly showed and defined Philippine theater not limited to English and Tagalog, but a complex of several regional languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 1963 saw the publication of two significant studies: Juan S. Aguas&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong>Juan Crisostomo Soto</strong></strong> and Pampangan Drama</em></strong> and Alejandrino Hufana&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong>Mena Pecson Crisologo</strong></strong> and Iloko Drama</em></strong>. The advantage of their having been adapted from master&rsquo;s theses at the University of the Philippines (UP) is that the area of research is focused on outstanding dramatists of two specific vernaculars, establishing the canons of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3269\">Soto</a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2856\">Crisologo</a>, and an attempt made to locate them within a tradition, even if documentation is not always complete. The disadvantage comes from the graduate studies that had led to the theses, being thoroughly Western in methodology and critical orientation. The standards evolved from Western history, society, and sensibility made the authors find the local dramas &ldquo;sentimental,&rdquo; with characters that were not rounded, plots without internal conflict, and which lacked the classical unities. The works, however, indicated a direction toward the retrieval of vernacular dramas, research into their playwrights and social settings, and the identification of norms that grow from within the dramas, and are not imposed from without.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scholarship, however, still largely focused on the drama texts, and a literary, rather than a theater orientation generally prevailed up to the 1960s. Also, the English language was the favored medium for these works. Many, in fact, were written for graduate degrees in the English language, or literature degrees, generally administered also by English departments. There are exceptions, however: Ester Francisco Deniga&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang mga Kuwento at Dula ni Severino Reyes sa Larangan ng Panitikang Pilipino&rdquo; (MA thesis, National Teachers College, 1948) and Federico B. Sebastian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pahapyaw na Kasaysayan ng Dulang Tagalog&rdquo; (MA thesis, National University, 1950), although the Pilipino works would also emphasize a<em>larangan ng panitikan&nbsp;</em>(literature domain) for dramatists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, books and publications touching on Philippine theater, outside specific thesis and dissertation formats, began to appear, still generally within the orbit of the universities, although exceptions occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Brown Heritage</em></strong>, 1967, a collection of essays on Philippine cultural tradition and literature, includes two essays on Philippine theater: one by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2991\">Daisy Hontiveros-Avellana</a>, &ldquo;Philippine Drama: A Social Protest,&rdquo; which yields valuable information on theater in the Japanese occupation, and one by Ma. Teresa Mu&ntilde;oz, &ldquo;Notes on Theater: Pre-Hispanic Philippines (Religion, Myth, Religious Ritual),&rdquo; on theater in precolonial Philippines, probably the first attempt to examine anthropological data for evidence of drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5089\">Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Philippine Music and Theater</em></strong>, 1969, although principally about music, has four chapters dealing with theater history and buildings, writers, actors, and theater troupes&mdash;all covered informally and conversationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971, as a project of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> and in connection with the Third World Theater Festival in Manila, the book <strong><em>A Short History of Theater in the Philippines</em></strong> was published, edited by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani R. Cruz</a>. The first of its kind since Retana, it is a collection of essays&mdash;on pre-Hispanic and Hispanic theater&mdash;by different authors, and thus the style, methodology, and scholarship are uneven. In spite of some factual errors and bibliographical ghosts, the essays and the four appendices represent valuable research and information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/741\"><strong><em>The &ldquo;Seditious&rdquo; Tagalog Playwrights: Early American Occupation</em></strong></a>, 1972, is a source book for one of the most vital periods in Philippine theater history: the years between 1900 and 1905, when nationalist sentiment transformed the drama into <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a> or what the American insular government called &ldquo;seditious theater.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s book is the first study of that period, and indeed of any period in Philippine theater, with research into hitherto unexamined newspaper accounts, and the inclusion of some of the texts of the seditious&rdquo; plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text of Aurelio V. Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow) published in Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s book is taken from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dictionary of Philippine Biography</em></strong>, volume 2, 1970. This indicates just one of the ways in which Manuel&rsquo;s three volumes, published 1955, 1970, and 1986, contribute to theater scholarship. They are rich in the biographies of playwrights, composers, and actors; they include data on their work and documentation of productions, as well as comments, facsimiles of theater programs, and in the case of Tolentino, a whole play enclosed in court records. Although not directly a study of Philippine theater, the <strong><em>Dictionary</em></strong> is a mine of information on theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5490\">Edna Zapanta-Manlapaz</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/695\"><strong><em>Selected Writings of Aurelio V. Tolentino</em></strong></a>, 1975, is bio-bibliography as well as an anthology. Representative plays by Tolentino in Spanish, Pampango, and Tagalog are included, alongside samples of his nondramatic writings. All are based on reliable copy texts, carefully standardized, cleaned of inconsistencies, and provided with complete documentation. All Tolentino works&mdash;extant, available, and essentially complete&mdash;are listed, with complete bibliographical descriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also published in 1975 was <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/720\"><strong><em>Kasaysayan at Estetika ng <strong>Sinakulo</strong> at Ibang Dulang Panrelihiyon sa Malolos</em></strong></a> (History and Aesthetics of the Sinakulo and Other Religious Plays in Malolos), based on the MA thesis of the author done in 1974, which fully documents the sinakulo and other forms of religious drama in Malolos, Bulacan, from the viewpoints of history, literary and nonliterary sources, form, and production details: financing, time and place of presentation, sets and props, sound and lights, special effects, director and crew, actors, chant, costumes, music, audience, and audience acceptance. The appendices supply the <strong>orihinal</strong> (archetypal texts), <strong>partitura</strong> (music scores), and charts organizing and comparing data for each barrio. Photographs of costumes and performances, as well as line drawings of stages and stage devices, provide visual support to the discussion. From his data Tiongson draws the aesthetics of the sinakulo, as well as the reasons for its existence, rise, popularity, and decline. The methodology used in data gathering and organization, the critical stance that saw text in Philippine context yet made judicious use of understanding gained from the study of Western drama, and the resulting exhaustive inquiry and analytical study comprise a guide for other studies into other forms and in other regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tiongson opus is important on two more counts. The study used the Filipino language as medium, connecting to the period of the prewar Surian ng Wikang Pambansa and the efforts of Ester Francisco Deniga and Federico B. Sebastian of the 1950s, an interval of about 25 years. More crucial, the use of the vernacular as the language of research connects the study to the very period of activism of the 1970s of which the work is in many ways very much a part of. In the realm of theater, this means a shift in language from English to the vernacular. The revolutionary agenda of the period included wresting theater from the clutches of the language of colonization, at that time English. Simultaneously a larger audience aside from students learning English in the universities were recognized as the legit audience for Philippine theater; hence, theater had to shift to the vernacular language as well. If this holds for the theater practitioners, then the Tiongson opus parallels the shift as well for the domain of research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research also very clearly defined the basic unit of analysis not anymore as the drama text, but the actual mise-en-sc&egrave;ne as witnessed by spectators and audiences in concrete performance spaces and mounted by specific theater artists. Drama studies of the 1950s and 1960s upgrade to theater studies by the 1970s. Notable are the very careful and precise documentation of mounting techniques as seen in the book&rsquo;s illustrations, all pointing to the mounted production as the basic unit of analysis, not necessarily or only the text of a play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At about this time also, the 1970s onward, the social sciences had gained a very strong foothold in research on theater, thus the context of theater gained equal attention. Texts, both dramatic and performed, were examined in the context of society, and the cultural and historical traditions. Many theses and dissertations of the last three decades of the 20th century demonstrate this new emphasis. Most are studies of individual playwrights, which set their canons, discuss their plays, and set them in context, such as Teresita Esteban Lagtapon on Angel Magahum, 1971; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5573\">Priscelina Patajo-Legasto</a> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3094\">Pablo Mejia</a>, 1976; and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a> on Salvador Magno, 1980. Others are studies of theater forms in particular provinces: David Adoptante Valenciano on passion plays in Buhi, Camarines Sur, 1971; Carolina Guillermo on moro-moro production in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, 1972; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G. Fernandez</a> on the Iloilo zarzuela and Rose Marie Gonzales on moro-moro production in Pangasinan, both 1978; Guillermo Pesigan on komedya in San Pablo, Laguna, and Nicanor G. Tiongson on the komedya of San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, both 1979. Still others look at the form within a whole region: Clarita Filipinas on the Lineyte-Samarnon sarsuwela, 1991; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5626\">Maria Lilia F. Realubit</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> dramatic tradition, 1976; and Mario Rosal on komedya in the Ilocos region, 1980. Some theses focus on production, such as Teresa Parian&rsquo;s study of the production practices of eight sarsuwela groups in Meycauayan, Bulacan, 1973, or on theater buildings and their productions, such as in Cristina Buenaventura&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Theater in Manila: 1846-1986,&rdquo; 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After texts have been recovered, set in the context of theater tradition, examined through lenses of textual criticism, and swept for all the drama and theater information they can yield, they still are a people&rsquo;s living literature, discourse of a special kind. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5517\">Resil B.Mojares</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/750\"><strong><em>Theater in Society/Society in Theater</em></strong></a>, subtitled <strong><em>Social History of a Cebuano Village, 1840-1940</em></strong>, 1985, takes the text beyond standard scholarship, by combining the methods of literary criticism, cultural anthropology, and history to look through the <strong>linambay</strong> (komedya) into the moral universe of the barrio and people of Villadolid, Carcar, southern Cebu. It became a lens into the masked past, into material and social conditions, into conflict and resolution, into lifestyle and aspiration, into parallel systems and elite monopoly and domination. The main argument of the study is to challenge, if not shock, readers, theater practitioners included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this particular study, theater had certainly been defined as social production. Marxism and other sociological theories underlined theater scholarship concerns. Correlations between theater and society continued to be sought. Rosario Cruz-Lucero&rsquo;s dissertation, &ldquo;The Decline of the Sugar Industry and the Rise of People&rsquo;s Theater in Negros Occidental,&rdquo; 1988, correlated a province&rsquo;s economic and class history with culture and the practice of theater. Priscelina Patajo-Legasto sought a materialist analysis in &ldquo;Philippine Contemporary Theater, 1946-1985 (with Special Emphasis on Theater in Manila): A Materialist Analysis,&rdquo; 1988. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2755\">Glecy C. Atienza</a> would seek to directly confront the issue of subversion and martial law in theater in &ldquo;Subersyon sa Dula sa Ilalim ng Batas Militar: Mga Dula ng PETA 1975-1981,&rdquo; 1990. The context of tourism received paramount concern in Patricia Jean Nicholson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Change and Continuity of Moryonan in the Context of Tourism: A Case Study of Culture Process in Marinduque, Philippines,&rdquo; 1997. For his part, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2840\">Apolonio B. Chua</a> read workers cultural groups in the context of social movements digging into the <strong>simulain</strong> (guiding principle) that propelled both theater and union activism in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/742\"><strong>Simulain: Dulambayan ng Manggagawa sa Konteksto ng Militanteng Kilusang Unyonismo (1980-1994)</strong></a></em></strong>&nbsp;(Guiding Principle: Workers&rsquo; Dulambayan in the Context of the Militant Unionism Movement, 1980-1994),&nbsp;2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The availability of more and more data from different provinces, regions, and languages led to the first theater histories. Using data gathered from his field and library research, Nicanor G. Tiongson wrote a historical essay, &ldquo;Ang Dulang Pilipino,&rdquo; 1977, later rewritten in English as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/756\">What Is Filipino Drama?</a>&rdquo; 1983. Later, he collated data from his own dissertation, from other research on komedya both academic or journalistic, to write <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/721\"><strong><em>Kasaysayan ng&nbsp;<strong>Komedya&nbsp;</strong>sa Pilipinas: 1766-1982</em></strong></a> (History of the Komedya in the Philippines), 1982. It is a definitive history, with an archetypal text, <strong><em>Prinsipe Atamante</em></strong> (Prince Atamante), and a collation and analysis of all available data. Wilhelmina Q. Ramas gleaned from the files of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> newspaper <strong><em>Bag-ong Kusog</em></strong>, 1915<em>-</em>41, a chronicle and texts of Cebuano theater found in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/747\"><strong><em>Sugbuanon Theater from Sotto to Rodriguez to Kabahar</em></strong></a>, 1982. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2828\">Arthur P. Casanova</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kasaysayan at Pag-unlad ng Dulaang Pilipino</em></strong> (History and Development of Filipino Theater), 1984, brings together previous research in Philippine theater history, and adds data on contemporary drama groups, especially those in Mindanao, where the author was based. By 1996, Doreen G. Fernandez&nbsp;would gather her critical and historical essays in her book <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/731\"><strong><em>Palabas</em></strong>: <strong><em><strong>Essay</strong>s on Philippine Theater</em></strong></a>, defining further the breath, scope, and various foci in the continuing formulation and mapping of Philippine theater history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interregional work resulted in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/732\"><strong><em>Philippine Drama: Twelve Plays in&nbsp;</em><em>Six Languages</em></strong></a>, 1987, which has plays from the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, Bikol, Cebuano, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> regions, and introductions by Filonila Tupas, Alejandro Casambre, Marcela Zamora, Maria Lilia F. Realubit, Consuelo Damaso, and Wilhelmina Ramas to the drama of each region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1985, many artists-scholars began to examine ever more closely in thesis and dissertations Philippine rituals, specifically those with performance components. Anthropological and Philippine Studies perspectives illumine many of these: <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2937\">Steven Patrick C.

The &ldquo;&aacute;k&ograve;&rdquo; of Pakil achieved prominence in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3206\">Jerry C. Respeto</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/699\">Bayang Panitikan: Ang Pagtatanghal ng Kabanalan sa Pakil, Laguna</a>&rdquo; (Town as Literature: Performing Religiosity in Pakil, Laguna), 2007, later echoed in Katherine U. Tolentino&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Komedya ng Pakil, Laguna: Isang Kultural na Pag-aaral&rdquo; (The Pakil, Laguna Komedya: A Cultural Study), 2012. Galileo S. Zafra would privilege the&nbsp;<em>dalumat ng katwiran&nbsp;</em>(concept of reason) as core concept in his book <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/696\"><strong>Balagtasan: Kasaysayan at Antolohiya</strong></a></em></strong>&nbsp;(Balagtasan: History and Anthology),&nbsp;1999, while <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3036\">Edna May Obien-Landicho</a> would grapple with the&nbsp;<em>dalumat ng lalim ng pagkataong Pilipino&nbsp;</em>in &ldquo;Dalumat ng Lalim ng Pagkataong Pilipino sa mga Kuwentong Bayan na Isinakuwento at Isinadula para sa Bata&rdquo; (Concept of Depth of Filipino Identity in People&rsquo;s Stories Narrated and Performed for Children), 2003. The dawn of the 21st century found Philippine scholars digging into the symbolic and cultural systems of indigenous cultures to validate theater and performance unique to the nation and its varied communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, it was time also to look at Philippine theater in the wider lens of nations and regions, demonstrated by the project on traditional media of the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, which resulted in the books <strong><em>The Cultural&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Traditional Media of ASEAN</em></strong>, 1986, edited by Nicanor G. Tiongson, and <strong><em>Traditions Revitalized</em></strong>, 1991, edited by Delia Barcelona. The first collected basal data: drama forms, glossaries, bibliographies, and directories of theater practitioners in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, with a view to identifying theater forms that could purvey contemporary developmental messages&mdash;in the case of the Philippines, the balagtasan. The second book presented praxis: the drama forms in actual performance, the texts bearing the messages, thus the CTM (cultural traditional media) in contemporary use. Similarly, Amparo Adelina C. Umali III&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/757\">Women Playwrights and Their Noh Adaptations</a>,&rdquo; 2001, configures the Philippines in the world map of Japanese Noh theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the graduate programs of universities should be commended for providing a strong impulse and support for scholarship on theater in the Philippine setting, especially in the second half of the 20th century onward. Scholarship was defined generally by graduate students who earned master&rsquo;s and doctoral degrees, generally in Philippine universities but also abroad. The bulk and trajectory of the scholarship would be generated through these institutional programs. The University of the Philippines, to a certain degree, with very strong master of arts and doctor of philosophy graduate programs in arts and culture and in Philippine Studies, would lead in such scholarship. But very significant productions would also be noted from Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, University of Santo Tomas, Far Eastern University, National Teachers College, National University, Philippine Normal College, Arellano University, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, Centro Escolar University, and even universities based in the regions, like the University of the Visayas and University of San Carlos, both in Cebu City; Angeles University and Guagua National Colleges in Pampanga; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> in Dumaguete City; and the University of Nueva Caceres in Naga City. In Mindanao, leading in this endeavor would be Ateneo de Davao University and the Mindanao State University&ndash;Iligan Institute of Technology. Foreign universities would also produce crucial studies, such as Doshisha University, Japan; University of Wisconsin-Madison and Trinity University, both in the USA; the National University of Singapore; and Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholarship on Philippine theater was by and large an academic activity. As a whole, it was done outside or largely independent of theater artists&rsquo; preoccupations, although many scholars are themselves artists. Scholarly works did not seem to immediately impact on drama groups and activities after their defense or publication, but some exceptions could be made. There were visionary artists-scholars who projected workable plans in their theses. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2977\">Cecilia Reyes Guidote-Alvarez</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/748\">A Prospectus for the National Theater of the Philippines</a>,&rdquo; 1967, served as blueprint for the establishment in the same year of the Philippine Educational Theater Association. By then, the growing activism and clamor for change foregrounded concepts like community theater, educational theater, and national theater as pegs for the growing importance and recognition of theater as a powerful institution in Philippine society. Theater amidst activist social movements, supported by nongovernment organizations and the Church, would be on the forefront of the ensuing battle to topple the authoritarian regime in the 1980s. Certainly, the theoretical formulations and the discourses generated by the theater scholars permeated the entire Philippine theater movement, at this juncture subliminally perhaps and also collectively, even if the artists themselves were not fully conversant with specific research outputs. Works of scholarship hardly became popular by themselves or bestsellers, but a phrase like RPN (<em>repleksiyon ng pangangailangan ng nakararami/</em>&ldquo;reflection of the needs of the majority&rdquo;) as articulated in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/756\">What is Philippine Drama?</a>&rdquo; would, even if potentially reductive, capture truth and conviction for many theater practitioners at that specific time juncture, and support the artist&rsquo;s struggle to maintain dignity, honor, and strength in his work amidst repression and annihilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But certainly interesting research work on a limited scale was also generated by a few theater groups themselves for their own purposes. In some instances, theater productions carried research requirements. This could take the form of an outreach for some actors needing some ideas and the concrete feel of slum realities, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/559\"><strong><em>Hinabing Pakpak ng Ating mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (The Woven Wings of Our Children), 2008. The actor&rsquo;s preparation included a research component, in as simple a form as exposure. Bourgeois artists in general would have vague ideas of oppression and poverty, so it was therefore necessary to conduct field trips and in advanced cases, immersions. Many theater workshop modules would include field trips to Quiapo to provide some interesting basic material for improvisation and structured learning processes. There is at least one theater company, PETA, that for a time invested and maintained a Documentation, Research and Publications Department (1980-93) as part of the official and regular programs of the company. It may not have lasted for long, but certainly added texture, confidence, and edge to the total theater practice for the theater organization when it was operational. For a time, &ldquo;ATOR&rdquo;&mdash;an acronym for Artist-Trainor-Organizer-Researcher&mdash;became the ideal toward which theater artists could aspire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, under the administration of artistic director Nicanor G. Tiongson from 1986 to 1994, achieved remarkable research production not only on theater but also on all arts. With a very strong publication program, it demonstrated how research should be a top-level agenda for government cultural institutions, and how the arts could be a powerful tool for social change and national goals. Although the CCP generally contracted academicians for many of these projects, it took the lead role, outside the universities and colleges, in undertaking and publishing research in the arts. Production of research outputs from this institution from this period would include the <strong><em>CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</em></strong>, 1994, with one volume dedicated to theater; the <strong><em>Tuklas Sining</em></strong> series, consisting of 30 monographs and video-documentaries on the Philippine Arts, 1989-94, four of which are on theater; union catalogues, 1990; anthologies like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/719\"><strong><em>Kamao</em></strong></a>, 1987, <strong><em><strong>Himala</strong>y Balagtas</em></strong>, 1988, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/753\">Unang Tagpo</a>&nbsp;</em></strong>(First Scene), 1992, a documentation of the first CCP National Theater Festival in 1992; and the journal <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a></strong></em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publications by university presses would still be strongest, leading among them the Ateneo de Manila University Press and the University of the Philippines Press, closely followed by the University of Santo Tomas Press and De La Salle University Press. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, starting 1992, also initiated research and publication schema that augments university production. The multivolume Toyota Foundation-assisted <strong><em>Panitikan</em></strong> series, conceived by Nicanor G. Tiongson and with editorial supervision for translation by Bienvenido Lumbera, involving the university presses of Ateneo de Manila University, UP, and De La Salle University materialized with volumes on regional theaters: <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/758\"><strong>Zarzuelang Iloko</strong></a></em></strong> (Iloko Zarzuela), 1993; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/710\"><strong><em>Dulaang <strong><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Hiligaynon Theater), 1996; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/740\"><strong><em><strong>Sarsuwela</strong>ng Pangasinan</em></strong></a> (Pangasinan Sarsuwela), 1996; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/709\"><strong><em>Dulaang Sebwano</em></strong></a> (Cebuano Theater), 1997. A UP Press multivolume publication followed: Nicanor G. Tiongson&rsquo;s <strong><em>Philippine Theatre: History and Anthology</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/722\"><strong><em>Komedya</em></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/743\"><strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong></a>, both published in 1999, which documented not only the text per se but the text as modified, expanded, and shortened by the conditions of time, audience, budget, and the sponsors&rsquo; wishes, thereby changing the total meaning of the performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the early days, therefore, of recovering texts in trunks and huts, to the evolution of norms and standards from the texts and traditions as they developed in Philippine society, scholarship in Philippine drama has certainly more than come of age. Of areas in the Philippine arts, along with literature perhaps, it could qualify as very strong, if not the strongest. What remains would be a tighter and more extensive exchange between artists, arts administrators, educators, and scholarship. A regular conference would not be so far behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, there are not only theses, dissertations, and books on Philippine theater history, styles, forms, and developments, but also articles in journals and magazines, papers and lectures, seminars, and conferences. In its maturity it has widened its scope&mdash;from individuals to movements to regions&mdash;and its seeing&mdash;from handwritten or printed page to stage, to a people&rsquo;s past and present, and certainly its future.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Doreen G.

These four saw and validated the creative impulse for theater and poetry of the natives beyond influence of colonial rule. In the larger perspectives, they were affirming the agenda of nation building as defined by a local culture that included dramatic literature and theater practice. Considering that their efforts were done on individual capacities, when the colony was still ravaged by Spanish and later American empires, all the more underline their worth. Later studies on Philippine theater would also project the same direction toward solidifying the cultural component of nation building, coming from individuals and the institutions supporting their endeavors, particularly from the Surian ng Wikang Pambansa (Institute of National Language or INL, 1936-87). The data gathering, annotations, and studies done by <a href=\"/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/7/60/3215\">Jose Ma.

Federico B. Sebastian&#x2019;s <strong><em>Ang Dulang Tagalog</em></strong> (The Tagalog Drama), 1951, puts together plays like <a href=\"/7/58/686\"><strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong></a> (No Wounds) and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/684\"><strong>Veronidia</strong></a></em></strong> with notes on what he calls the first plays, the religious dramas, the revolutionary and nationalist plays, plays of everyday life, and plays of 1942 to the present. For almost two decades this was the only work that paid attention to the texts and history of vernacular drama. Its bibliography is worth noting, although the listing of plays does not include dates nor publication data."

The study used the Filipino language as medium, connecting to the period of the prewar Surian ng Wikang Pambansa and the efforts of Ester Francisco Deniga and Federico B. Sebastian of the 1950s, an interval of about 25 years. More crucial, the use of the vernacular as the language of research connects the study to the very period of activism of the 1970s of which the work is in many ways very much a part of. In the realm of theater, this means a shift in language from English to the vernacular. The revolutionary agenda of the period included wresting theater from the clutches of the language of colonization, at that time English. Simultaneously a larger audience aside from students learning English in the universities were recognized as the legit audience for Philippine theater; hence, theater had to shift to the vernacular language as well. If this holds for the theater practitioners, then the Tiongson opus parallels the shift as well for the domain of research."

Many theses and dissertations of the last three decades of the 20th century demonstrate this new emphasis. Most are studies of individual playwrights, which set their canons, discuss their plays, and set them in context, such as Teresita Esteban Lagtapon on Angel Magahum, 1971; <a href=\"/9/9/5573\">Priscelina Patajo-Legasto</a> on <a href=\"/7/60/3094\">Pablo Mejia</a>, 1976; and <a href=\"/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a> on Salvador Magno, 1980.

Scholarship was defined generally by graduate students who earned master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees, generally in Philippine universities but also abroad. The bulk and trajectory of the scholarship would be generated through these institutional programs. The University of the Philippines, to a certain degree, with very strong master of arts and doctor of philosophy graduate programs in arts and culture and in Philippine Studies, would lead in such scholarship. But very significant productions would also be noted from Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, University of Santo Tomas, Far Eastern University, National Teachers College, National University, Philippine Normal College, Arellano University, Philippine Women&#x2019;s University, Centro Escolar University, and even universities based in the regions, like the University of the Visayas and University of San Carlos, both in Cebu City; Angeles University and Guagua National Colleges in Pampanga; <a href=\"/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> in Dumaguete City; and the University of Nueva Caceres in Naga City. In Mindanao, leading in this endeavor would be Ateneo de Davao University and the Mindanao State University&#x2013;Iligan Institute of Technology.

				"value": "Scholarship on Philippine theater was by and large an academic activity. As a whole, it was done outside or largely independent of theater artists&#x2019; preoccupations, although many scholars are themselves artists. Scholarly works did not seem to immediately impact on drama groups and activities after their defense or publication, but some exceptions could be made. There were visionary artists-scholars who projected workable plans in their theses. <a href=\"/7/7/2977\">Cecilia Reyes Guidote-Alvarez</a>&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"/7/59/748\">A Prospectus for the National Theater of the Philippines</a>,&#x201D; 1967, served as blueprint for the establishment in the same year of the Philippine Educational Theater Association. By then, the growing activism and clamor for change foregrounded concepts like community theater, educational theater, and national theater as pegs for the growing importance and recognition of theater as a powerful institution in Philippine society. Theater amidst activist social movements, supported by nongovernment organizations and the Church, would be on the forefront of the ensuing battle to topple the authoritarian regime in the 1980s. Certainly, the theoretical formulations and the discourses generated by the theater scholars permeated the entire Philippine theater movement, at this juncture subliminally perhaps and also collectively, even if the artists themselves were not fully conversant with specific research outputs. Works of scholarship hardly became popular by themselves or bestsellers, but a phrase like RPN (<em>repleksiyon ng pangangailangan ng nakararami/</em>&#x201C;reflection of the needs of the majority&#x201D;) as articulated in &#x201C;<a href=\"/7/59/756\">What is Philippine Drama?</a>&#x201D; would, even if potentially reductive, capture truth and conviction for many theater practitioners at that specific time juncture, and support the artist&#x2019;s struggle to maintain dignity, honor, and strength in his work amidst repression and annihilation."

				"value": "But certainly interesting research work on a limited scale was also generated by a few theater groups themselves for their own purposes. In some instances, theater productions carried research requirements. This could take the form of an outreach for some actors needing some ideas and the concrete feel of slum realities, as in <a href=\"/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/559\"><strong><em>Hinabing Pakpak ng Ating mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (The Woven Wings of Our Children), 2008. The actor&#x2019;s preparation included a research component, in as simple a form as exposure. Bourgeois artists in general would have vague ideas of oppression and poverty, so it was therefore necessary to conduct field trips and in advanced cases, immersions. Many theater workshop modules would include field trips to Quiapo to provide some interesting basic material for improvisation and structured learning processes. There is at least one theater company, PETA, that for a time invested and maintained a Documentation, Research and Publications Department (1980-93) as part of the official and regular programs of the company. It may not have lasted for long, but certainly added texture, confidence, and edge to the total theater practice for the theater organization when it was operational. For a time, &#x201C;ATOR&#x201D;&#x2014;an acronym for Artist-Trainor-Organizer-Researcher&#x2014;became the ideal toward which theater artists could aspire."

Tiongson from 1986 to 1994, achieved remarkable research production not only on theater but also on all arts. With a very strong publication program, it demonstrated how research should be a top-level agenda for government cultural institutions, and how the arts could be a powerful tool for social change and national goals. Although the CCP generally contracted academicians for many of these projects, it took the lead role, outside the universities and colleges, in undertaking and publishing research in the arts. Production of research outputs from this institution from this period would include the <strong><em>CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</em></strong>, 1994, with one volume dedicated to theater; the <strong><em>Tuklas Sining</em></strong> series, consisting of 30 monographs and video-documentaries on the Philippine Arts, 1989-94, four of which are on theater; union catalogues, 1990; anthologies like the <a href=\"/7/59/719\"><strong><em>Kamao</em></strong></a>, 1987, <strong><em><strong>Himala</strong>y Balagtas</em></strong>, 1988, and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/59/753\">Unang Tagpo</a>&#xA0;</em></strong>(First Scene), 1992, a documentation of the first CCP National Theater Festival in 1992; and the journal <strong><em><strong><a href=\"/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a></strong></em></strong>."

		"text": "<p>The playscript or script is the text of the play, including stage directions, cast list, and possibly production and other notes. The text written by the playwright may or may not constitute the final playscript, since it may be modified in production, or given final revisions by the playwright when prepared for publication. Thus, the author&rsquo;s text, the working script, and the published play may or may not be identical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous performances, such as rites, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, dance dramas, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic</a> games, did not have written scripts. Instead, they had established procedures or processes, confirmed through time and practice, hallowed by tradition. The performer thus knew the order to follow; the chants, invocations, and gestures, even when improvised, followed custom and what may be called an inner or assumed text.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The text of a traditional play developed from the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, both as material object and as literary work, is called the <strong>orihinal</strong>. At first, this referred to the author&rsquo;s original manuscript, the holograph written in notebooks, and the only extant copy, since authors did not give copies to actors or stage crew. The former had their lines dictated to them by the <strong>diktador</strong>/<strong>apuntador</strong>; the latter were given verbal directions or the <strong>apuntacion</strong> (prompt script). Later, orihinal came to refer as well to copies of the holograph handwritten by a son, daughter, or assistant; then to typewritten copies of the original, and even by extension to a mimeo script. The term is never applied, however, to a printed and published text; it always denotes some exclusivity and rareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk authors were not usually conscious of themselves as artists, with exclusive rights to their creations. They had no notion of intellectual property or copyright, but had an attachment to their orihinal as being the source and core of performances, and were loath to lend out their scripts, for fear of presentations without their knowledge or permission. The orihinal was simply the play each had written for a particular <strong>samahan</strong>, occasion, or town. As the key to presentation, it had to be safeguarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These orihinal were thus kept in trunks, under beds, or wrapped up and hung from or tucked into ceilings to protect them from termites. Thus, they were often wet, damaged&mdash;and erased&mdash;by rain. After an author&rsquo;s death, they were considered the property of his heirs, who kept them as heirlooms. Researchers have found that it takes a lot of arguing, and a real leap of consciousness, to make a folk writer or his heirs realize that literary and dramatic texts have value when they are read, studied, recorded, documented, and stored in libraries for others to profit from (Tiongson 1975; Fernandez 1978).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The orihinal was usually written in Bureau of Education notebooks&mdash;the paper and form most readily available to any writer around the country. The kinds of notebook, paper, ink, and penmanship used are often valuable to the dating of an undated manuscript. Some writers used real title pages, and were careful about documentation; an example is <strong><em>Oregenal ng Cenacolo/o Pasion y Muerte/Areng</em></strong><strong><em>Tunay ni Hirminigildo de Guzman/Sanayon ng Tikay&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Malolos Bulacan/Ang Oregenal na Ito Mayo 12-1948-ng Gauin Ito</em></strong> (Script of the Sinakulo/or Passion and Death/Real Property of Hirminigildo de Guzman/in the Barrio of Tikay, Malolos, Bulacan/This Script Was Finished on May 12, 1948) (Tiongson 1975). Others might record casts and the date of first performance: <strong><em>Zarzuela en <strong><strong>Bisaya</strong></strong> en un Acto</em></strong>, <strong><em>Letra del V. Cristobal y Musica de T. Gallego/Titulado:/&ldquo;Kalipay sang Panday&rdquo;/Reparto/TeclaDionisia Javellana/Felipa Dominga Javellana/Gregorio Ramon Zaldivar/Rafael Ygnacio Ynfante/Roque Castor Custodio/Ventura Jose Zarandin/Yko Gregorio Cuenca/Tau Macario Martinez/Coro de Carpineros/De Estreno en el <strong>Teatro</strong> Oriental de/Yloilo el a&ntilde;o 1906/Si prohibe copiar este original sin/el consentimiento del autor</em></strong> (Sarsuwela in Visayan in One Act, Libretto by/V.

Some have a title on the cover, then the first page starts immediately with the first scene, such as <strong><em>Sale el&nbsp;</em><em>Rey</em></strong> (Enter the King), omitting title, author, or date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major divisions of folk drama in the orihinal are called <strong>akto</strong>, <strong>bahagi</strong>, <strong>yugto</strong>, <strong>parte</strong>, <strong>hate</strong>, or <strong>timbon</strong> (acts). These are often divided into <strong>eksena</strong> or <strong>kuwadro</strong> (scenes), which may or may not be so labeled, but correspond to the entrances or exits of major characters, to a change of scenery, indicated by <strong>bukas telon</strong> (open curtain) or <strong>sara telon</strong> (close curtain); or in the sarsuwela, to the introduction of a song, signaled by the word <strong>prevencion</strong>. Some sinakulo are not formally structured but are roughly divided into scenes proper to each day, with the passion and crucifixion always falling on Good Friday; or into scenes and stage directions such as &ldquo;<em>Apostoles sali todos: ang pagpuputong ng dilang apoy sa mga apostoles</em>&rdquo; (Enter all apostles: the crowning of the apostles with tongues of flame), with the major divisions known to players and audience through familiarity with the material and the text (Tiongson 1975).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The komedya is often more formally divided. Manuel Roque&rsquo;s <strong><em>Vida de Atamante</em></strong> (Life of Atamante), Paete, Laguna, ca. 1887, starts with <strong>Primer Acto</strong>, divided into scenes by such instructions as &ldquo;<em>Se va Aristipo</em>&rdquo; (Aristipo exits) and &ldquo;<em>Pelean y paren</em>&rdquo; (They fight and stop), but no other act follows (Tiongson 1982). <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong></a>, ca. 1857-60, has three parts: <strong>primera parte</strong> (first part), divided into six <strong>tagpo</strong> (scenes); <strong>segunda parte</strong> (second part), into 11; and <strong>tercera parte</strong> (third part), into 12 (Medina 1990).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sarsuwela, hewing closely to its ancestor, the Spanish zarzuela, usually consisted of one act, like the <strong>genero chico</strong>, or three, four or five, like the <strong>zarzuela&nbsp;</strong><strong>grande</strong>, which is divided into <strong>escenas</strong> or <strong>cuadros</strong> (scenes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The orihinal may not be completely original, since sarsuwela writers may be led to copy or adapt a play that proved popular elsewhere. Not being conscious of intellectual property or copyright for themselves, neither are they conscious of it for others. Writers have been known to lend their orihinal, probably willingly, later to find it in production elsewhere, with or without attribution. Many sinakulo orihinal present a backbone structure derived from the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g&nbsp;<strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a> (and/or other pasyon), but encrusted and enriched with individual invention. This springs from the writer&rsquo;s folk/Filipino perception of the Biblical events and characters. For example, Mary is portrayed as a well brought-up&nbsp;<em>dalag a</em>(lady), and therefore a&nbsp;<em>colegiala&nbsp;</em>(convent bred), while Judas is shown as a drunkard. To expand the&nbsp;<em>pasyon&nbsp;</em>material to fill the eight days of production from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, apocryphal material and invention mix and merge: stories about Samuel Belibet and Boanerhes from the novel <strong><em>El Martir del Golgotha</em></strong> (The Martyr of Golgotha); stories from popular publications like <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></em></strong>; and in the case of the <strong><em>Elena</em></strong> of Malolos, Bulacan, shades of <strong><em>Oedipus Rex</em></strong> (Tiongson 1975).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The backs of the orihinal notebooks often yield interesting information, since the authors/directors were wont to record their lists of props. An example of a proper listing in a play is as follows:<em>Galamiton sa&nbsp;</em><em>Escenario: 1 ca lamesa ng may cajon</em>,&nbsp;<em>sa sulod sa cajon may</em><em>listahan sa mga Panday</em>,<em>1 ca lagare</em>,<em>1 ca lamaceta &hellip; Panapton nga guisi-on</em>,<em>Quinque de Mesa</em>,&nbsp;<em>2 ca Silla</em>,<em>Gunting</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cigarillo cag Fosforo&nbsp;</em>(Props for the scene: one table with drawer, inside the drawer a list of the carpenter&rsquo;s, one saw, one small table, one flower pot &hellip; torn clothing, table lamp, two chairs, scissors, cigarettes, and match) (Fernandez 1978). Lists of production expenses and of advances given to actors and the like are also included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The orihinal always has the text in the vernacular, but the stage directions in Spanish, or corrupted/indigenized Spanish, or both Spanish and the vernacular. The de Guzman sinakulo cited above, for example, has&nbsp;<em>Sali Soldados&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Siban Soldados&nbsp;</em>for &ldquo;<em>Sale Soldados</em>&rdquo; (Enter Soldiers) and &ldquo;<em>Se Van Soldados</em>&rdquo; (Exeunt Soldiers), but it also has&nbsp;<em>Bukas ang tilon&nbsp;</em>(Open curtain) and&nbsp;<em>Itatago ang ninyo ng Birhen&nbsp;</em>(The Virgin hides the child) (Tiongson 1975). The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2859\">Valente Cristobal</a> orihinal above has correct Spanish:&nbsp;<em>Vase Tecla&nbsp;</em>(Tecla exits),&nbsp;<em>Felipa prepara&nbsp;</em>(Felipa prepares), and&nbsp;<em>Prevencion&nbsp;</em>(a signal to prepare the band for a coming song). But it also has <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>&mdash;<em>Sigue sang pangita&nbsp;</em>(Continue looking)&mdash;and a combination:&nbsp;<em>Sale Felipa may dula nga panapton&nbsp;</em>(Enter Felipa carrying clothes) (Fernandez 1978).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These manuscripts were obviously used by the directors at rehearsals and on stage because they have red pencil marks, revisions, and marginal notations that have direct bearing on production. They generally do not have indications of lighting, stage arrangements, and the like. Certainly mood or production concept is not written down, for the author fully expects to be present at the rehearsal to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; the cast himself, perhaps as director. The orihinal is a bare, pragmatic playscript that records the texts of traditional drama, documents the working world of folk theater, as well as the transitions of both drama and theater: from the original Spanish forms to the indigenized forms now known as komedya, sinakulo, and sarsuwela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contemporary playscript is usually a typescript or mimeo script, or more recently a computer printout or a photocopy. It is generally divided as plays are in the United States and Europe: into acts and scenes, or into parts, possibly with prologue and epilogue. The multiple copies are demanded by the new production style: auditions and tryouts, memorization of lines, changes and notations while in production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playwrights may choose to provide detailed stage directions, explanations of characters and setting, even suggestions about music and other aspects of production. The script of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong><em>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</em></strong></a> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major), 1985, for example, specifies the music for each scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater styles, like forum and image theater, call for a minimal script or none at all. The text may be presented only in outline or contain instructions for improvisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contemporary play, however, generally has a conscious playscript, prepared with an eye to publication and to performance/production by groups other than the original. Authorial intention is considered, alongside revisions called for by actual production. When these scripts are printed in anthologies, journals, or other publications intended for reading audiences, they are generally only texts with stage directions and some data about original productions. Examples of these anthologies are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/752\"><strong><em>Tropical Baroque: Four Manile&ntilde;o Theatricals</em></strong></a>, 1979, a collection of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s four most representative plays, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/697\"><strong><em>Bangon: Antolohiya ng mga Dulang Mapanghimagsik</em></strong></a> (Revolt: Anthology of Revolutionary Plays), 1998, a collection of 35 plays that embody the people&rsquo;s revolutionary struggle against oppression written from 1967 to 1996. When they are prepared for the use of production groups&mdash;for example, the playscript of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907), 1982&mdash;they may contain text, music, production notes, an English translation, notes from author, director, and musical director, background/historical material, and the like (Tiongson 1985). The published playscript of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/718\"><strong><em>Juan Tamban</em></strong></a>, 1978, shares with the reader/performer the process of the play&rsquo;s creation, conscious that there are not too many books or occasions from which the playwright or theater group can acquire such experience (Chua 1984). <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/737\"><strong><em>Sa Sariling Bayan: Apat na Dulang may Musika</em></strong></a> (In One&rsquo;s Own Motherland: Four Plays with Music), 2003, contains not only the actual scripts but also the playwright&rsquo;s personal and historical circumstances of writing the play, and the literary and theater contexts of producing the play on the page and on stage. The book also includes the music used in the plays as well as photos from the actual staging of the plays (Lumbera 2003).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the orihinal, which was often the author&rsquo;s own original holograph but was meant for only one performing group, the playscript has developed into a literary text, a production guide, and often a document of theater in the Philippine context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the martial law period, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3144\">Palihang Aurelio V. Tolentino (PAVT)</a> was established in 1974 to produce activist-playwrights or playwrights with a strong orientation toward social concerns. PAVT had three phases. In the first phase, the participants listened to established playwrights discuss the objectives and techniques of playwriting. In the second phase, the participants wrote their own plays, then joined a playwriting contest which was open to all. Equal prizes were given to the ten best full-length plays. In the last phase, the winning plays went into production, with the young playwrights working closely with known directors and companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Production companies continued to require scripts, and as such, either these were developed by the companies&rsquo; existing playwrights, actors, and directors, or nonmembers were invited to write. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">PETA</a> had a Writers Pool in the 1970s that developed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2968\">Alan Glinoga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3148\">Manny Pambid</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>. The group not only wrote scripts but also determined the direction and play lineup of the Kalinangan Ensemble seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1980s, young playwright <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2884\">Charley dela Paz</a> took up the cudgels of developing a younger generation of member playwrights by setting up the PETA Playwrights Development Program. This produced the works of, among others, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\">Liza Magtoto</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2748\">Gamay Arkoncel</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4378\">Vincent de Jesus</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playwriting thrived in universities where young writers were exposed to the Western canon and contemporary plays by their teachers. Earlier playwrights include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a> (Philippine Normal College), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3335\">University of the Philippines (UP) Dramatic Club</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a> (both from UP). From the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2899\">UP Speech Communication and Theater Arts Department</a> came Anton Juan, Chris Millado, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3193\">Floy Quintos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3175\">Nicolas Pichay</a>. Later, the UP Department of Filipino and Philippine Literature offered playwriting courses in Filipino that culminated in staged readings. Ateneo de Manila&rsquo;s Fine Arts Theater programalso has a playwriting thesis with a production component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Activist theater groups from UP such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\">Company</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3166\">Peryante</a> also produced playwrights, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5094\">Joi Barrios</a> and Richie Valencia. Playwrights also developed in the regions through theater productions, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3350\">Ventura Bitot</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3130\">Obon Di Malayad Inc</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2858\">Sonny Cristobal</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan</a> in Bulacan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3163\">Edward Perez</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2751\">ARTIST</a> in Laguna, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3256\">Louie Sevilla</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3153\">Pantanghalang Sining ng Laguna</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3009\">Reynaldo Jamoralin</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3268\">Sorsogon&rsquo;s Community Based Theater Group</a>, Joel Albolario and Ismael Java of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3021\">Kalingaw: Ang Teatro Hiligaynon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2937\">Steven Patrick Fernandez</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3516\">Edward Defensor</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3290\">Teatro Amakan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2992\">Nestor Horfilla</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3022\">Kaliwat Theater Collective</a>, Frank Rivera of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a>, and Romeo Narvaez of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3109\">MSU Kabpapagariya Ensemble</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also vital were the continuing traditions of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> and the CCP Literary Awards. These institutions encouraged playwrights young and old to compete. When the Palanca Awards Hall of Fame was instituted, among the first to be recognized was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3161\">Jesus T. Peralta</a>, 1978. He was followed by playwrights <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>, 1994; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\">Rolando S.

Deriada</a>, 2001; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5269\">Reynaldo A. Duque</a>, 2003; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5197\">Isagani R. Cruz</a>, 2004; Rodolfo R. Lana Jr, 2005; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2805\">Manuel R. Buising</a>, 2005; Nicolas B. Pichay, 2007; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2725\">Reuel Molina </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\">Aguila</a>, 2009; Peter Solis Nery, 2007; and Rodolfo Vera, 2014. In 1990, the Carlos Palanca Foundation published <strong><em>Antolohiya ng mga Nagwaging Akda, Dekada 80: Isang-Yugtong Dula</em></strong> (Anthology of Winning Plays, Decade 80: One-Act Plays).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP literary contest was vied for by established and young playwrights as it offered the chance for first place winners to be produced by the resident company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a>, Reuel Aguila, and Butch Dalisay were among those produced in the 1980s by the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literary courses and workshops also encouraged the writing of new plays as a literary endeavor. In the 1980s a group of playwrights was organized in UP after a student council sponsored playwriting workshop taught by Rene Villanueva and Al Santos. The participants, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2897\">Rolando dela Cruz</a>, Nicolas Pichay, Donato Alvarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5090\">Romulo Baquiran</a>, Maripaz Luna, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\">Luna Sicat</a>, banded together and formed with Villanueva the Telon Playwrights Circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, summer workshops in playwriting by groups such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> or literary institutions such as the UP Creative Writing Center continued to introduce a new generation to the craft. One such workshop conducted at CCP Tanghalang Pilipino by Rene Villanueva produced Jun Lana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4839\">Elmer Gatchalian</a>, and JB Capino. They joined the Telon workshops that, in the 1990s, would merge with the PETA playwrights program. In the 2000s, this larger group broke off from PETA to form Writers Bloc Inc. In its wake, PETA organized another Writers Pool under Manny Pambid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writers Bloc, headed by Rody Vera, collaborated with Tanghalang Pilipino by the mid-2000s to organize the Virgin Laboratory Festival (VLF) or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3361\">Virgin Labfest</a> at the CCP. Though other festivals also abound in the era, including foreign franchises such as Fringe Manila and Short and Sweet, it was the VLF that consistently provided for the plays of the young playwrights, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2802\">Layeta Bucoy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3059\">Allan Lopez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3087\">Glenn Sevilla Mas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2867\">Tim Dacanay</a>, to be produced and their scripts to be published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publication was rich and varied by this time even as commercial publishers ceased to publish play scripts. During the centennial of the Philippine Revolution in 1998, the National Centennial Commission sponsored a literary competition wherein playwrights and other writers were honored with a million-peso cash prize each, as well as publication for first place winners, in Filipino sarsuwela and English drama categories, among other genres. Nicolas Pichay&rsquo;s <strong><em>Almanac for a Revolution</em></strong>, 2000, won in the English drama category, while <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/639\"><strong><em>Ang <strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></em></strong></a> (Valentin&rsquo;s Palace), 2003, won in the Filipino sarsuwela category. Both plays, along with other prizewinning plays, were published by the UP Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government agencies provided grants and assistance not only for theater productions but also for playscript publication. CCP published <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/719\"><strong><em>Kamao: Panitikan ng Protesta 1970-1986, Dula</em></strong></a> (Fist: Protest Literature 1970-1986, Play), 1987; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/753\"><strong><em>Unang Tagpo: Kalipunan ng mga Dulang Rehyunal sa Pambansang Pistang Pandulaan</em></strong></a> (First Scene: Anthology of Regional Plays from the National Theater Festival), 1992; the Tanghalang Pilipino Sarsuwela series, which includes <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1990s; and the Virgin Labfest anthologies in 2009 and 2012. NCCA published <strong><em>Telon: Mga Dula</em></strong> (Telon: Plays), in 2011. Nongovernment organizations also published anthologies. An example is the Philippine PEN, which published <strong><em>Stage Presence</em></strong>, 2008, an anthology of English plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playwrights found allies in the university presses that published anthologies focusing on theater forms, playwrights or theater groups, and regions or languages. A number of books were research outputs whose main objective was to develop a theater history that is inclusive of the contributions from the different regions in the country. These include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5490\">Edna Zapanta-Manlapaz</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/695\"><strong>Aurelio Tolentino: Selected Writings</strong></a></em></strong>, 1975; Wilhelmina Q. Ramas&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/747\"><strong><em>Sugbuanon Theater from Sotto to Rodriguez and Kabahar: An Introduction to Pre-War Sugbuanon Drama</em></strong></a>, 1982; Wilhelmina Q. Ramas, Filonila M. Tupas, Alejandro J. Casambre, Marcelo C. Zamora, <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5626\">Maria Lilia F. Realubit</a>, and Consuelo M. Damaso&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/732\"><strong>Philippine Drama: Twelve Plays in Six Languages</strong></a></em></strong>, 1987; and Wilhemina Q. Ramas&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/745\"><strong><em>Studies of the Pre-War Sugbuanon Theater (The First Series)</em></strong></a>, 2001, all published by the UP Press. The Ateneo de Manila University Press produced a number of anthologies for the Panitikan Series, which includes Mario G.R. Rosal&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/758\"><strong>Zarzuelang Iloko</strong></a></em></strong>, 1993; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5573\">Priscelina Patajo-Legasto</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/740\"><strong>Sarswelang Pangasinan</strong></a></em></strong>, 1996; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/710\"><strong>Dulaang Hiligaynon</strong></a></em></strong>, 1996; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5021\">Erlinda K. Alburo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5517\">Resil B. Mojares</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/709\"><strong>Dulaang Cebuano</strong></a></em></strong>, 1997. University presses from the regions also produced books that would highlight their regions&rsquo; plays. An example is Clarita C. Filipinas&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/725\"><strong>The Lineyte-Samarnon Zarzuela (1899-1977): History and Aesthetics</strong></a></em></strong>, published by the Divine Word University Publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several published books provide scholarly documentation of a specific theater form, focusing on the text, contexts, and performance. Nicanor G. Tiongson documented two folk forms in his <strong><em>Philippine Theatre: History and Anthology</em></strong> series, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/743\"><strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/722\"><strong><em><strong>Komedya</strong></em></strong></a>, both published by the UP Press in 1999. In these books, Tiongson discusses in detail the history, script, production techniques, and significance of the theater form in the community. The books also provide performance photographs, performance scores, and complete orihinal of an actual performance with annotations by Tiongson, providing scholars, students, and academics in theater and performance studies, literary studies, art studies, and other related disciplines a comprehensive understanding of the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most published books are anthologies of works by individual or several playwrights. These books often contain an introduction explaining the aesthetics, the sociohistorical contexts, and the histories of the plays, and the creative processes in writing the plays. In 2000, the UP Creative Writing Center and the UP Press published <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/723\"><strong>The Likhaan Book of Philippine Drama 1991-1996: From Page to Stage</strong></a></em></strong>. Edited by Anton Juan, the book is a collection of five full-length plays written by Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, Floy Quintos, Chris Millado, Elsa Coscolluela, and Arturo Calo (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4689\">Aureus Solito</a>). In 2006, the second collection, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/694\"><strong><em>Ang Aklat Likhaan ng Dula 1997-2003: Kapangahasan bilang Kaligtasan</em></strong></a> (The Likhaan Book of Plays 1997-2003: Boldness as Redemption), was published. Editors Rene O. Villanueva and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5527\">Victor Emmanuel Carmelo D. Nadera Jr</a> put together 15 plays by new and established playwrights, as well as scripts for electronic media, such as television and radio. In 2005, the UST Publishing House published <strong><em>10 x 10 x 10 (Sampung Tigsasampung Minutong Dula ng Sampung Mandudula)</em></strong> (Ten Ten-Minute Plays by Ten Playwrights), featuring short plays by members of the Writers Bloc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play anthologies by individual playwrights include <strong><em>Mga Dula sa Magkakaibang Midyum</em></strong> (Plays for Various Media), 1982, by Frank Rivera; <strong><em>Ang Katutubo at Dalawa Pang Dula</em></strong> (The Native and Two Other Plays), 1983, by <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3186\">Nonilon V. Quea&ntilde;o</a>; <strong><em>Ligalig at Iba Pang Dula</em></strong> (Disquiet and Other Plays), 1989, by Reuel Molina Aguila; <strong><em>Teatro Pulitikal</em></strong> (Political Theater), 1994, by Malou Leviste Jacob; <strong><em>Apat na Dula</em></strong> (Four Plays), 1998, by Rene Villanueva; <strong><em>Rite of Passage and Her Father&rsquo;s House</em></strong>, 2005, by Glenn Sevilla Mas; <strong><em>Tatlong Paglalakbay: Isang Trilohiya ng Mahahabang Dula ni Tony Perez</em></strong> (Three Journeys: A Trilogy of Long Plays by Tony Perez), 2007; <strong><em>Hibik ni Amang-Hari: Mga Unang Dula ni Tony Perez</em></strong> (Plea of Father, the King: First Plays of Tony Perez), 2008, by Tony Perez; and <strong><em>Collected Plays</em></strong>, volumes 1 and 2, 2014, by Floy Quintos. The digital medium has yet to be explored for play publication. So far only the Palanca Foundation has used the Internet to electronically publish winning literary works, including plays, on its portal, www.palancaawards.com.ph.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

At first, this referred to the author&#x2019;s original manuscript, the holograph written in notebooks, and the only extant copy, since authors did not give copies to actors or stage crew. The former had their lines dictated to them by the <strong>diktador</strong>/<strong>apuntador</strong>; the latter were given verbal directions or the <strong>apuntacion</strong> (prompt script). Later, orihinal came to refer as well to copies of the holograph handwritten by a son, daughter, or assistant; then to typewritten copies of the original, and even by extension to a mimeo script. The term is never applied, however, to a printed and published text; it always denotes some exclusivity and rareness."

The orihinal was simply the play each had written for a particular <strong>samahan</strong>, occasion, or town. As the key to presentation, it had to be safeguarded."

Researchers have found that it takes a lot of arguing, and a real leap of consciousness, to make a folk writer or his heirs realize that literary and dramatic texts have value when they are read, studied, recorded, documented, and stored in libraries for others to profit from (Tiongson 1975; Fernandez 1978)."

		"text": "<p>The sets refer to the scenery and properties or the physical context created for a theater performance. It includes the setting for mimetic actions, including the clearings, fields and open spaces for ritual, dance, and ceremony, and the accessories there used; the properties that dressed entablado or temporary stages built for folk theater during and after the Spanish colonial period; and eventually, the more formal mise-en-sc&egrave;ne in indoor and outdoor theaters, which indicates where the stage action is supposed to be taking place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When viewing a modern theater production the audience is presented with interior landscapes, the time and milieu carefully chosen to tell a story that may take on psychological and symbolic dimensions; and exterior landscapes, the environment in which the production is presented based on staging conventions. Anything that exists and happens in a performance is a symbolic creation of those behind the production. A space is chosen that may contain dimensions beyond that which is seen, lights set the space to be comprehended, performers wear clothing prescribed to define and enhance their presence, while sound provides the aural dimension of the world thus created.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the indigenous theater of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a>, dance, and ceremony, sets consisted of the altars prepared for the <strong>pagdiwata</strong>; or the setting arranged for <strong>kashawing</strong>, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> rice planting ritual&mdash;a mat spread on the field with the symbolic flags, food, and cans of water and seaweed; and certainly the spirit houses, table of offerings, fires, shelters, among others, necessary for different occasions. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><strong>duplo</strong></a>, the mimetic game played at wakes, called for definite set, called <strong>kaharian</strong> (kingdom): a table and a chair for the <strong>hari</strong> (king), benches for the <strong>bilyako</strong> and <strong>bilyaka</strong>, and the <strong>palmatoryo</strong> as symbol of authority for the <strong>piskal</strong> (fiscal). The coffin flanked by candles may also be said to be part of the setting, because penalties for losers might include saying a <strong>dalit</strong> or prayer at its side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the religious dramas and dramatizations of Spanish colonial drama, sets were approximations of the assumed Biblical settings: palm-strewn (sometimes also <strong>tapis</strong> -lined) streets, church aisles, or plazas for the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a>, perhaps with <strong>kubol</strong> (little platform or huts) for the angels singing or strewing petals. For the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>, it often included a tall <strong>galilea</strong>, a structure from which to suspend the <strong>puso</strong> (heart) masking the chair on a pulley for the descending angel; a decorated stage for declamations and dances; the figures and <strong>karo</strong> (floats) of the Blessed Virgin, the Risen Christ, and accompanying saints; and in the case of Angono, Rizal, an elaborate system of pulleys for the angel, and for the birds that swoop down to open the puso. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/474\"><strong>siete palabras</strong></a> was usually dramatized with the statue of the crucified Christ against a background of greenery; and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> enacted partially in a field representing Golgotha, and in the streets (Tiongson 1975).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When enactment was on an <strong>entablado</strong>, however, as for the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, sinakulo, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, the <strong>telon</strong> (<strong>kurtina</strong>, <strong>kartelon</strong> &mdash;stage curtain), the painted backdrop and/or curtain, was the basic set used in folk theater, both on open-air and indoor stages. This was usually made of about 10 yd of canvas or thick cotton or unbleached muslin, and painted by community artists or members of theater groups. Often a water-based paint (in Iloilo&nbsp;<em>pulbos de sin&nbsp;</em>mixed with water and gum arabic) is used, so that the cloth may be recycled, simply by wetting, erasing the design, and then repainting. These hang from ceiling to floor, and are rolled up by hand by means of pulleys, the <strong>telonero</strong> in charge sitting at its side, either on stage or on a small platform just off to one side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telonero is also the name given to the scene painter(s), who may be a complete amateur or, as in the case of the Iloilo sarsuwela, the most prominent painter in town (Vicente San Miguel), also responsible for painting the background scenery used in the city&rsquo;s photography studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>telon de fondo</strong> or permanent backdrop marks the end of the performance area, and in the provincial open-air stages, is thus the wall of what serves as dressing area. The <strong>telon de boca</strong> or front curtain covers the stage and in front of this a troupe member might announce the beginning or end of the play or its acts. Other telones are painted to satisfy the needs of the play: a <strong>telon (de) calle</strong> for a street scene, a <strong>telon bukid</strong> for a countryside scene (fields, mountains in the background), and others for church, palace exteriors and interiors, even prisons. Although most telones are single pieces of cloth, there are occasional variants, like <strong>kurtinang pambuwisit</strong> (short curtain) or even split curtains that move to either side or roll up individually. In some productions, the prompter speaks from behind the curtain, or through a hole in it (Tiongson 1975).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some komedya stages used painted facades (representing a Moro/Christian castle) instead of telones. In San Dionisio, Paranaque, this is built on a permanent stage, in three levels, with two entrances on the ground level, each indicating a Moro or Christian kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The stages are provided with furniture and props indicating (usually quite minimally) the setting: tall, possibly carved chairs for a throne room; some potted plants and rocks for a garden or forest; a tall structure that could suggest a balcony from which to watch a <strong>torneo</strong> in a komedya, or a tower from which Magdalena could look out on a serenading Boanerhes, in the sinakulo (Tiongson 1975, 1982). For the indoor scenes, of a sarsuwela, a living room set was usual, its luxury depending on whether the setting was a <strong>sala rica</strong> or a <strong>sala pobre</strong> &mdash;perhaps with the center and end tables, flowers, and pictures on the walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special effects, called <strong>artipisyo</strong> or <strong>artipisyales</strong> (from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>artificio</em>, &ldquo;artifice&rdquo;) in the sinakulo, and <strong>mahiya</strong> (from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>magia</em>, &ldquo;magic&rdquo;) in the komedya were often part of the stage dressing. These were a favorite with the audiences, to whom they brought the extraordinariness and splendor of the events in the plays. In the sinakulo, for example, special effects include angels descending from heaven, the Blessed Virgin ascending to heaven, Christ rising from the dead&mdash;on pulleys disguised as part of the set. Other devices portrayed miracles, like &ldquo;wheat&rdquo; shooting up to confuse the soldiers pursuing the Holy Family into Egypt, or water turning to wine at the Last Supper (Tiongson 1975). The komedya has had such &ldquo;magical&rdquo; effects as birds flying off on pulleys with princes on their backs, mountains opening into waterfalls, and flowers unfolding to reveal princesses within (Tiongson 1982). The devices behind these effects are designed and executed by folk carpenters and artisans, who interpret their understanding of the splendor through native ingenuity and, especially the sides of the stage, fertility and innocence of folk imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When indoor theaters were built, stage directors (who were usually their own designers) began to demand more realism, closing off the sides of the stage with bastidores or tormentors of painted canvas, hiding the pulley strings and the ceiling with <strong>bambalina</strong> or teasers, and eventually building box sets, dressed with furniture proper to the scene and the period (usually from their own friends&rsquo; homes). When the sarsuwela became the regnant theater form, filling the Manila theaters and then traveling on to provincial venues, stage sets increased in cost and complexity. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/503\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ng Dagat</em></strong></a> (Child of the Sea), 1921, for example, specifies an opening scene showing a shipwreck; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3147\">Precioso Palma</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), 1920, has one act set in a Club Bagongtao with a garden glorieta, one in the countryside where a picnic unfolds, and another in a living room where a party takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Japanese occupation, which cut off the influx of American films, Filipinos turned to stage shows and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a>, which called for stage dressing for the skits, revues, and musical numbers. The sets and props used for these stages were similar to those of the sarsuwela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was after the sarsuwela, however, when Manila schools started to stage Western plays&mdash;modern theater at the University of the Philippines (UP), Shakespeare and Greek tragedy at Ateneo de Manila&mdash;that academe&rsquo;s sensitivity to consistency of period, style, and thought and its unity in a production brought to fore the need for a person to focus on this aspect of production. It was in campus theaters that most stage designers had their first experience&mdash;perhaps as scene painters or carpenters, usually as assistant to directors. &ldquo;Perhaps it was at this juncture that Filipino directors, acutely aware of the limiting conditions to which the &lsquo;legitimate&rsquo; stage had to submit, began moving towards the idea of a Filipino stage design&rdquo; (Lumbera and Gavino 1990).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Pacific War, when normalcy returned, the Philippine stage developed designers&mdash;at first interior designers like Ernest Korneld&mdash;for <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballets</a>, and plays presented at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">Opera</a> House, the Far Eastern University Auditorium, the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/358\">Philamlife</a> Auditorium, and the Girl Scouts Auditorium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the new theater groups and theaters came into being from the 1960s onward, the demand for scene design increased further. Professional theater groups, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a>, together with campus-based theater organizations, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, Ateneo Experimental Theater, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3302\">Teatro Tomasino</a>, paved the way for a flourishing theater atmosphere during that time. Under the supervision of prominent theater directors such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3065\">Tony Mabesa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan Jr</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2712\">Ricky Abad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2925\">Jose Estrella</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\">Nonon Padilla</a>, these groups generally followed Western styles, especially Repertory Philippines, which did plays from Broadway and the London West End.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rise of these theater groups opened a number of different theater venues that created the necessary space for theater design to thrive. On its open-air thrust stage, called Dulaang Rajah Sulayman, in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> ruins, PETA produced original Filipino plays as well as translations and adaptations of foreign plays. These productions, like those designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a>, were often characterized by &ldquo;resourcefulness and creative use of nonconventional materials and staging techniques&rdquo; (Lumbera and Gavino 1990). There were also the different theater venues located in UP, Ateneo, University of Santo Tomas, and other campuses in which the energy of students, the imagination of directors, the limited budgets, and the daring of student productions made for some very creative stage design and designers. The <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, with its three different stages&mdash;Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>, Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>, and Tanghalang <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Huseng Batute</a>&mdash;provides venues for every type of performance, and therefore opportunities for a spectrum of stage designs by designers like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a>. Its performances, training workshops, and grants, moreover, have developed stage design as a profession, and Filipino stage designers alongside playwrights and directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the desire to present a more unified vision of the dramatic space has been a motivation for a scenographic approach to productions or, at least, to performing multiple creative roles: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3050\">Amiel Leonardia</a> designs sets and lights for productions he directs, Salvador Bernal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2973\">Gino Gonzales</a> do sets and costumes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3228\">Tuxqs Rutaquio</a> directs and designs sets and costumes, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3080\">Lex Marcos</a> has designed lights for his sets. All of the aforementioned had experience with campus theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater design is now taught in some Philippine schools, by designers who sharpened their skills through their studies abroad, like Amiel Leonardia (master of fine arts, University of Hawaii), Salvador Bernal (master of fine arts, Northwestern University), <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2893\">Ludendorffo Decenteceo</a> (master of fine arts, Tulane University), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2999\">Mio Infante</a> (master of arts in scenography, Wimbledon School of Art), and Gino Gonzales (master of fine arts, Tisch School of the Arts, New York University). Their experiences and training abroad contributed greatly in advancing the level of theater design in the Philippines. Bernal, for example, after finishing his degree, came back to the country in the early 1970s, when the necessary conditions had been set for a flowering of the performing arts in the Metro Manila area: new theaters were built, old venues were refurbished and upgraded, a brilliant crop of theater and dance artists began to rise and mature, and more professional and semiprofessional companies were established (Tiongson 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the vast styles and modes it has showcased through the years, production design has earned itself recognition as an art form, as proven by the proclamation of Salvador Bernal as the first National Artist for theater design in 2003. With his works, he elevated the status of a designer to that of a creative artist, on the same level as the playwrights, performers, or director. His style became known for veering away from literalist renderings, preferring abstractions or stylization instead. Bernal deliberately used the stage as another medium to give life to the theatrical text and did not merely decorate the stage or concede to unjustified realism. With him, the set performed together with and complemented all the other aspects of production in order to create an artistically unified production (Tiongson 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its status as an art form, production design in the Philippines also started to become a viable profession in the 1990s. It was during this time that a number of production designers, led by Bernal, organized the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3168\">Philippine Association of Theater Designers and Techinicians (PATDAT)</a> to further establish production design as a profession. After its organization in 1994, PATDAT became a full-fledged country member of the Organisation Internationale des Scenografes, Techniciens, et Architects de Theatre or OISTAT in 1997. Along with Bernal, those involved in the early stages of PATDAT-OISTAT Centre Philippines were Gino Gonzales, Ricardo Eric G. Cruz, Gerard H. Fernandez, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2745\">Jay V. Aranda</a>, Eric Pineda, Jo Tecson, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3211\">Leo Rialp</a>, Nonon Padilla, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3517\">Rafael del Casal</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3079\">Dennis Marasigan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PATDAT-OISTAT elevated the production design profession by encouraging exchange of ideas, innovations, and collaboration among theater designers. The organization has mounted exhibitions, conferences, and lectures on design and its members have also been attending international theater design exhibitions, competitions, and conferences. To cultivate professionalism among its members, it established a set of standards of ethical practice to guide the members on their obligations to the public, its clients or employers, and to the profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A survey of sets from the 1980s to the early 21st century will show vast styles of theater design that can be grouped into these five categories: realistic, stylized, surrealistic, symbolic, and postmodern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realistic stage designs largely contribute in establishing the ambience necessary to make the audience co-experience the particular context and situations affecting the characters on stage. A two-storey set was used by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4239\">Leo Abaya</a> for <strong><em>Pahimakas sa Isang Ahente</em></strong> (<strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong>), 2014, for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>. The house evoked the 1940s suburban America setting with its use of a telephone, refrigerator, wallpaper, lamps, and other furniture from that era. In Dulaang UP&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/545\">Fake</a></em></strong>, 2011, Dante Nico Garcia had the audience witness the Mountain of Revelations and its holy tree where Sister Emily performs her miracles; rose petals literally fell from Teatro Hermogenes Ylagan&rsquo;s ceiling when Sister Emily finally showed the unbeliever Miguel the truth of her faith. Mio Infante, in PETA&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 2014, literally created an inundated Barangay Venezia inside the PETA Phinma Theater; the center stage was filled with a pool of water surrounded by makeshift houses of typical informal settler communities, making the whole stage look like the perennially flooded and poverty-stricken barangays featured in the news and documentaries. The physical existence of the flood made it easier to sympathize with the characters as the audience witnessed them ride the bancas or even soak themselves in the flood every time they traveled from one place to another. Infante won Outstanding Set Design at the 2014 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3170\">Philippine Legitimate Stage Artists Group</a> Gawad Buhay!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much more imagination is required from the audience in the use of stylized sets, as set pieces are portrayed only through details and not their entirety. In Tanghalang Pilipino&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/651\"><strong>Sa North Diversion Road</strong></a></em></strong> (On the North Diversion Road), 1988, Salvador Bernal did not need to transport a real car on stage, the play&rsquo;s main setting; he only used car skeletons as the car itself and strips of paper as highways and let the audience exercise their suspension of disbelief. Such a move was artistically economical and practical, for having a real car on stage would be very expensive and would physically hinder the actors from being audible and connecting to the audience. In <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/521\"><strong>Bombita</strong></a></em></strong>, 2011, staged by Ateneo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2921\">Enterteynment para sa Tao, Bayan, Lansangan, at Diyos (ENTABLADO)</a>, set changes were done quickly by using adjacent pillars of rotating triangular prisms as the background; Mikaela Ostonal and Ena Esca&ntilde;an devised the background to shift from a military headquarters to a field with cloudy blue skies to a neutral place in every rotation of the triangular prisms, a modern version of the komedya&rsquo;s telon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sets sometimes use the natural setting for plays with mythical content. An example is the set design of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/594\"><strong>Ang Maikling Buhay ng Apoy</strong></a></em></strong> (The Short Life of Fire), 1993, staged outdoors using the trees as background and mounted 15 ft above the ground. Another example is the stage design by Gino Gonzales for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong><em><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong>: Ang Banog ng Sanlibutan</em></strong></a> (Labaw Donggon: Hawk of the Universe), 2013, Ateneo ENTABLADO. The one-level platform stage was deliberately set in an open space with bamboo groves in the background to give the audience an authentic feel of Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s world while minimal props transformed the bare stage into the different settings of the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In minimalist stage designs, the set is usually limited to a few pieces and some ornaments, like in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3361\">Virgin Labfest</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/566\"><strong>Isang Araw sa Karnabal</strong></a></em></strong> (A Day in the Carnival), 2009, which depicted the busyness of a carnival with a few props; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2860\">Eric Cruz</a> only had a bench in the middle of the stage and props to define the different spaces the characters visited in the carnival: a rifle suggested a shooting booth, a steel bar a roller-coaster harness. For a play about five high school students who discover the importance of Shakespeare in their lives, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3018\">Boni Juan</a> used wooden stools stacked and connected like Lego pieces to function as the backdrop, classroom, locker room, and the individual homes and spaces of the characters in PETA&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a></em></strong>, 2011. In Ateneo ENTABLADO&rsquo;s version of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major), 2013, simple blocks were utilized in each of the four stories featured in the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In symbolic stage designs, the set itself serves as the principal metaphor for the play&rsquo;s message. Salvador Bernal was lauded for his poetic stage designs that elevated the artistry of stage designing to a whole new level. His biographer <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> describes his individual achievments. For <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/5801\"><strong>Francisco Maniago</strong></a></em></strong>, 1987, he constructed three huge sandboxes that impeded the actors&rsquo; movements, symbolizing the devious tactics employed by the Spaniards to defeat the uprising led by Maniago. For <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/576\"><strong>Kabesang Tales</strong></a></em></strong>, 1997, he visualized Kabesang Tales&rsquo;s loss of his lands by constructing a small drum with transparent sidewalls and faces filled with sand; at the moment of Kabesang Tales&rsquo;s mourning after he had lost everything, sand was seen falling to the ground, disappearing through the holes of the wooden floor. For <strong><em>Lapu-Lapu</em></strong>, 1997, the central motif served as the major set pieces themselves; since the ocean made possible the meeting of Lapu-Lapu and Magellan, of East and West, the characters stood on three huge parallel waves undulating on the stage. For <strong><em>Ang Pagpatay kay <strong><strong>Antonio Luna</strong></strong></em></strong> (The Execution of Antonio Luna), 2001, the metaphor of the stairs was used to visualize the confusing and conflicting courses taken by the leaders of the Philippine Revolution during the uprising against the Spanish and Americans; Bernal created a single set that had 14 separate staircases going up and down in different levels and directions, some ending in blank walls or in dead-end platforms (Tiongson 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other set designers also resorted to this style in order to concretize the statement brought across by the play. Richard de Guzman covered the whole interior wall of the theater up to the stage with recycled yellow pages folded in an origami-like fashion to evoke the environmental theme of <strong><em>Unang Baboy sa Langit</em></strong> (The First Pig in Heaven), 2009. In <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/666\"><strong><em>Ang Sistema ni Propesor Tuko</em></strong></a> (Professor Gecko&rsquo;s Way), 2012, Martin Malabanan set Professor Tuko&rsquo;s classroom in a wasteland with a blackboard and a couple of chairs instead of a typical cozy classroom to show that Philippine public education is garbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fantasy stage designs easily dispose the audience to the dreamlike quality of a play. To capture a magical virgin forest that serves as playground for fairies and spirits, Salvador Bernal experimented with fiber optics in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/110\"><strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong></a>, 2004, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> Guild. In Dulaang UP&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/682\"><strong><em>Umaaraw,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Umuulan, Kinakasal ang <strong>Tikbalang</strong></em></strong></a> (Sun Shining, Rain Pouring, Horse Demons Wed), 2012, Lex Marcos recreated the world of Philippine mythical creatures by abstracting the trees, clouds, and other details of a typical rural setting, transforming the whole stage into a mural of waves and crescents. In Tanghalang Pilipino&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/561\"><strong><em>Ibalong</em></strong></a>, 2013, the grotesque costumes for the monsters complemented the magical setting of this Bikol epic, which was evoked by Tuxqs Rutaquio through balete vines, and a luminous Mount Mayon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postmodern stage designs are self-referential in nature and combine disparate elements to create new forms. Moreover, the ubiquity of digital media has challenged productions with audiences that are more sensory. Productions have responded with presentations that provoke the senses. As a result, there is so much more that theater can express because of digital media. Martin Malabanan used cartoon animation as the primary visual device in Reyna Leona&rsquo;s most important musical number in <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (Hundred Dreams), 2007, of Ateneo ENTABLADO. Instead of typical movements on stage, the whole song was visually narrated through an animated picture of Reyna Leona doing charity work for the people of Kingdom Tralala. The use of digital media in the stage thus adds new textures and provides fresh ways of experiencing a play. Scene changes were swiftly done through <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3080\">Lex Marcos</a> and Mark Dalacat&rsquo;s use of projectors in the set of Dulaang UP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bilanggo ng Pag-ibig</em></strong> (Prisoner of Love), 2015, an adaptation of Jean Genet&rsquo;s <strong><em>Un Captif Amoureux</em></strong>. Marcos and Dalacat also utilized digital media to aid in understanding and capturing Genet&rsquo;s imagination and communicating controversial insights on different themes, like love, war, homosexuality, and violence, through displaying snippets from Genet&rsquo;s own writings. In the same year, Dulaang UP staged a play that used multimedia as its forefront device,&nbsp;<em><strong>#R<!--3J: A Multimedial Hallucination on William Shakespeareâ€™s Romeo and Juliet;<!--3J: A <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a>l Hallucination on William Shakespeare?s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/185\"><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></a></strong-->--</strong> </em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2872\">Ohm David</a> filled the stage with projections of images very familiar to millennials&mdash;icons of different applications and technologies, Internet pornography sites, social media interfaces&mdash;in order to draw the audience to the &ldquo;multimedial hallucination&rdquo; the play was trying to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sets for many and varied ballets and plays staged on different Philippine stages all indicate how stage design in the Philippines, though often burdened with lack of funds, materials, and facilities, has learned from the past, been managed in the present, and envisioned the future.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <strong><em>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

This was usually made of about 10 yd of canvas or thick cotton or unbleached muslin, and painted by community artists or members of theater groups. Often a water-based paint (in Iloilo&#xA0;<em>pulbos de sin&#xA0;</em>mixed with water and gum arabic) is used, so that the cloth may be recycled, simply by wetting, erasing the design, and then repainting.

Other telones are painted to satisfy the needs of the play: a <strong>telon (de) calle</strong> for a street scene, a <strong>telon bukid</strong> for a countryside scene (fields, mountains in the background), and others for church, palace exteriors and interiors, even prisons. Although most telones are single pieces of cloth, there are occasional variants, like <strong>kurtinang pambuwisit</strong> (short curtain) or even split curtains that move to either side or roll up individually.

These were a favorite with the audiences, to whom they brought the extraordinariness and splendor of the events in the plays. In the sinakulo, for example, special effects include angels descending from heaven, the Blessed Virgin ascending to heaven, Christ rising from the dead&#x2014;on pulleys disguised as part of the set. Other devices portrayed miracles, like &#x201C;wheat&#x201D; shooting up to confuse the soldiers pursuing the Holy Family into Egypt, or water turning to wine at the Last Supper (Tiongson 1975). The komedya has had such &#x201C;magical&#x201D; effects as birds flying off on pulleys with princes on their backs, mountains opening into waterfalls, and flowers unfolding to reveal princesses within (Tiongson 1982).

Their experiences and training abroad contributed greatly in advancing the level of theater design in the Philippines. Bernal, for example, after finishing his degree, came back to the country in the early 1970s, when the necessary conditions had been set for a flowering of the performing arts in the Metro Manila area: new theaters were built, old venues were refurbished and upgraded, a brilliant crop of theater and dance artists began to rise and mature, and more professional and semiprofessional companies were established (Tiongson 2007)."

His style became known for veering away from literalist renderings, preferring abstractions or stylization instead. Bernal deliberately used the stage as another medium to give life to the theatrical text and did not merely decorate the stage or concede to unjustified realism.

The physical existence of the flood made it easier to sympathize with the characters as the audience witnessed them ride the bancas or even soak themselves in the flood every time they traveled from one place to another.

Such a move was artistically economical and practical, for having a real car on stage would be very expensive and would physically hinder the actors from being audible and connecting to the audience. In <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/521\"><strong>Bombita</strong></a></em></strong>, 2011, staged by Ateneo&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/7/2921\">Enterteynment para sa Tao, Bayan, Lansangan, at Diyos (ENTABLADO)</a>, set changes were done quickly by using adjacent pillars of rotating triangular prisms as the background; Mikaela Ostonal and Ena Esca&#xF1;an devised the background to shift from a military headquarters to a field with cloudy blue skies to a neutral place in every rotation of the triangular prisms, a modern version of the komedya&#x2019;s telon."

For <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/5801\"><strong>Francisco Maniago</strong></a></em></strong>, 1987, he constructed three huge sandboxes that impeded the actors&#x2019; movements, symbolizing the devious tactics employed by the Spaniards to defeat the uprising led by Maniago. For <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/576\"><strong>Kabesang Tales</strong></a></em></strong>, 1997, he visualized Kabesang Tales&#x2019;s loss of his lands by constructing a small drum with transparent sidewalls and faces filled with sand; at the moment of Kabesang Tales&#x2019;s mourning after he had lost everything, sand was seen falling to the ground, disappearing through the holes of the wooden floor. For <strong><em>Lapu-Lapu</em></strong>, 1997, the central motif served as the major set pieces themselves; since the ocean made possible the meeting of Lapu-Lapu and Magellan, of East and West, the characters stood on three huge parallel waves undulating on the stage. For <strong><em>Ang Pagpatay kay <strong><strong>Antonio Luna</strong></strong></em></strong> (The Execution of Antonio Luna), 2001, the metaphor of the stairs was used to visualize the confusing and conflicting courses taken by the leaders of the Philippine Revolution during the uprising against the Spanish and Americans; Bernal created a single set that had 14 separate staircases going up and down in different levels and directions, some ending in blank walls or in dead-end platforms (Tiongson 2007)."

Moreover, the ubiquity of digital media has challenged productions with audiences that are more sensory. Productions have responded with presentations that provoke the senses.

Martin Malabanan used cartoon animation as the primary visual device in Reyna Leona&#x2019;s most important musical number in <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (Hundred Dreams), 2007, of Ateneo ENTABLADO. Instead of typical movements on stage, the whole song was visually narrated through an animated picture of Reyna Leona doing charity work for the people of Kingdom Tralala. The use of digital media in the stage thus adds new textures and provides fresh ways of experiencing a play.

		"text": "<p>Sound design in theater is the process of creating the best, if not ideal, aural environment for the theatrical production through artistic, technical, and collaborative means. The person responsible for this task is the sound designer who makes sure that the musical and environmental ambience as well as the acoustical reinforcement of the production are working together to form the total soundscape of a performance. The designer&rsquo;s specific responsibilities can vary considerably, however, as these would greatly depend on the type of performance, the performers, and the performance venue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In past centuries, sound-related expressions utilized in Philippine theater mainly focused on the aspect of music. This is not surprising, as Philippine theater history is, after all, deeply rooted in and intertwined with countless musical forms and traditions and vice versa. But by the dawn of the 21st century, trends in globalization, technological advances, not to mention the growing tastes and listening expectations of audiences and theater practitioners, led to a reassessment of the nature, role, and function of sound and music in the theater. World theater scholars and practitioners would point out that instead of it being an afterthought, sound is and should be an integral part of the production concept. In addition, the proliferation of and accessibility to analog and digital sound systems brought about novel, exciting, and yet complex processes in sound and music production. Consequently, such discourses, processes, and technological developments paved the way for a &ldquo;new&rdquo; artistic and technical field to emerge in the Philippine contemporary theater scene&mdash;sound design.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While sound design may indeed be considered a novel artistic and technical field as opposed to set design, costume design, and lighting design, the practice of integrating sound in theater performances has, in fact, existed in Philippine theater traditions from the very beginning. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432\">Indigenous</a> oral traditions such as the <strong>badiw</strong> of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, <strong>duplo</strong> of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a> of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, and <strong>tod-om</strong> of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, as well as Hispanic dramatic genres like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> and American forms like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> and spoken plays, place emphasis on the performer&rsquo;s voice, which may be considered the most fundamental, if not the basic sound instrument in Philippine theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voice as a fundamental sound element strongly suggests one distinctive function of sound and music in Philippine theater&mdash;to serve as communicative devices to connect with one or all of the following: a Supreme being or spiritual beings in the hope of winning favors, as in the case of indigenous harvest rituals and Christianized customs, or drive them away, as in the case of healing rituals; fellow performers as with spoken dialogues or songs, as in the case of the komedya, sinakulo, sarsuwela, bodabil, and other spoken plays and contemporary musicals and dance dramas; and audiences as in community-participatory activities, like the <strong>salidumay</strong> of the Cordilleras, and the spoken plays and musicals of contemporary theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound of the performer&rsquo;s voice is so vital that contemporary performances would require setting up modest to complex sound reinforcement systems. This is so in order to amplify the voices to cover a wider audience area and allow audiences to hear the performers better. Performers would be provided with handheld wired or wireless microphones that they would either carry around the stage or affix to microphone stands. For more flexibility, they may instead be provided with body-worn microphones with battery-powered radio pack transmitters commonly known as lapel or lavalier mics. In other setups, microphones are either positioned on the stage apron floor, hung just below the stage ceiling, or hidden within the set pieces situated on the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, some productions, as in the case of a sinakulo (Tiongson 1999c) and most especially school-based children&rsquo;s plays, would instead use playback prerecorded dialogue (previously stored on cassette tape, and today stored on recorded compact discs and laptop computers). Performers would then lip-synch over the recording, thus eliminating the need and use of microphones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In small venues, a pair of loudspeakers would ideally be set up on opposite corners of the performance area facing the audience, though it is fairly common as well that only a single loudspeaker is set up. These speakers are conventionally positioned close enough to the sources of sound activity, yet far enough from them to minimize audio feedback. In larger venues and better-funded productions, more complex loudspeaker cluster systems may be set up within and around the audience area. The complexity and availability of such systems and equipment would largely depend on the immediate need followed by the available (allowable) budget for the production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another function of sound and music that perhaps encompasses Philippine theater is to perform as symbolic indicators or markers to establish social roles, behaviors, time, setting, and physical happenings. In some indigenous rituals that celebrate a girl&rsquo;s first menstruation and onset of womanhood, the maiden is forced to keep her silence to symbolize the previously ideal submissive role of the woman in that society. War dances and rituals associated with the circumcision of young boys symbolizing their transition to manhood are performed with terrifying shrieks, screams, and shouts to remind the young men of their dominant roles as hunters, protectors, and guardians of their family and tribes (Fernandez 1996).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous performances may begin with the sound of gongs or the sound of the&nbsp;<em>budyong&nbsp;</em>(shell trumpet) (Fernandez 1996). The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> notably adapted the latter in the past. In all performance venues of the CCP, just before the theater house opened, the sound technician played a recording of the budyong. This was to signal that the theater house had opened and audiences were permitted to enter the premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A crucial sound aesthetic of the komedya is the live brass band, composed of 10-30 members led by a bandmaster. The band performs music such as the slow one-step grand <strong>martsa</strong> to establish the entrance of kings or sultans and their royal court, and the fast-paced <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso&nbsp;</strong><strong>doble</strong></a> to begin and accompany the batalya (Tiongson 1999b). It is fascinating to note that the choreographed sounds of clashing swords, made from either wood or metal, add excitement to the physical action of the <strong>batalya</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some traditional sinakulo would similarly incorporate the live brass band in their performances. In one documented performance in Malolos, Bulacan, the director blows a whistle to indicate which type of music is to be played when a character enters or exits. One whistle would signal a slow march; two whistles would signal a fast march. At the resurrection scene, sounds of live fireworks, thundering beats of the bass drum, and pebbles thrown onto the stage floor are heard as the door of Christ&rsquo;s tomb opens and the National Anthem is played (Tiongson 1999c).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third, if not most important function of sound and music in Philippine theater, is to influence participants, both performers and audiences, to feel the world they are experiencing at that specific moment. The special ability of sound to heighten feelings and emotions is perhaps what completes the participants&rsquo; theater experience and draws them deeper into the world of the performance. In the West, various specific conventions of sound and music have been developed and employed, and which Philippine local contemporary productions have eventually adapted and specifically required&mdash;namely, house music and/or ambience and curtain call, underscoring, and transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Music and environmental ambient sounds (e.g., of ocean waves, city sounds, crickets, chickens, dogs), used as house music or ambience, set the mood for the whole performance. In musical terminology, this is identified as the prelude. As a Western-defined convention, these types of music may have been evident in the sarsuwela, where the <strong>pasa calle</strong> and/or opening chorus begins the show and raises the curtains. Closing choruses meanwhile bring the curtains down (Fernandez 1996). House and curtain call music may have also been heard in the bodabil, where today&rsquo;s television variety shows are believed to have originated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary straight plays in English or the vernacular (drama) produced by commercial theater companies such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, as well as school-based theater groups such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, more often than not incorporate house and curtain call music in their productions. In Tanghalang Pilipino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pahimakas sa Isang Ahente</em></strong>, an adaptation by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a> of Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong>, produced in 2014, the sound designer featured industrial and construction sounds, such as drilling cement, truck engines, and cranes, as house ambience. In addition, such productions may also include music during the intermission, if at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Underscoring is commonly referred to nationally as background music, though today, live or recorded environmental ambient sounds can also very well function as such. It accompanies the action, and its general purpose is to highlight the mood or emotions of the moment. The term &ldquo;incidental music&rdquo; may also fall under this convention, but the term today can be quite misleading as it can connote that the music is chosen and treated as a superfluous element of the performance when in truth, sound and music used for the theater today should be very well thought out. Why was the sound chosen for the scene? What is its function? How is it to be heard in the space? Where is it coming from? What does it intend to convey?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locally, &ldquo;incidental music&rdquo; may include songs and instrumental tunes that function as dialogue or are inserted into the dialogue and actions. In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a>, the dialogue between the Birheng Maria and San Jose, on the one hand, and the houseowners, on the other, is initially sung to the accompaniment of a small band. The music connected to the song continues to underscore the holy couple as they travel through the barrio to find a place to stay. Notably, the underscore music in the panunuluyan also serves as a signal for the people to follow the holy couple along their journey. In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>, the &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; (Queen of Heaven, Rejoice) is often sung and underscores the action of the angel, played by a child, raising Mary&rsquo;s mourning veil (Tiongson 1992).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Palm Sunday, children dressed as angels sing the &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; to accompany the procession. A doleful song, usually an &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\">Ave Maria</a>,&rdquo; to commemorate Mary&rsquo;s solitude after the death of Christ (Fernandez 1996), underscores the soledad. In the bodabil, music or whistle and drum roll effects would have most likely accompanied dance acts, magic tricks, and stand-up comedy skits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies and theater groups mounting straight plays sometimes incorporate songs to emphasize or provoke a particular mood, setting, emotion, or ideology as witnessed especially in political plays. The Philippine National Anthem and similar songs of nationalistic nature were sneaked into the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a>, in 1902-7, the days when these songs were branded &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; by the American authorities. Similarly, songs of political importance&mdash;some of them popular songs with the lyrics revised to suit present issues, others traditional songs loaded with new signals, still others like &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">Bayan Ko</a>&rdquo; (My Country) seemingly able to express the politics of different eras&mdash;animate plays of protest in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (Fernandez 1996).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transitional music and environmental ambient sounds connect actions and scenes. Songs performed in the bodabil would sometimes act as transitional music between performances (Fernandez 1996). Transitions are evident especially in Philippine contemporary stage productions that mirror global trends in foreign films, stage productions, television, and YouTube. The production concept of Repertory Philippines&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong> in 2008, for example, was influenced by the movie <strong><em>Mad Max</em></strong> starring Mel Gibson. Instead of setting Shakespeare&rsquo;s play in the traditional English Renaissance palace court, the director chose to set it in a post-apocalyptic barren wasteland. The dramatic acts and scenes of the play were connected by what one critic described as an &ldquo;ethereal&rdquo; sound score, originally composed of a mix of recorded, MIDI-generated electronic drones, and digitally processed sound recordings of the&nbsp;<em>tungali</em>,&nbsp;<em>bungkaka</em>,&nbsp;<em>kubing</em>, and&nbsp;<em>gangsa</em>. The production was noteworthy from a sound point of view because of the technique of fusing the following elements: underscore and transitional ambient sound and music, performers actually performing selected sound cues over recorded sound, and localization of sounds to various speakers around the theater space. This technique created a &ldquo;surround&rdquo; soundscape that goes beyond the performing area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically required music and environmental ambient sounds are those written particularly for the performance. The songs written in sarsuwela, like <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), with libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and music composition by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>), and modern musicals fall under this category. Some of the most successful songs of the sarsuwela eventually assumed lives of their own and became popular hits, such as &ldquo;Nabasag ang Banga&rdquo; (The Clay Pot Broke) in 1917 from <strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong>, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\">Bituing Marikit</a>&rdquo; (Beautiful Star) in 1926 from <strong><em>Dakilang Punglo</em></strong> (Great Bullet) (Fernandez 1996).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolando Tinio described his literary work <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a></em></strong> (Reason Has Its Reason) as a drama of 18 scenes and 12 songs. In the play <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong>Ang Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</strong></a></em></strong> (The Trial of Old Serapio), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a> writes of distant voices and noises being heard offstage getting louder as the performers begin to enter the scene. Throughout the play, Dumol indicates in certain scenes how many gavel-knocking sounds are heard as well as when silences are of crucial importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The functions and conventions of theater sound and music enumerated here are not absolute of course and can very well overlap each other. Underscore music may also function as transition music and vice versa. A music used for intermission may in fact be indicated by a playwright in the play and thus be considered as specifically required music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some theater directors today have continued to boldly re-explore traditional theater forms and revitalize them in fresh and daring productions. In the process of revitalizing, experimentation and fusion of sound and music have taken place. In Dulaang UP&rsquo;s 2008 production of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s komedya <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira), selected Philippine indigenous instruments were combined with other indigenous instruments found around the world, a live band, and electronic music. The rich sound created is what Westerners may commonly call &ldquo;world fusion music.&rdquo; For us, the local audience, the music is simply contemporary Original Pilipino Music (OPM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PETA&rsquo;s longest-running musical to date, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, celebrates commercial OPM music in the context of a modern musical centered on contemporary Filipino issues in family and peer relationships, politics, and the environment. The music of the popular late 1990s band Aegis was given a funky new twist by the musical&rsquo;s musical director, thus attracting audiences of different ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The continuing trend of incorporating existing commercial music in plays and musicals, which sell tickets at the box office, not to mention the easy access to digital music, brings forth the complex issues of music copyright and clearances. Some professional Filipino playwrights, directors, producers, and commercial theater companies have taken extra effort to secure clearances for the &ldquo;pulled-out&rdquo; commercial music used in their productions. Still, securing clearances for pulled-out music for plays and musicals does not seem to be the norm across the nation due to the complicated and expensive costs these entail. As such, theater productions would rather have original music and soundscape compositions created by talented composers and sound artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diverse and complex nature of Philippine theater challenges today&rsquo;s Filipino sound practitioners to explore and examine further their art and craft&mdash;to redefine and challenge codified functions and conventions of sound and music in Philippine theater. While there has yet to be a scholarly publication on Philippine theater sound practices, this has not discouraged efforts of institutions, organizations, and individuals to educate individuals interested in theater sound. Schools with theater-related programs, such as the University of the Philippines and De La Salle&ndash;College of Saint Benilde, have opened courses in theater sound design. The Ateneo de Manila fine arts program in theater recently opened a course focused on musical theater. The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela offers a technical course in sound for general mass communication students. The Cultural Center of the Philippines offers occasional workshops in sound. Sinag Arts Foundation used to provide intensive and comprehensive workshops in sound. Sadly, Sinag Arts is now closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound and music in Philippine theater is superb and the processes vary considerably across forms and regions. The processes have also evolved with the times. It is now up to the current and future generations to develop and add to this rich sound culture.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3011\"><strong>Jethro Joaquin</strong></a></strong></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Abola, Exie. 2008. &ldquo;Brave New Bard.&rdquo; <em>The Philippine Star</em>, 7 Feb. http://dogberryexie.blogspot.com/2008/02/brave-new-bard.html.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bracewell, John L. 1993. <em>Sound Design in the Theatre</em>.

This is not surprising, as Philippine theater history is, after all, deeply rooted in and intertwined with countless musical forms and traditions and vice versa. But by the dawn of the 21st century, trends in globalization, technological advances, not to mention the growing tastes and listening expectations of audiences and theater practitioners, led to a reassessment of the nature, role, and function of sound and music in the theater. World theater scholars and practitioners would point out that instead of it being an afterthought, sound is and should be an integral part of the production concept. In addition, the proliferation of and accessibility to analog and digital sound systems brought about novel, exciting, and yet complex processes in sound and music production. Consequently, such discourses, processes, and technological developments paved the way for a &#x201C;new&#x201D; artistic and technical field to emerge in the Philippine contemporary theater scene&#x2014;sound design."

			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",

This is so in order to amplify the voices to cover a wider audience area and allow audiences to hear the performers better. Performers would be provided with handheld wired or wireless microphones that they would either carry around the stage or affix to microphone stands. For more flexibility, they may instead be provided with body-worn microphones with battery-powered radio pack transmitters commonly known as lapel or lavalier mics. In other setups, microphones are either positioned on the stage apron floor, hung just below the stage ceiling, or hidden within the set pieces situated on the stage."

These speakers are conventionally positioned close enough to the sources of sound activity, yet far enough from them to minimize audio feedback. In larger venues and better-funded productions, more complex loudspeaker cluster systems may be set up within and around the audience area. The complexity and availability of such systems and equipment would largely depend on the immediate need followed by the available (allowable) budget for the production."

In some indigenous rituals that celebrate a girl&#x2019;s first menstruation and onset of womanhood, the maiden is forced to keep her silence to symbolize the previously ideal submissive role of the woman in that society. War dances and rituals associated with the circumcision of young boys symbolizing their transition to manhood are performed with terrifying shrieks, screams, and shouts to remind the young men of their dominant roles as hunters, protectors, and guardians of their family and tribes (Fernandez 1996)."

In one documented performance in Malolos, Bulacan, the director blows a whistle to indicate which type of music is to be played when a character enters or exits. One whistle would signal a slow march; two whistles would signal a fast march. At the resurrection scene, sounds of live fireworks, thundering beats of the bass drum, and pebbles thrown onto the stage floor are heard as the door of Christ&#x2019;s tomb opens and the National Anthem is played (Tiongson 1999c)."

The special ability of sound to heighten feelings and emotions is perhaps what completes the participants&#x2019; theater experience and draws them deeper into the world of the performance. In the West, various specific conventions of sound and music have been developed and employed, and which Philippine local contemporary productions have eventually adapted and specifically required&#x2014;namely, house music and/or ambience and curtain call, underscoring, and transition."

Transitions are evident especially in Philippine contemporary stage productions that mirror global trends in foreign films, stage productions, television, and YouTube. The production concept of Repertory Philippines&#x2019;s <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong> in 2008, for example, was influenced by the movie <strong><em>Mad Max</em></strong> starring Mel Gibson. Instead of setting Shakespeare&#x2019;s play in the traditional English Renaissance palace court, the director chose to set it in a post-apocalyptic barren wasteland. The dramatic acts and scenes of the play were connected by what one critic described as an &#x201C;ethereal&#x201D; sound score, originally composed of a mix of recorded, MIDI-generated electronic drones, and digitally processed sound recordings of the&#xA0;<em>tungali</em>,&#xA0;<em>bungkaka</em>,&#xA0;<em>kubing</em>, and&#xA0;<em>gangsa</em>. The production was noteworthy from a sound point of view because of the technique of fusing the following elements: underscore and transitional ambient sound and music, performers actually performing selected sound cues over recorded sound, and localization of sounds to various speakers around the theater space. This technique created a &#x201C;surround&#x201D; soundscape that goes beyond the performing area."

Still, securing clearances for pulled-out music for plays and musicals does not seem to be the norm across the nation due to the complicated and expensive costs these entail.

While there has yet to be a scholarly publication on Philippine theater sound practices, this has not discouraged efforts of institutions, organizations, and individuals to educate individuals interested in theater sound. Schools with theater-related programs, such as the University of the Philippines and De La Salle&#x2013;College of Saint Benilde, have opened courses in theater sound design. The Ateneo de Manila fine arts program in theater recently opened a course focused on musical theater. The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela offers a technical course in sound for general mass communication students. The Cultural Center of the Philippines offers occasional workshops in sound.

A young man learned by watching a war dance, and then by participation, which is the training method itself. Young girls may train as apprentice dancers, then go on to minor roles and eventually to dancing lead roles&mdash;and then to teaching others.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In folk theater, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> actors are first told how to perform their roles by directors, and eventually become directors, who train younger members of the community in their jobs. Even the little girls who &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> know about the role from having watched their predecessors. The directors, once actors, learn about direction from having been at the receiving end. In community theater, it is largely the same, although one or the other member may receive some training at a school or workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In campus theater, there is more steady opportunity: a theater group with a season or at least a schedule; a director-teacher who may teach classes, conduct workshops, or teach within the process of rehearsing and staging a play. Although formerly it was the English teacher who was expected to direct drama groups, such directors now usually have some training before or after assuming the role.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>All the above are largely the practices of nonprofessional theater. The beginnings of professional training are found in the schools with theater programs. Currently, the University of the Philippines (UP), Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), De La Salle University&ndash;College of Saint Benilde (DLSU-CSB), Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), and Mindanao State University (MSU) offer a full bachelor of arts program in theater arts. Colleges and universities like the Philippine Normal University (PNU) in Manila, PNU in Lopez (Quezon), Naga College Foundation, Bicol University, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> offer bachelor of arts (BA) in speech and drama and/or theater arts programs. The Assumption College in Makati, Bulacan State University, and Centro Escolar University (CEU) offer BA in communication, major in theater arts or performing arts. Arellano University and Liceo de Cagayan University in Misamis Oriental offer BA in performing arts and literature, while the University of Santo Tomas (UST) gives their students training in musical theater. Some universities also offer certificates in theater arts and diplomas in creative and performing musical arts, like the UP College of Arts and Letters and College of Music, respectively. The PNU also offers a certificate in speech and theater arts. Graduate studies in theater arts are being offered by the UP Diliman through their master of arts in theater arts, and PNU, through their master of education in drama education and theater arts and MA in education with specialization in drama education and theater arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine High School for the Arts in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, offers courses in theater arts: acting, stagecraft, stage and production management, directing, history, and theory. A theater student presents a production as a graduation requirement. The program invites applicants nationwide, and they are screened by a committee of administrators and theater professionals. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2913\">Dulaang Sipat Lawin</a> is the official PHSA theater group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, and more frequently, there are theater seminars and workshops. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3144\">Palihang </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>, established in 1974, sought to provide playwrights with training and experience in the production of their plays. The process was divided into three phases. The first phase comprised the workshop, where experienced writers and directors spoke on various aspects of drama, and academics provided guidance through the reading of different types of plays. The second phase was the competition proper, where the workshop participants wrote their plays and the winners were chosen. The third was the production phase, where the winning plays were assigned to theater groups for staging, involving the playwright in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> has regular summer workshops in theater arts open to all. These include basic theater arts (history of Philippine theater, basic theater philosophies, exercises in acting and directing); the basic integrated theater arts workshop; creative writing, creative drama, body movement, dance, visual arts, and music; specialized workshops (acting, directing, playwriting, technical, production, and stage management); and advanced workshops and special courses (people&rsquo;s theater, puppetry). All PETA training programs reflect its philosophy of theater as education, as artistic expression, as art for the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation, Inc (BKFI)</a> has a four-year practical course in theater first guided by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2956\">Joonee Gamboa</a> as teacher and artistic director. A workshop is integrated into actual production work of different types of plays. The group averages three productions a year, and after completion of the four-year course, the participant can become a full-fledged member of UHAY, the professional BKFI repertory group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1990s, film and theater director <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a> conducted theater workshops for SINING, whose members come from various communities in Metro Manila. Workshops usually culminate in theater productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other individual and theater groups&mdash;such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> Center for Dramatic Arts, CCP Outreach Program,<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\"> Repertory Philippines</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro&nbsp;Pilipino</a>&mdash;and cultural networks, such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2751\">Arts Research and Training Institute in Southern Tagalog Inc (ARTIST Inc)</a> and Teatro <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3331\">Umalohokan</a> in Southern Tagalog, BANAAG-Dungog in the Visayas, KAFI-MPC and Educational Discipline in Culture and Arts for Development and Services Inc&ndash;Mindanao Center for People&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Culture&nbsp;</em>in Mindanao, F-CAN in Negros, and BUGKOS also offer workshops for members and prospective members on a fairly regular basis. The latter networks, PETA, and other groups, such as Tambisan sa Sining, Tanghalang Silangan, and SILAB and Dulampasigan, all engaged in workers&rsquo; theater, also conduct sectoral training, to help nonschool and non-theater groups (e.g., peasants, workers, street children, prostitutes, out-of-school youth, women, victims of violence) develop theater as a vehicle of expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3361\">Virgin Labfest</a> was conceptualized and realized in 2005 as a playwrights&rsquo; festival. This festival was organized by the Writers Bloc, then headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> then headed by its former artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2969\">Herbie Go</a>. The festival aims to develop, workshop, and eventually produce untested, unpublished, and unstaged plays written by both seasoned and emerging playwrights in the country. The festival has already produced two anthologies of plays. Playwrights submit their script to the organizing committee. Once accepted, they undergo a series of workshops organized by the Writers Bloc. Together with the chosen director, the playwright is expected to learn from the various stages of writing a play&mdash;from drama composition, staged reading, rehearsals, up to the performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occasionally, the United States Information Service, Goethe-Institut, and the British Council invite directors/teachers from the United States, Germany, and England respectively to lecture and/or teach; occasionally there are grants or scholarships for training courses abroad, short or long. Some of the foreign directors/teachers have had considerable impact on the training of Philippine actors and directors, among them Brooks Jones and Alex Moncleart, and especially <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2788\">Fritz Bennewitz</a>, who directed Brecht in Filipino translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2002, the University of the Philippines Center for International Studies (UPCIS), in partnership with the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas</a>, invited Japanese masters to help stage <strong><em>Kanjincho</em></strong>, a kabuki play. Staged in 2003, directors <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3065\">Tony Mabesa</a> and Amparo Adelina Umali III worked with the kabuki costume master Minoru Matsumoto, Japanese traditional music master Takinojo Mochizuki, and buyo master Toyohiro Fujima. Since then, the UPCIS has continued toprovide venues for Filipinos to train and perform Asian performance traditions. At present, the members of the UPCIS Noh and Bunraku ensembles receive training from Japanese masters like the Noh master for shite Naohiko Umewaka through face-to-face or virtual classes online. The UPCIS also offers the elective course Global Studies 197, covering special topics like the Japanese traditional performance practice and Asian performance practice to introduce Japan&rsquo;s Noh and bunraku, Indian&rsquo;s bharata natyam, Indonesia&rsquo;sJavanese dances, and the komedya of San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, among other theater traditions in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also some publications on theater arts training. The <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/698\"><strong><em>Bitaw: Basic Integrated Theater Arts Workshop</em></strong></a>, 1989, is the first work published in the PETA workshop manual series. The manual features a syllabus for the five-day basic integrated theater arts workshop. Juilliard School alumna <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3053\">Ana Valdes-Lim</a> authored <strong><em>Workshop: A Manual on Acting</em></strong>, 1997, published by Anvil Publishing. The University of the Philippines Press published Edgardo Bengson de la Cruz&rsquo;s <strong><em>Directing for Theater: A Personal Approach</em></strong> in 2005. ARTIST Inc has also published instructional materials and has developed courses, such as Likhandula (Improvisation in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">Performance Art</a>), Malikhaingguro (Heritage-Based Pedagogy for Teachers), Mandudula (Directing and Playwriting), Tanghal-himig (Music Theater), Galawkoryo (Creative Dance and Movement), Dulambata (Children&rsquo;s Theater), Sanaysanay (Trainors&rsquo; Training), Sinopsining (Arts Management), and Tagpograpiya (Production Design).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training in the theater has thus grown from exposure, apprenticeship, and school theatricals to seminars, workshops, courses, and training programs, some foreign, but mostly local and aimed at theater as art and as expression. A professional stage has been reached by the Tanghalang Pilipino Actor&rsquo;s Company at the CCP, in which five actors who train (acting, voice, movement) and act (lead and minor roles) full time are funded (salaries and expenses) so that they need not hold other jobs as most local actors do. The most active and widespread stage training has been attained by people&rsquo;s theater groups, which take theater into active duty in communities of many types and concerns as an instrument for change. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

		"text": "<p>Conventionally, translation refers to the rendition of a foreign play into a Philippine language while adaptation implies a full contextualization that makes all aspects of its production characteristically Filipino. However, the Philippines being a multicultural nation of multiple languages, it is necessary to rework an original play in one language into the national language or any of the other languages throughout the archipelago. Adaptation could also mean the conversion of literary works (e.g., epics, folktales, stories, novels) or historical texts (e.g., biographies, autobiographies) into performances on stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the earliest translations of dramatic works to enter Philippine literary consciousness were those published between 1880 and 1883 by Jose Felipe del Pan in his newspaper <strong><em>La Oceania Espa&ntilde;ola</em></strong>. Along with works by Spanish playwrights Calderon de la Barca and Lope de Vega, he published, in Spanish translation, Pierre Corneille&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Cid</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>Polinto</strong></em>; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Fausto</strong></em>; Moliere&rsquo;s <strong><em>La Hipocrita</em></strong>; Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s <strong><em>Los Bandidos</em></strong>; and William Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Mercader de Venecia</em></strong> (<strong><em>The Merchant of Venice</em></strong>), <strong><em>Otelo</em></strong> (<strong><em>Othello</em></strong>), and&nbsp;<em><strong>Vida y Muerte del Rey Ricardo III</strong> </em>(<strong><em>Richard III</em></strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest adaptations would certainly be the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, which turned the metrical romances from Spain first into verse narratives for the Filipino called&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido</em>&mdash;for example, <strong><em>Doce Pares de Francia</em></strong> (Twelve Peers of France) and <strong><em>Don Juan Ti&ntilde;oso</em></strong> &mdash;and then into plays for fiesta stages. Many awit have their corresponding komedya, such as <strong><em>Haring&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Villarba</em></strong> (King Villarba) and even the famous <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Florante&nbsp;</strong></strong>at Laura</em></strong></a> (Florante and Laura). A prominent example would be the Pampango <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/550\"><strong><em>Comedia Heroica de la Conquista de&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Granada o</em></strong><strong><em>sea Vida de Don Gonzalo de&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Cordoba Llamado el Gran Capitan</em></strong></a> (Heroic Play on the Conquest of Granada or the Life of Gonzalo de Cordoba Called the Great Captain) by Fr Anselmo Jorge de Fajardo. The life of Gonzalo de Cordoba, a general in the service of Queen Isabela, inspired this, the longest known komedya (832 pages; 31,000 lines), the most famous in Pampanga, even if it was known to have been staged only once (February 1831, in Bacolor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s novels, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em>Noli Me Tangere</em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not) and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong><em>El Filibusterismo</em></strong></a> (Subversion), have been and continue to be adapted into plays. Some early ones were <strong><em>Ginoong Pasta</em></strong> (Mr Pasta), 1916, by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3215\">Jose Maria Rivera</a>; <strong><em>Suyuan sa Isang Azotea</em></strong> (Courtship on a Balcony), 1928, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>; and <strong><em>Ang mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ni <strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong></em></strong> (The Children of Sisa), 1931, originally written in Spanish by Francisco Varona and Ramon Torres, and translated by Godofredo Herrera.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Other translations in those early years include <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> translations of <strong><em>La Viuda Alegre</em></strong> (Ang Balong Masaya), <strong><em>Sue&ntilde;o de un Vals</em></strong> (Ang Pangarap na Bals), <strong><em><strong>Lucia</strong> de Lammermoor</em></strong>, <strong><em>La Traviata</em></strong>, and other operas and operettas from Europe. During the Japanese occupation, with the prohibition of plays in English, translations into Tagalog of W.W. Jacobs&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Monkey&rsquo;s Paw</em></strong>, Lillian Hellman&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Little Foxes</em></strong>, and Noel Coward&rsquo;s <strong><em>Private Lives</em></strong>, were staged, and notably Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong>, in a translation by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5655\">Francisco Rodrigo</a> so good that it was restaged at the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> in 1989 and 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of translation and adaptation went into high gear in the 1960s. The years of Philippine theater in English, brought about by the educational system instituted by the American insular government, had resulted in vernacular theater being confined to provincial stages, being forbidden in schools and confined to community folk stages. Because of the resulting break between the language onstage and that of the audience, theater in English was patronized by small, school-based, or urban audiences, and lost the crowds of townsfolk, farmers, fishers, vendors, children, and housewives who had patronized folk theater. Soon theater visionaries realized that the lack of growth in English language theater was not due to &ldquo;inadequate education,&rdquo; as some directors thought, but to the need for a language that would reach the audiences and express Philippine life in the tones and talk of everyday.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1965, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a> staged, in a parish in Balic-Balic, Tondo, <strong><em>Doon Po sa Amin</em></strong>, his adaptation of Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s <strong><em>Our Town</em></strong>. The change was not only in the language but also in the transmutation into Philippine life. Grover&rsquo;s Corners became Barrio San Roque, the newspaper editor the high school principal, the milkman a&nbsp;<em>pan de sal</em>/<em>kesong puti&nbsp;</em>(salt bread/white cheese) vendor, and the baseball-playing hero the town&rsquo;s basketball star. <strong><em>Doon Po sa Amin</em></strong> has played repeatedly in schools and on other stages, showing that the language and the transformation had indeed &ldquo;domesticated&rdquo; the American play. Many years later, Pagsanghan adapted <strong><em>The Fantasticks</em></strong> into his lyrical and long-running <strong><em>Sinta</em></strong>, 1973, which in turn was adapted for film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando S. Tinio</a>, on the other hand, decided at about the same time that translation into Tagalog/Filipino could bring to a larger audience the masterpieces of the Western stage. Beginning with <strong><em>Laruang Kristal</em></strong>, his translation of Tennessee Williams&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></strong>, he successfully translated and staged such plays as August Strindberg&rsquo;s <strong><em>Miss Julie</em></strong>, Henrik Ibsen&rsquo;s <strong><em>An Enemy of the People</em></strong>, and Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong> &mdash;all in the late 1960s. He later institutionalized this faith by forming <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a>, a theater group (1975-92) for which he translated and directed a distinguished roster of European, British, and American plays, like Carlo Goldoni&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Fan</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Mistress of the Inn</em></strong>; Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, <strong><em>As You Like It</em></strong>, <strong><em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em></strong>, <strong><em>Twelfth Night</em></strong>, and <strong><em>The Merchant of Venice</em></strong>; Anton Chekhov&rsquo;s <strong><em>Uncle Vanya</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Seagull</em></strong>; Albert Camus&rsquo;s <strong><em>Caligula</em></strong>; Max Frisch&rsquo;s <strong><em>Andorra</em></strong>; Alexei Arbuzov&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Promise</em></strong>; John van Druten&rsquo;s <strong><em>I Am a Camera</em></strong>; George Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s <strong><em>Arms and the Man</em></strong>; Ibsen&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Hedda Gabler</strong> </em>; Sophocles&rsquo;s <strong><em>Oedipus Rex</em></strong> and <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong>; Plautus&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Menaechmi</em></strong>; Moliere&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Miser</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>Tartuffe</strong> </em>; Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em></strong>; Alexander Dumas&rsquo;s <strong><em>Camille</em></strong>; Gerhart Hauptman&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Weavers</em></strong>; and Pierre Beaumarchais&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Barber of Seville</em></strong>. In some seasons, plays like <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong> were performed in both English and Filipino by the same cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tinio&rsquo;s work is based on a belief in &ldquo;the effectiveness of the classics in developing the national language as the language of the Philippine performing arts,&rdquo; and the wish to &ldquo;enrich the national language through translations of drama masterpieces.&rdquo; It has resulted not only in a roster of world drama in Filipino translation but also in debates on strategies and techniques of translation, and on what should and should not be translated, which have enriched the theater as well as the craft and practice of translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The translation and adaptation of foreign plays have since been found by many writers and theater groups to be effective ways to bring foreign plays from East and West into the Philippine theater audiences&rsquo; experience, understanding, and lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> began its life with a translation: <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/517\"><strong><em><strong>Bayani</strong>ng Huwad</em></strong></a>, 1967, a translation into Tagalog by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5675\">Wilfredo Sanchez</a> of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Straw Patriot</em></strong>. In those early years, before it had developed a pool of playwrights, translations and adaptations trained its writers, artists, artisans, and audiences. Among the productions were <strong><em>Everyman</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Tao</em></strong>), Nikolai Gogol&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Inspector General</em></strong> (<strong><em>Inspektor Heneral</em></strong>), Friedrich Drrenmatt&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Visit</em></strong> (<strong><em>Do&ntilde;a Clara</em></strong>), and Eugene Ionesco&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bald Soprano</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Tatay Mong Kalbo</em></strong>), all 1970; Brecht&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Good Woman of Setzuan</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Butihing Babae ng Setzuan</em></strong>), 1971; and Sophocles&rsquo;s <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong>, 1975. Even in later years, when its repertoire was dominated by original plays, translations continued to enrich its seasons, among them: <strong><em>Sa Tabi ng Pasig</em></strong>, 1973, a translation of Rizal&rsquo;s <strong><em>Junto al Pasig</em></strong>; <strong><em><strong>Flores</strong> para los Muertos</em></strong>, 1977, Williams&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em></strong>;&nbsp;<em><strong>Ang Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</strong></em>, 1977, Brecht&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Caucasian Chalk&nbsp;</em><em>Circle</em></strong> set in Mindanao; <strong><em>Ang Buhay ni Galileo</em></strong>, 1981, Brecht&rsquo;s <strong><em>Galileo</em></strong>; Shakespeare&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Macbeth</strong></em>, 1984;&nbsp;<em><strong>Nasa Puso ang Amerika</strong> </em>, 1984, an adaptation/translation of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1688\"><strong><em>America Is in the Heart</em></strong></a>; <strong><em><strong>Halik</strong></em></strong><strong><em>ng Tarantula</em></strong>, 1989, Manuel Puig&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kiss of&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>the Spider&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Woman</em></strong>; and <strong><em>Casa de Bernarda Alba</em></strong>, 1990, Federico Garcia Lorca&rsquo;s <strong><em>House&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>of</em></strong> <em><strong>Bernarda Alba</strong> </em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campus theater has used translations and adaptations as ways of teaching student/university audiences about world drama, as training for drama groups, and as interlanguage work for teachers. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>, of the Ateneo de Manila High School, has staged Shakespeare (e.g., <strong><em>Julius Caesar</em></strong>) both in English and in translation. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, of the college department, has staged Robert Bolt&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Man for All Seasons</em></strong> (translated by Ricardo Saludo, 1984), and Jean Anouilh&rsquo;s <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong> (translated by Jose Bernard Capino, 1993), in both languages. In 2013, the Tanghalang Ateneo did an adaptation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></strong> by combining an early 20th-century translation in the traditional awit form by G.D. Roke (1901) and Rolando Tinio&rsquo;s more contemporary rendition. The love story is set in a Muslim community called Sampurna.

Rolando S. Tinio has translated the greatest number of plays, all of them performed first by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3296\">Teatro Filipino</a>; even when this closed, he went on translating opera and drama.

All the above work was done largely for the benefit of the Filipino audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reverse direction has also been followed: the translation of Filipino plays into English for audiences abroad. Tony Perez, for example, translated his own <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong><em>Biyaheng Timog</em></strong></a> into English as <strong><em>A Small Matter of Sacrifice</em></strong>, for production by a group of Filipinos in New York. His <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/521\"><strong>Bombita</strong></a></em></strong> and Rene O. Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/558\"><strong>Hiblang Abo</strong></a></em></strong> (Strands of Gray) were translated by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G. Fernandez</a> at the request of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2923\">Tony Espejo</a>, who took them to a drama festival in the United States. Chris Millado&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong><em>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</em></strong></a> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major) was translated by Fernandez for a seminar on Philippine literature in translation at the University of Michigan. Tiongson translated his sarsuwela <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907) into English for its performance at Kennedy Theatre in the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1989 and at the University Theatre in Cal State Hayward in California in 1995. <strong><em>Modern&nbsp;</em><em>ASEAN Plays</em></strong>, 1992, collects English translations of such contemporary dramas as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/666\"><strong><em>Ang Sistema ni Propesor Tuko</em></strong></a> (Professor Gecko&rsquo;s Way), Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hiblang Abo</em></strong> (Strands of Gray), Tony Perez&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/651\"><strong>Sa North Diversion Road</strong></a></em></strong> (On the North Diversion Road), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a> &rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/573\"><strong><em>Juan Tamban</em></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater groups from the regions also translated or adapted foreign plays into their regional languages. These translations or adaptations gave them the opportunity not only to use their own languages but also to interpret the plays based on their cultural, social, and historical contexts. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3310\">Theater Arts Guild of the UP College of Iloilo</a> has, from 1975 to the mid-1980s, translated and/or adapted foreign works into Hiligaynon, such as <strong><em>Do&ntilde;a Clara</em></strong>, a Hiligaynon adaptation of <strong><em>The Visit</em></strong>; <strong><em>Ang&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Babayi sa Espejo</em></strong>, a stage adaptation of <strong><em>Sins of the Mother</em></strong>; <strong><em>Amahl</em></strong>, a stage adaptation of <strong><em>Amahl and the Night Visitors</em></strong>; <strong><em>Ang mga Pagpasimpalad ni Don Quixote</em></strong>, a Hiligaynon adaptation of <strong><em>Man of La Mancha</em></strong>; <strong><em>Ang Pilason</em></strong>, a Hiligaynon translation of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds); <strong><em>Ang Kapid</em></strong>, a Hiligaynon adaptation of <strong><em>Menaechmi</em></strong>; and <strong><em>Hacienda Roces</em></strong>, a Hiligaynon adaptation of <strong><em>The Cherry Orchard</em></strong>. Other theater groups that translated or adapted foreign plays into their languages are <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3088\">Maskara Theater Ensemble</a>, which mounted <strong><em>Godo, Wer W8ng por U</em></strong>, 2007, an adaptation of Beckett&rsquo;s <strong><em>Waiting for Godot</em></strong>, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2868\">Dagway Sigmahanon</a>, which presented <strong><em>Damgo sa Gab-i sa Tunga Sang Tingadlaw</em></strong>, 2013, an adaptation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the translations, whether staged or not, were anthologized and published. The publication of translated plays may be due to the translators&rsquo; desire to make the translation available for theater groups who may wish to mount the translated plays as well as for academic use, not only of theater arts majors but also of classes in creative writing, translation studies, and literary studies. Some of the published theater studies and anthologies that contain translations include Felicidad M. Mendoza&rsquo;s <strong><em>The (Comedia) Moro-Moro Re-visited</em></strong>, 1976; Nick Joaquin&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Complete <strong>Poems</strong> and Plays of Jose Rizal</em></strong>, 1976; Wilhelmina Q. Ramas&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sugbuanon Theater from Sotto to Rodriguez to Kabahar: An Introduction to an Anthology of Sugbuanon <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></em></strong>, 1982; Ramas, Filonila M.

However, the Philippines being a multicultural nation of multiple languages, it is necessary to rework an original play in one language into the national language or any of the other languages throughout the archipelago. Adaptation could also mean the conversion of literary works (e.g., epics, folktales, stories, novels) or historical texts (e.g., biographies, autobiographies) into performances on stage."

The years of Philippine theater in English, brought about by the educational system instituted by the American insular government, had resulted in vernacular theater being confined to provincial stages, being forbidden in schools and confined to community folk stages. Because of the resulting break between the language onstage and that of the audience, theater in English was patronized by small, school-based, or urban audiences, and lost the crowds of townsfolk, farmers, fishers, vendors, children, and housewives who had patronized folk theater. Soon theater visionaries realized that the lack of growth in English language theater was not due to &#x201C;inadequate education,&#x201D; as some directors thought, but to the need for a language that would reach the audiences and express Philippine life in the tones and talk of everyday."
