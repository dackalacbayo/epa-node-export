His story is retold by Filipino-American Fred Tinawid through the memory of his grandfather, Gramps Alfredo, a migrant worker in the United States (US) from Ilocos. In act 1, Dean Worcester and Gen Clarence Edwards are introduced as representatives of the US Philippine Commission looking for &ldquo;specimens&rdquo; for the 1904 Saint Louis Exposition of US colonies. German scientist Prof Gustavo Niederlein shows he has a pure heart for the natives while members of the Philippine Exhibit Committee, Dr Leon Ma. Guerrero and Pedro Paterno, express their opposition to sending tribal folks to Missouri. Christianized Bontoc chief Antonio accepts America&rsquo;s offer to the Igorot community to show off their dog-eating tradition for a fee of 380 dollars per month. More than the promise of wealth, Bulan is enticed to &ldquo;do something great&rdquo; by reaching a faraway land. On board the boat going to America, Bulan quickly learns English, and meets Antonio and the kind Prof Niederlein. During their travel by sea, Bulan&rsquo;s wife, Momayon, dies of smallpox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 presents the events in the June fair that features the Philippine Exposition. Pres Theodore Roosevelt declares that America loves Filipinos, yet does not recognize Bulan as a leader. Paterno resigns from his post in protest against the discrimination toward the natives, while Worcester lectures that self-reconstruction is the key to acceptance in the imperial land. As seasons pass, Antonio and his tribe become popular as the &ldquo;savages&rdquo; who need to be civilized. Observing the growing disillusionment of Bulan, Fred shares his thoughts about the Filipino natives&rsquo; loss of identity. In one show, Bulan trades off his Magani dress and head scarf for Salvation Army rags. Meanwhile, he develops a close friendship with Maude, the fat lady of the circus. By December, the fair closes and the colonial natives are told to head home. However, Bulan jumps ship to pursue his love for Maude and his dream in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 3, the exploits of Worcester in the Cordilleras are exposed in the editorial &ldquo;Aves de Rapi&ntilde;a&rdquo; (Birds of Prey) in <strong><em>El Renacimiento</em></strong>, 1908. Without documents chronicling what happens to Bulan thereafter, Fred imagines Bulan&rsquo;s life post-fair, including his acceptance to the circus as Madam Maude&rsquo;s prop in the act &ldquo;Madam Maude and Her Apeman.&rdquo; Later, she dumps him when the show is no longer popular and as racism heightens. For 10 years, Bulan bravely travels across the foreign land alone; reduced from a chief to a pauper. Alfredo feels Bulan&rsquo;s hardship as he shares his own story as a young migrant laborer. Alfredo would also encounter the old Niederlein who confesses that it was a great mistake to uproot the natives. Niederlein hands him Bulan&rsquo;s head scarf in hopes that it will be returned to the chief for his &ldquo;reconstruction.&rdquo; By 1935, Quezon&rsquo;s Repatriation Act mandates the &ldquo;free&rdquo; return of Filipino natives to their homeland. Alfredo, who now heads the labor union in Seattle, convinces the crowd of Filipinos to take advantage of the act. But they fear the possibility of being forbidden to reenter the United States. On the other hand, Bulan, who is in the crowd, looks up to the horizon hoping to be repatriated. Alfredo recognizes him as the Bagobo chief whom Niederlein was searching for. He then hands him his head scarf, symbol of nobility and bravery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play reexamines the American &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; to the Philippines. While it presents a tragic experience of a native chief who genuinely desires greatness for his people during the American occupation, it also shows the people&rsquo;s resiliency and strong determination to create their identity as a self-reliant homeland. The play provides insights into the prevailing Filipino diaspora, as well as the Filipino nationalism amidst colonial/slave mentality. While the straight play was, for Quintos, &ldquo;political, issue-oriented, even didactic,&rdquo; the musical, according to Cortez, takes on a more &ldquo;intimate, more human approach. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Joanna Lerio and Carlo Pacolor Garcia</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Guerrero</a> Theater in UP Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This puppet play derives its story from a Leyte folktale. Abadeja is an orphan whose father, Abac, married the wicked Concha, who has two daughters, Conchinita and Conchiching. Envious of her beauty, Abadeja&rsquo;s stepfamily make life difficult for her, giving her impossible tasks and threatening her with banishment. However, with the help of a magical fish-friend, she performs wondrous feats. The stepsisters capture the magical fish and cook it. When Abadeja sadly buries its remains, a magical lady appears and gives her a colorful cock, which soon suffers the fate of the fish. The lady assures Abadeja that if she buries the cock&rsquo;s feathers and feet, and waters the spot on the third day, a wonderful gift awaits her. At this point she meets a handsome man, who introduces himself as Itoy, but is actually Principe Destrito (Prince Destrito) of the royal family. They fall in love. The buried remains of the cock bloom into a jewel-bearing tree. Only Abadeja can pluck the jewels, and only to help the poor or needy. When she impulsively picks a ring and gives it to Itoy, he suffers from a painful swollen finger, because the ring was meant for other purposes. Hari Destro (King Destro) and Reyna Destra (Queen Destra) are told by a&nbsp;<em>herbolaryo&nbsp;</em>(native healer) that only a lady with a pure, loving heart can get the ring off. The royal family visits every household, seeking that woman, and finally come to Abac&rsquo;s house. Concha presents her daughters, who cannot remove the ring. When Abadeja is presented, she and Itoy recognize each other. Abadeja removes the ring, curing the prince&rsquo;s finger instantly. The king and queen ordain that they should be married, and rule the kingdom. The magical lady scolds Abac for having neglected his daughter and given her to the abuse of his wife. Abac turns on his wife and daughters, who beg forgiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play, which now forms part of the repertoire of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a>, is one of the first in the country to tell a folktale through puppets. It inspired the movement to reorient the values of Filipino children through the use of folklore as theater.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Malou L.

				"value": "This puppet play derives its story from a Leyte folktale. Abadeja is an orphan whose father, Abac, married the wicked Concha, who has two daughters, Conchinita and Conchiching. Envious of her beauty, Abadeja&#x2019;s stepfamily make life difficult for her, giving her impossible tasks and threatening her with banishment. However, with the help of a magical fish-friend, she performs wondrous feats. The stepsisters capture the magical fish and cook it. When Abadeja sadly buries its remains, a magical lady appears and gives her a colorful cock, which soon suffers the fate of the fish. The lady assures Abadeja that if she buries the cock&#x2019;s feathers and feet, and waters the spot on the third day, a wonderful gift awaits her. At this point she meets a handsome man, who introduces himself as Itoy, but is actually Principe Destrito (Prince Destrito) of the royal family. They fall in love. The buried remains of the cock bloom into a jewel-bearing tree. Only Abadeja can pluck the jewels, and only to help the poor or needy. When she impulsively picks a ring and gives it to Itoy, he suffers from a painful swollen finger, because the ring was meant for other purposes. Hari Destro (King Destro) and Reyna Destra (Queen Destra) are told by a&#xA0;<em>herbolaryo&#xA0;</em>(native healer) that only a lady with a pure, loving heart can get the ring off. The royal family visits every household, seeking that woman, and finally come to Abac&#x2019;s house. Concha presents her daughters, who cannot remove the ring. When Abadeja is presented, she and Itoy recognize each other. Abadeja removes the ring, curing the prince&#x2019;s finger instantly. The king and queen ordain that they should be married, and rule the kingdom. The magical lady scolds Abac for having neglected his daughter and given her to the abuse of his wife. Abac turns on his wife and daughters, who beg forgiveness."

For a few times, the production was played in actual government offices. Tanghalang Pilipino restaged the play at the CCP in 1998 and 2002. In 2003, the outreach program of the CCP commissioned translations of the play into several regional languages&mdash;such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, and Hiligaynon&mdash;and mounted productions in major cities in the regions for regional theater groups. The production inspired a CCP radio program, and was turned to a film with the same title in 2011, with Dennis Marasigan also as director.

The judge enters using the back entrance. The last to enter is Cely who is late because she got stuck in the elevator of the building. That same day, Cely&rsquo;s remarkable speed, skill, and acumen in handling two cases&mdash;an extrajudicial case of child support and a pretrial case of dissolution of conjugal property&mdash;mark her as a force that would cut the &ldquo;extra income&rdquo; of the office. Bok, who has been spying on her, explodes because the family court&rsquo;s new hearing officer refuses to accept &ldquo;envelopes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 opens with a confrontation scene between Bok and Cely. Bok deliberately misplaces Cely&rsquo;s decision papers on the Claveria adoption case. With its location unknown, the messenger timely arrives to pick up the papers. The conflict escalates when the senior lawyer Ric strongly advises Cely to approve a marriage annulment case. Ric had already accepted three goats and a promise of bigger rewards should the annulment be granted by the court. Cely declares she cannot circumvent the law in this case. With tensions reaching the boiling point and the Claveria decision papers still missing, an internal meeting of the office staff with the judge is called. Cely thinks Charing and May would testify to the irregularities and anomalies going on in the office, but in the meeting the employees remain silent.

The friar sits beside Felixberta, the daughter of Bernabela, on the pretext of teaching her the catechism. When he tries to take advantage of her, the girl becomes apprehensive. &ldquo;Marry someone rich and good-looking like me,&rdquo; the priest says, &ldquo;and not that coarse and stupid Kalatiyo who does not even know how to pray.&rdquo; Felixberta answers: &ldquo;What good shall money and wealth bring if I become enslaved to them? I shall be happier with a poor man who can give me peace.&rdquo; The priest is furious. He gives her 10 minutes to decide. Felixberta refuses him and he threatens to kill her. The priest forces her to submit. A scuffle ensues and the girl stabs him in the chest. The assistant comes in, sees the dead priest and runs out. Bernabela rushes in, and asks: &ldquo;My child, why have you tampered with God&rsquo;s emissary?&rdquo; Felixberta, fearless and composed, replies: &ldquo;It is not his priesthood that I avenged, but his iniquity &hellip; For his profligacy on our Filipino women, he has proved himself to be the antithesis of Christ&mdash;the Anti-Cristo!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play was probably not staged at the time it was written, for its performance would have cost Nuyda his life and property. Albay was then still under the power and influence of the Spanish&nbsp;<em>frailes&nbsp;</em>(friars). The play was discovered only when research was conducted by the UP System Integrated Research Program on <strong><em>Philippine Drama: Twelve Plays in Six Philippine Languages</em></strong>, 1987.

The friar sits beside Felixberta, the daughter of Bernabela, on the pretext of teaching her the catechism. When he tries to take advantage of her, the girl becomes apprehensive. &#x201C;Marry someone rich and good-looking like me,&#x201D; the priest says, &#x201C;and not that coarse and stupid Kalatiyo who does not even know how to pray.&#x201D; Felixberta answers: &#x201C;What good shall money and wealth bring if I become enslaved to them? I shall be happier with a poor man who can give me peace.&#x201D; The priest is furious. He gives her 10 minutes to decide. Felixberta refuses him and he threatens to kill her. The priest forces her to submit. A scuffle ensues and the girl stabs him in the chest. The assistant comes in, sees the dead priest and runs out. Bernabela rushes in, and asks: &#x201C;My child, why have you tampered with God&#x2019;s emissary?&#x201D; Felixberta, fearless and composed, replies: &#x201C;It is not his priesthood that I avenged, but his iniquity &#x2026; For his profligacy on our Filipino women, he has proved himself to be the antithesis of Christ&#x2014;the Anti-Cristo!&#x201D;"

It was also published in <strong><em>Floy Quintos: Collected Plays Volume 2</em></strong>, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 1, Gia Almonte, a movie star, arrives at the de la Rama residence in Gagalangin, Tondo, and is welcomed by Rene and Eveng. Gia is set to interview Atang de la Rama&mdash;the &ldquo;Queen of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\">Kundiman</a>&rdquo;&mdash;as part of her research for the biopic on Atang. Wary of Gia&rsquo;s intentions, Atang asks her to report on what she has researched so far. Gia narrates the beginnings of Atang as a theater artist, living with her older sister Pastora and brother-in-law Leon Ignacio, the composer and librettist of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3235\">Compa&ntilde;ia de Zarzuela Ylagan</a>. Atang is convinced of Gia&rsquo;s sincerity but uncertain about her vocal capacity to sing&nbsp;<em>kundiman&nbsp;</em>(love songs). At the age of 14, Hermogenes Ylagan already gave Atang the title role in the <strong><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), which had more than 1,000 performances all over the country and abroad. Atang recounts that after her performance in Japan, she was introduced to Gen Artemio Ricarte who went on self-exile to Japan after the defeat of the Philippine Revolution. Ricarte complements Atang&rsquo;s performance with pronouncements on how their aspirations for the country have not ended in vain. Atang, feeling tired, bids Gia goodbye. Gia leaves but with a lighthearted threat of coming back the following week.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 opens with Atang giving instructions to Gia on how to present her as a Filipina. They go through the script of the film project, particularly the sequence on a reception where Pres Manuel L. Quezon, Deogracias Rosario, and Jose Corazon de Jesus aka Huseng Sisiw were in attendance. Atang makes an attempt to dismiss the gossips about her past relationships. Atang and Gia talk about the sequence where a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>balagtasan</strong></a> (debate done in verse) is performed. Atang recollects how after her initial meeting with Amado Hernandez, the <strong>lakandiwa</strong> or moderator, he started sending her roses and poems, gradually winning her heart. Atang recounts their wedding day and how their married life eventually became routinary. To perk things up, Atang proposes a duet with Katy de la Cruz, the leading <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> artist during the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When her artistic career was already waning in the 1940s, Atang was introduced to the workers&rsquo; movement headed by Amado and his friends. Amado was arrested in 1951 and she describes their relationship during the time of his incarceration up until he was given a parole in 1956, and was under probation until 1964. She also recounts smuggling out of prison Amado&rsquo;s seminal works, such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1847\"><strong>Bayang </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></strong></em></strong> (A Free Country), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1882\"><strong>Isang Dipang Langit</strong></a></em></strong> (A Stretch of Sky), <strong><em><strong>Luha</strong> ng Buwaya</em></strong> (Crocodile&rsquo;s Tears), and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1750\"><strong>Mga Ibong Mandaragit</strong></a></em></strong> (Birds of Prey). She closes with an account of how Amado died in her arms in 1970. In the end, Atang pleads with Gia not to continue with the project because an artist needs to maintain her mystery. She urges Gia to create her own story and mystery instead. Atang asks Gia to sing another song for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An homage to Honorata &ldquo;Atang&rdquo; de la Rama, <strong><em>Atang</em></strong> introduces the life and times of this National Artist for music and theater to new audiences. The play also philosophizes on how an artist should view one&rsquo;s craft. The play revived new interest in songs made popular by de la Rama, such as &ldquo;Nabasag ang Banga&rdquo; (The Clay Pot Broke), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\">Bituing Marikit</a>&rdquo; (Beautiful Star), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/933\">Madaling Araw</a>&rdquo; (Dawn), &ldquo;Masayang Dalaga&rdquo; (Happy Maiden), &ldquo;Magkano ang Bibingka Mo?&rdquo; (How Much Is Your Rice Cake?), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">Bayan Ko</a>&rdquo; (My Country), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/960\">Nasaan Ka Irog</a>&rdquo; (Where Are You, Beloved?), and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\">Pakiusap</a>&rdquo; (Plea); and a bodabil song popularized by Katy de la Cruz, titled &ldquo;Mamang Gusting&rdquo; (Mr Gusting). Hernandez&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Kitang Dalawa&rdquo; (The Two of Us), with musical arrangement by de Guzman, served as the thematic music of the play. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Erick Dasig <strong>Aguila</strong>r</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The owner of the gay parlor, Naomi, and lover David are playing cards as the TV blasts away the final notes of the Philippine National Anthem. Jonathan, Naomi&rsquo;s houseboy and parlor assistant, enters, carrying bottles of beer. Their exchange reveals that David provides companionship for Naomi in exchange for money and things like tricycle parts and a Swiss Army knife. After a few exchanges of unfriendly banter, Naomi instructs Jonathan to buy&nbsp;<em>isaw&nbsp;</em>(grilled chicken or pork intestines) to go with the beer. Jonathan reluctantly exits. Naomi reveals that Jonathan has agreed to work for him to pay for the family&rsquo;s debt. Jonathan returns with the food. Naomi leaves to take a bath, recalling that David prefers &ldquo;women-smelling&rdquo; partners. During Naomi&rsquo;s absence, David starts seducing Jonathan. The seduction ends abruptly when Naomi returns. Naomi drinks his beer and asks for the newspaper that Jonathan is holding. Jonathan proceeds to stack towels, while Naomi reads to David a news article about an old man whose penis has been cut off. Before he finishes reading the article, Naomi collapses. From there, it is revealed that David and Jonathan are lovers, and that they have planned to drug Naomi with a strong dose of Baclofen and steal all of the parlor-owner&rsquo;s money. As they recount the specific details of their plan, Jonathan confronts David about the latter&rsquo;s fear of being identified as gay, as well as his inability to stand up for himself and their relationship. Naomi suddenly wakes up and, to his surprise, David pulls out his Swiss Army knife and stabs Naomi to death. David and Jonathan resume their argument. Jonathan insists on sticking to the initial plan that he would leave first to get Naomi&rsquo;s money. Vehemently rejecting this suggestion, David soon realizes that Jonathan actually intends to leave him for good after they have split the money. The argument escalates into a brawl, knocking over the parlor&rsquo;s manicure set. The much bigger David overpowers Jonathan. David pulls out his Swiss Army knife and is about to stab Jonathan, but he hesitates and cries, saying that he cannot kill him. David hugs Jonathan, crying. Jonathan comforts him, but slowly pulls out a nail pusher that he has picked up from the manicure set and repeatedly stabs David&rsquo;s nape until he dies.

Ana</a> for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Ensemble</a> in 2005.

Guerrero</a> Theater, UP Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From the last decades of the 19th century to the first decades of the 20th, Basilia Tantoco and the other women of Malolos struggle to assert themselves against two patriarchal overlords: the&nbsp;<em>panginoong puti&nbsp;</em>(white overlord) and the&nbsp;<em>panginoong kayumanggi&nbsp;</em>(brown overlord). Politicized by the reformists of Malolos, Basilia and her&nbsp;<em>barkada&nbsp;</em>(friendly gang) of female relatives successfully push for the opening of a school where they could learn Spanish, and in secret meet to discuss political ideas and actions. Gov-Gen Valeriano Weyler favors the school, but the friars of Malolos and Basilia&rsquo;s arrogant Spanish suitor Leon Lorenzo Tuells&mdash;representing the religious and secular authorities of the colony and the patriarchy&mdash;do all they can to suppress what they correctly read as an antifriar move. However, the women get support from the reformists of Malolos, Basilia&rsquo;s maid Ikang (a battered wife), the maestro de Latinidad Teodoro Sandico, and the latter&rsquo;s friend and townmate Miguel Maglaya. Basilia and Miguel fall in love. But the crafty Leon manages to have Miguel put in jail while the friars close down the womens&rsquo;s school after Sandico narrowly escapes arrest. Miguel eventually escapes and joins Bonifacio&rsquo;s forces when the revolution breaks out. Separated from her beloved, Basilia, who by now has joined her father and brothers in the Katipunan, and her remaining barkada devote themselves to helping the Katipuneros in Bulacan by sending arms, food, clothes, and messages to the battlefields. When the revolutionary government is transferred to Malolos, Basilia and Miguel are reunited and finally decide to get married, after having known each other for 10 years. Meanwhile, the Philippine-American war has begun and the Americans are slowly advancing toward Malolos. Basilia and the remaining women, mostly those who were not yet married, help to establish the first Cruz Roja (Red Cross) and serve in its hospitals. Miguel, now a general, oversees the evacuation of civilians from Pulo and is shot at the back by a Macabebe. He recovers, and the wedding pushes through with Pres and Mrs Emilio Aguinaldo as principal sponsors. But just before Basilia and Miguel are pronounced man and wife, a woman named Narcisa Dizon introduces herself as Miguel&rsquo;s wife. Confronted by Aguinaldo, Miguel admits the truth. Basilia slaps him, and the president strips him of his rank. Traumatized by the betrayal of the panginoong kayumanggi, Basilia and her friends, now with Narcisa, continue to work for the welfare of all women, rich and poor. In 1906, the Malolos branch of the Asociacion Feminista Filipina is inaugurated in the house of Basilia, who, with her friends, recruited 264 members, making the Malolos group the largest in the country. Even when most of the women have become preoccupied with their respective families, Basilia and the new members of the local women&rsquo;s organization spearhead the opening of the first puericulture center to give medical and psychological support to poor mothers and children of Malolos. And because the American educational system is doing all it can to Westernize the values and tastes of Filipinos, Basilia opens her own Escuela Catolica de Malolos, a school for children that will stand for Filipino ideals. For the rest of her life, Basilia commits herself to protect and advance the rights and welfare of women of all classes. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3206\">Jerry C.

Ningning then reveals that her father was a logger who was accidentally killed by a falling tree. Aya comments that Roemart is just a sad child playfully inventing stories. Ningning responds that they, too, invent stories so they must be just as sad as Roemart. Aya says it is better to invent stories because it keeps them from despair.

First staged at the Bulwagang Gantimpala of the <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> on 27-30 Jun and 4-7 Jul 1985. Since its first staging up until the publication of the script, the play already had more than 40 performances at the CCP and other venues. It came to print in Noriega&rsquo;s third collection of plays, titled <strong><em>Bongbong at Kris</em></strong>/<strong><em><strong>Batang Pro</strong></em></strong> (Bongbong and Kris/Child Prostitute), 1987. The play was adapted to film by Lito Casaje, co-written with Noriega, in 1999 with the following cast: Gerald Madrid, Marcus Madrigal, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4313\">Ana Capri</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play encompasses the three years of friendship between three child prostitutes: Nado, a battered child sold by his father to a Mr Gelber, a German pedophile and clubhouse owner; Ricky, a slum dweller who serves as a pimp; and Milet, a victim of sexual abuse by her stepfather. The play starts as Nado and Ricky watch a blazing fire engulf a nearby building. They wait for Milet, who went out with Nado&rsquo;s guardian. Nado narrates how he became Mr Gelber&rsquo;s ward. Milet arrives, tells them her harrowing first experience, and is about to break down but Ricky tells her to just chew it all up with a bubble gum. The next time they meet, Milet is dressed as a schoolgirl. Nado makes fun of her look, while they wait for Ricky, who went inside a building to blackmail an office manager who is fond of Milet. Ricky enters saying that he was given only a few bucks. Nado narrates the abuses he suffers in the hands of Mr Gelber. He says that whenever he does something &ldquo;wrong,&rdquo; Mr Gelber would beat him and make him sleep inside the cage of his dog named Rizal. Ricky wants to study electronics and plans to go to Saudi so he could help his mother and siblings. But Ricky&rsquo;s mother dies from an abortion. His money is all spent. Nado arrives and tells them that he has run away from Mr Gelber. He tells Ricky and Milet that he has also killed Rizal and taken money from Mr Gelber. He needs a place to stay. Ricky refuses him at first but gives in on the condition that Nado should contribute his share of the expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After a time, Nado and Ricky celebrate the former&rsquo;s birthday. They hear news that Mr Gelber is now based in Cebu and decide to tip the police on him. Milet returns and narrates her experiences in Japan as the three of them wait for the Manila Zoo gates to open. Nado and Ricky talk about their escapades as prostitutes. Milet leaves for a while and returns after learning that her elephant friend already died of cold. Months after, Milet becomes pregnant. Ricky tells her how shameful it is for her to continue prostituting herself while she is pregnant. She accuses Ricky of impregnating her. Nado decides to return to Quezon upon hearing news of Mr Gelber&rsquo;s release from jail. Milet expresses her desire to go with Nado as they talk of their waning career as prostitutes. Ricky decides to go back to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a year, Nado and Milet talk on how they were able to kill Mr Gelber. Milet, after musing on her wasted life, asks Nado to stab her with the knife she used to kill Mr Gelber. Nado, at first refuses, but in the end stabs Milet and throws her body into the waves of Manila Bay. In the end, Ricky boasts that he started a fire at the school he enrolled at and from where he learned nothing. Ricky and Nado admire the blazing fires and call for stronger winds to come. They comment on how Milet&rsquo;s death did not even come close to reaching the tabloid newspapers. Their lives mean nothing to society. Nado decides to burn himself in the fires Ricky started. Nado says farewell and runs into the fire. Ricky, alone now, cheers Nado on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This searing play on the lives of three child prostitutes of Manila and their no-holds-barred dialogue is an eye opener. The play was awarded second prize in the full-length play in Filipino category of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> in 1983. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Erick Dasig <strong>Aguila</strong>r</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The play starts as Nado and Ricky watch a blazing fire engulf a nearby building. They wait for Milet, who went out with Nado&#x2019;s guardian. Nado narrates how he became Mr Gelber&#x2019;s ward. Milet arrives, tells them her harrowing first experience, and is about to break down but Ricky tells her to just chew it all up with a bubble gum. The next time they meet, Milet is dressed as a schoolgirl. Nado makes fun of her look, while they wait for Ricky, who went inside a building to blackmail an office manager who is fond of Milet. Ricky enters saying that he was given only a few bucks. Nado narrates the abuses he suffers in the hands of Mr Gelber. He says that whenever he does something &#x201C;wrong,&#x201D; Mr Gelber would beat him and make him sleep inside the cage of his dog named Rizal. Ricky wants to study electronics and plans to go to Saudi so he could help his mother and siblings. But Ricky&#x2019;s mother dies from an abortion. His money is all spent. Nado arrives and tells them that he has run away from Mr Gelber. He tells Ricky and Milet that he has also killed Rizal and taken money from Mr Gelber. He needs a place to stay. Ricky refuses him at first but gives in on the condition that Nado should contribute his share of the expenses."

In the end, Ricky boasts that he started a fire at the school he enrolled at and from where he learned nothing. Ricky and Nado admire the blazing fires and call for stronger winds to come.

They are headed south to Bicol to attend the funeral of their father, an authoritarian patriarch of an old landed family. They stop several times and remount the vehicles, in different groupings, revealing the many relationships and background of each character. Clarita Valle, the eldest, travels with her husband Tito Razon, whom she married only because of her father&rsquo;s wishes. The man she really loved committed suicide on the day of her wedding, and she has not forgiven herself or Tito since. Geoffrey Valle is a well-meaning but spineless character, brutalized by his father, henpecked by his wife Nona, and largely ignored by his son Andre. Paul Valle, the only gentle, kind, and understanding member of the family, has remained that way because he managed to escape from his father into a seminary. Sylvia Valle is still unmarried, and often insults her suitor, Nona&rsquo;s brother, Cyril, because she cannot get over the trauma of almost being raped by her own father, and because she has fallen in love with her brother-in-law, Tito. Brenold Valle tried to prevent the rape of Sylvia, and since then he has not been able to relate to women normally, but instead would take care of younger men whom he often hurt physically and emotionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon arrival at the ancestral house, and at the funeral, each of the Valles finally confronts the principal nightmare of their lives, and buries with their father the traumas, prejudices, the constraints that had warped or destroyed their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As they travel back to Manila, and as they watch a fire caused by a vehicular accident, each of them is resurrected as a person, now able to fully shape his or her own life. Clarita decides to separate from Tito, whom she has never loved, and whom she now hates after he maneuvered to buy off all the lands that the father left Geoffrey. Geoffrey has inherited only the old santos to Nona&rsquo;s chagrin but now has money to go to the States. Paul forgives his girlfriend Cherry, whose insecurity had made her seduce Brenold. Sylvia now despises Tito for what he has done and decides to try a relationship with Cyril, on condition that there would be no physical contact between them. Brenold has decided to stop taking in strangers into his life and consents to take care of his nephew Andre, when Geoffrey and Nona leave for the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Biyaheng Timog</em></strong> is one of the best examples of realism in Philippine theater.

Brenold Valle tried to prevent the rape of Sylvia, and since then he has not been able to relate to women normally, but instead would take care of younger men whom he often hurt physically and emotionally."

The play was commissioned by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> Coordinating Center for Dramatic Arts in 1988 and was first staged by Tanghalang Filipino on 14-25 Nov at the Tanghalang Huseng Batute of the CCP. The script was published as <strong><em>Botong: Alay at Alaala</em></strong> (Botong: Offering and Memory), 1989, and was included in Villanueva&rsquo;s collected plays titled <strong><em>Apat na Dula</em></strong> (Four Plays), 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the prologue, Botong and Angono&rsquo;s patron saint San Clemente meet on the clouds over the mountains of Angono. San Clemente reveals that Botong is one of the dead. Botong, unwilling to accept his fate, asks for a one-day reprieve so he could create his last masterpiece. San Clemente grants this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mountains of Angono, overlooking the town, act 1 opens with Botong meeting his childhood friend and a public school teacher Ebo in the afterlife. Ebo worries about his unfinished duties as a teacher. Botong tells Ebo about a portal near one of the caves where every soul in the afterlife would eventually pass through. Botong reveals he could only go through the portal in peace if his Musa (muse) inspires him to finish another mural. Ebo decides to pass through the portal only after Botong does so. Then, Botong meets his Musa and asks why she chose him, and taught him to love art. Instead of a direct response, Musa lets him interact with his three&nbsp;<em>kababata&nbsp;</em>(childhood friend), thus recreating the time when his passion for art took root. Botong resents Musa&rsquo;s interference with the pace and direction of his life. Then, Genghis Khan materializes and challenges Botong, saying that he can leave the mountain and the afterlife, and proceed to Hollywood to make another film. As Genghis Khan tries to convince Botong to leave with him, two&nbsp;<em>higantes&nbsp;</em>(giants) appear. Countering Genghis Khan&rsquo;s appeal for Botong to leave, they tell Botong that he does not need the attractions of Tinseltown because he is fated to become a National Artist. Botong maintains that he must finish his last work first. He asks the two higantes if they could bring him to the town so he could see his family once more, but they do not have the power to get him out of the mountain. While Botong sulks, Nene, his real muse and wife, comes to him. Nene blurts out her deepest hurts to Botong&mdash;that art stole away her love and chance at happiness. Botong defends art as a passion that he cannot do without. With no common ground between them, Nene leaves him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 opens with Ebo confiding to Botong of his decision to pass through after realizing that he has lived a full life. Botong and Ebo are joined by three of their&nbsp;<em>kababaryo&nbsp;</em>(town mates). Botong&rsquo;s deep appreciation for the ordinary and the folk, as well as the value of artifacts and heritage, is revealed in their exchange. Saddened by Ebo&rsquo;s departure, Botong then meets two Apostoles (Apostles) in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>. Later, the Dalaga (single woman) enters and narrates how she died of pneumonia and of love at a young age. With the thought of being unloved, she decides to pass through. Botong marvels at her unwavering decision. After Botong asks for the Apostoles&rsquo; company, they reveal that he cannot leave the mountain. Juan Tamad, the last character he encounters, inspires him to recognize the virtue of patience through his &ldquo;<em>aral ng bayabas</em>&rdquo; (lesson of the guava). Juan is not just a lazy fool after all. The play ends with Ebo and Botong meeting each other again in another realm, the so-called paradise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Botong</em></strong> is a tribute to a cultural icon, renowned muralist, and National Artist for painting <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a> from Angono, Rizal. The play is memorable because it lives up to the artistic challenge of portraying an artist&rsquo;s life. Villanueva incorporates the discourse of culture&mdash;the ordinary folk as bearers of art, artifact, and history&mdash;through Botong&rsquo;s interaction with his town mates who were fishermen and farmers. Through the appearance of various characters, Villanueva was able to articulate the power of art as counter-memory to much of history and art&rsquo;s excesses. The play won third prize in the full-length play category, Filipino division, of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> in 1989. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\">Luna Sicat-Cleto</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

Botong and Ebo are joined by three of their&#xA0;<em>kababaryo&#xA0;</em>(town mates). Botong&#x2019;s deep appreciation for the ordinary and the folk, as well as the value of artifacts and heritage, is revealed in their exchange. Saddened by Ebo&#x2019;s departure, Botong then meets two Apostoles (Apostles) in the <a href=\"/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>. Later, the Dalaga (single woman) enters and narrates how she died of pneumonia and of love at a young age. With the thought of being unloved, she decides to pass through. Botong marvels at her unwavering decision. After Botong asks for the Apostoles&#x2019; company, they reveal that he cannot leave the mountain. Juan Tamad, the last character he encounters, inspires him to recognize the virtue of patience through his &#x201C;<em>aral ng bayabas</em>&#x201D; (lesson of the guava). Juan is not just a lazy fool after all. The play ends with Ebo and Botong meeting each other again in another realm, the so-called paradise."

The play is memorable because it lives up to the artistic challenge of portraying an artist&#x2019;s life. Villanueva incorporates the discourse of culture&#x2014;the ordinary folk as bearers of art, artifact, and history&#x2014;through Botong&#x2019;s interaction with his town mates who were fishermen and farmers. Through the appearance of various characters, Villanueva was able to articulate the power of art as counter-memory to much of history and art&#x2019;s excesses.

Tomas favors the capitan for the prestige the union would give him; Serapia is inclined toward Tiama, the Chinese, who offers gifts.

The play was based on the report on 19th-century prostitutes written by Efren Isorena in a graduate class of Milagros Guerrero, as well as research on the same topic during the American period by Luis Dery. The play was presented together with a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a> work in a twin bill titled <strong><em>Baligtaran: Dalawang Dula ukol sa Kasarian</em></strong> (Two-sided: Two Gender Plays), which was the initial offering of PETA Kalinangan Ensemble&rsquo;s 25th major season.

Magdalena, a prostitute with a golden heart, serves as the narrator of the play and comments on the stories of the other characters. Clara, the secondary narrator, is used to washing clothes for a living until she is pimped by a Chinese named Sytuco. She pretends to be a mute. Maria, a former&nbsp;<em>cigarrera&nbsp;</em>(cigar factory worker), works in a<em>casa</em>(brothel) after meeting Ramon, an official. She has been imprisoned a number of times. Juanita dreams of becoming a <strong>sarsuwelista</strong> (sarsuwela actress), but instead, becomes a kept woman of a rich and powerful man, Don Pedro. She is imprisoned when Don Pedro&rsquo;s jealous wife learns about the infidelity. Leonarda is a&nbsp;<em>criada&nbsp;</em>(servant) charged with being a prostitute when she is caught late one night wandering the streets in search of Miguel, her lover, who is a Katipunero. The characters narrate their varied stories with common experiences of oppression and suggest how they are constrained by social constructs&mdash;<em>mujer publica&nbsp;</em>(public woman),&nbsp;<em>indocumentada&nbsp;</em>(undocumented),&nbsp;<em>prostituta&nbsp;</em>(prostitute),&nbsp;<em>vagamunda&nbsp;</em>(vagabond),&nbsp;<em>dama de noche&nbsp;</em>(woman of the night), prostitute, call girl,&nbsp;<em>puta&nbsp;</em>(bitch), and even their opposite,&nbsp;<em>virgen&nbsp;</em>(virgin)&mdash;and other labels used by society to evaluate and judge women. The play is not just about the individual narratives of the victimized women nor is it just about prostitution; rather, it is a reexamination of the misogynist language that permits and perpetuates the oppression of women. The play ends with a ritual that celebrates women&rsquo;s capacity to define their own destiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play weaves into the narrative various intertexts to highlight the myriad forms and contexts of women&rsquo;s subjugation. For example, the work plays around with the names Maria and Clara to draw into the narrative Rizal&rsquo;s famous character, Maria Clara, who has been a symbol of women particularly in the 19th century&mdash;timid, submissive, prayerful, frail&mdash;while stressing that these images were true only for the privileged and not among the lower class. Leonarda&rsquo;s character who was mistaken for a prostitute for just wandering the streets calls to mind <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5218\">Modesto de Castro</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1823\"><strong>Urbana at Feliza</strong></a></em></strong> (Urbana and Feliza), which discourages women to leave their homes without chaperones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Damas de Noche</em></strong> goes from the Spanish period to the American period but also traverses within various times and spaces&mdash;the presence of American military bases in the country, the time when Ermita replaced Binondo as the &ldquo;red-light district,&rdquo; and the indefinite period of women&rsquo;s rituals&mdash;thereby highlighting women&rsquo;s continuous struggles throughout Philippine history. Each historical period is defined by the sound and music, as well as dance and movements using indigenous, traditional, and modern idioms and styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This play contributes to the increasing body of feminist plays, and specifically calls attention to the centrality of language in women&rsquo;s struggle for freedom.

Santos</a>, Jaime Yambao, Lawrence Espinosa, Edward Baluyut, Rico Gutierrez, Arjay Avisado, Gines Enriquez, Aristotle Bancale, Cora Lopez, Dante Bantatua, and Alex Parane. First staged by the UP Playwrights&rsquo; Theatre on 17 Sep 1991 at the Faculty Center Studio, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prologue shows the Director lying dead on the beach, his genitals cut off by unknown killers. In Act 1, a&nbsp;<em>ballet de court&nbsp;</em>uses clashing music and stylized movements to depict a chessgame between the white forces on stage and the red forces offstage (supposedly the audience itself). The white forces are led by the power brokers of the social hierarchy composed of pope, bishop, baron, general, and queen and their respective pawns who execute their orders to protect and strengthen the hierarchy. But one white pawn transforms into a red knight, and then into a red queen. The Director shouts &ldquo;Cut.&rdquo; The Director is happy with the rehearsal of the dance that will be filmed and intercut with realistic scenes of his new anti-establishment film. The Director is a communist who rails against the abuses of capitalists and believes the church is a fascist institution. He is also a gay man who pays for sex from male prostitutes or strangers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 opens with the Director and the Teenager, a male prostitute, conversing while drinking wine on the beach. The young man left his father, a fisherman, and family to become an actor. Strangely, because both the Director and the Teenager are rebels against the establishment, a bond is formed between them.

In Act 1, a&#xA0;<em>ballet de court&#xA0;</em>uses clashing music and stylized movements to depict a chessgame between the white forces on stage and the red forces offstage (supposedly the audience itself). The white forces are led by the power brokers of the social hierarchy composed of pope, bishop, baron, general, and queen and their respective pawns who execute their orders to protect and strengthen the hierarchy. But one white pawn transforms into a red knight, and then into a red queen. The Director shouts &#x201C;Cut.&#x201D; The Director is happy with the rehearsal of the dance that will be filmed and intercut with realistic scenes of his new anti-establishment film. The Director is a communist who rails against the abuses of capitalists and believes the church is a fascist institution. He is also a gay man who pays for sex from male prostitutes or strangers."

As he waits, he recalls his experiences as a closeted gay through a series of flashbacks and monologues. His recollections are textured by the story and music of Walt Disney&rsquo;s animated film <strong><em>The Little Mermaid</em></strong>.

Their initial encounter progresses into a five-year domestic partnership. While the double and his partner Ding bicker about issues like financial dependence and emotional intimacy, the double describes their relationship as a relatively peaceful one. The relationship crumbles the moment Ding expresses that he wants to have a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; family life with a wife and children&mdash;a desire that he believes the double will not understand as the latter is not a straight man.

It was restaged as one of three revisited plays for Virgin Labfest 6 in 2010, and was drafted to be part of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>&rsquo;s 25th theater season titled Eyeball: New Visions in Philippine Theater in 2012, a selection of plays from the Virgin Labfest at the CCP Tanghalang <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play is set in Boy Pogi&rsquo;s house, which is found in the slums beside a polluted river. Jess, a doctor, has come to speak to his cousin Boy Pogi about the coming elections. Jess tries to convince Boy Pogi not to run against him, promising to institute changes when he becomes mayor and to employ Boy Pogi himself. Jess invokes their childhood memories to get Boy Pogi to decide in his favor. Boy Pogi responds with bitterness, reminding Jess of how the latter had abandoned Boy Pogi and the community as a whole. Jess gives Boy Pogi a new fishing line and hook, because he remembers how they both used to fish there as kids. Boy Pogi refers to the river in front of them, now dirty and unproductive.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As they talk and reminisce, they are interrupted every so often by Boy Pogi&rsquo;s family members. Boy Pogi&rsquo;s father is revealed to have been sleeping in one of the boats docked to the side of the house. Boy Pogi&rsquo;s wife Elsa enters to bring them drinks, asks Jess to stay for lunch then disappears to take a bath. Boy Pogi&rsquo;s mother, Mang, arrives from selling fish sauce in the market, and reminds Jess of how he had ignored her once, but all has been forgiven. These interruptions remind Boy Pogi of Jess&rsquo;s other sins against his family and community. Boy Pogi&rsquo;s anger escalates. He shifts between being bullied by Jess to being the bully himself. It then dawns on Jess that Boy Pogi is just a nuisance candidate. Jess offers Boy Pogi cash to drop his candidacy. Boy Pogi says Jess need not pay him off and asks instead that Jess bring his wife and kids to spend a day with Boy Pogi&rsquo;s family. Jess makes excuses saying his wife Margaret is busy with work and his kids need to go with him on the campaign trail. Boy Pogi turns glum, accusing Jess of thinking so little of him. He then takes his old fishing hook and gouges out Jess&rsquo;s eye. Jess tries to fight back but is overpowered by Boy Pogi. Jess pleads for his life. Boy Pogi sneers and says Margaret won&rsquo;t even look at him now. Jess screams. Boy Pogi says no one will bother about the screams of a stranger in this corner of his community. Boy Pogi then strangles Jess with the fishing line. Once Jess is dead, Boy Pogi&rsquo;s family starts stepping out from the shadows, all in on the planned murder. It is revealed that the mastermind is the mayor, Jess&rsquo;s political rival. The mayor was certain that Jess would be forced to seek out Boy Pogi the moment the latter&rsquo;s name popped up as a candidate. Pang, Mang, and Elsa all give the dead Jess a kick to get back at him for his sins to them as family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play creates a world of wretchedness which de-romanticizes poverty by showing its filth not only in the set design but in the language the play utilizes, full of cuss words that characterize the everyday conversation of Boy Pogi&rsquo;s social class. The play won first prize in the one-act play in Filipino category of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Awards for Literature</a> in 2009. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Katrina Stuart Santiago</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Jess tries to convince Boy Pogi not to run against him, promising to institute changes when he becomes mayor and to employ Boy Pogi himself. Jess invokes their childhood memories to get Boy Pogi to decide in his favor. Boy Pogi responds with bitterness, reminding Jess of how the latter had abandoned Boy Pogi and the community as a whole. Jess gives Boy Pogi a new fishing line and hook, because he remembers how they both used to fish there as kids. Boy Pogi refers to the river in front of them, now dirty and unproductive."

Boy Pogi&#x2019;s wife Elsa enters to bring them drinks, asks Jess to stay for lunch then disappears to take a bath. Boy Pogi&#x2019;s mother, Mang, arrives from selling fish sauce in the market, and reminds Jess of how he had ignored her once, but all has been forgiven. These interruptions remind Boy Pogi of Jess&#x2019;s other sins against his family and community. Boy Pogi&#x2019;s anger escalates. He shifts between being bullied by Jess to being the bully himself. It then dawns on Jess that Boy Pogi is just a nuisance candidate. Jess offers Boy Pogi cash to drop his candidacy. Boy Pogi says Jess need not pay him off and asks instead that Jess bring his wife and kids to spend a day with Boy Pogi&#x2019;s family. Jess makes excuses saying his wife Margaret is busy with work and his kids need to go with him on the campaign trail. Boy Pogi turns glum, accusing Jess of thinking so little of him. He then takes his old fishing hook and gouges out Jess&#x2019;s eye. Jess tries to fight back but is overpowered by Boy Pogi. Jess pleads for his life. Boy Pogi sneers and says Margaret won&#x2019;t even look at him now. Jess screams. Boy Pogi says no one will bother about the screams of a stranger in this corner of his community. Boy Pogi then strangles Jess with the fishing line. Once Jess is dead, Boy Pogi&#x2019;s family starts stepping out from the shadows, all in on the planned murder. It is revealed that the mastermind is the mayor, Jess&#x2019;s political rival. The mayor was certain that Jess would be forced to seek out Boy Pogi the moment the latter&#x2019;s name popped up as a candidate. Pang, Mang, and Elsa all give the dead Jess a kick to get back at him for his sins to them as family."

First staged by the University of the Philippines (UP) Playwrights&rsquo; Theater on 4 May 2011 at the Teatro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2998\">Hermogenes Ylagan</a> of UP Diliman, the play was restaged in Aug 2011 as part of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>&rsquo;s 36th theater season. It was published in <strong><em>Floy Quintos: Collected Plays Volume 2</em></strong>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 1 begins with Miguel arriving at the Mountain of Revelations, accompanied by Lobo. Miguel is looking for Sister Emily, a miracle woman known to be a medium of the Virgin Mary. Miguel shares his doubts about Sister Emily&rsquo;s miracles and his desire to reveal the woman as a hoax. Lobo reminisces about his life as a poster boy for the fake Tasaday tribe. They encounter a group of disappointed pilgrims because Sister Emily could not make the Virgin appear. Just as another group of pilgrims pass, Miguel calls out to Lobo who vanishes within the forest. Miguel sees George, a foreigner with a gout-like affliction who is looking for Sister Emily, the miracle worker featured in the documentary. Lobo returns and leads Miguel and George to Sister Emily. She reveals that the Virgin has stopped talking to her and will never come back. The group argues about Sister Emily being a fraud and the country being a &ldquo;country of fakes.&rdquo; Then, just as the air smells of roses, petals start to rain. George&rsquo;s affliction is healed. A rosebud materializes from Sister Emily&rsquo;s chest and she faints. George takes the rosebud and hands it to Miguel who rejects it and leaves. Sister Emily asks Lobo and George to pray for Miguel so that he may find something that he believes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 2, Miguel visits the home of Jose Marco, a historian and antiquarian, residing in Pontevedra, Negros. Miguel is led inside the house by Concepcion, Jose Marco&rsquo;s wife. As Concepcion asks Miguel about how the outside world talks about her husband and his work, a young Miguel enters. This glimpse of the past, shows how Jose Marco filled the young Miguel&rsquo;s head with fiction passed off as historical facts&mdash;the Code of Kalantiao, an indigenous Filipino penal code; and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong><em>La Loba Negra</em></strong></a> or the Black She-Wolf, a governor-general&rsquo;s lady-turned-rebel who kills Spanish friars. In exchange for the stories and some historical trinkets, the young Miguel would give Jose Marco old paper and rubber stamp imprints he gets from his family&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>baul&nbsp;</em>(vault). Jose Marco and young Miguel enjoy this bond, as they call themselves &ldquo;<em>mambubulok</em>&rdquo; or collectors of old useless things&mdash;seekers of lost treasures. This bond is put to the test with the arrival of William Henry Scott, an American professor from the University of Santo Tomas. Scott, under the guise of doing a dissertation, interviews Jose Marco on the Code of Kalantiao. The young Miguel arrives in the middle of Jose Marco&rsquo;s interrogation and realizes that all of his stories were fakes. Jose Marco pleads with Scott not to expose his fraud and insists that what he did was for the good of his country, providing hope and a sense of pride. Before leaving, Scott stresses the importance of exposing truth, especially for historians. Jose Marco justifies that he did everything so that Miguel could have something to believe in. The play ends with the young Miguel exiting as the present Miguel enters. They pause and stand back-to-back as the older Miguel stares at Jose Marco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><strong>Fake</strong></em></strong> demonstrates humanity&rsquo;s never-ending quest for truth. A fictional narrative that is influenced by nonfictional characters and events, the play emphasizes the importance of always interrogating the stories behind and beneath the &ldquo;facts.&rdquo; The business of truth, as Quintos mentions in his notes, will forever be a vague endeavor, a perpetual work in progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his anthology, Quintos clarifies that in the 2009 draft of the play, Jose Marco&rsquo;s story came first, followed by Sister Emily&rsquo;s. For the production, the director Mabesa recommended not only interchanging the two acts but also performing the work as two separate one-act plays. <strong><em>Fake</em></strong> won third prize in the full-length play category of the 2009 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Vladimeir B.

Miguel sees George, a foreigner with a gout-like affliction who is looking for Sister Emily, the miracle worker featured in the documentary. Lobo returns and leads Miguel and George to Sister Emily. She reveals that the Virgin has stopped talking to her and will never come back. The group argues about Sister Emily being a fraud and the country being a &#x201C;country of fakes.&#x201D; Then, just as the air smells of roses, petals start to rain. George&#x2019;s affliction is healed. A rosebud materializes from Sister Emily&#x2019;s chest and she faints. George takes the rosebud and hands it to Miguel who rejects it and leaves. Sister Emily asks Lobo and George to pray for Miguel so that he may find something that he believes in."

As Concepcion asks Miguel about how the outside world talks about her husband and his work, a young Miguel enters. This glimpse of the past, shows how Jose Marco filled the young Miguel&#x2019;s head with fiction passed off as historical facts&#x2014;the Code of Kalantiao, an indigenous Filipino penal code; and <a href=\"/5/40/928\"><strong><em>La Loba Negra</em></strong></a> or the Black She-Wolf, a governor-general&#x2019;s lady-turned-rebel who kills Spanish friars. In exchange for the stories and some historical trinkets, the young Miguel would give Jose Marco old paper and rubber stamp imprints he gets from his family&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>baul&#xA0;</em>(vault). Jose Marco and young Miguel enjoy this bond, as they call themselves &#x201C;<em>mambubulok</em>&#x201D; or collectors of old useless things&#x2014;seekers of lost treasures. This bond is put to the test with the arrival of William Henry Scott, an American professor from the University of Santo Tomas. Scott, under the guise of doing a dissertation, interviews Jose Marco on the Code of Kalantiao. The young Miguel arrives in the middle of Jose Marco&#x2019;s interrogation and realizes that all of his stories were fakes. Jose Marco pleads with Scott not to expose his fraud and insists that what he did was for the good of his country, providing hope and a sense of pride. Before leaving, Scott stresses the importance of exposing truth, especially for historians. Jose Marco justifies that he did everything so that Miguel could have something to believe in. The play ends with the young Miguel exiting as the present Miguel enters. They pause and stand back-to-back as the older Miguel stares at Jose Marco."

The play had its first full staging on 16 Oct 2013 as Lacson&rsquo;s thesis production at the Teatro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2998\">Hermogenes Ylagan</a>, University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman.

Julio is an effeminate boy who cannot come to terms with his gayness because this is not accepted by his family. Luna is a plain and trusting girl who tries to free herself from the lustful dreams haunting her by entering the convent. The dreams were of her parents making love, an act she had watched live. Diego is a boy filled with confusion, being a fatherless boy and son to a negligent mother. He grows to be more confused than before, and gets intimate with Julio.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The play begins with the three characters grimly reciting familiar yet twisted lines from fairy tales, foreshadowing the dark tone of the play. The three friends then proceed to play their favorite games&mdash;<em>pitik-bulag&nbsp;</em>(guessing game),&nbsp;<em>bahay-bahayan&nbsp;</em>(playing house), marbles&mdash;which serve as outlets to express their repressed desires, their deep-seated &ldquo;monsters.&rdquo; While playing bahay-bahayan, Diego and Luna clash over whether they should make love, as husband and wife do at night. In playing pitik-bulag, Julio challenges Diego to lower his pants if the latter loses. Diego agrees and the two start to be intimate with each other. With each game, they are able to understand why they are the way they are. They get to know themselves deeper, even the monsters they fear themselves to be. As they age, their relationships get strained and they eventually separate ways. Years pass and the three meet once again, updating each other about their lives in the most awkward manner. The scars of their childhood have remained with them in adulthood, so they are still unable to face the monsters they fear themselves to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play depicted the complex inner struggles of people resulting from their childhood experiences.

Julio is an effeminate boy who cannot come to terms with his gayness because this is not accepted by his family. Luna is a plain and trusting girl who tries to free herself from the lustful dreams haunting her by entering the convent. The dreams were of her parents making love, an act she had watched live. Diego is a boy filled with confusion, being a fatherless boy and son to a negligent mother. He grows to be more confused than before, and gets intimate with Julio."

It was the only time it is known to have been staged. It was printed by Cornelio Pabalan Byron, 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This verse play was inspired by the historical Gonzalo de Cordoba (1453-1515) who was a general in the service of Reyna Isabela and was among those responsible for recovering Granada from the Moors who had occupied it for three centuries. Gonzalo&rsquo;s military exploits appeared tailor-made for the komedya, but Fajardo made alterations on his amorous conquests by including a fictional romance with Zulema, a beautiful Moorish princess. This interweaving of historical and fictional threads spun the tapestry of Gonzalo de Cordoba&rsquo;s fame as folk hero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other komedya, <strong><em>Gonzalo de Cordoba</em></strong> has an extremely intricate plot. During the invasion of a Muslim city, Gonzalo falls in love at first sight with Zulema. Nothing comes out of that first encounter because Gonzalo is sent on another mission, this time to Africa. During Gonzalo&rsquo;s absence from the Christian camp, a letter arrives. It is addressed to Gonzalo by Zulema and her sister-in-law, Reyna Zoraida. The latter, who has been falsely accused of plotting the murder of her husband, the despotic Boabdil, begs Gonzalo to come to her defense. On behalf of the absent Gonzalo, Conde de Lara goes to Granada and saves the queen&rsquo;s life as well as her honor. Meanwhile, Zulema is abducted by Almanzor and taken prisoner on a ship bound for Africa. Gonzalo, who is on his way back to Spain disguised as a Moor, rescues Zulema. They anchor at Malaga, where Zulema nurses the wounded Gonzalo&mdash;only known to her as the African knight. Learning of his daughter&rsquo;s rescue, Muley Hassem promises Zulema&rsquo;s hand to any one of her four suitors (one of whom is the African knight) who can capture Gonzalo. When Gonzalo reveals his true identity to Zulema, the Moorish princess nevertheless assures him of her love. Gonzalo surprises his rivals by revealing his identity to them, and easily defeats them in combat. Meantime, the news of Gonzalo&rsquo;s impending arrival in Granada causes panic among the inhabitants. Almanzor, the brother of Zulema, challenges Gonzalo to personal combat. Without Gonzalo&rsquo;s knowledge, Reyna Isabela accepts the challenge. Gonzalo thus finds himself caught between his loyalty to the queen and his love for Zulema. When Gonzalo fails to arrive on time, Conde de Lara puts on Gonzalo&rsquo;s armor and kills Almanzor. Gonzalo then rushes to Zulema to explain what had happened, but he is captured by Boabdil&rsquo;s men and is sentenced to death. The wounded Lara hears this and he confesses that it was he who killed Almanzor. Refusing to have his friend sacrifice his life for him, Gonzalo insists that he is guilty. The matter is settled when Lara exhibits the wounds he received during that fateful combat. Muley Hassem is so moved by the friendship between the two men that he releases them both. Angered, Boabdil imprisons his father and his sister. In response to Zulema&rsquo;s plea for help, Gonzalo invades Granada. On behalf of Spain, he claims the city of Granada and, on his own behalf, claims the hand of Zulema.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This Kapampangan <strong>kumidya</strong> is only one of many similarly romanticized accounts of Gonzalo de Cordoba&rsquo;s life.

		"text": "<p>(The Hunger of Negros, The Country&rsquo;s Hunger). 1980. Two-act play with prologue, in Hiligaynon. Direction and script, Alan Abadesco. Cast: Out-of-school youths playing the roles of&nbsp;<em>obreros&nbsp;</em>(workers), a union member, the&nbsp;<em>amo&nbsp;</em>(landlord or master), and government employees. First staged by Teatro Pangkatilingban in Negros Occidental in 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This play demonstrates the complexity of the feudal relationship between hacendero (sugar plantation owner) and obrero by placing it in the national and global context of that era. Interspersed in the play&rsquo;s actions are the workers&rsquo; discussions in both dialogue and song, clarifying the structural and systemic causes of their oppressed condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the start of the dramatic action, there is a prologue in song, which provides an analytical framework for the play. The cast sings of the abundance of natural resources in the Philippines and asks why there is hunger amid this abundance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a&nbsp;<em>kampo&nbsp;</em>(cane field), obreros reenact the&nbsp;<em>karga-tapas&nbsp;</em>(the cutting and loading of cane) in slow motion. The dance is over and they sit down to rest, groaning with hunger. The hacendero arrives on the scene and shouts invectives at them for malingering. The scene dramatizes the feudal relationship between a bullying amo and his workers who are typically cowed, except one who is resentful of the amo&rsquo;s verbal abuse. When the workers explain to their amo that they are too weak with hunger to continue working, he brusquely replies that he is unable to pay the workers their just wages because he himself is being cheated by the government. He exits, and the workers continue their discussion. One obrero, a union member, explains to his fellow workers that the sugar industry has collapsed due to the Philippine government&rsquo;s dependence on US economic policies. Another worker observes that prices of agricultural equipment have gone up. The union member traces these various conditions to the worldwide recession that began in the 1970s. The workers realize that the legal, political, and wage systems are interrelated. Martial law itself has legalized unjust wages and enforces the laws that maintain these by curtailing freedom of assembly and speech.

Cast: Out-of-school youths playing the roles of&#xA0;<em>obreros&#xA0;</em>(workers), a union member, the&#xA0;<em>amo&#xA0;</em>(landlord or master), and government employees.

The dance is over and they sit down to rest, groaning with hunger. The hacendero arrives on the scene and shouts invectives at them for malingering. The scene dramatizes the feudal relationship between a bullying amo and his workers who are typically cowed, except one who is resentful of the amo&#x2019;s verbal abuse. When the workers explain to their amo that they are too weak with hunger to continue working, he brusquely replies that he is unable to pay the workers their just wages because he himself is being cheated by the government. He exits, and the workers continue their discussion. One obrero, a union member, explains to his fellow workers that the sugar industry has collapsed due to the Philippine government&#x2019;s dependence on US economic policies. Another worker observes that prices of agricultural equipment have gone up. The union member traces these various conditions to the worldwide recession that began in the 1970s. The workers realize that the legal, political, and wage systems are interrelated. Martial law itself has legalized unjust wages and enforces the laws that maintain these by curtailing freedom of assembly and speech. To assuage their hunger, the workers apply for a rice loan with the state-controlled Philippine Sugar Marketing Association. At its office, they go through the application process but are caught up in the government bureaucracy, filling up form after form although there is no loan in sight."

Their father, a Muslim king, rules the land from the palace. His many wives complain of not being able to see him more than once a year. His favorite daughters&mdash;Maria 1, Maria 2, and Maria 3&mdash;were taking an afternoon stroll on Jones Bridge when they were blown away by a strong wind, and delivered into the clutches of three monsters. The servant Alberto, known to be the most stupid, volunteers to find the princesses. In his journey, he acquires boots that transport him to far places; a<em>nuno</em>&rsquo;s (gnome) ring that answers questions; a&nbsp;<em>kapre</em>&rsquo;s (tree giant) hat that makes one disappear; twin brothers Juan 1 and Juan 2, who hold keys for opening and closing any door; and a guitar that can make everyone dance endlessly. Armed with&nbsp;<em>anting-anting&nbsp;</em>(amulets), Alberto finds the princesses. Maria 3 is found in the kingdom of Binibining Sirena, who has been promoting drug use among the youth. Maria 2 is found in the kingdom of Ginang Purista, whom Alberto defeats in a&nbsp;<em>bugtungan&nbsp;</em>(riddle contest), aided by the ring. Maria 1 has been brainwashed to work as secretary of the three-headed Ginoong Dragon. Love develops among the princesses and their rescuer, much to the king&rsquo;s dismay. Toward the end, Alberto kicks the king toward the angry activists, and is hailed as the new king. Alberto, just like the previous king, succumbs to wealth and power, practicing beheading as a form of punishment. He gives everyone a gift of marijuana, and decides to marry all three princesses, and more wives, for his harem.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><strong>Halimaw</strong></em></strong> was the first to use the sarsuwela form in contemporary theater, and assumed that if it had been allowed to grow instead of being stifled by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> and the movies, it would have been tremendously influenced by current theatrical trends.

				"value": "This play is about three princesses kidnapped by three monsters, and the quest to find them. Their father, a Muslim king, rules the land from the palace. His many wives complain of not being able to see him more than once a year. His favorite daughters&#x2014;Maria 1, Maria 2, and Maria 3&#x2014;were taking an afternoon stroll on Jones Bridge when they were blown away by a strong wind, and delivered into the clutches of three monsters. The servant Alberto, known to be the most stupid, volunteers to find the princesses. In his journey, he acquires boots that transport him to far places; a<em>nuno</em>&#x2019;s (gnome) ring that answers questions; a&#xA0;<em>kapre</em>&#x2019;s (tree giant) hat that makes one disappear; twin brothers Juan 1 and Juan 2, who hold keys for opening and closing any door; and a guitar that can make everyone dance endlessly. Armed with&#xA0;<em>anting-anting&#xA0;</em>(amulets), Alberto finds the princesses. Maria 3 is found in the kingdom of Binibining Sirena, who has been promoting drug use among the youth. Maria 2 is found in the kingdom of Ginang Purista, whom Alberto defeats in a&#xA0;<em>bugtungan&#xA0;</em>(riddle contest), aided by the ring. Maria 1 has been brainwashed to work as secretary of the three-headed Ginoong Dragon. Love develops among the princesses and their rescuer, much to the king&#x2019;s dismay. Toward the end, Alberto kicks the king toward the angry activists, and is hailed as the new king. Alberto, just like the previous king, succumbs to wealth and power, practicing beheading as a form of punishment. He gives everyone a gift of marijuana, and decides to marry all three princesses, and more wives, for his harem."

Chayong stays behind after the rehearsals, and Bindoy grabs this chance to woo her. At first, Chayong doubts Bindoy&rsquo;s sincerity, but eventually admits that she has feelings for him. Overjoyed, Bindoy tells Tino the good news. Tino, however, reminds Bindoy that they live in an era of war. The two soon receive a letter ordering them to go to General Malvar&rsquo;s camp in the mountains. They decide to leave the women in the town. But Chayong and Conching insist that they are just as capable as men and refuse to be left behind. At General Malvar&rsquo;s camp, Chayong receives news of two sisters, Sabel and Pinang, who were brutally raped by American soldiers. She then suggests to Don Goring that they publish the story in the <strong><em>Columnas Volantes</em></strong>. Don Goring agrees and Asun coaxes Sabel, the older of the victims, to relate what happened. As Sabel finishes her story, Conching suggests that they publish the wrongdoings of the American soldiers, but withhold the identities of the sisters to shield them from shame and probable backlash. Conching suggests publishing a poem instead, with the verses written by Chayong. Chayong agrees but only with the help of all. As preparations are made to leave the camp for the war, Bindoy speaks to Chayong, asking her to stay with him. She refuses, stating that she has to take care of the hysterical Pinang. Reluctantly, Bindoy agrees. In the midst of the revolution, Pinang runs away from the American soldiers and Chayong chases after her. Chayong is captured by the American soldiers. In 1902, Chayong, Conching, Ayang, and Gare gather and reminisce. Then Tino and an American soldier, Peter, come to escort Chayong to her English lessons. Peter denies Tino&rsquo;s accusations of American abuses and asks for proof of such wrongdoing. Chayong presents herself as proof, bringing to light how she was raped by the Americans. Peter excuses himself. Having heard Chayong&rsquo;s plight, Bindoy apologizes to Chayong for abruptly disappearing; the two reconcile.

A Bagobo chant is heard. The goddess Meybuyen appears. The children move to receive nourishment from Meybuyen&rsquo;s breasts. The children merrily laugh as they undress&mdash;before crossing the river. Meybuyen continues her chanting. In their final exchanges, Mata 1 jokingly calls Mata 2 Reuel but immediately retracts when Mata 2 gets upset. Mata 1 then calls Mata 2 in his real name which is Rene.

Tiongson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ilokula II</em></strong> is a sequel to <strong><em>Ilokula I</em></strong>, 1980, which focuses on nepotism and the unexplained wealth of the Marcos family. The play opens as the Circus Barker invites one and all to come into the circus to see the greatest, most exciting, and most shocking show on earth. The show begins with the audience creating the sounds of a dog&rsquo;s howls and of strong winds on a scary night, as well as of screams and of pounding heartbeats, which punctuate the atmosphere. Then one by one, the creatures of the night begin to appear and introduce themselves. Dra Maxima Bareta is the monster-minister of finance. She sings a song about her &ldquo;development&rdquo; plans for the country, all to be funded by all the foreign loans she can get her hands on. Dr Barile and Dr Rebolber, on the other hand, is the two-headed monster, whose songs promise to shoot all dissenters. Then, the Queen of Monsters is announced with big fanfare&mdash;Madam Kula, the wife of Ilokula. Although her plane from Geneva is late, she graciously gives in to her welcomer&rsquo;s request and sings a song of love and mercy. The monster explains the reason for the glittering assembly: the king of darkness, Ilokula or the Ilocano Dracula, is coming to life again. On the eve of the monster&rsquo;s world anniversary, he is resurrected amid more horrific sounds. Ilokula comes back to life, but moans with pain. He is immediately examined by experts, scanned by an X-ray machine. His heart is healthy, with the chambers of finance, defense, agriculture, and natural resources well supplied with blood. His small intestines are in good condition, with the continuous operation of the minor industries and of agriculture; the big intestines&rsquo; multinational and transnational corporations are also found to be healthy and strong, for they are securely attached to the country&rsquo;s rich natural and human resources. The problem is finally traced to his stomach, which is suffering from indigestion because of gluttony. After a transfusion from the International Mumu Fund and World Blood, and some USAID and CIA medication, Ilokula is operated on. From his stomach, dismembered parts of the human body are recovered: the fist of a worker on strike, a farmer&rsquo;s shoulder, a student&rsquo;s leg, a professional&rsquo;s brain, an artist&rsquo;s tongue, the hearts and livers of the many who were martyred for the country, and the people&rsquo;s blood and flesh, which have been served on a platter to strangers from other lands. Ilokula is dying and no one can save him. On 21 Sep 1983, he comes back to life after receiving CIA injections and IMF-WB dextrose. As he strongly denies rumors that he is about to die, his wife and other monsters deny all rumors of preempting more power. As a wondrous Christmas carol is sung, the dismembered parts thrown into the trash heap slowly reform into a human being. At this point, the audience is asked to participate in making noise to protest tyranny. Finally, the people onstage surround the monster family and deliberately raise their fists to hit them. As they freeze with arms raised, the play ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ilokula</em></strong> borrows the format of a <strong>circus-vaudeville</strong> to showcase the song-and-dance numbers of the government minister-monsters, and the magic-horror portion where Ilokula is operated on. To establish rapport with the audience and encourage audience participation, the Peryante come out at the beginning of the play and ask the audience to create the sound effects to be used in the play. Once established, the rapport with the audience is maintained through witty statements (e.g., &ldquo;I do not intend to die&rdquo;) or songs (e.g., &ldquo;Feelings&rdquo;) associated with the leaders of the regime. The laughter elicited by all these devices makes the injection of political analysis (Eric Baines or US imperialism sends a CIA injection and an IMF-WB dextrose to the ailing Ilokula) painless and almost pleasurable. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Nicanor G.

Mr Lorenzo, big-time manager of boxers and owner of Lorenzo Stadium, fixes the fights by arranging who wins and loses in every game, to ensure his bet against money put up by a certain Mr Lee and Mr Sanchez. Most of the ring fighters are easily bribed&mdash;agreeing to win or lose as he dictates&mdash;because of their own weaknesses. Kid Alaminos wants to become a champion, to give his girlfriend Rita a life better than simply raising placards announcing the next round. Joe Bikol is a parasite whose weakness is sex and women. Speed Max wants to win clean money to invest in a&nbsp;<em>sari-sari&nbsp;</em>(variety) store business, but is not strong enough to go against the system. Only Flash Gonzaga, the veteran boxer, sticks to his principles and maintains his self-respect by refusing to succumb to the wishes of the powerful; he would rather lose a fight than be fixed. Although pressured by his premature baby&rsquo;s condition in the hospital, he refuses to accept unclean money from his buddy Max, who had earlier been bribed to lose a fight with Kid. Meanwhile, Kid Alaminos, who was supposed to fight Flash in the next fight, has been told by boxer-turned-sidekick Joe Bikol, that Mr Lorenzo wants him to lose this fight, a bigger bet having been placed on Flash winning. With this, Kid&rsquo;s straight-win record would be tarnished, disqualifying him for the championship round. Mr Lorenzo also uses Rita, by telling Kid that his girl was actually Lorenzo&rsquo;s girlfriend. Demoralized and in tears, he tells Flash that he has been fixed to lose against him. Flash realizes that although he is the better boxer and a sure winner against Kid, if he wins it would mean victory for the slimy Mr Lorenzo and company. In the last scene, with bettors egging the boxers on, Kid and Flash size up one another in the first two rounds, each refusing to make a decisive move to beat his opponent. Their thoughts are heard in a voice-over narration: each has to lose, Kid to follow the system, and Flash to fight it. Realizing that Kid refuses to fight, Flash ignites the situation by bombarding Kid with his left hook and insulting remarks, calling him a coward, and urging the young boxer to fight. Kid wakes up and unleashes his left-right combination, hitting Flash on the face and sides, causing the veteran boxer to fall several times. Still he gets up, smiles, and drives on until his last fall gives his opponent the advantage. Kid eventually wins the fight. The last scene shows Kid a sad-faced winner, Mr Lorenzo defeated, and the veteran Flash looking triumphant about having lost&mdash;and thus won. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Malou L.

Kid Alaminos wants to become a champion, to give his girlfriend Rita a life better than simply raising placards announcing the next round. Joe Bikol is a parasite whose weakness is sex and women. Speed Max wants to win clean money to invest in a&#xA0;<em>sari-sari&#xA0;</em>(variety) store business, but is not strong enough to go against the system. Only Flash Gonzaga, the veteran boxer, sticks to his principles and maintains his self-respect by refusing to succumb to the wishes of the powerful; he would rather lose a fight than be fixed. Although pressured by his premature baby&#x2019;s condition in the hospital, he refuses to accept unclean money from his buddy Max, who had earlier been bribed to lose a fight with Kid. Meanwhile, Kid Alaminos, who was supposed to fight Flash in the next fight, has been told by boxer-turned-sidekick Joe Bikol, that Mr Lorenzo wants him to lose this fight, a bigger bet having been placed on Flash winning. With this, Kid&#x2019;s straight-win record would be tarnished, disqualifying him for the championship round. Mr Lorenzo also uses Rita, by telling Kid that his girl was actually Lorenzo&#x2019;s girlfriend. Demoralized and in tears, he tells Flash that he has been fixed to lose against him. Flash realizes that although he is the better boxer and a sure winner against Kid, if he wins it would mean victory for the slimy Mr Lorenzo and company. In the last scene, with bettors egging the boxers on, Kid and Flash size up one another in the first two rounds, each refusing to make a decisive move to beat his opponent. Their thoughts are heard in a voice-over narration: each has to lose, Kid to follow the system, and Flash to fight it. Realizing that Kid refuses to fight, Flash ignites the situation by bombarding Kid with his left hook and insulting remarks, calling him a coward, and urging the young boxer to fight. Kid wakes up and unleashes his left-right combination, hitting Flash on the face and sides, causing the veteran boxer to fall several times. Still he gets up, smiles, and drives on until his last fall gives his opponent the advantage. Kid eventually wins the fight. The last scene shows Kid a sad-faced winner, Mr Lorenzo defeated, and the veteran Flash looking triumphant about having lost&#x2014;and thus won. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Malou L.

Its production in 2013 at the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>, was dubbed &ldquo;homecoming&rdquo; because of its staging by the alma mater of the playwright Coscolluela and the director Leonardia (Casocot 2013). The play is published in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/723\"><strong><em>The Likhaan Book Drama 1991-1996: From Page to Stage</em></strong></a>, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The play spans the years from 1941 to 1944. It is 31 Dec 1941, New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and the landed Santamaria family of Dumaguete City is having dinner. At the onset, they talk about what to do with the&nbsp;<em>sakada</em>&rsquo;s (seasonal cane workers) unrest on the impending arrival of the Japanese forces to the city and the still to be harvested sugarcane. Miguel and Franco reveal to their mother Amanda and to their wives Isabel and Cristy, respectively, that they are being called by the Americans to active duty. Miguel mentions the American forces have retreated to Bataan and various American strongholds are now in ruins. Amanda is devastated. Her youngest son Carlito, early on, was already called to service, and now her two elder sons. The church bells peal and siren sounds are suddenly heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miguel and Franco have just returned from military service. On 16 Jun 1942, the Santamarias talk about the atrocities of the Japanese forces in the city of Dumaguete. Miguel is advised not to get involved with the resistance because he is under surveillance. They still have no news on the whereabouts of Carlito. Miguel and Franco argue about the surrender of the Americans. Amanda pleads with them to stop. Captain Haroda visits the family. He offers the position of provincial governorship to Franco. Franco refuses the offer. Haroda delivers another news that their house is to be the High Command&rsquo;s residence. Carlos does not object. Before leaving, Haroda instructs Franco to see him the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family has transferred its living quarters at the church sacristy. Miguel has joined the resistance; while Isabel and their children are now with Isabel&rsquo;s parents in Santa Catalina. On 10 Aug 1942, Carlos, Amanda, and Cristy are having dinner when Benito, their bookkeeper, comes in and announces the arrival of Emilio, who was sent by Miguel. Emilio requests the Santamarias to take in his girlfriend Marisa. Benito leaves for he is expected to be at the High Command&rsquo;s residence by supper. Emilio and Marisa detail the hardships of guerrilla living in the mountains and being pursued by the Japanese forces, and how they barely escaped the raid that sent them to the Santamarias. The two teenagers also relay the news that Miguel is safe. Emilio leaves to meet other underground personalities in the city. Cristy assists Marisa to the sleeping quarters. Alone, Carlos and Amanda discuss Franco&rsquo;s collaboration with the Japanese. Franco arrives to visit them. Carlos and Franco argue to the point of Carlos&rsquo;s disowning his son. Fuming, Carlos leaves the sacristy. Cristy enters and begs Franco to work for the release of her parents who are currently being tortured in jail. Franco says he is in no position to help. Cristy scorns his selfishness. Tired of fighting with everyone, Franco leaves. Marisa later becomes a sex slave of the High Command and becomes pregnant. On 22 Nov 1942, the Santamarias receive news from Victor, a friend of Carlito, of their youngest son&rsquo;s demise. Franco is guilt-stricken, saying he never wanted any of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve of 1942 is supposed to be Franco and Cristy&rsquo;s second anniversary of marriage. But Cristy is not sure she still loves her husband. Captain Haroda visits the Santamarias and inquires if they are sheltering &ldquo;outlaws.&rdquo; One of the informants for the Japanese has been murdered and the High Command may retaliate if the culprit is not caught. The family denies knowledge of the culprit. Captain Haroda bids them farewell. Emilio enters, disguised as an old man; he is the assassin the Japanese are looking for. He is informed of Marisa&rsquo;s fate with the Japanese High Command. Just then, the Japanese soldiers return to the sacristy with Marisa. Emilio hides in the pulpit, but upon seeing Marisa, he lunges at the soldiers. The soldiers drag him outside and he is immediately executed. Captain Haroda clears the Santamarias of connivance with the outlaw. One of the soldiers saw Emilio slip in while Captain Haroda was interviewing them earlier. With Emilio dead, Marisa kills herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isabel returns to Dumaguete on 14 Apr 1944 to get medicine for her malaria-stricken children. She walked for three days from Santa Catalina to Dumaguete. She is angry at Miguel who never visited them. On 10 Sep 1944, Miguel secretly meets with Franco to deliver news of General McArthur&rsquo;s return. He offers Franco safe passage in case the Allied forces win the war. But Franco refuses the offer. On the day of General MacArthur&rsquo;s return in 1944, the family is celebrating when Benito arrives with news that Franco has been tortured and killed. The family is grief-stricken. Carlos prepares to leave. Amanda asks him where he is going? He answers, &ldquo;I have to bury my son.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the story of Coscolluela&rsquo;s father and her father-in-law&rsquo;s families, the play depicts the slow destruction of an Ilonggo family and the personal disintegration of its members during the Japanese Occupation of Negros Island in the 1940s. The script won second prize in the full-length play category in English of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> in 1980.

The play was restaged by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">University of the Philippines (UP) Repertory Company</a> in 2011 and by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2749\">Artistang Artlets</a> of the University of Santo Tomas in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The monologue is set in a small turon (fried banana roll) and banana cue stall along Recto Ave in Manila. It is night and Lola Gloria, 76 and overweight, waits for the police to arrest her. She speaks as if the surroundings are already littered with gossipers. She begins by asking if the police are near and muses on how nothing could be kept secret in Manila. She does not even try to escape for fear of being shamed and televised just like what happened before when someone decided to commit suicide not far from her turon and banana cue stall. She says if one decides to kill one&rsquo;s self, death should be swift. She reminds the gossipers to prompt the police if ever the mobile car passes by the area. Besides, she has nowhere to go. She narrates how she acquired and started her stall when Marcos was still president. She ponders how even though government administrations have changed since the time of Marcos up until her namesake president, her status in life did not. She remembers her daughter Elsa whom she lost to a good-for-nothing neighbor. She adds how Elsa had 10 consecutive pregnancies and how thankful she was that only three children survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>She then talks to the heavens and speaks of how devoted she is to the Black Nazarene of Quiapo. She laments how even though the church is so near, heaven is so far and their cries cannot be heard. Nonetheless, she is thankful for she was given the strength and longevity to endure hardships. She asks forgiveness for questioning at times why the heavens decided to leave the last three of her grandchildren. When Elsa and her husband separated, Elsa left the three children to Lola. Lola&rsquo;s only consolation is that her youngest grandchild Edita looks exactly like Elsa. Lola muses that Edita, who is sickly, would often call her &ldquo;Yoya! Yoya!&rdquo; easing her fatigue after a day&rsquo;s work. Lola enumerates what she had tried to do to cure Edita for she had been sick for the last two weeks. It came to a point where Lola was forced to bring Edita with her, aggravating her work in the stall. Dealing with so much work, and seeing Edita convulsing, Lola&rsquo;s mind snapped. She takes her granddaughter&rsquo;s life by hitting her head on the cement. At last, the police arrive while Lola holds on to Edita&rsquo;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play represents how society&rsquo;s neglect breaks an individual, forcing one to take a loved one&rsquo;s life. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Erick Dasig Aguilar</strong></em></p>\r\n",

It is night and Lola Gloria, 76 and overweight, waits for the police to arrest her. She speaks as if the surroundings are already littered with gossipers. She begins by asking if the police are near and muses on how nothing could be kept secret in Manila. She does not even try to escape for fear of being shamed and televised just like what happened before when someone decided to commit suicide not far from her turon and banana cue stall. She says if one decides to kill one&#x2019;s self, death should be swift. She reminds the gossipers to prompt the police if ever the mobile car passes by the area. Besides, she has nowhere to go. She narrates how she acquired and started her stall when Marcos was still president. She ponders how even though government administrations have changed since the time of Marcos up until her namesake president, her status in life did not. She remembers her daughter Elsa whom she lost to a good-for-nothing neighbor. She adds how Elsa had 10 consecutive pregnancies and how thankful she was that only three children survived."

She laments how even though the church is so near, heaven is so far and their cries cannot be heard. Nonetheless, she is thankful for she was given the strength and longevity to endure hardships. She asks forgiveness for questioning at times why the heavens decided to leave the last three of her grandchildren. When Elsa and her husband separated, Elsa left the three children to Lola. Lola&#x2019;s only consolation is that her youngest grandchild Edita looks exactly like Elsa. Lola muses that Edita, who is sickly, would often call her &#x201C;Yoya! Yoya!&#x201D; easing her fatigue after a day&#x2019;s work. Lola enumerates what she had tried to do to cure Edita for she had been sick for the last two weeks. It came to a point where Lola was forced to bring Edita with her, aggravating her work in the stall. Dealing with so much work, and seeing Edita convulsing, Lola&#x2019;s mind snapped. She takes her granddaughter&#x2019;s life by hitting her head on the cement. At last, the police arrive while Lola holds on to Edita&#x2019;s body."

The main narrative thread is that of Josephine Bracken bringing her stepfather George Taufer to the Philippines for an eye operation, meeting Rizal, falling in love, and being with him till his execution. The multilayered unfolding also brings in Rizal&rsquo;s roles in Dapitan as a teacher, interacting with and developing the community, and serving as doctor; and in the reform movement, with Rizal&rsquo;s debate with the Church, the popular perception of friars and of Jesuits. It also reveals Filipino women&rsquo;s perceptions of their womanhood in Rizal&rsquo;s time and in the present, Rizal&rsquo;s poetry and his plays <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/532\"><strong><em>El Consejo de los Dioses</em></strong></a> (Council of the Gods) and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/575\"><strong><em>Junto al Pasig</em></strong></a> (Beside the Pasig), the question of the language in which Philippine literature should be written, and the roles of the poet and the historian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characters transform, even in mid-scene: Josephine and Manuela Orlac from their 19th-century selves into 20th-century streetwalkers, and in another scene into contemporary Taglish-speaking housewives gossiping about friends having affairs. As background of Rizal&rsquo;s unsuccessful operation on George Taufer, Manuela transforms into Teodoro Alonzo, and Rizal into his younger self, realizing his mother&rsquo;s blindness. Josephine and Rizal, in the midst of their discussion about the future&mdash;she pleading that he leave the country; he insisting he is needed&mdash;transform into Baby and Jun, graduate students in New York&mdash;she wanting to return home after her doctoral studies; he insisting there are no opportunities there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Languages proliferate in these multivoiced and multilayered worlds: Josephine speaks English and Spanish and eventually <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>; George Taufer English and German; Rizal Tagalog, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, English, and Spanish; the men and women of Dapitan, Cebuano and Tagalog; the women into and out of which Josephine and Manuela transform, all of the above and German and French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a play, despite the author&rsquo;s proffered disclaimer, that weaves the historical moment of Rizal and Josephine with the other strands that unravel because of them, and because they were who they were: that of colonial Philippines, its politics and society; that of women and their self-view (&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s place is in the home,&rdquo; and onward); those of language and literature, reform and revolution, desire and commitment. Some situations are historical, some absurd, some repetitive, some insolvable, all interconnected and real. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

First staged by PETA in 1975 at the Dulaang Rajah Sulayman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, Manila. In 1997, it was staged by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> at the Tanghalang <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V.

O&rsquo;Hara and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3015\">Nanding Josef</a>, who were both part of the original production, took up different roles for the 1997 production. <strong><em><strong>Kabesang Tales</strong></em></strong> was published in <strong><em>Sagisag</em></strong> in Jul 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play draws material from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong><em>El Filibusterismo</em></strong></a> (Subversion), chapters 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10. It starts with Tales moving his father Selo, his wife Victoria, and children Juli, Tano, and Lucia to Sagpang. There they clear land, which exacts its toll: Victoria and Lucia fall ill and die. A day before the first harvest, Fray Clemente claims the land as belonging to his order, and charges Tales rental fees. Although Tales knows that the friar had moved the markers to make the claim, he pays the rental, because it is low and he can afford it. The harvests are good; Tales is able to build a better house, and is eventually appointed&nbsp;<em>cabeza de barangay&nbsp;</em>(barangay captain), a position of honor and responsibility: he collects the village taxes. He makes plans to send his children to school, especially Juli, whose sweetheart, Basilio, is studying to become a doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Fray Clemente pursues him, however, raising the rent gradually. Tales is pushed to the wall, refuses to pay, and decides to take Fray Clemente to court, even though Tandang Selo, his father, points out that he is &ldquo;a clay pot knocking against an iron skillet,&rdquo; because no one ever won such a case, and he would be judged even before the case is heard. Tales insists that the friars have no proof of ownership of the land. His case is lost gradually and painfully: cheating scribes, a good judge removed, hearings postponed, a withdrawal by the governor of his privileges as cabeza, and a judgement against him, which he decides to appeal. The friars install a new tenant in the land he cleared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal pain also mounts: Tano is conscripted; Tales&rsquo;s weapons of gun, then bolo, are confiscated, and he is reduced to Selo&rsquo;s axe, until he is taken by outlaws, who ask for ransom. Juli borrows money for the ransom, and becomes a servant to repay it. After she leaves home, Selo is struck dumb. When Tales is freed, Simoun comes and asks to use his house to show the jewelry he is selling. He also offers to buy the&nbsp;<em>agnos&nbsp;</em>(medallion) of Maria Clara, but Tales wishes to consult Juli first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last scenes, Fray Clemente and the new tenant are found dead. Simoun shows a letter from Tales explaining that he took Simoun&rsquo;s gun, left Maria Clara&rsquo;s medallion in exchange, and joined the outlaws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dumol takes matter from Rizal&rsquo;s fiction and&mdash;in short, effective scenes&mdash;presents the growth of Tales&rsquo;s consciousness from submission to rebellion. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

Cast: Evelyn Tila (Kuapao), Nancy Belmonte (Siopao), and Cathy Benedicto (Siomai).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play is a hilarious skit on the workers&rsquo; plight, for three chubby female actors, who sing, dance, and deliver lines using popular melodies, with lyrics changed to highlight workers&rsquo; and peoples&rsquo; conditions and demands. It has allusions to popular movie titles and puns on television commercials. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>Bodabil</strong></a></strong>-inspired, this is <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3299\">Teatro Pabrika</a> liberated from agitprop conventions. In 1989, this three-actor piece, accompanied by a guitarist, was improvised by Misajon, Opaon, Tila, Belmonte, and Benedicto, cultural workers from various unions in Quezon City factories at that time. A relatively polished version with dramaturgical and directorial inputs from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2840\">Apolonio B. Chua</a> and Oscar Roman appeared in 1991, in the Folk Arts Theater concert-play production <strong><em><strong><strong>Harana</strong></strong>ng Bayan</em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Serenade). It became a staple in rallies up to the administration of Fidel Ramos. The different variants of the script and annotations are published in both <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/697\"><strong><em>Bangon: Antolohiya ng mga Dulang Mapanghimagsik</em></strong></a> (Revolt: Anthology of Revolutionary Plays ), 1998, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/742\"><strong><em>Simulain: Dulambayan ng Manggagawa sa Konteksto ng Militanteng Kilusang Unyonismo, 1980-1994</em></strong></a> (Guiding Principle: Workers&rsquo; Dulambayan in the Context of the Militant Unionism Movement, 1980-1994), 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The skit is set on a payday. At the factory gates, the debt collectors intercept workers as they come out of the factory and collect payments. But Kuapao cunningly stays behind in the factory to elude them. With a very small salary, she cannot afford to pay her loans and bills. She feels bad and to console herself sings a popular Sharon Cuneta song &ldquo;Tubig at Langis&rdquo; (Water and Oil), with modified lyrics that complain about the prices of goods and not having enough food to eat. Siopao enters, wailing exaggeratedly and covering one eye with her hand. She had a fight with her husband, who gave her a black eye. Siopao joins Kuapao in singing about their plight. Siomai, a union leader, joins them, and the three berate the leaders of the government for the people&rsquo;s woes. The disillusionment with the Cory Aquino administration is also rendered through song sequences and a parody of a popular television commercial for rubber sandals at that time, &ldquo;Marupok ka! Wala kaming tibay na maaasahan. Binoto pa naman din kita noong eleksiyon. Hinarang pa namin ang mga tangke de giyera.&rdquo; (Weak! We cannot expect strength from you. To think I voted for you in the last election. We even barricaded military tanks.) But they also criticize themselves. Siomai alludes to workers&rsquo; weaknesses, as well as their reluctance to participate in mass actions. A strong male voice-over is heard; it is Kuapao&rsquo;s domineering husband asking her if she has started cooking rice. Kuapao is frightened, but Siopao and Siomai encourage the submissive wife to be strong and fight. After the two leave, Kuapao practices some aikido movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than developing a narrative, the improvisation is a string of <strong>lapat-awit</strong> (new lyrics fitted unto existing popular tunes). Workers&rsquo; predicaments as well as social and national issues of the period were touched upon in as comic a manner as possible. Depending on the issue at hand, lines were adjusted. For example, during the Ramos administration, the line &ldquo;He did nothing but smoke a cigar,&rdquo; was added. Also a part of the skit directly addressed the audience with questions like &ldquo;Anybody here knows how much we owe IMF-WB?&rdquo; Of the skit&rsquo;s numerous performances, the actors wore colorful attires, including bandannas knotted like ribbons on their heads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The skit was given the gold prize in 1992 by an award-giving group, Kritika. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Apolonio B.

His father, she tells him, is Kalayaan (Freedom). In act 1, tribute is demanded by Haring Bata (the young king&mdash;king of China), who is, however, defeated by the Filipinos. In act 2, the people are persecuted by Matanglawin (hawk-eyed&mdash;the Spanish colonial government), Dilat-na-bulag (blind but with eyes open&mdash;Spain), and especially by Halimaw (monster&mdash;the Spanish friar), who demands even the jewelry and personal possessions of the women. Forces led by Taga-ilog, however, conquer the Spaniards. Bagongsibol (newcomer&mdash;America) and Malaynatin (who knows?&mdash;the American government) enter, claiming that anyone whom they help is freed from slavery. In act 3, however, the Americans attempt to conquer Inangbayan and her people. Taga-ilog and his forces, equipped with such modern equipment as airships, cannons, electric bullets, and movable fortifications, fight back. In the end, Bagongsibol and Malaynatin grant the people their liberty because the children had asked them for it.

First performed in 2000 in Aquinas University in Legaspi, Albay, the play was a collaborative production by the Aquinas University, the Sorsogon CBTG, and <strong><em>Letra</em></strong>, a Bikol magazine. The play was also presented during the Sandiwaan Festival by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission of Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 2001. Also, under an NCCA grant, the play was toured in almost all the provinces in Mindanao, as well as in Manila and the University of Baguio in Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story tells of Daragang Magayon, who is aware that, eventually, she will be the chieftain of her tribe. However, the future is threatened by the ambitious Datu Pagtuga, a mighty warrior and hunter who is already beginning to conquer neighboring tribes. Daragang Magayon will not allow such a thing to happen. On her own, she trains to become a warrior with the help of her nurse Sirangan. She wants to prove that being a woman will not hinder her from defending her tribe. Datu Pagtuga, desiring to make Daragang Magayon his wife, abducts her father Datu Makusog. But Daragang Magayon is already smitten by the charm of Ulap, a gallant warrior from a distant land. A battle ensues between the peoples of Daragang Magayon and Datu Pagtuga, killing most of the warriors in Daragang Magayon&rsquo;s tribe. The morning after the battle, cries and wailings of widows and orphans are raised to high heavens and down the bottomless seas. Datu Pagtuga is killed by Ulap. Daragang Magayon runs to embrace Ulap. A stray arrow pierces Daragang Magayon. As Ulap embraces the dying Daragang Magayon, a man from Datu Pagtuga&rsquo;s tribe impales Ulap&rsquo;s back with a spear, killing him instantly. The two are eventually buried in a place where the beautiful Mayon Volcano now stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Jamoralin and Llana adapted to stage Pe&ntilde;ones&rsquo;s translation of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5122\">Merlinda Bobis</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cantata of Daragang Magayon, Warrior Woman</em></strong>, 1993.

However, the future is threatened by the ambitious Datu Pagtuga, a mighty warrior and hunter who is already beginning to conquer neighboring tribes. Daragang Magayon will not allow such a thing to happen. On her own, she trains to become a warrior with the help of her nurse Sirangan. She wants to prove that being a woman will not hinder her from defending her tribe. Datu Pagtuga, desiring to make Daragang Magayon his wife, abducts her father Datu Makusog. But Daragang Magayon is already smitten by the charm of Ulap, a gallant warrior from a distant land. A battle ensues between the peoples of Daragang Magayon and Datu Pagtuga, killing most of the warriors in Daragang Magayon&#x2019;s tribe. The morning after the battle, cries and wailings of widows and orphans are raised to high heavens and down the bottomless seas. Datu Pagtuga is killed by Ulap. Daragang Magayon runs to embrace Ulap. A stray arrow pierces Daragang Magayon. As Ulap embraces the dying Daragang Magayon, a man from Datu Pagtuga&#x2019;s tribe impales Ulap&#x2019;s back with a spear, killing him instantly. The two are eventually buried in a place where the beautiful Mayon Volcano now stands."

Interpreting the epic as an allegory, the play, with the assistance of a narrator-chanter and a comic sidekick, follows the hero Labaw Donggon as he embarks on a journey to restore peace in a world rent asunder by envy, greed, and selfish ego. He unites the divided worlds&mdash;the Underworld, the Middleworld, and the Upperworld&mdash;by marrying a&nbsp;<em>binukot&nbsp;</em>or princess from each of the three realms. But, in order to do this, he needs to best formidable adversaries guarding each binukot. After overcoming the Kapre Manaluntad through the power of his&nbsp;<em>pamlang&nbsp;</em>(magical oil), he marries Ginbitinan of the Underworld, by whom he has a son, Asu Mangga. Labaw Donggon then proceeds to defeat the giant Octopus Sikang Padalogdog in the Middleworld and weds Doronoon, who gives birth to Baranugun. In the Upperworld, the only domain left, Labaw Donggon insists on marrying Nagmalitung Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, the wife of Saragnayan. To Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s surprise, the pamlang loses its power because he breaches custom law by selfishly desiring someone already married. He is defeated and imprisoned, and in jail he undergoes a spiritual cleansing. After many years, his two sons, Asu Mangga and Baranugun, set out to liberate their father. The two battle Saragnayan, symbolizing the triumph of filial love over a spouse&rsquo;s love. Defeated, Saragnayan dies, and Labaw Donggon, now purified, rises once again. Labaw Donggon then marries Nagmalitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, completing the unification of the three worlds into one. The journey helps Labaw Donggon discover the bounds of love and desire, the importance of law in society, and the nobility of transcending self in order to save humanity (ENTABLADO 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Labaw Donggon</em></strong> showcases the creative fusion of the indigenous and the contemporary in costumes, music, and dance in order to reconcile the sensibilities of the present with the richness of the past. Set in an open space and in a bamboo grove, the stage gave the audience an impression of Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s primeval world. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Tyron Judes de la Calsada Casumpang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>ENTABLADO (Ateneo Enterteynment para sa Tao, Bayan, Lansangan, at Diyos). 2013. <i>Labaw Donggon</i>.

Interpreting the epic as an allegory, the play, with the assistance of a narrator-chanter and a comic sidekick, follows the hero Labaw Donggon as he embarks on a journey to restore peace in a world rent asunder by envy, greed, and selfish ego. He unites the divided worlds&#x2014;the Underworld, the Middleworld, and the Upperworld&#x2014;by marrying a&#xA0;<em>binukot&#xA0;</em>or princess from each of the three realms. But, in order to do this, he needs to best formidable adversaries guarding each binukot. After overcoming the Kapre Manaluntad through the power of his&#xA0;<em>pamlang&#xA0;</em>(magical oil), he marries Ginbitinan of the Underworld, by whom he has a son, Asu Mangga. Labaw Donggon then proceeds to defeat the giant Octopus Sikang Padalogdog in the Middleworld and weds Doronoon, who gives birth to Baranugun. In the Upperworld, the only domain left, Labaw Donggon insists on marrying Nagmalitung Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, the wife of Saragnayan. To Labaw Donggon&#x2019;s surprise, the pamlang loses its power because he breaches custom law by selfishly desiring someone already married. He is defeated and imprisoned, and in jail he undergoes a spiritual cleansing. After many years, his two sons, Asu Mangga and Baranugun, set out to liberate their father. The two battle Saragnayan, symbolizing the triumph of filial love over a spouse&#x2019;s love. Defeated, Saragnayan dies, and Labaw Donggon, now purified, rises once again. Labaw Donggon then marries Nagmalitong Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, completing the unification of the three worlds into one. The journey helps Labaw Donggon discover the bounds of love and desire, the importance of law in society, and the nobility of transcending self in order to save humanity (ENTABLADO 2013)."

The play had a regular run at the Penguin Bar in Malate in Dec 2000 and was restaged at the Aldaba Recital Hall of the UP Theater in 2001. Succeeding restagings of the play were done by different theater groups, both professional and nonprofessional, such as <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3302\">Teatro Tomasino</a> of the University of Santo Tomas in 2003 and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang UP</a> Baguio in 2008.

They are always attended to by waiter Marcel and Sweet, who nags them about buying his red roses that get more expensive every time she enters. The play begins with Tuxqs&rsquo;s arrival at the Penguin Caf&eacute;. After being welcomed by Marcel, Tuxqs starts contacting friends who are still on-the-way. Harlene arrives and is unnerved by the paintings exhibited at the caf&eacute;. She confides to Tuxqs how her four-year live-in relationship is collapsing. Tess arrives and comments how undesirable the paintings are. Tess, who used to date a lot of boys, discloses her current sex life which involves a lesbian, Sheqs. Tuxqs and Harlene scrutinize Tess&rsquo;s change of sexual preference. Their discussion goes from Tess&rsquo;s qualms about having a lesbian lover, to Harlene&rsquo;s unfulfilled sexual needs with her live-in partner Nicko, and Tuxqs&rsquo;s fear of growing old, single, and alone. Dyna and Mario arrive. Mario introduces Sang. Dyna expresses her revulsion for&nbsp;<em>jologs&nbsp;</em>(coarse, low class people)&mdash;only to reveal, upon the group&rsquo;s inquiry, that she is dating Edwin, a 16-year-old jolog. She is actually ashamed of introducing him to the group. The group, wanting very much to meet Edwin, pins Dyna to the couch and contacts Edwin to come to the caf&eacute;. Meanwhile, Mario narrates his epiphanic transformation from a drug user to a drug pusher because of his near-death experience, adding how he and Sang met. Sang reveals she is older than the rest of them and expresses her contentment in having four kids, shocking the group. Edwin arrives and is comfortable speaking to them. The group, much to Dyna&rsquo;s embarrassment, is amused that Edwin abhors jologs. Sheqs arrives and offers marriage to Tess, which she neither accepts nor rejects. Harlene and Nicko are not able to resolve the issue of a long-term relationship gone stale. Dyna and Edwin are at odds because of their different upbringing. Mario and Sang, having no issues to begin with, end the same way they began. Except for Tuxqs, everyone leaves the Penguin Caf&eacute;. Tuxqs, loveless and drunk, debates with Sweet, who is disappointed because she never got to sell any of his red roses.

In 1992, a new character, Pio De Puga, was integrated into the play. Tanghalang Pilipino staged this version at the Toyama International Amateur Theater Festival in Toyama, Japan, on 1-7 Aug 1992. With CCP&rsquo;s outreach program, the play went on a national tour. The play script was published with another play in <strong><em>Butihing Babae ng Timog/<strong>Mac Malicsi TNT</strong></em></strong> (Good Woman of Timog/Mac Malicsi TNT), 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a hotel in Milwaukee, Mac Malicsi bitterly muses how wonderful life is in America to his companion Pio. Dwight, an American national, enters and asks Mac for whiskey in return for a cigar. Dwight is refused when he asks if he can stay the night. Growing suspicious, he asks if Mac is in any trouble. Mac denies this and adds that he has been a tourist for eight years. Addressing the audience, he confesses that he entered the United States (US) on a tourist visa to run away from Sen Tommy Tirador of the Philippines, whose daughter he knocked up. He narrates the odd jobs he did as an illegal migrant and how he is currently on the run from the Midwestern Association of Filipino Immigrants in America (MAFIA). Dwight falls asleep and is robbed by Mac, who goes to Minneapolis, Minnesota, with Pio. They leave the still-asleep Dwight to deal with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the hotel manager who later bursts into the room looking for Mac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the train, Mac goes by another name and meets the hairdresser Wendy Van Winkle and the immigrant Pete Pihado who is now a professor in Ohio. Mac convinces them that he is an investment counselor and manages to get money from them. Arriving at Minneapolis, Pete leaves the group. Wendy decides to have dinner with Mac and tells him about her life as a former lover of Frank, a MAFIA member. Pete returns with Adel, also a member of the MAFIA, who has lost her way to the annual MAFIA Christmas Party. Mac and Adel note their familiarity with each other. Pete and Adel describe the MAFIA Christmas party and invites Mac and Wendy to attend, unaware that their conversation is being recorded. Mac refuses and invites Wendy to spend the night with him instead. At the hotel, Mac, thinking Wendy is asleep, takes her purse and goes to the bathroom. Once Mac is out of sight, Wendy likewise takes Mac&rsquo;s wallet from his pants&rsquo; pocket and finds out he has been deceiving her the whole time. Mac emerges from the bathroom disgruntled upon seeing his ID in Wendy&rsquo;s hands and snatches it back. He tells the audience that it is his most prized possession&mdash;the one proof of an honest attempt to live a decent life. Outraged by Mac&rsquo;s attempt to steal from her, Wendy accuses him of being a fugitive. Mac denies this by saying that he is merely a &ldquo;lost Pinoy.&rdquo; Wendy threatens to call the police, but Mac argues that she has been lying to him as well. She admits to planning to steal from Mac from the beginning, and tells him of the difficulties she faced as an orphan that led her to where she is now. Mac is moved and gives Wendy his last one hundred dollars. Before parting ways, he tells her to find her aunt. Mac heads back to Chicago, and Wendy is reunited with Frank, who turns out to be the MAFIA chasing after Mac. At the train station to Chicago, Pio decides to live honestly and bids Mac goodbye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chicago, Mac is reunited with Sally and asks her to marry him. Sally refuses and admits to tipping off the INS on Mac. Initially, she thought of going with him once he gets deported, but she is now soon to be married to an American. The next day, Mac goes to the INS office to turn himself in. Before he enters, the office announces that illegal aliens who entered before 1982, with proof of residency, are to be granted amnesty. Mac is overjoyed. Pio arrives and tells Mac of his plan to return to the Philippines to take care of his mother. Pio leaves, and a Filipino couple applying for amnesty arrive. However, they have no documents to prove that they were in the United States before 1982. Mac introduces himself as an immigration law attorney and offers to help them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play presents, in a comic way, what drastic measures some Filipinos who stay as illegal migrants in the United States resort to in order to chase the &ldquo;American Dream.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Athena Angela Aquino</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In act 1, the <a href=\"https://info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> recall the death of their beloved leader Apo Macli-ing Dulag who was killed in the conflict over the Chico River Dam Project. Now they are confronted with a new enemy, Puraw, who arrived with his military forces and his women, presenting the natives with gifts to hide his real objective&mdash;to continue the building of the Chico River Dam.

The government has formed the Solution of Eternal Peace, through which the military eliminated all rebels and activists. As a final form of protest, the activists named their 39 children born on that day after the gods and heroes of the epics. Now in their early 20s, these children are scattered and unaware of their origins and source of their supernatural powers. Journalist Bantugan Buenaventura, one of these children, discerns that when he awakens to his power of dreaming, he forms a connection with the other children of protest, specifically Lam-ang Panganiban, the leader of the underground group Maragtas. Through the Maragtas&rsquo;s babaylan (priestess), Gawigawen, Lam-ang learns he is not alone and discovers the higher purpose of his powers: to find a cure for the epidemic of&nbsp;<em>kamanhiran&nbsp;</em>(apathy) that is spreading throughout the country. Kamanhiran turns its victims&rsquo; skins white and renders them emotionless and soulless. Through Bantugan, the Maragtas tries to locate and recruit the other children to their cause but they are pursued and thwarted by the&nbsp;<em>tulisan ng bayan&nbsp;</em>(town bandits), the other children of protest who are loyal to the government, specifically to Mamalahim-ma, the minister of humanity. The tulisan&rsquo;s leader Apolaki Regalado believes that their powers were given to them so they can rule the world and enslave humanity. Ambushed by the tulisan in their hideout, the Maragtas are defeated and have no choice but to flee when Lam-ang is killed and Bantugan is captured. The tulisan torture Bantugan to force him to reveal the whereabouts of the other scattered children. The capture and purging of the other children of protest continue. Upon discovering the location of Urduja, the last child of protest, the tulisan send Radia to seduce and capture her. Radia is a shape-shifter who can compel anyone to fall in love with him, and yet upon meeting Urduja, it is he who falls in love with her. After professing their love for each other, they infiltrate the Ministry of Humanity. Assuming Urduja&rsquo;s form, Radia allows himself to be captured in her place while Urduja rescues Bantugan and the other captured Maragtas. They search the seas for the body of Lam-ang and she is resurrected by the combined powers of Gawigawen, Lagrimas, and Urduja. Now stronger, the Maragtas regroup and begin their revolution, curing the apathetic while fighting the tulisan. Their presence inspires ordinary people to feel awe and astonishment, to question, and to fight back. To stop this crusade, Mamalahim-ma holds Lagrimas hostage and proposes a final battle between the Maragtas and the tulisan. If the former win, true freedom is granted with the end of apathy and a chance for free elections. If the latter win, the Maragtas must end their crusade and let themselves be enslaved by the tulisan. The final fight does not end well, with many children killed on both sides including Mamalahim-ma. Before he is killed, Bantugan dreams of the solution, which centers on Lagrimas. The remaining Maragtas understand what they must do and through Lagrimas&rsquo;s final sacrifice, her tears and ashes, which return to the land through the rain, cleanses and heals, restoring the peace and setting the people free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Manhid</em></strong> was inspired by American superhero comic books and Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s <strong><em>Midnight&rsquo;s Children</em></strong>. The play attempted to find a form for a comic book narrative in drama, music, and dance which expressed the creative team&rsquo;s anxiety over the continuing presence of the American bases and the colonial mind-set of Filipinos. The production gathered the talents of the then student rock band The Eraserheads, soprano Cabili, and punk artist Lee. The UP Tropa could not find a theater for the musical so they transformed the lobby of the Palma Hall Building as their performance space, fitting both ends with large industrial exhaust fans to generate wind to simulate Lam-ang&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>amihabagat&nbsp;</em>or monsoon winds. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Paolo Manalo</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The play attempted to find a form for a comic book narrative in drama, music, and dance which expressed the creative team&#x2019;s anxiety over the continuing presence of the American bases and the colonial mind-set of Filipinos. The production gathered the talents of the then student rock band The Eraserheads, soprano Cabili, and punk artist Lee. The UP Tropa could not find a theater for the musical so they transformed the lobby of the Palma Hall Building as their performance space, fitting both ends with large industrial exhaust fans to generate wind to simulate Lam-ang&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>amihabagat&#xA0;</em>or monsoon winds. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Paolo Manalo</strong> </em>"

After breakfast, Maxie performs errands for his father, collecting and delivering jueteng bets and winnings to their neighbors. He also goes out to watch pirated DVDs with his group of young gays, losing himself in the fantasy world of films. But today is special, not only because it is the fiesta of their barangay (complete with the usual procession and dancing) but because he is joining the gay beauty pageant. The contest ends at midnight and Maxie rushes home, but is harassed by two drunken men. He screams for help and the newly arrived policeman Victor comes to his aid. Victor brings him home safe but he refuses the reward money offered by Paco. Maxie falls for the handsome and kind Victor. After the policeman leaves, Boy arrives in a bloodied shirt.

There they witness Victor bringing in a snatcher whom he apprehended. Maxie admires Victor&rsquo;s bravery. Meanwhile, the two men who harassed Maxie are found unconscious and naked on a garbage heap, the handiwork of Boy and Bogs to avenge Maxie. Soon, Maxie and Victor are able to talk, and the latter advises the young boy to go back to school. That night, the chief of police and Victor visit Paco&rsquo;s house to find out if they know anything about the murder of the student. After the police leave, Maxie burns Boy&rsquo;s bloodied shirt, but Victor sees him do it from afar. Later, Victor asks Maxie about the shirt, and succeeds in confirming that the shirt belonged to one of his brothers. Guilty, Maxie tells his family about his revelation. Paco then discovers Boy&rsquo;s crime and beats him up for it, saying, &ldquo;I raised you to be thieves, not murderers.&rdquo; To protect Boy, Paco gets a group together and they beat up Victor to discourage him from pursuing the case. Secretly, Maxie goes to Victor&rsquo;s house to attend to his wounds and ask forgiveness for having indirectly caused his mauling. Victor forgives Maxie, who then gives him a kiss on the lips. Maxie spends the night beside Victor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 3, Paco strictly forbids Maxie from seeing Victor ever again. Arguing that Victor is only doing his job, Maxie defies his father and writes Victor a love letter. He replies by asking Maxie to find someone his own age. Bogs comforts Maxie. Meanwhile, a new police chief Dominguez, together with Victor, has stepped up the drug bust operations. Victor and a few policemen raid Paco&rsquo;s house. Maxie is shocked at the change in Victor. Bogs too is mistakenly arrested and jailed for the murder of the student. Paco with his gun in tow confronts his old enemy, Dominguez, but ends up being shot dead instead by Victor and in full sight of Maxie. The community mourns Paco&rsquo;s death.

She lights a candle and relives the moment when the soldier intrudes upon her rented room, asking if he could spend the night there. She is appalled and says she does not practice her work there. The soldier says he only wants to talk. He had seen her a few nights ago at the bar where she works and thought she was friendly. Despite her doubts, the prostitute allows him to stay. She pretends to seduce him, but he rejects her advances. She then articulates how the people from the countryside loathe and scorn the military. She insults him by describing the torture mechanisms the military use on the rebels, or alleged rebels, adding that the rebels had every reason to fight. She narrates the difficult life her people are experiencing in the countryside because of militarization. He asks if she has any plans of returning to her hometown. She says she no longer has a place to return to. The soldier decides to leave, and leaves money on the table. Insulted, the woman insults him back and asks why he even bothered to come. He admits that she reminds him of his sister. He tells her of the comrades he has lost to the rebels and how he is very much tempted to go AWOL, but his obligation to his family is stopping him. He notes that his sister has joined the rebellion and fears that one day, they might have to face each other in the battlefield. This time, the prostitute asks him if he ever plans to return home. The soldier says he no longer has a place to return to, and leaves. Alone once more, the prostitute laments the soldier&rsquo;s fate. Before blowing the candle out, she muses that maybe those who have decided to join the rebellion are in a much better disposition than they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The play presents the struggles faced by the different Filipinos through the clashing beliefs of the prostitute and the soldier during martial law.

				"value": "In Samar in 1981, a prostitute recollects a moment she had with a soldier a year before, amid an electricity blackout and ongoing military operations, not far from where she now stays. She lights a candle and relives the moment when the soldier intrudes upon her rented room, asking if he could spend the night there. She is appalled and says she does not practice her work there. The soldier says he only wants to talk. He had seen her a few nights ago at the bar where she works and thought she was friendly. Despite her doubts, the prostitute allows him to stay. She pretends to seduce him, but he rejects her advances. She then articulates how the people from the countryside loathe and scorn the military. She insults him by describing the torture mechanisms the military use on the rebels, or alleged rebels, adding that the rebels had every reason to fight. She narrates the difficult life her people are experiencing in the countryside because of militarization. He asks if she has any plans of returning to her hometown. She says she no longer has a place to return to. The soldier decides to leave, and leaves money on the table. Insulted, the woman insults him back and asks why he even bothered to come. He admits that she reminds him of his sister. He tells her of the comrades he has lost to the rebels and how he is very much tempted to go AWOL, but his obligation to his family is stopping him. He notes that his sister has joined the rebellion and fears that one day, they might have to face each other in the battlefield. This time, the prostitute asks him if he ever plans to return home. The soldier says he no longer has a place to return to, and leaves. Alone once more, the prostitute laments the soldier&#x2019;s fate. Before blowing the candle out, she muses that maybe those who have decided to join the rebellion are in a much better disposition than they are."

Pira maintains his belief that a new seed shall bring the&nbsp;<em>sangkatauhan&nbsp;</em>(humanity) back to the way of life of their earliest forefathers.

Maynilad is sacked; Sulayman is captured and taken to Maalat (Malate). Ligaya flees to Lagyo (Ermita), is raped by Spanish soldiers and friars, and dies from shock and exhaustion. The wooden sculpture, Salamat&rsquo;s gift to Ligaya, is found and is believed to be the miraculous statue of the Virgin Mary, called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, which presently stands in the Ermita Church.

Only May-I, the baby, remains&mdash;the last legacy of his lost world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part 3, Pira, in exile at Maalat, is compelled to build cannons for the enemy. Alive, Salamat finds out about Pira&rsquo;s work for the enemy and curses the day he had Pira as his&nbsp;<em>guro&nbsp;</em>(teacher). Pira blinds himself so that the Spaniards can no longer make use of him. He and May-I leave for Laguna and the Makiling mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, Augusto de Legaspi, a descendant of Lakandula, grieves over the loss of his wife and property, stolen by friars. In the forest where he weeps, he hears Salamat&rsquo;s voice. He spreads the news that Salamat lives, and droves of people come to push the huge rock away from the mouth of the cave where Salamat has been imprisoned for 17 years. An armed insurrection erupts over land and sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part 4, the rebellion spreads, and Pira hears about it. Meanwhile, friars spread the rumor that May-I is an evil&nbsp;<em>encantada&nbsp;</em>(enchantress). People nearby, however, think of her as benevolent, and later call her Maria Makiling. The story goes that Maria falls in love with a young man, who, in his desire not to serve time as a soldier of the Spanish army, marries a mestiza belonging to the&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>(ruling class). Meanwhile, the rebellion is crushed due to the treachery of a government agent, Surabao. Salamat is hanged. Pira slowly wanes and from his deathbed summons Maria and tells her his whole life story.

The play was restaged by TP in 2009. It was also performed twice at the Armed Forces of the Philippines Theater, Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo, Quezon City, sponsored by the Department of National Defense and the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office. It was subsequently staged in 2014 at Bindlestiff Studio, San Francisco, using an English translation by Vera, directed by Lorna Velasco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play was based on Benjamin Pimentel&rsquo;s novel of the same title, published in 2007, which won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5443\">Juan C. Laya</a> Award for Fiction in the 2008 National Book Awards. The novel is based on Pimentel&rsquo;s English short story &ldquo;Waiting on Powell Street,&rdquo; which won the 1991 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5686\">Bienvenido Santos</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">Short Story</a> Writing Contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Five elderly Filipinos are shown waiting for their train along Powell Street in San Francisco. They do not have jobs and spend their days at this station, reminiscing about their past days during World War II, the women they have loved, and family members that they left behind in the Philippines. They long for the day when the US government will pass legislation that will allow them to claim benefits as veterans&mdash;a benefit that other veterans enjoy. They have filed a petition to be recognized and compensated as war veterans. From their conversations, it is revealed that they all share the common dream of dying in their homeland instead of in the USA. Ciriaco &ldquo;Tex&rdquo; Santos talks about his philandering wife, a Filipina who readily kicks him out of his own house after he took her in and promised to help her get a green card. Tex dies of a broken heart. The remaining men revise their wish to die in their homeland. Now they wish for their bodies to be sent back whole to the homeland, refusing to be cremated into ashes. But even this wish may not be granted to all of them as travel costs for the coffin is terribly expensive. As they pay their respects to the ashes of one of their fallen friends, a funny incident with the ashes leaves them all surprised. Soon, one by one, they pass away. Ruben talks about his sex life with the bombshell Svetlana. His time with her is the only thing that makes him feel alive. He suffers a heart attack in the middle of a &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; encounter. Fidel learns to accept the radical ideas of his son Arnel. He reminisces that his son&rsquo;s own life has paralleled his. Arnel became a guerrilla of the revolutionary movement in the 1980s. Fidel finds out that Arnel has been killed in his own fight for freedom and justice, through a fellow veteran who now works as a delivery man.

They do not have jobs and spend their days at this station, reminiscing about their past days during World War II, the women they have loved, and family members that they left behind in the Philippines. They long for the day when the US government will pass legislation that will allow them to claim benefits as veterans&#x2014;a benefit that other veterans enjoy. They have filed a petition to be recognized and compensated as war veterans. From their conversations, it is revealed that they all share the common dream of dying in their homeland instead of in the USA. Ciriaco &#x201C;Tex&#x201D; Santos talks about his philandering wife, a Filipina who readily kicks him out of his own house after he took her in and promised to help her get a green card. Tex dies of a broken heart. The remaining men revise their wish to die in their homeland. Now they wish for their bodies to be sent back whole to the homeland, refusing to be cremated into ashes. But even this wish may not be granted to all of them as travel costs for the coffin is terribly expensive. As they pay their respects to the ashes of one of their fallen friends, a funny incident with the ashes leaves them all surprised. Soon, one by one, they pass away. Ruben talks about his sex life with the bombshell Svetlana. His time with her is the only thing that makes him feel alive. He suffers a heart attack in the middle of a &#x201C;heavenly&#x201D; encounter. Fidel learns to accept the radical ideas of his son Arnel. He reminisces that his son&#x2019;s own life has paralleled his. Arnel became a guerrilla of the revolutionary movement in the 1980s. Fidel finds out that Arnel has been killed in his own fight for freedom and justice, through a fellow veteran who now works as a delivery man. In the end, the train these veteran guerrillas are waiting for arrives and the audience realizes that the station they are in is actually a holding area before moving on to the next life."

Inspiration struck UP Rep chairman Cecile de Joya when she saw fellow company officer, Raul Dealino, practicing his oral interpretation piece for a speech class. Dealino was using the poem by Lacaba, which was in the class manual. The first tula-dula performance of the play was then staged in Mater Dei.

Lola Basyang comes in with her cane, and introduces herself and the three tales she will recount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ang Prinsipeng Mahaba ang Ilong&rdquo; (The Prince with the Long Nose) is about a prince who would have been considered handsome, except for his kilometric nose, the result of a curse made by an unrequited suitor of the prince&rsquo;s mother, the queen. To take her son&rsquo;s mind off his nose, the queen advises the prince to pass the time away in the forest with his guard. They get lost in the forest, with the prince almost falling prey to a wild pig had it not been for a girl gathering firewood. Strangely, the girl, who has black skin, does not laugh at the prince&rsquo;s nose and instead builds a bonfire to keep the wild animals at bay. Just then, two denizens of the forest, Duling (Cross-eyed) and Bungal (Toothless), enter and make fun of both the prince&rsquo;s nose and the girl&rsquo;s black skin. But soon enough, Duling falls into a ravine and is saved and brought up from the ravine by the prince&rsquo;s nose. It is then that the girl articulates the moral of the story: that the goodness of a person&rsquo;s heart cannot be seen from the outside. The prince and the girl fall in love with each other, and because of that love, the prince&rsquo;s long nose is replaced with a normal one.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In &ldquo;Ang Binibining Tumalo sa Mahal na Hari&rdquo; (The Girl Who Bested the Great King), Sharay, the daughter of the slave of Datu Abdul, has fallen in love with the datu&rsquo;s son, Prinsipe Pido, and vice versa. Both have broken the datu&rsquo;s law that strictly forbids the love between a slave and a royale. To punish the presumptuous girl, Datu Abdul subjects her to three tests, which she must pass or die. The datu is sure that Sharay will not pass the tests because she is only a girl and he is the smartest man in the kingdom. Through his first slave Lamukot, the datu orders Sharay to kill a small&nbsp;<em>pipit&nbsp;</em>bird and make 12 tasty dishes out of it. Since the 12 viands will have to be placed on silver platters, Sharay asks the datu to turn her silver hairpin into 12 silver platters. Sharay passes the first test. In the second, the king orders Sharay to sell one sheep for an ounce of gold, but to bring it back to him together with the ounce of gold. Sharay challenges Lamukot to a riddling contest and wins the ounce of gold from the slave. She then sends the gold, the sheep, and a sheepskin to the king, the last as a gift. The datu and Lamukot are outwitted. In the third test, the datu orders Sharay to provide him with milk from a male carabao, so that his skin rashes, caused by Sharay&rsquo;s gift, will go away. He also announces that he will take a bath in the river to relieve the itch, and forbids anyone from washing anything in the river while he bathes. Deliberately, Sharay washes a mat full of blood in the river, polluting the waters and drenching the datu with blood. Angry, the datu asks Sharay why she broke his order. The girl reasons out that she had to immediately wash away the blood from the mat on which her father had just given birth. The blood was actually from a pig that was butchered on the mat. The datu says it is impossible for a male to give birth. By the same token, Sharay argues, a male carabao cannot produce milk. Impressed by the girl&rsquo;s wit, the datu repeals the law forbidding the union of slaves and princes, believing that Sharay&rsquo;s intelligence will work for the benefit of the kingdom. Indeed, he says, class differences should not be an obstacle to true love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In &ldquo;Ang Prinsipeng Duwag&rdquo; (The Cowardly Prince), the prince detests all forms of violence and instead loves music and art. Disgusted with a son who is a &ldquo;coward,&rdquo; the king banishes the prince from the kingdom. In the forest, he strays into another kingdom and there finds a princess, Malaya, who also loves music. They fall in love with each other. Soon the prince must hide because the Gurkos arrive, with instructions from their chief, who wants Malaya for himself at all costs, to torture anyone who courts Malaya. The prince hides but when the Gurkos threaten Malaya&rsquo;s life, he comes out of hiding and demolishes them all. The prince says he loves peace but he is prepared to go to war when necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trilogy retells three stories of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> for today&rsquo;s youth, editing them for conciseness, tweaking them to endorse feminist and other transformative values, and rewriting narration and dialogue into contemporary colloquial language, including street slang and&nbsp;<em>colegiala&nbsp;</em>(schoolgirl) English. The play exemplifies how traditional stories can acquire new meaning and relevance to the millennial generation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

The prince hides but when the Gurkos threaten Malaya&#x2019;s life, he comes out of hiding and demolishes them all. The prince says he loves peace but he is prepared to go to war when necessary."

Gunshots are fired and Hamida dismisses them as the new commander&rsquo;s way of showing off. Saliha realizes it may be a raid.

Farhana continues her tirades on Saliha&rsquo;s denial of listening to men&rsquo;s discussions, challenging her to reveal what the men in her family talk about.

Juhayra resolves to continue making patches. Hamida instructs Saliha to sit in the machine to work on the patches&rsquo; borders. Farhana complains again about Saliha. Saliha narrates her experience one morning when she was about to go to school and her classmates, including Farhana, left early so Saliha had to go on her own. She says on that morning, she passed by a battalion of soldiers. She was so scared she peed. She asks Farhana why they left her that morning. Farhana asks for forgiveness. Saliha decides to join the movement to fight for the Bangsamoro cause. She tells Farhana to continue the work she will leave behind, and that Farhana will be the best seamstress in the years to come.

A&nbsp;<em>manong&nbsp;</em>(elderly man) and a&nbsp;<em>manang&nbsp;</em>(elderly woman), however, call out at the door. They are looking for santos for the procession. Titay and Ambrosio welcome them, saying they have many such, &ldquo;mga natural na natural po&rdquo; (very real ones, sir). Titay lights their way to the next room, where they examine the three sweating saints. They are impressed with their naturalness, with their realistic sweating, with their suffering faces. Ambrosio and Titay&rsquo;s teasing remarks add to the rascals&rsquo; discomfiture. The manong and manang want all three, are quoted a price, and decide to take them. Ambrosio offers to show them a miracle, and holds his candle to the bald pate (or the bottom) of the kura, who drops his cross and runs, followed by the sakristan mayor and the piskal. Ambrosio draws his bolo, Titay restrains him, and the manong and manang fall to their knees, exclaiming: &ldquo;A miracle!

The play is set in the province of Rizal, in the middle-class apartment owned by Regina Calderon, a widow and a teacher of civics and government. She lives with her sister Ana, and her children Tony, Aida, and Ben. The plans being made and the tension revealed in the opening scene are slowly explained: Aida, who is turning 18, has been raped by the son of a town mayor. Regina, who believes in justice, is determined to sue. The mayor and a councilor come to see her and, indirectly but clearly, ask her to withdraw the case, citing the fruitlessness of her endeavor: the judge is a&nbsp;<em>compadre&nbsp;</em>(friend) of the mayor&rsquo;s and a &ldquo;<em>brad sa cursillo</em>&rdquo; (brother in the cursillo). When she asks the mayor what he would have felt if his daughter had been raped, he suggests that she avoid the pain of having her daughter cross-examined. When she counters that at the next election his son&rsquo;s crime will be known, the councilor reminds her that the mayor has been in office for 13 years. She declares that she will ask for a change of judge. The councilor asks which judge would not be on the mayor&rsquo;s side? When they offer her a check, she refuses, and they leave cursing. Tony agrees that suing would be fruitless, and argues for an Old Testament kind of justice: &ldquo;An eye for an eye &hellip;&rdquo; When his father was killed right in front of their house, he tells her, he pondered on what they should do, and found his answer in the Bible. He wants to kill the mayor&rsquo;s son while she insists on pursuing the case. He is sent out to buy medicine for Aida. She finds out that he has taken a gun with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the final scene, Tony comes running in: he has killed the mayor&rsquo;s son, and wants them all to flee. Regina refuses, and tells him to surrender and to give her the gun. The mayor and his men arrive, and Regina assures them that Tony will surrender peacefully. They grab Tony, and tell him to run&mdash;obviously to shoot him &ldquo;while resisting arrest.&rdquo; Regina shoots Tony. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asks the Mayor. &ldquo;Because you were going to kill him,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;You do not know the meaning of justice &hellip; Yes &hellip; take me to the precinct, to the court &hellip; anywhere. I will answer for my son&rsquo;s death. I killed my son &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The play has been performed again and again by different <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> groups, in different schools and settings.

The plans being made and the tension revealed in the opening scene are slowly explained: Aida, who is turning 18, has been raped by the son of a town mayor. Regina, who believes in justice, is determined to sue. The mayor and a councilor come to see her and, indirectly but clearly, ask her to withdraw the case, citing the fruitlessness of her endeavor: the judge is a&#xA0;<em>compadre&#xA0;</em>(friend) of the mayor&#x2019;s and a &#x201C;<em>brad sa cursillo</em>&#x201D; (brother in the cursillo). When she asks the mayor what he would have felt if his daughter had been raped, he suggests that she avoid the pain of having her daughter cross-examined. When she counters that at the next election his son&#x2019;s crime will be known, the councilor reminds her that the mayor has been in office for 13 years. She declares that she will ask for a change of judge. The councilor asks which judge would not be on the mayor&#x2019;s side? When they offer her a check, she refuses, and they leave cursing. Tony agrees that suing would be fruitless, and argues for an Old Testament kind of justice: &#x201C;An eye for an eye &#x2026;&#x201D; When his father was killed right in front of their house, he tells her, he pondered on what they should do, and found his answer in the Bible. He wants to kill the mayor&#x2019;s son while she insists on pursuing the case. He is sent out to buy medicine for Aida. She finds out that he has taken a gun with him."

The first person he visits is his childhood friend and sweetheart Maria Clara and her father Kapitan Tiago. He relates an encounter with San Diego&rsquo;s former parish priest Padre Damaso, who behaved coldly toward him despite his friendship with Don Rafael. As Kapitan Tiago dismisses him, he meets Maria Clara at the&nbsp;<em>azotea&nbsp;</em>(terrace) where they reaffirm their love for each other and plan their engagement. In the convent, Padre Damaso reveals that he has two letters containing the secret of Maria Clara&rsquo;s birth&mdash;he is Maria Clara&rsquo;s real father. He also reveals that he dislikes Ibarra for Maria Clara. Meanwhile, Ibarra goes to the cemetery where his father was interred, only to find that the body had been exhumed. The gravedigger admits to throwing the remains in the lake since he thought it a better fate for Don Rafael than to be buried in the Chinese cemetery, as originally instructed by the parish priest. Padre Salvi, the new parish priest of San Diego, brushes off Sisa who is looking for her missing sons Basilio and Crispin. There, Ibarra confronts Padre Salvi about his father&rsquo;s disinterment, only for the gravedigger to reveal that Padre Damaso, not Padre Salvi, ordered it. Ibarra and Padre Salvi cross paths again at Kapitan Tiago&rsquo;s house, where Ibarra, Maria Clara, and their friends meet before going to a picnic. The priest seemingly forgives Ibarra for his actions, even accepting the invitation to join them in the picnic and fishing at the lake. During the fishing, the nets are discovered to have entangled a crocodile. The boatman Elias, followed by Ibarra, jumps into the lake and successfully kills the crocodile. Later on, Ibarra and Tia Isabel talk about the new school he intends to put up in memory of his father with Padre Salvi, who disagrees with his ideas. Padre Salvi excuses himself, and begins plotting Ibarra&rsquo;s downfall. The second act opens with the social-climbing couple Donya Victorina and Don Tiburcio de Espada&ntilde;a making their grand entrance. Meanwhile, Kapitan Tiago reflects on his life: how he has befriended both the government and the church, how he has pandered to everyone, and how proud he is of having a daughter like Maria Clara. Later on, Padre Damaso has a talk with Kapitan Tiago, dissuading him on Maria Clara&rsquo;s engagement to Ibarra. Meanwhile, Elias secretly approaches Ibarra who is out with Maria Clara and their other friends, and warns him of a plot against him. A leper receives the pity of Maria Clara, who gives him a necklace she received from Kapitan Tiago. Once the leper leaves, Ibarra asks Elias why he should be trusted, to which Elias replies that he owes him his life. He introduces himself as the boatman from that incident with the crocodile. Ibarra and several others go to the site where the school is to be built. There, an incident ensues when the derrick suddenly falls apart, dropping the heavy block of stone hanging from it. Ibarra is unhurt, the only casualty being the yellowish man who operated the machine. Ibarra realizes that Elias is right and there are people out to destroy him. At dinner that night, Padre Damaso belittles Ibarra&rsquo;s foreign education and for putting up a school. It is only when Padre Damaso insults his father&rsquo;s honor that Ibarra lunges at the priest with a knife in hand, threatening to kill him. Fortunately Maria Clara intervenes. In the convent, Padre Salvi discovers the letters containing the secret of Maria Clara&rsquo;s birth, and resolves to use it as a way to steal her from Ibarra. Meanwhile, Ibarra and Maria Clara talk about Ibarra&rsquo;s excommunication from the church, and promise to stay true to each other despite the obstacle. Maria Clara falls sick with fever, and the de Espada&ntilde;a couple, with Don Tiburcio masquerading as a doctor, come over to heal her. His wife Donya Victorina intends to introduce her cousin Linares to Kapitan Tiago and Padre Damaso, a scheme to have him marry Maria Clara. Meanwhile, Maria Clara trades Ibarra&rsquo;s letter for the two letters Padre Salvi has. The final act begins with the end of Ibarra&rsquo;s excommunication. When he visits Maria Clara, he learns of the plans for her engagement with Linares. After, Ibarra meets with Elias at the lakeside. Elias suggests that because of Ibarra&rsquo;s education and position in society, he can ask the Spanish government to implement radical reforms including fewer privileges for religious corporations, security for citizens and more respect for a man&rsquo;s dignity. Ibarra objects and reasons that institutions such as the priesthood, religious corporations, and the civil guard are necessary evils that must be tolerated by the society. Meanwhile, Padre Salvi hatches an attack on the town, but intends to frame Ibarra for it. As Ibarra is arrested and thrown out of San Diego, an old man encourages him, saying that perhaps the country is not ready for the changes Ibarra is pushing for. Before Ibarra&rsquo;s escape, he meets Maria Clara in secret one last time. There, Maria Clara reveals the secret contained in the letters. The play ends with Maria Clara and Ibarra bidding farewell to their love, before Maria joins the other nuns of the convent, while Ibarra stands powerless to do anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2011 production served as the launch of a national campaign, in cooperation with the Commision on Higher Education and the Department of Education, to encourage high school students to join forces with the Kabataang Rizal Movement to promote Rizal&rsquo;s ideas and vision for the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The musical has gone through several restagings since then, and toured several countries such as the United States, Malaysia, and Japan.

Boulasem,&nbsp;<em>gran pasha&nbsp;</em>(a political and military rank or title in the Ottoman Empire) of Tedents or Flea, suspects the Sultan Mahamud of Marruecos of hatching a plot to kill him. He has the latter assassinated. His sons Abdalap and Orosman meet and fall madly in love with Zafira, the murdered sultan&rsquo;s beautiful daughter&mdash;to the woe of Zelima, Abdalap&rsquo;s sweetheart and daughter of the&nbsp;<em>almansor&nbsp;</em>earlier deposed by Mahamud. While Zafira vows revenge on Boulasem and all his kin and repeatedly repulses Abdalap&rsquo;s attentions and preferred protection, she falls in love with Orosman, who time and again snatches her from danger. Defeated in her first battle, Zafira joins forces with Zelim, pasha of Duquela and another aspirant to the throne of Marruecos, for another bid to overthrow Boulasem. Partly through treachery, Boulasem&rsquo;s army under Abdalap&rsquo;s command wins again. After this triumph, Abdalap dethrones and exiles his father, who had forbidden his love for Zafira and ordered him to wed Gulnara instead. Abdalap then dishonors Zelima, orders Gulnara to be forced into his seraglio on the morrow, jails Orosman, and threatens Zafira to have Orosman beheaded in her presence if she does not capitulate to his desire. Moving swiftly, Zafira, Zelima, and Gulnara join Zelim and Aldervesin in hatching and executing a plan that leads Abdalap to his death by Zelima&rsquo;s sword&mdash;and Orosman out of prison and up to the throne of Marruecos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong> deviates from standard komedya formulae: there is no Moro-Christian conflict, and heroes as well as villains are such because of character rather than religion. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by T.

His sons Abdalap and Orosman meet and fall madly in love with Zafira, the murdered sultan&#x2019;s beautiful daughter&#x2014;to the woe of Zelima, Abdalap&#x2019;s sweetheart and daughter of the&#xA0;<em>almansor&#xA0;</em>earlier deposed by Mahamud. While Zafira vows revenge on Boulasem and all his kin and repeatedly repulses Abdalap&#x2019;s attentions and preferred protection, she falls in love with Orosman, who time and again snatches her from danger. Defeated in her first battle, Zafira joins forces with Zelim, pasha of Duquela and another aspirant to the throne of Marruecos, for another bid to overthrow Boulasem. Partly through treachery, Boulasem&#x2019;s army under Abdalap&#x2019;s command wins again. After this triumph, Abdalap dethrones and exiles his father, who had forbidden his love for Zafira and ordered him to wed Gulnara instead. Abdalap then dishonors Zelima, orders Gulnara to be forced into his seraglio on the morrow, jails Orosman, and threatens Zafira to have Orosman beheaded in her presence if she does not capitulate to his desire. Moving swiftly, Zafira, Zelima, and Gulnara join Zelim and Aldervesin in hatching and executing a plan that leads Abdalap to his death by Zelima&#x2019;s sword&#x2014;and Orosman out of prison and up to the throne of Marruecos."

First staged by the University of the Philippines College Baguio (UPCB) Summer Theater Arts Workshop at the UPCB Auditorium in Baguio City on 12 May 1978. The script is included in the playwright&rsquo;s collection of plays titled <strong><em>Ang Katutubo at Dalawa Pang Dula</em></strong> (The Native and Two More Plays), 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play is about a family whose luck in the city has run out and is forced to return to the barrio. Headed by Saro and his wife Dolor, they settle in an unfinished house by the cemetery in the small town where Saro grew up. While daughter Lucila tends to the plants around the house, she encounters a woman who asks for some of Lucila&rsquo;s roses. The woman boasts about her vast garden filled with all kinds of flowers. Lucila asks to visit the garden sometime. The woman agrees and leaves saying that she needs to find her husband. As she leaves, the woman sings a song about a lost lover. Meanwhile, Saro meets up with an old friend Huse, and the two reminisce about their time as musicians. Saro remembers the city&rsquo;s filth and delights in his hometown&rsquo;s rich soil and fresh air. Huse insists that their town is no longer the heaven that Saro remembers it to be. He speaks of the troubles their musician friends went through, about the farmers going hungry, the thugs terrorizing the townsfolk, and the selfishness that now marks the townspeople. The family has dinner while listening to the broadcast of a radio play written by their firstborn Pepe about two separated lovers&mdash;an affluent woman and a man barely surviving as a broadcaster and playwright. Their second son, Karlos, who was assaulted by thugs, is brought home by Saro&rsquo;s old friend and the cemetery&rsquo;s caretaker Felix. Saro finds that Felix has been doing better than when they were still musicians. Their conversation is interrupted when Huse arrives and accuses Felix of molesting his daughter. Felix denies this and before things escalate into a fistfight, Saro convinces them to sleep it off and meet as friends the day after. Toward the end, when all is settled, the family hears someone sobbing. They find the woman, whom Lucila spoke with. She says that she could not find her husband. The family tries to comfort her by saying that he will surely return. Saro asks the woman where she lives and she points to the cemetery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written and staged during martial law, the play brings attention to the plight of the informal settlers who have nowhere else to go and are forced to live in a space reserved for the dead.

Padre Salvi reaches the long, narrow bridge in search of the woman to whom, in life, he had been unjust. His journey is an act of penitence; every step he takes is like walking knee-deep in a mire of ashes. Every moment, he is assailed by his conscience, as shadows of the past creep into his senses. The priest returns to his former parish to fulfill a promise: to pray over the grave of Sisa, and to ask for forgiveness. Along the way, he meets two fishers and two woodcutters, carrying on their backs the day&rsquo;s labor: cut wood and a net of fish. From them he finds out that Sisa has been cremated, and no one knows where her body and that of the man Elias were burned. The restless soul of Sisa roams the surface of the earth, dressed in a bright yellow gown of jusi adorned with gold beads, but underneath she still wears her old, patched clothes. Masked by a yellow ribbon, she walks very slowly, and at times swings her body round in full abandon. Her two sons, Crispin and Basilio, also roam the earth barefoot, masked, and wearing the patched black shirts and loose pants of their poverty. Amazed, Padre Salvi falters in his speech when he asks the woman if she is Sisa. He wails, seeing the woman who would not allow his mind to rest. She, whom he thought was in ashes, is now standing before him, cursing him for his unjust treatment of her children and family. Sisa recalls her frailty, freezing with fright, feeling the pain of her children&rsquo;s bruised palms whenever she heard the church bells ring. Her children who were her only joy had been wrongly accused of stealing church money, and the iniquitous priest beat them and locked them up inside the church tower. Basilio escapes, and seeing his mother walking aimlessly in the streets, calls out and runs to her, tears streaming down his cheeks. Sisa, thinking the calls were those of her accusers, runs and hides behind a wall. Basilio climbs the wall to convince his mother that it is her beloved son, calling out to her. He loses his balance and falls in front of Sisa, who recognizes him. The sight of her bloodied son snaps Sisa&rsquo;s last thread of sanity. Branded as a prostitute, a leech, and mother of thieves, she realizes that the dignity of the poor is as thin as a strand of thread. With her last breath Sisa bewails the misfortunes of her poor family, as she accepts the fire that burns every inch of her body, in that darkest and longest day of her life. As the sea calms, Padre Salvi asks Sisa to calm the raging waves in his heart as he promises to pray always for her soul. Sisa thanks the priest, but tells him to pray for himself, a slave of his own weaknesses. As she bids goodbye, Sisa repeats the last words uttered by Elias before he breathed his last: &ldquo;I shall die without even seeing the break of dawn &hellip; in my beloved country; you, who shall witness this event, do not forget us, who fell in the midst of the dark night.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play adapts the idea (restless souls) and technique (slow movement, chanting) of a Japanese Noh drama, using a <strong>koro</strong> or chorus (as in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><em>pasyon</em></a>) to narrate the movement of a play carved out from the <strong><em>Noli</em></strong>, and thus from Philippine fiction and history. <strong><em>Paglalakbay</em></strong> won third prize in the CCP Literary Contest in 1976. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Malou L.

The text of the play, together with cassette tapes of one performance and a minus one of the same performance, was published by CCP in its sarsuwela series in 1991 to aid those who want to mount the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sarsuwela is one of the most famous in the country. Act 1 opens on the grounds of Club Bagongtao, where a party is ongoing to celebrate Ricardo&rsquo;s having finished his course in medicine. His friend Martin deems it a &ldquo;new weapon&rdquo; that can open new paths: to finding a beautiful wife who can accompany him to a career in politics, and giving him license to kill with impunity. Ricardo loves Estrella, a&nbsp;<em>mahinhing dalaga&nbsp;</em>(demure maiden), but is being pursued by Caridad, a flirt. Caridad&rsquo;s mother, Do&ntilde;a Carmen, talks rich and dresses young, while her father, Don Torcuato, lives in his past since he figured in the Revolution of 1898. Ricardo&rsquo;s buddies (Martin, Felipe, and Luis) and Estrella&rsquo;s friends (Maring, Liling, and Pakita) aid and abet the action.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 transfers the cast and action to the countryside, where Ricardo hosts a picnic for his friends. Love is blossoming between Ricardo and Estrella, while Caridad is determined to make him her fianc&eacute;. She plies him with champagne, and when they emerge from the fisher&rsquo;s hut at the&nbsp;<em>palaisdaan&nbsp;</em>(fishpond), her parents demand that he uphold her honor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 3 opens on Maring&rsquo;s birthday party, with all the friends present except Estrella, who sends a present and a letter explaining the sadness in her heart. When Estrella arrives, Ricardo declares himself, explains that he was not at fault, and is forgiven. Their engagement is announced, to Caridad&rsquo;s consternation. When Ricardo is confronted by Do&ntilde;a Carmen, he produces proof of a liaison between Caridad and Don Juanito, and all ends well for the sweethearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></em></strong> is a pleasant comedy of manners that presents and comments on Filipinos when they were turning from their Spanish to their Yankee years.

He brings home his radical ideas and forms a radical group, in which he involves his younger brother Aristeo, who has been an armchair revolutionary all this time. Failing to apply his theories to the present conditions of his country, Homer resigns from his post as political education officer of the central committee, believing that radicalism has turned his family into a bunch of cold-blooded executioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aristeo develops into a real revolutionary, committed but always seeking answers to his questions, and refusing to blind himself to what he sees as the inherent contradictions of Marxist-Leninist theories. A writer, he has a firm grasp of Philippine reality during that time and sees armed struggle as a mere tactical move to even out the odds against the superior arms of the Japanese.

Aristeo is buried in the central plains and Homer is reduced to an opportunistic lawyer who earns from helping the rich reclaim the wealth they lost during the war. On the run, Jaime has a last mission to accomplish: to annihilate Homer, whom he believes has betrayed him and Aristeo, and the revolution Homer himself convinced them to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homer knows that he has a political debt to pay, and fears the day when his youngest brother would come to collect it. One day, before break of dawn, Jaime finally arrives, worn-out and restless. Afraid that the authorities would trace Jaime to the house and consequently find out his previous involvement ending his career, Homer pulls out his gun to drive out his brother, but it is too late. Jaime has already planted a bomb by the door, and carries another in a box; both are timed to explode simultaneously.

Later, Ilagan expanded and translated it into Filipino, which was the version staged in the Philippines. The Filipino translation was first staged by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">University of the Philippines (UP) Repertory Company</a> on 18 Aug 1977 at the <a href=\"http://https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2975\">Wilfrido Ma.

It was toured by the same company to different schools, and in 1980 and 1984 was restaged at the original venue. Other productions were reportedly done by various groups in Manila, Pampanga, Cebu, Dagupan, and Iligan. The play has been translated into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, and has had at least 100 performances until 1984. It was published in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/719\"><em><strong>Kamao: Mga Dula ng Protesta 1970-1986</strong></em></a> (Fist: Plays of Protest 1970-1986), 1987, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5667\">Alfrredo Navarro Salanga</a> et al.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play takes on the structure of the Catholic Mass as a theological instrument and symbol, with the priest not merely an interpreter of the Word or the world but an active participant in changing both. An altar at center stage is the focus of action, and around the celebrant is a congregation of peasants, workers, students, tribal minorities, urban poor and professionals, interacting with the priest and relating their daily struggles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mass has three divisions: the Preparation, the Consecration, and the Communion. In part 1, the Gospel is read, followed by the sermon, with the parable of the Good Samaritan as theme. The scene is simultaneously enacted in mime, depicting Inang Pilipinas (Mother Philippines) as under attack from three robbers costumed as imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. Two men of prominent and noble positions ignore the prostrate victim, while the Samaritan, shown as a peasant or laborer (or in Pagsambang Bayan II, 1980, an armed man from the hills), comes to her aid. Part 2 is a symbolic transformation of bread and wine into Christ&rsquo;s body and blood. As the people participate in the transformation, they themselves are transformed, just as the priest in the play is, dedicating himself to the pursuit of peace and equality and to the liberation of the poor and oppressed. Part 3 is a collective partaking of the body and blood of Christ. The sacrament of the Holy Eucharist and the Thanksgiving are meaningfully depicted in the play as the priest changes from liturgical robes into the attire of the masses, and ties a bolo to his waist, showing his union with the people and acceptance of his new role as a coworker and liberator. As the ritual draws to a close, the priest and congregation become one in stirring resolve to continue Christ&rsquo;s work in this world in the only manner that can be considered meaningful today.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Pagsambang Bayan I</strong></em> featured a communion of puto (rice cake); a collection for the urban poor, detainees, and others; and hymns and biblical passages relevant to the issues of the time incorporated in the lines. <em><strong>Pagsambang Bayan III</strong></em>, staged after the Aquino assassination, was much more direct in its protest, featuring slide projections that laid the blame for the Aquino murder squarely at the<br />\r\nfeet of the Marcos regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the play was staged during the martial law period, fear of military harassment and arrest was always in the air; in fact, Cervantes, together with the musical director, was arrested during the 21 Sep 1977 performance in a Tondo slum area. Ilagan, fresh from a 22-month detention, was ordered to submit a copy of the play. A production in Samar never opened due to military harassment. International papers and magazines mentioned the play as a sign of the resurgent people&rsquo;s movement and the early cracking of the Marcos rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Pagsambang Bayan</strong></em> won in the 1977 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3144\">Palihang Aurelio V.

Cast: Members of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP). Pagsambang Bayan was written for a liturgical conference of NCCP in Hong Kong in 1976. Later, Ilagan expanded and translated it into Filipino, which was the version staged in the Philippines. The Filipino translation was first staged by the <a href=\"/7/60/3338\">University of the Philippines (UP) Repertory Company</a> on 18 Aug 1977 at the <a href=\"http:///7/7/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>&#xA0;Theater in UP Diliman, under the direction of <a href=\"/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a> and set design by <a href=\"/3/3/3517\">Rafael del Casal</a>. The cast includes: Orestes Ojeda, Jerry Fernandez, <a href=\"/7/7/3271\">Armand Sta. Ana</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3120\">Madeleine Nicolas</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3073\">Ces Mangay</a>, Nimfa Camacho, Rene Agbayani, Cris Gosalvez, Teza Mendoza, and the UP Repertory Company ensemble. It was toured by the same company to different schools, and in 1980 and 1984 was restaged at the original venue. Other productions were reportedly done by various groups in Manila, Pampanga, Cebu, Dagupan, and Iligan. The play has been translated into <a href=\"/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, and <a href=\"/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, and has had at least 100 performances until 1984. It was published in <a href=\"/7/59/719\"><em><strong>Kamao: Mga Dula ng Protesta 1970-1986</strong></em></a> (Fist: Plays of Protest 1970-1986), 1987, edited by <a href=\"/9/9/5667\">Alfrredo Navarro Salanga</a> et al."

				"value": "The play takes on the structure of the Catholic Mass as a theological instrument and symbol, with the priest not merely an interpreter of the Word or the world but an active participant in changing both. An altar at center stage is the focus of action, and around the celebrant is a congregation of peasants, workers, students, tribal minorities, urban poor and professionals, interacting with the priest and relating their daily struggles."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The Mass has three divisions: the Preparation, the Consecration, and the Communion. In part 1, the Gospel is read, followed by the sermon, with the parable of the Good Samaritan as theme. The scene is simultaneously enacted in mime, depicting Inang Pilipinas (Mother Philippines) as under attack from three robbers costumed as imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. Two men of prominent and noble positions ignore the prostrate victim, while the Samaritan, shown as a peasant or laborer (or in Pagsambang Bayan II, 1980, an armed man from the hills), comes to her aid. Part 2 is a symbolic transformation of bread and wine into Christ&#x2019;s body and blood. As the people participate in the transformation, they themselves are transformed, just as the priest in the play is, dedicating himself to the pursuit of peace and equality and to the liberation of the poor and oppressed. Part 3 is a collective partaking of the body and blood of Christ. The sacrament of the Holy Eucharist and the Thanksgiving are meaningfully depicted in the play as the priest changes from liturgical robes into the attire of the masses, and ties a bolo to his waist, showing his union with the people and acceptance of his new role as a coworker and liberator. As the ritual draws to a close, the priest and congregation become one in stirring resolve to continue Christ&#x2019;s work in this world in the only manner that can be considered meaningful today."

In an old theater that shows old <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> movies, Valentin, the theater projectionist, is drinking with Toto, the young janitor that Valentin hired. On his natal day, Valentin ends up narrating his life story. The characters of that story enter from the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Diding, the beautiful daughter of Senyor Marcelo, Valentin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> teacher, has been the object of his affection since they were children. Senyor Alfonso, the owner of the theater and producer of the <strong>sarsuwela</strong>, recruits Diding, who wants to be an actress. Alfonso asks Valentin to teach Diding the songs, and Valentin obliges but demands that Diding should communicate not with her beauty but with her soul. Carlota, Alfonso&rsquo;s Spanish wife and principal actress, overhears Valentin&rsquo;s statement and reminisces about her golden days as an actress in Madrid, where she was sought after by so many suitors although she knew she was not a real artist. Then Carlota falls in love with Deodato, a young medical student, who later kills himself. She ends up with Alfonso whom she has never loved. In fact, Carlota has had a string of lovers, the last one being the native Basilio, who also commits suicide. After Basilio&rsquo;s death, Alfonso stops coming home to Carlota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Valentin is horrified to discover Diding in bed with Alfonso. She explains that she gave herself to the director for the promise of stardom. But, at rehearsals, Alfonso shames her, ordering the devil character to grab Diding&rsquo;s breast. Diding protests that she is not a prostitute. Alfonso later reveals that he had paid 50 silver pieces to Diding&rsquo;s mother for the girl&rsquo;s virginity and another thousand pesos to make Diding his wife. In despair, she tries to drown herself in the river but Valentin saves her, as he once saved her from a rampaging carriage that then ran over Valentin&rsquo;s leg and gave him a limp for life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Mang Juan, the man who hired Valentin for the theater, Valentin joins the Katipunan but the two are found out and arrested. Carlota is able to save Valentin&rsquo;s life, and makes love to her in gratitude. Knowing how deeply in love Valentin is with Diding, Carlota tells him to save the pregnant Diding from Alfonso, who has threatened to kill her after finding out about her condition. He is certain the paternity is not his, because he is sterile. Valentin and Diding try to escape but Valentin is shot by a&nbsp;<em>guardia civil&nbsp;</em>(constable) and incarcerated in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, where another prisoner, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, ministers to his wounds. Out from prison, Valentin learns of Diding&rsquo;s death. He exhumes Diding&rsquo;s body, slits her stomach open, and sees the bullet embedded in the heart of his unborn child. He swears to avenge the death of both mother and child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the two guardias civiles Alfonso hired to arrest Valentin are found dead, hanging on the main stage of the theater. Alfonso shakes with fear and Carlota laughs at him. A confrontation ensues and Alfonso admits to killing Deodato and all of Carlota&rsquo;s lovers, including Basilio. Carlota decides to leave Alfonso for good, but he shoots her dead. Alfonso sells the theater and hides. Valentin takes over the theater and buries Diding&rsquo;s body under the main stage, so that Diding can rise from her grave and sing a song onstage any time she wishes to. The spirit of Diding does appear onstage to tell Valentin how Alfonso prevented her from visiting him in jail by chaining her to the bed and later shooting her. Unable to hunt down Alfonso, who has fled to Spain, Valentin devotes himself to a higher cause, which is the revolution against Spain and, later, the war against America. He ends up with Sakay who gives him a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Americans take over, Valentin goes back to the theater and reinvents himself as the local Charlie Chaplin. Later, he works as a projectionist for the movies, still in pursuit of Alfonso. One day, he finds Alfonso&mdash;now acting on the screen.

It was published in the 1989 Script Series Program of the CCP Coordinating Center for Dramatic Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This play is set in the G. Mirasol and Sons store, in the cramped stockroom above the display and customer area, from where clerks hurl down through a chute the shoe models and colors requested by salespersons below. The denizens of this &ldquo;square paradise&rdquo; are Simplicia Cruz or Isya, the heroine, who is in her early 20s; Emy, single and fun loving; and Belen, married and unhappy. Tomas, the janitor, is a frequent visitor; Ate Pastora Dimagiba, spinster and head saleslady, is the voice of authority and keeper of the rules. The higher authority is the voice of Don Gerardo Mirasol, owner of the store, whose precepts and tenets on Mirashoes and the organization occasionally issue from the loudspeaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>True to her name, Isya is simple and content with her job, especially since she has been awarded a medal for seven years of loyal and efficient service. Belen complains not about her work but about her marriage and her husband&rsquo;s treatment of her (e.g., he refuses to take her to the company picnic), while Emy&rsquo;s discontent is with the job, the hours, the pay, and the oppression by Ate Pastora. Isya&rsquo;s secure little world changes when Alberto Reyes, a new employee, is admitted into it. She and Al start by sharing lunch, then their lives, dreams, then feelings, and when he tells her, &ldquo;Leave this place. You&rsquo;ll get nowhere, staying here,&rdquo; she is shaken, and at first cannot understand his anger. He says, &ldquo;I am angry &hellip; at all the shoeboxes &hellip; at my mother and all mothers like her &hellip; at all the Simplicia Cruzes in this world because they have no ambitions &hellip; at all the Alberto Reyeses in this world because they have high ambitions yet nothing will happen in spite of all their efforts &hellip; at this whole world &hellip; at this life.&rdquo; The walls of her paradise crumble. In the end, Isya decides not to follow Al; she turns her back on happiness, and decides to stick to her little corner of &ldquo;paradise.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play has been called one of the best structured, and is one of the most often performed, one-act plays in the country. It is, the playwright writes in the introduction, &ldquo;about human beings, ambitious and ambitionless, virtuous and vicious together &hellip; about the simple, the common, the unknown, the popular and the poor, the rude &hellip;<em>a kuwentong-masa&nbsp;</em>(story of the masses).&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Doreen G.

The book won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5489\">Manila Critics Circle</a> Award in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The play alludes to <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s sarsuwela <strong><em>Filipinas para los Filipinos</em></strong> (Filipino Women for Filipino Men), 1905, which Tiongson was asked by St. Paul College to update for presentation in 1978. The original conflict based on reactions to the Davis Bill prohibiting American women from marrying Filipino men, was changed to &ldquo;the bigger conflict of the First Decade between Filipino and American interest in the economy (the American attempt to monopolize the tobacco industry), in politics (Federalistas vs Nacionalistas), and in culture and education (the Americanized vs the Nationalist).&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was a new sarsuwela, <strong><em>Pilipinas circa</em></strong><strong><em>1907</em></strong>, which opens in the elegant home of Se&ntilde;ora Pilar on Arlegui St in Quiapo. Her daughter Leonor loves Emilio, a nationalist poet, but is also courted by Robert, an American. Pura, her cousin, who stays with her, loves Andres, a worker. Bad news comes in a newspaper announcing the upcoming nuptials of Emilio and Patria Gatlaya of Malolos, Bulacan. Deeply hurt, Leonor is upbraided by Emilio for going around with Robert. She pleads that her Uncle Pardo has asked her to entertain him, and she cannot refuse. At Leonor&rsquo;s birthday party, the&nbsp;<em>ilustrados&nbsp;</em>(the educated) led by her Uncle Pardo are ranged against the folk: Andres, Juan the family servant, and the workers at Germinal, the family-owned tobacco factory that Pardo is plotting to sell to the Americans. Also revealed are Pardo&rsquo;s pro-American feelings, echoed by the Americanized girls who see Americanization as progress, and the nationalist sentiments of Emilio, the workers, Andres, Pura, and Se&ntilde;ora Pilar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 2, the lovers&rsquo; differences are cleared up when Emilio reveals the symbolism of his supposed engagement: Patria Gatlaya is named for Motherland and Independence, and Malolos is the birthplace of the First Republic. Andres bids Pura goodbye. Pardo has the workers who opposed him arrested, and is now looking for Andres and Emilio. Avoiding prison, Andres decides to join the revolutionaries fighting the Americans in the hills. Emilio is arrested by soldiers and Pardo, who strikes his sister Pilar for disowning him as traitor, is attacked by the workers. In the tussle, a Germinal worker is killed. Leonor decides that the only way to save Emilio is for her to marry Robert as Pardo wishes. At the wedding, however, she refuses to take Robert as husband, because, she reveals, he is already married. Dorothy, who had come to the country ostensibly to marry Porong, a musician, is revealed as the wife Robert had abandoned in the United States. The play ends with Emilio freed, Pura leaving to join Andres in the hills, and the chorus singing &ldquo;Philippines for the Filipinos.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although clad in the raiment of old&mdash;choruses, love linking two gallant heroes and two beautiful heroines, comic songs by Juan and the girls, period manners, and domestic situations&mdash;this sarsuwela has contemporary accents: tragedy, reality, problem, and solution. The manner, humor, and language of an earlier period make a point for today, which proves that the sarsuwela can take in new content while retaining its old charm. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

The original conflict based on reactions to the Davis Bill prohibiting American women from marrying Filipino men, was changed to &#x201C;the bigger conflict of the First Decade between Filipino and American interest in the economy (the American attempt to monopolize the tobacco industry), in politics (Federalistas vs Nacionalistas), and in culture and education (the Americanized vs the Nationalist).&#x201D;"

Her daughter Leonor loves Emilio, a nationalist poet, but is also courted by Robert, an American. Pura, her cousin, who stays with her, loves Andres, a worker. Bad news comes in a newspaper announcing the upcoming nuptials of Emilio and Patria Gatlaya of Malolos, Bulacan. Deeply hurt, Leonor is upbraided by Emilio for going around with Robert. She pleads that her Uncle Pardo has asked her to entertain him, and she cannot refuse. At Leonor&#x2019;s birthday party, the&#xA0;<em>ilustrados&#xA0;</em>(the educated) led by her Uncle Pardo are ranged against the folk: Andres, Juan the family servant, and the workers at Germinal, the family-owned tobacco factory that Pardo is plotting to sell to the Americans. Also revealed are Pardo&#x2019;s pro-American feelings, echoed by the Americanized girls who see Americanization as progress, and the nationalist sentiments of Emilio, the workers, Andres, Pura, and Se&#xF1;ora Pilar."

Andres bids Pura goodbye. Pardo has the workers who opposed him arrested, and is now looking for Andres and Emilio. Avoiding prison, Andres decides to join the revolutionaries fighting the Americans in the hills. Emilio is arrested by soldiers and Pardo, who strikes his sister Pilar for disowning him as traitor, is attacked by the workers. In the tussle, a Germinal worker is killed. Leonor decides that the only way to save Emilio is for her to marry Robert as Pardo wishes. At the wedding, however, she refuses to take Robert as husband, because, she reveals, he is already married. Dorothy, who had come to the country ostensibly to marry Porong, a musician, is revealed as the wife Robert had abandoned in the United States. The play ends with Emilio freed, Pura leaving to join Andres in the hills, and the chorus singing &#x201C;Philippines for the Filipinos.&#x201D;"

The manner, humor, and language of an earlier period make a point for today, which proves that the sarsuwela can take in new content while retaining its old charm. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><strong><em>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

When Alvaro, who had ordered Rodante beheaded in front of his parents, is condemned to death for his crimes, it is Porciana, the Moorish princess, who asks that Alvaro be forgiven after having met San Dionisio, patron saint of the barrio, who preached love for one&rsquo;s enemies.

It was revived by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3334\">University of the Philippines (UP)&nbsp;Anak-Tibawan</a> in 1980 and restaged by the same company in 1983 at the Little Theater of the Rizal Hall, UP Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play portrays a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> troupe in rehearsal and in production. Colas, the director, worries about attacks on the komedya by the <strong>sarsuwelista</strong> (<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> performers); Ichay worries about salaries and about a Spanish suitor. The rehearsal proceeds with incidents that parody the true-life situation in reverse and with comic events that make the acting, the conventions like the <strong>ditso</strong> (declamatory style), the <strong>batalla</strong> (fight scenes), the <strong>dikta</strong> (prompting), and the play itself look ridiculous. In the last scene, those sent to announce the play run in to say that they have been stoned in Divisoria; that the actors Ratia, Carvajal, and Titay Molina refuse to act in the komedya; and only fishers and market vendors watch them. They all agree to bury the komedya in a coffin which bears the letters &ldquo;R.I.P.&rdquo; (<em>requiescat in pace</em>or rest in peace).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The komedya performers protest against this play by riding past Reyes&rsquo;s house in costume and on horseback, stoning it, and shouting &ldquo;We cannot die!&rdquo; They also stage a work by Juan Bartolome, <strong><em>Kailanman Ay Buhay, E.P.D. y Resurrexit</em></strong> (Forever Alive, E.P.D. It Rose Again), at the Teatro Nuevo Sol on Calle Diaz, which attacks Reyes and threatens the actors, causing Ilagan to desist from further appearances in the play. Although <strong><em>R.I.P</em></strong>. did not quite kill the komedya which continued to flourish in the provinces, it did mark the ascendance of the sarsuwela over the komedya in Manila, and the beginning of its reign of popularity. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

It was revived by the <a href=\"/7/7/3334\">University of the Philippines (UP)&#xA0;Anak-Tibawan</a> in 1980 and restaged by the same company in 1983 at the Little Theater of the Rizal Hall, UP Manila."

Colas, the director, worries about attacks on the komedya by the <strong>sarsuwelista</strong> (<a href=\"/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> performers); Ichay worries about salaries and about a Spanish suitor. The rehearsal proceeds with incidents that parody the true-life situation in reverse and with comic events that make the acting, the conventions like the <strong>ditso</strong> (declamatory style), the <strong>batalla</strong> (fight scenes), the <strong>dikta</strong> (prompting), and the play itself look ridiculous. In the last scene, those sent to announce the play run in to say that they have been stoned in Divisoria; that the actors Ratia, Carvajal, and Titay Molina refuse to act in the komedya; and only fishers and market vendors watch them. They all agree to bury the komedya in a coffin which bears the letters &#x201C;R.I.P.&#x201D; (<em>requiescat in pace</em>or rest in peace)."

Although <strong><em>R.I.P</em></strong>. did not quite kill the komedya which continued to flourish in the provinces, it did mark the ascendance of the sarsuwela over the komedya in Manila, and the beginning of its reign of popularity. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

To this Merto says no, as is his answer to Anding&rsquo;s inquiry on having a new roommate. Anding is glad and asks how Merto is, because the gardener and the social worker have noticed that Merto has turned into a loner of late and has often been seen musing to himself.

Asking about their formerly shared room, Merto shares that nothing has changed and that the vase is still there, the one from which Anding took the dried rose flower when he left.

Merto answers red. Anding says that red roses do not grow there. Merto apologizes. Anding says he is now giving Merto the photo album as a sign that he is not leaving anymore, and asks for him to open the last leaf of the photo album.

It is the last in a trilogy of journey plays along with <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/521\"><strong>Bombita</strong></a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong>Biyaheng Timog</strong></a></em></strong> (Southern Journey), all of which were published in <strong><em>Tatlong Paglalakbay: The Collected Works of Tony Perez Volume 4</em></strong> (Three Journeys: The Collected Works of Tony Perez Volume 4), 2007. Earlier, the play was published in English translation in <strong><em>Modern ASEAN Plays:&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Philippines</em></strong>, 1992, edited by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>. This triad was inspired by the separate adventures of the brothers Don Pedro, Don Diego, and Don Juan in capturing the<em>i bong&nbsp;</em>Adarna (Adarna bird). Their journeys paralleled the personal journey of the three protagonists in Perez&rsquo;s plays (Tiongson 1992, 95). In 2005, Dennis Marasigan adapted the play to a film with the same title, starring Irma Adlawan and John Arcilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><strong>Sa North Diversion Road</strong></em></strong> presents 10 scenes, in different cars featuring 10 different couples&rsquo; marital infidelity, as they drive along the North Diversion Road, later known as the North Luzon Expressway. The first, called &ldquo;Ace of Hearts,&rdquo; is about a wife confronting her husband about his cheating by divulging the extent of what she knows. He confesses to the crime, but adds that he has been cheating on her much longer than she had suspected. He then reveals that he and his mistress love each other. The wife thanks him for being honest. The second, called &ldquo;Slippery When Wet,&rdquo; is about a woman crying and cursing at her unfaithful man who continues to pacify her with sweet words and assurance that she is the only woman he loves. However, it is clear that he is unrepentant. The third, called &ldquo;The Orange Light,&rdquo; centers on a couple outshouting each other with exchanges of the most uninhibited expletives, even saying they regret marrying each other. The man asks the woman why she is behaving this way and she reveals having visited and warned his mistress thrice. Accused of meddling, the woman threatens to attack the mistress but is warned that he will side with his mistress if anything breaks out. The woman threatens to jump off the bridge but the husband encourages her to do so. The woman opens the door but closes it again&mdash;she cannot do it. The fourth, called &ldquo;The Conversation,&rdquo; is on a man and woman engaging in a silent game of dominance and submission. It ends with the woman exclaiming she knows of the man&rsquo;s infidelity. The fifth, called &ldquo;The Ride,&rdquo; opens with the man and woman talking about their marriage. Having decided that they cannot live with infidelity, and after a final confession of love and forgiveness, they commit suicide. The sixth, called &ldquo;The Steering Lesson,&rdquo; is about a Momsie receiving cues from Popsie on her driving. She then starts teasing him on buying her a pink car once she improves revealing how his mistress, who has received a pink car from him, is a good friend of hers. Their conversation, in between nervous or hysterical laughter, ends when they find out that the car&rsquo;s engine has broken down. The seventh, called &ldquo;The Motorcade,&rdquo; is about a woman in the middle of a nervous breakdown; her husband is calling for help through a Citizens Band (CB) radio. He discloses to the CB radio modulator how he has just picked her up from a mental institution. Narrating how his cheating sent her back to the institution, the CB radio modulator ends up giving him advice on how to repair their relationship. The eighth, called &ldquo;The Excursion,&rdquo; is about a man muttering a few lines about his sin and begging the woman for forgiveness. The woman says &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; right before she shoots him with a gun. The last two are related to each other, as they both focus on the relationships of singer Charmaine and composer Tony, and his wife May. Elements from the first eight manifest in the last two. The ninth, called &ldquo;Shadow on a Windshield,&rdquo; is a conversation between Charmaine and Tony, in which he announces that he is going to marry May. This prompts Charmaine to ask why Tony is marrying the other woman. It ends with Charmaine confessing her love for Tony. The last, called &ldquo;At the Vanishing Point,&rdquo; happens years after the ninth scene. This is a conversation between Tony and his dying wife May, who thanks Tony for his devotion and for being a good husband to her. She makes him promise to marry Charmaine after her death (Tiongson 1992, 95-97).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the metaphor of a journey, one car provides the setting for all the scenes, thus allowing the audience to focus on the ideas and emotions. The space is limited and the characters are trapped, making them relate to each other.

				"value": "<strong><em><strong>Sa North Diversion Road</strong></em></strong> presents 10 scenes, in different cars featuring 10 different couples&#x2019; marital infidelity, as they drive along the North Diversion Road, later known as the North Luzon Expressway. The first, called &#x201C;Ace of Hearts,&#x201D; is about a wife confronting her husband about his cheating by divulging the extent of what she knows. He confesses to the crime, but adds that he has been cheating on her much longer than she had suspected. He then reveals that he and his mistress love each other. The wife thanks him for being honest. The second, called &#x201C;Slippery When Wet,&#x201D; is about a woman crying and cursing at her unfaithful man who continues to pacify her with sweet words and assurance that she is the only woman he loves. However, it is clear that he is unrepentant. The third, called &#x201C;The Orange Light,&#x201D; centers on a couple outshouting each other with exchanges of the most uninhibited expletives, even saying they regret marrying each other. The man asks the woman why she is behaving this way and she reveals having visited and warned his mistress thrice. Accused of meddling, the woman threatens to attack the mistress but is warned that he will side with his mistress if anything breaks out. The woman threatens to jump off the bridge but the husband encourages her to do so. The woman opens the door but closes it again&#x2014;she cannot do it. The fourth, called &#x201C;The Conversation,&#x201D; is on a man and woman engaging in a silent game of dominance and submission. It ends with the woman exclaiming she knows of the man&#x2019;s infidelity. The fifth, called &#x201C;The Ride,&#x201D; opens with the man and woman talking about their marriage. Having decided that they cannot live with infidelity, and after a final confession of love and forgiveness, they commit suicide. The sixth, called &#x201C;The Steering Lesson,&#x201D; is about a Momsie receiving cues from Popsie on her driving. She then starts teasing him on buying her a pink car once she improves revealing how his mistress, who has received a pink car from him, is a good friend of hers. Their conversation, in between nervous or hysterical laughter, ends when they find out that the car&#x2019;s engine has broken down. The seventh, called &#x201C;The Motorcade,&#x201D; is about a woman in the middle of a nervous breakdown; her husband is calling for help through a Citizens Band (CB) radio. He discloses to the CB radio modulator how he has just picked her up from a mental institution. Narrating how his cheating sent her back to the institution, the CB radio modulator ends up giving him advice on how to repair their relationship. The eighth, called &#x201C;The Excursion,&#x201D; is about a man muttering a few lines about his sin and begging the woman for forgiveness. The woman says &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; right before she shoots him with a gun. The last two are related to each other, as they both focus on the relationships of singer Charmaine and composer Tony, and his wife May. Elements from the first eight manifest in the last two. The ninth, called &#x201C;Shadow on a Windshield,&#x201D; is a conversation between Charmaine and Tony, in which he announces that he is going to marry May. This prompts Charmaine to ask why Tony is marrying the other woman. It ends with Charmaine confessing her love for Tony. The last, called &#x201C;At the Vanishing Point,&#x201D; happens years after the ninth scene. This is a conversation between Tony and his dying wife May, who thanks Tony for his devotion and for being a good husband to her. She makes him promise to marry Charmaine after her death (Tiongson 1992, 95-97)."

In Susie&rsquo;s dreams, assorted shoes take on humanlike forms as moving, talking, and skating beings, ruled by the Shoe Fairy. They comfort Susie and play with her. Susie&rsquo;s insecurity, which causes her misery, stems from her awareness that she will not be able to live out her father&rsquo;s dream for her to be a ballerina. When her family presents her with a laptop for her birthday, she smashes it out of frustration. Her father walks out. All she wants for her birthday is a single day to wear the magical shoes she has in her dreams which will allow her to walk. She wants to dance with her father as she dances with the Shoe Fairy in her dreams. Her mother and sister comfort her and tell her that it is not all her fault that her father is so stressed. Susie&rsquo;s father succumbs to an illness. After his death, her mother and sister discover among his stash all the shoes that Susie saw in her dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The musical is a moving ode to a father&rsquo;s love for a daughter. The play also tackled domestic issues that are very familiar to Filipino families such as poverty, broken dreams, and death. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Trixie Dauz</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Susie&#x2019;s insecurity, which causes her misery, stems from her awareness that she will not be able to live out her father&#x2019;s dream for her to be a ballerina. When her family presents her with a laptop for her birthday, she smashes it out of frustration. Her father walks out. All she wants for her birthday is a single day to wear the magical shoes she has in her dreams which will allow her to walk. She wants to dance with her father as she dances with the Shoe Fairy in her dreams. Her mother and sister comfort her and tell her that it is not all her fault that her father is so stressed. Susie&#x2019;s father succumbs to an illness. After his death, her mother and sister discover among his stash all the shoes that Susie saw in her dreams."

Cast: Bob McElya, Thais Robertson, Leigh Dean, Laura Foreman, Jaquelin Goland, Peggy Post, Elaine Sulka, Don Castelo, Leigh Dean, William Smith, Tony Roemer, Stan Samber, Dick Brooks, Sharon Hayden, and Judilee Tash. Its first performance was by the Wisconsin Players on 22 May 1957 at the Play-Circle Theater of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Wisconsin, United States. The play was first published in the <strong><em>Literary Apprentice</em></strong> in 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play uses pantomime and dancelike movements to show flashbacks. It opens with a narration by the son, who describes the small town and the people living in it. The humble old town is a fishing village with simple, hardworking men and women whose skins are browned by the sun. The son is an engineer directing the construction of roads and bridges in his town. The town character is Sepang Loca, who wanders about and lives by herself. On the feast day of Santa Clara, when infertile women dance and chant their prayers, he remembers her dancing in abandon, while other women stood horrified.

The town character is Sepang Loca, who wanders about and lives by herself. On the feast day of Santa Clara, when infertile women dance and chant their prayers, he remembers her dancing in abandon, while other women stood horrified.

They beat the corals to force the fish out, sending them up to be trapped in the nets.

The fisherfolk family&mdash;Felimon and his wife Syana and child Junior&mdash;is in search of a more sustainable livelihood so that they can settle the debts they have incurred as a result of a waning fish catch. The small-town proprietor&rsquo;s family of Fernando and Brando is likewise in search of a more profitable venture as poor business returns hit their business. The two families meet Malid and Ye, members of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> tribe family, who are in an intense discussion on the true meaning of progress as they themselves parry the blows of development on their ancestral lands. The families of fisherman Felimon and businessman Fernando realize that gold lies in the ancestral land of the Blaan. Malid and Ye explain the importance of making an offering to the&nbsp;<em>diwata&nbsp;</em>(spirit) and the ancestors so that they may be led to the path of progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, one of the actors asks the audience which ending they prefer to see: a happy ending or a sad ending? In the happy ending, Junior saves her father Felimon from falling off the cliff. Felimon brings a chest, which apparently contains the key to humankind&rsquo;s salvation. The audience&rsquo;s attention is then requested as Malid explains the need to call on the next generation&rsquo;s help in opening the chest. The chest yields a fishing net, a golden fishing line and weight, which means that nature demands care and attention in order to flourish. Felimon decides to go back to fishing while Fernando transforms into a farmer and promises to nurture the land for everybody so that nature may yield the paradise they have been longing for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, in the sad ending, Brando jumps off the cliff as an offering. Syana and Junior decide to jump to their death too since Felimon has also fallen off the cliff. Malid and Ye sing a sad song on the wrath of nature as floods engulf the land, and the scene ends with a prayer through <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Bathala&rdquo; (God).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play&rsquo;s distinction lies in its efforts to break the wall between the audience and the performers. At the start of the play, the actors and the musicians engage their audience in a lively banter through song and dance. As the play progresses, the audience is made to transfer to three performing areas, which tell of the condition of the three families&mdash;that of the fisherfolk, the small-town proprietor, and the Lumad family. At a certain point, the audience will be led by the actors to a center of convergence where they can take part in the meeting of the three families. In the end, the actors ask the audience which ending they prefer to see. The audience must watch the play at least twice in order to witness the two endings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play is a product of the Kaliwat Theater Collective&rsquo;s efforts to bring community participation through theater processes. Through careful research and interactive processes with several communities in the Davao provinces, the actors brought to life the community concerns that they experienced and presented these stories to the community using theater processes as critical tools for reflection and transformation. The performance process, done in the seaside communities and Lumad communities, can be well described using Augusto Boal&rsquo;s &ldquo;rehearsal for change&rdquo; as the audience is engaged in giving out comments in some portions of the play and choosing which ending they prefer toward the end of the performance. Likewise, the performance area is defined by setting up materials found in the community. The performance commences and ends with the musicians engaging the audience in a participatory song-and-dance number, establishing the audience&rsquo;s significant role in the progress of the performance. The actors likewise are dressed in the likeness of the community characters they portray, with only the performance area as their delineation as actors in a performance. From time to time, the actors seek their audience&rsquo;s participation, thus establishing the audience&rsquo;s significant role in the play&rsquo;s use of theater as a forum for community action. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2755\">Glecy C.

Nick was their close friend and was also Richie&rsquo;s boyfriend in college until Nick decided to go to the mountains. Richie tells Del she won&rsquo;t stay long because her family is waiting for her. Del tells her to just wait until Mol, a friend who now works in the government bureaucracy, arrives.

Richie later reveals how she was invited and questioned for hours by the military, several years back, for an investigative report she wrote on the Chico Dam project in Kalinga. Del then asks her why she did not speak during Nick&rsquo;s internment. He talks on how ambiguous the details of Nick&rsquo;s death are.

Aguay Jr (Don Ramon Santos and Gurang Ente), Jazmin Llana (Do&ntilde;a Caridad), and Emmanuel Babilonia (Colonel Bandholtz and Garwood). First staged by Kaboronyogan Cultural Network on 17-21 Sep 1995 to represent Bikol in the Lusong Theater Festival held at the University of the Philippines Los Ba&ntilde;os in Laguna. The play also represented Luzon in the second National Theater Festival of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> and was staged at the Aquinas University in Legazpi City on 11-18 Jan 1996. The play&rsquo;s &ldquo;Director&rsquo;s Notes&rdquo; was published in <strong><em>Ranga: Journal of Bikol Writing</em></strong>, 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the opening monologue, Daragang Magayon calls on her people to resist the oppressor. American Colonel Bandholtz entertains pro-American, wealthy abaca plantation owners Don Ramon Santos and company to tell them about America&rsquo;s plans for Albay&rsquo;s economy and education. Albayanos (locals of Albay), including Don Ramon&rsquo;s wife Do&ntilde;a Caridad, support the insurgents against the Americans. Meanwhile, Simeon A. Ola, a captain in the Katipunan, transports funds amounting to 42,000 pesos to General Malvar in Cavite and continues the struggle against the Americans despite the imposition of the Sedition Law. Bandholtz, hurt fromOla&rsquo;s raids, plans to bribe Olato surrender. But Olarejects Garwood&rsquo;s offer of surrender.The Americans then intensify the campaign against the revolutionaries. Human rights violations by the American troops, news of General Malvar&rsquo;s surrender, and the shooting of the oldest supporter Gurang Ente shatter the morale of the insurgents and their supporters.A shift to present-day incidents of burning of homes, kidnapping, and killing of farmers suspected of backing the New People&rsquo;s Army, highlights the continuing suffering and struggle of the Bikol from the time of legends to the present. In the end, Don Ramon and his supporter Eligio begOlato surrender to end the great suffering of the people.Olasays he will think about it.Daragang Magayon ends the play in a&nbsp;<em>tagulaylay&nbsp;</em>or lament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play, which dramatizes the life of revolutionary Simeon A. Ola of Guinobatan, Albay, is an important contribution to Bikol drama. The production was a creative collaboration between the member organizations of the Kaboronyogan Bikol Cultural Network. The collective nature of its script and direction brought in the nuances of a variety of Bikol languages and dialects into the play. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5689\">Paz Verdades M.

American Colonel Bandholtz entertains pro-American, wealthy abaca plantation owners Don Ramon Santos and company to tell them about America&#x2019;s plans for Albay&#x2019;s economy and education. Albayanos (locals of Albay), including Don Ramon&#x2019;s wife Do&#xF1;a Caridad, support the insurgents against the Americans. Meanwhile, Simeon A. Ola, a captain in the Katipunan, transports funds amounting to 42,000 pesos to General Malvar in Cavite and continues the struggle against the Americans despite the imposition of the Sedition Law. Bandholtz, hurt fromOla&#x2019;s raids, plans to bribe Olato surrender. But Olarejects Garwood&#x2019;s offer of surrender.The Americans then intensify the campaign against the revolutionaries. Human rights violations by the American troops, news of General Malvar&#x2019;s surrender, and the shooting of the oldest supporter Gurang Ente shatter the morale of the insurgents and their supporters.A shift to present-day incidents of burning of homes, kidnapping, and killing of farmers suspected of backing the New People&#x2019;s Army, highlights the continuing suffering and struggle of the Bikol from the time of legends to the present. In the end, Don Ramon and his supporter Eligio begOlato surrender to end the great suffering of the people.Olasays he will think about it.Daragang Magayon ends the play in a&#xA0;<em>tagulaylay&#xA0;</em>or lament."

He collects money for activities that do not come to pass; he makes his class buy materials for such activities as making flags with which to welcome famous celebrities at the airport. His mischievous students consume class time by playing tricks on him: trapping him into their word games; bringing out information from current histories by Agoncillo and Constantino to show how outdated his lessons are; confronting him with the realities outside the classroom that they find more relevant and pressing (such as washing dishes, scrubbing floors, fetching water, and collecting pig swill); and lastly, hiding his glasses and their misdemeanors. Along the way his colonial thinking is bared: he adores Shakespeare but does not think Balagtas counts as a poet; he views history through Western eyes. His &ldquo;system&rdquo; brought about by 32 years of teaching is shown in all its absurdity as having been caused by low pay. This requires him to moonlight as a waiter in Cubao, which results in his being sleepy and tardy and unable to read new books or prepare his lessons.

He collects money for activities that do not come to pass; he makes his class buy materials for such activities as making flags with which to welcome famous celebrities at the airport. His mischievous students consume class time by playing tricks on him: trapping him into their word games; bringing out information from current histories by Agoncillo and Constantino to show how outdated his lessons are; confronting him with the realities outside the classroom that they find more relevant and pressing (such as washing dishes, scrubbing floors, fetching water, and collecting pig swill); and lastly, hiding his glasses and their misdemeanors. Along the way his colonial thinking is bared: he adores Shakespeare but does not think Balagtas counts as a poet; he views history through Western eyes. His &#x201C;system&#x201D; brought about by 32 years of teaching is shown in all its absurdity as having been caused by low pay. This requires him to moonlight as a waiter in Cubao, which results in his being sleepy and tardy and unable to read new books or prepare his lessons. The play ends in a war, then a truce, in which students and teacher agree to help each other and to update Propesor Tuko&#x2019;s absurd system."

In November of the same year, the play became part of the National Theater Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set in the 1950s, the play revolves around the love of Tres Dahlia&rsquo;s lead singer Ester for her husband Tirso, a womanizing conductor of the band Tirso and the Bandits. A musical number, &ldquo;Mambo Magsaysay,&rdquo; is performed by the Tres Dahlias: Ester, Chabeng, and Magdea. Ester dreams about Tirso&rsquo;s affairs but little does she know that another member of the Tres Dahlias is her rival in love, Chabeng. Tirso goes to his band rehearsals and performs &ldquo;Tittina, My Tittina&rdquo; with girls including Chabeng. Tirso goes missing after abandoning both Ester and Chabeng. Ester confronts Chabeng in the&nbsp;<em>perya&nbsp;</em>(carnival) where the latter plays the seductress&nbsp;<em>babaeng gagamba&nbsp;</em>or spider woman. Chabeng tries to help Ester find Tirso by giving her information, and asks for her forgiveness in the number &ldquo;I Apologize.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ester finds out that her husband suffered a stroke and ended up on the streets of Manila as a beggar. She sets off to find her husband, going from town to town asking for her husband&rsquo;s whereabouts. She suffers misfortunes, such as getting lost and robbed, and ends up with a beggar who subjects her to sexual abuse. Undaunted by her misfortunes, she manages to find Tirso, who is now very sick. With her forgiveness, Tirso expires with a bang in the number &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Live Till I Die.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><strong>Stageshow</strong></em></strong> is the last play written by O&rsquo;Hara, honoring the forgotten artists of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, the Filipino version of vaudeville. The play is staged like a bodabil performance with the narrative unfolding through skits and production numbers featuring songs and dances popular during the peak and waning years of bodabil. The play won the following awards in the 2008 <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3170\">Philippine Legitimate Stage Artists</a> Group Gawad Buhay!: Outstanding Musical Production, Outstanding Stage Direction, Outstanding Book or Original Libretto, Outstanding Choreography for a Play or Musical, Female Lead Performance in a Musical (Centenera-Buencamino), Female Featured Performance in a Musical (Kanapi), and Male Featured Performance in a Musical (Vera). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Trixie Dauz</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Suor Clara, more than 40 years old and Madre Superiora of the Convent of Santa Clara in Intramuros, recites sensuous passages from the Song of Solomon in her chamber. Interrupted by Bishop Salvi who is demanding to enter her room, she finishes reading and lets him in. Noticing the opened pages of the Bible, Salvi warns her of the impropriety of reading those passages, especially for a woman of her stature. Clara argues that the songs are part of the Bible, wherein the woman in the passages longs for her lover. Salvi continues that she should not say things like that to her subordinates. Clara tells him that her congregation already knows; that she encourages Sour Agatha during meal time to sing them with emotion and with Venancio in mind. Salvi begs her to lower her voice and inquires who Venancio is. She explains that he is the meat and vegetable seller who comes on Wednesdays. Clara suggests calling Agatha so that Salvi could hear her sing. Salvi, afraid of being seen in her chamber, asks her to lower her voice. Clara comforts him by saying that her congregation already knows that he visits her on occasion. He is dumbfounded. She asks about his almost one year of absence and Salvi speaks of the revolution that is happening outside the convent walls. Clara is made aware of this with propaganda pamphlets coming their way through Venancio who is part of the resistance. Salvi wants the convent to stop its communication with Venancio at once, but she counters that what happens outside the convent walls do not concern them. He vehemently asks what kind of convent it is. Clara answers that he should know as it was he who sent her there. She picks up a roll of paper and spreads it on the table, revealing the design for a new sculpture to be installed in her private sanctuary. It is a statue of the Virgin Mary dressed as a Grecian goddess sitting atop a mound of books and maps, as well as scientific, musical, and art instruments. Salvi accuses her of sacrilege and tears the paper to pieces. Clara becomes formal but says that the next time he comes, the sculpture would have been installed and cannot so easily be destroyed. Reciting the sensuous passages again, Salvi pleads for her to stop but she continues on. He wonders what might happen if the revolutionaries win, while her confidence on Venancio&rsquo;s word regarding their safety is unwavering. Salvi asks what her relation to Venancio is, and Clara reveals that he visits her chamber during the early hours of the morning after the Matins. Salvi is scandalized, but Clara says that she hides nothing from her sisters. After Salvi denounces the convent as a brothel, Clara asks him to leave, exclaiming that he has no right to speak of the sisters that way since he never experienced the loss of freedom that they had. Lamenting over the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Clara, he apologizes for making her enter the convent. She answers that she has matured. Getting tired of his apologies, she tells him that she has gotten over her melancholy existence and has decided to devote her mind to learning, praying, and loving. She tells Salvi that he has become powerful, but she is the one who is happy. They imagine a scene where Clara is being burned at the stake. Salvi, witnessing the spectacle, strips his clothes and runs toward her and they both burn. Cradling him like a child, she tells him that she does not regret anything that she has done. Salvi finally reveals his fears of the revolution and that he has to leave the country. He persuades her to leave with him. She asks if he loves her, and he tells her that it was not just desire that sustained his visits for the past 25 years. She turns down his offer, saying she does not love him and relates that she has regained her freedom through the years of being in the convent. Clara remembers that when Ibarra asked for her forgiveness, he also left her, the way Salvi is doing now. He bids her a final goodbye and leaves the room.

He wears loose pants, fastened with abaca strings, and carries a<em>bayong</em>(native bag) in which he keeps the scraps of food he collects from garbage cans and heaps. Despised and rejected by passersby, he has no one to talk to but his stomach which is forever growling for lack of food. He wishes his intestines were like those hanging behind glass in restaurants&mdash;clean, quiet, and quite dead.

Yet he can turn away from a bag of mooncakes as he did once, because the man who tossed it at him did not even look him in the eyes. Affirming himself, he reveals his name. He is Samuel, and like his namesake Samuel Belibet, he is cursed to live and walk forever.

The action takes place on the feast of San Juan on 24 Jun, around the mid-1920s. It opens on the veranda and front yard of the Moreta house in Paco, where reigns a thick old balete tree, at the foot of which flowers are strewn and a small candle burns. The whole cast is presented: Don Paeng and Do&ntilde;a Lupe Moreta, elegant&nbsp;<em>ilustrados&nbsp;</em>(educated native), and their sons; their cousin Guido, lately arrived from abroad; the visiting expatriates Micaela and Maggie, mother and daughter. On the other side of the social divide are Amada, the cook, and her husband Entoy, the driver; Kikay and Rosa, the housemaids; and the men and women who participate in the rites of the&nbsp;<em>tatarin&nbsp;</em>(summer solstice).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 1, Don Paeng, imperious male, asserts his macho thinking and supremacy over his wife, to which she assents. Entoy, on the other hand, usually a wife beater, reveals both fear and reverence for Amada, because &ldquo;The spirit is in her. She is the tatarin &hellip; At such times she is not my wife. She is the wife of the river &hellip; of the crocodile &hellip; of the moon.&rdquo; Act 2 is set at noon of the same day. The men, stripped to the waist, appear, dancing with the image of San Juan around the tree and throwing water at the spectators. Guido, who is with them, kisses Lupe&rsquo;s feet, unsettling her with his admiration. Juanito, also unsettled after having joined the procession, grows from a boy fond of ice cream to a young man discovering woman. Act 3, set in the evening, uncovers the forces beneath the Moreta milieu. The procession of the tatarin is led by a young girl, then the mature woman Amada, and an old woman who dies and rises triumphant. Their San Juan is &ldquo;a crude, primitive, grotesque image,&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;a female tumult.&rdquo; Paeng is repelled, but Lupe is drawn to and joins the procession. Paeng chases after her and is attacked by the women. When Lupe returns, she is changed: wanton and flamboyant.

She laments that her husband has not been coming home lately due to his involvement in a protest for higher wages.She soon learns from the neighbors that a shooting occurred at the factory where Tonio works and that seven protesters died. Frantic and worried, she makes her way to the factory, bringing her kids with her. Her daughter stumbles upon her husband&rsquo;s blood-stained shoe. Nearly brought to tears at the sight of it, she tells her family to head home, saying that Tonio might be there waiting for them. She tells her daughter to bring the shoe with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In &ldquo;Tata Selo,&rdquo; Saling, a young girl, recounts the story of how she and her father, Selo, were exploited by their landlord and ousted from the land they once owned. Selois seen trying to convince the landlord that he is still fully capable of taking care of the farm. The landlord ignores his protest, stating that he has already found someone else to till his land for him and turns him violently away. In revenge for his daughter whom the landlord impregnated, Selo stabs the landlord and is thrown into jail because of it. In jail, Selo tries to reason that he was only protecting his daughter, but the chief of police beats him up instead. Saling pleads for them to stop, but the chief grabs her and violates her right in front of her father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In &ldquo;Mariang Tabak,&rdquo; Sepa, an elderly woman, confides in a girl named Elizabeth whom she realizes knows her son well. She talks about how she still clings on to hope that her son, Emmanuel, is still alive for she has yet to see the body. Elizabeth leaves and comes back with news that Emmanuel is dead&mdash;shot during a protest at a factory. As Sepa attempts to console Elizabeth, Sepa recalls how her husband died in the same manner: shot to death while tending to the fields. She then discovers that Elizabeth is pregnant and tries to comfort her, stating that crying is bad for the child. Sepa vows to be strong for her son, and to raise her grandson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the epilogue, the fates of the three women turn out for the better. Sebya remarries, a priest takes Saling under his wing, and Sepa fondly tells stories about her grandson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Tatlong Maria</em></strong> was staged, mainly in arena style, more than 80 times in Malolos, and was the official entry of BKFI-Uhay to the National Theater Festival hosted by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 1992. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Athena Angela Aquino</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Chua, Apolonio B., ed. 1992. <em>Unang Tagpo: Kalipunan ng mga Dulang Rehyunal sa Pambansang Pistang Pandulaan.</em> Manila: Sentrong Pangkultura ng Pilipinas, Sentrong Tagapag-ugnay para sa Panitikan.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

It was written and directed by Joel Arbolario for a Manila tour in 1988 but premiered in Bacolod City in 1987. The characters are nameless, though the actors might address their fellow actors by ad-libbing their real names during the play&rsquo;s staging. Thus, the cast of characters is listed according to the actors&rsquo; nicknames, except a few, such as the &ldquo;Sakada,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cowboy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Peasants,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scholars.&rdquo; The actors who had their own individual roles to play doubled as any of these, which were social class stereotypes following the conventions of the political allegory.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The cast runs from behind the audience onto the stage, wearing huge, grotesquely smiling masks, and singing a satirical song about the Maskara Festival, to the tune of &ldquo;La Bamba.&rdquo; The Maskara Festival is Bacolod City&rsquo;s version of the Mardi Gras (Shrove Tuesday) held every year in October, when there is much drinking and carousing. Half of the cast falls to the floor in a drunken stupor, while the other half removes their masks to expose suffering faces that represent the Negros masses. In rhyming verse, they enumerate their troubles: children dying of hunger, the war between vigilantes and rebels, and the collapse of the sugar industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a university library, the country scholars quote statistics, health studies, and the dictionary to display their erudite knowledge about the death of the sugar industry. Eavesdropping, the lead characters, scoff at their pedantry and explain to the audience the plight of the Negros sakada battling hunger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the hacienda (sugar plantation) house, the&nbsp;<em>enkargado&nbsp;</em>(foreman) tells the&nbsp;<em>hacendero&nbsp;</em>that there is a crowd of people outside looking for work. However, he replies that he is no longer hiring. The American Cowboy enters waving a contract for the hacendero&rsquo;s signature and, in a singsong chant, offers a sugar quota. This brings to mind a chapter in Philippine history when the American colonial government gave a glowing promise of long-term security for the hacienda system in exchange for the Negros hacendero&rsquo;s dependence on the American sugar market. The characters recall the old times when the plantation workers&rsquo; best meals were dried fish and corn meal. Now they are reduced to eating&nbsp;<em>kamote&nbsp;</em>(sweet potato) and field rats. The country&rsquo;s economic troubles, culminating in the crisis of 1983, are traced to American machinations, including the coups d&rsquo;etat beleaguering Manila at the time of the play&rsquo;s staging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cast stages a protest rally, in which the slogans reveal the problems of Negros: the shutdown of the sugar centrals leading to widespread unemployment; low wages of those who remain employed; and the laid-off workers&rsquo; demand for a small piece of land on which to plant subsistence crops and vegetables. A series of explosions backstage herald the violent dispersal of the rallyists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mass burial is held after the massacre of the rallyists. Mourners enter, carrying corpses and lighted candles. This is followed by a series of reenactments of atrocities committed as a result of the new administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;total war policy,&rdquo; aka low-intensity conflict: the brutalities of the vigilantes called&nbsp;<em>alsa masa</em>; the hamletting of mountain villages by means of bombing, strafing, razing, and military brutalities; mass evacuations and the consequent epidemics and famine suffered by the refugees with the children being the most numerous war casualties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grimness of the play&rsquo;s content is lightened but not diluted by satirical songs, which are either adapted from folk songs or are original compositions with folksy tunes. The movements of the sakada at work or of those caught in battle scenes are defamiliarized as dance movements or enacted in slow motion. The poignancy of the vignettes is heightened by the use of bamboo curtains as backdrop, on which corresponding scenes are painted in a naif style. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

Half of the cast falls to the floor in a drunken stupor, while the other half removes their masks to expose suffering faces that represent the Negros masses. In rhyming verse, they enumerate their troubles: children dying of hunger, the war between vigilantes and rebels, and the collapse of the sugar industry."

However, he replies that he is no longer hiring. The American Cowboy enters waving a contract for the hacendero&#x2019;s signature and, in a singsong chant, offers a sugar quota. This brings to mind a chapter in Philippine history when the American colonial government gave a glowing promise of long-term security for the hacienda system in exchange for the Negros hacendero&#x2019;s dependence on the American sugar market. The characters recall the old times when the plantation workers&#x2019; best meals were dried fish and corn meal. Now they are reduced to eating&#xA0;<em>kamote&#xA0;</em>(sweet potato) and field rats. The country&#x2019;s economic troubles, culminating in the crisis of 1983, are traced to American machinations, including the coups d&#x2019;etat beleaguering Manila at the time of the play&#x2019;s staging."

A series of explosions backstage herald the violent dispersal of the rallyists."

This is followed by a series of reenactments of atrocities committed as a result of the new administration&#x2019;s &#x201C;total war policy,&#x201D; aka low-intensity conflict: the brutalities of the vigilantes called&#xA0;<em>alsa masa</em>; the hamletting of mountain villages by means of bombing, strafing, razing, and military brutalities; mass evacuations and the consequent epidemics and famine suffered by the refugees with the children being the most numerous war casualties."

The movements of the sakada at work or of those caught in battle scenes are defamiliarized as dance movements or enacted in slow motion. The poignancy of the vignettes is heightened by the use of bamboo curtains as backdrop, on which corresponding scenes are painted in a naif style. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a></strong><a href=\"/9/9/5200\"> </a></em>"

The play was performed in English and Filipino with over 120 performances. The play came into print, titled <strong><em>The Trial: A <strong><strong>Drama</strong></strong>tization of the Prosecution of Andres Bonifacio</em></strong>, 1963.

The courtrooms are the rebel headquarters in the town of Naic and Maragondon, in which the trial lasts for three days, 29 Apr and 4-5 May 1897.

Majority of the scenes depict the intense interrogation and harassment of the witnesses by the fiscal Jose Elises, with some interruptions from the judge advocate Pedro Lipana. The first witness to take the stand is Maj Benito Torres, followed by Procopio Bonifacio and Julian Aguila. The trajectory of the interrogation is to make the witnesses corroborate the crimes imputed on Bonifacio&mdash;that he instigated an attack on the rebel soldiers led by Colonel Yntong in Limbon, Cavite, and killed two soldiers in the process; and that he is guilty of sedition, treason, and counterrevolution against the duly constituted government of the people. The last witness to take the stand is Lt Col Pedro Giron, an obvious turncoat, who presents lies and fabricated details to impress upon the court the categorical culpability of his former supremo. The news of an impending Spanish attack on Cavite cuts short the interrogations and forces the court to adjourn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In act 2, which happens on 4 May 1897, Elises and Lipana continue attempts to condemn Bonifacio and his wife Gregoria de Jesus. Bonifacio argues that the accusations against him are all lies; that it is impossible to go against the revolution he himself started. He adds that Colonel Yntong&rsquo;s band attacked first and without provocation. Gregoria de Jesus narrates in detail how Colonel Yntong could have hurt her seriously if not for the timely intervention of comrade Tomas Mascardo.

Mayoralty candidate Molong pushes Christina to run for vice mayor. The game ends with the killing of Chinese drug lord Lu, the party&rsquo;s alleged traitor. The murder serves as a threat for Christina despite the fact that the Perezes are suspects to the sudden and anomalous death of her husband. Forced to accept the task, Christina runs against her cousin Melba. The influential businessman Santiago Sr and the anti-corruption advocate Doray Gutierrez run for mayor as well. Doray dies upon falling down the stairs on her wheelchair, leaving her son, a Sangguniang Kabataan chairperson, who is slowly becoming corrupt himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At a bar, an initially happy drinking spree of the political families&rsquo; children ends in a fight between Dino Perez and Santiago Jr. The incident leads to the death of tricycle driver Pong who tries to protect Marky Medina, Christina&rsquo;s son. As payback, Santiago Jr trains with his father&rsquo;s friend Vic, a would-be lawyer who owes a debt to Pong&rsquo;s mother Panchang. Gambling lord Alex, on the other hand, teaches Marky how to fix matters through money and guns. Marky, who gains power through violence, rapes his cousin Rhoda, his Aunt Melba&rsquo;s daughter, and kills his friend Vic, turning a solemn procession of the town sponsored by the ruling families to another bloodbath. In their final statements, both the Perez and Santiago families resolve to retain their power, while the Medinas begin to wonder how they can start a life out of politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play was devised from interviews and testimonials among government whistleblowers, political insiders, and bloggers. The play portrays the country&rsquo;s traditional politics characterized by corruption, impunity, and nepotism. While the situations are quite familiar, the extreme violence that comes with graft and corruption and the filthy practices of political dynasties do not allow the audience to blink for even a second. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Joanna Lerio</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Mayoralty candidate Molong pushes Christina to run for vice mayor. The game ends with the killing of Chinese drug lord Lu, the party&#x2019;s alleged traitor. The murder serves as a threat for Christina despite the fact that the Perezes are suspects to the sudden and anomalous death of her husband. Forced to accept the task, Christina runs against her cousin Melba. The influential businessman Santiago Sr and the anti-corruption advocate Doray Gutierrez run for mayor as well. Doray dies upon falling down the stairs on her wheelchair, leaving her son, a Sangguniang Kabataan chairperson, who is slowly becoming corrupt himself."

There, Julia lives with her widowed mother, Aling Juana. The relationship that began from childhood between Julia and her distant cousin Tenyong develops gradually into a strong love, unnoticed by Julia&rsquo;s mother. One day, news reaches Tenyong that his father, Kapitang Inggo, and other men from the town have been arrested as rebel suspects by Filipino volunteers of the Spanish army and jailed at the provincial capital of Bulacan. In prison, Tenyong finds seven of the prisoners already dead, and his father dying from the physical torture ordered by the friars. When his father dies, Tenyong swears to avenge him, and leads the town&rsquo;s able-bodied men to take up arms and join the revolution. Torn between his love for Julia and his love of country, and spurred by his desire for vengeance, Tenyong leaves for the front despite Julia&rsquo;s objections. On the way there, Tenyong&rsquo;s men attack and kill some friars and Spanish civilians who are waiting at the Guiguinto Railroad Station for a Manila-bound train.

Tenyong seeks the advice of his general, who assures him of help to effect his marriage to Julia. Tenyong sends back word that he would be returning home. Lucas, the message bearer and a comic character, goes home, weaving his way through a battle in which the rebels engage. Lucas, Monica, and Tadeo, Miguel&rsquo;s father, and Aling Juana, play courtship scenes that serve as comic counterpoint to that of Julia and Tenyong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day of Julia&rsquo;s marriage to Miguel dawns. In the midst of seeming gaiety, Lucas announces the arrival of Tenyong, who comes in bandaged and on a stretcher.

Miguel demands that the wedding ceremony proceed but Julia ignores him and demands attention for Tenyong, who is pronounced on the brink of death. A priest called to hear his last confession announces his last request&mdash;to be married to Julia before he dies.

The play was also part of the 4th National Theater Festival in Nov 2012. In late 2013, the production was close to having done 100 shows, touring schools and universities. In Jan-Feb 2014 it had a three-week run at the Star Theater in Star City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play starts with a rap performance introducing the difficulty students experience in reading Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. Ms Lugarda Martinez, the terror class adviser, forces her students to read Shakespeare&rsquo;s texts in order to pass the final grading period and graduate from high school. The students are far from excited because they have their own concerns. Richard, an academic achiever, is gay and refuses to come out of the closet. Erwin is a stutterer and an outcast. The class bully TJ, abused by his father at home, writes Richard&rsquo;s sexuality on the bathroom wall; he also pulls a prank on Erwin by nominating him for batch representative. Estella, who worries about her grades more than her classmates, is the angry daughter, left behind by her mother who is an overseas Filipino worker in London. The family of Sophia recently won the lottery, and with this came a shift in her perspective about her classmates. She becomes a social climber going to absurd lengths to prove she and her family are now better-off. As the grading period draws to a close, each student performs a monologue from Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies. Richard faces homosexual bullying by choosing to recite Shylock&rsquo;s &ldquo;If you prick us do we not bleed &hellip;&rdquo; speech from <strong><em>Merchant of Venice</em></strong>. TJ unravels as bully via the &ldquo;To be or not to be &hellip;&rdquo; soliloquy from <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>. Erwin finds his voice and comes out of his shell in defense of Richard through <strong><em>Julius Caesar</em></strong> &rsquo;s &ldquo;Friends, Romans, countrymen &hellip;&rdquo; oration. Estella forgives her mother&mdash;and herself&mdash;via Portia&rsquo;s &ldquo;The quality of mercy &hellip;&rdquo; plea in <strong><em>Merchant of Venice</em></strong>. Sophia, seemingly petty as her crisis is, ties together a newfound love in the poor boy that is Erwin through Juliet&rsquo;s &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name &hellip;&rdquo; musings from <strong><em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em></strong>. Through the monologues the students get the chance to voice out their inner turmoil.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The set design of <strong><em><strong>William</strong></em></strong> consists of wooden armchairs piled one on top of the other, which function as both backdrop and as the shifting and changing parts of a set for the individual homes and particular spaces of each of the five characters.

First staged on 9 Feb to 4 Mar 2006 by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> as part of PETA Kalinangan Ensemble production of five one-act plays titled <strong><em>Pinoy Wannabes</em></strong> during the company&rsquo;s 38th theater season at the PETA-PHINMA Theater Center in Quezon City. The play&rsquo;s script is anthologized in <strong><em>Davao <strong>Harvest</strong> 2</em></strong>, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first scene opens with Eman or Emmanuel, nine, playing an X-box computer game as Ate Mawsi or Mao Zedong, 13, enters irate because their maid has left with some of her jewelry. The two are now left to themselves as their parents are both working abroad, their grandmother has been dead for two years, and their oldest brother Kuya V.I. or V.I. Lenin, 17, who has just started work as a call center agent, finds no more time to be with them. Eman mentions there is no need for her to help him on his assignment since he will just copy his classmate&rsquo;s work. Their conversation leads to the issue of who will chat online with their Tatay Jessie and Nanay Grace when the schedule comes. The next scene takes them back two years. Over the phone, V.I. talks with their Tatay Jessie about Mawsi&rsquo;s sudden mood swings because of her first menstruation. Eman, while playing with his toys, asks help from Kuya V.I. later with his assignments. Mawsi&rsquo;s mood swings make her and V.I. cuss at each other. V.I. apologizes over the phone and comments about the pressure on him in making things work since their grandmother&rsquo;s recent death. Tatay Jessie, now working as a janitor in Canada, makes V.I. reiterate the family&rsquo;s plan to gradually immigrate&mdash;Nanay Grace has been abroad for six years and Tatay Jessie, four. Their conversation ends and V.I. afterward sweet-talks Mawsi into being a lady from now on and helping Eman with his assignments. The third scene is set four years further back. Canada-bound Tatay Jessie is bidding farewell to his children as he leaves for the airport and gives them instructions about how the setup is going to be. Tatay Jessie asks V.I. to teach his siblings to be independent. It is revealed that their Nanay Grace is now in hiding as an illegal alien in the United States (US). The plan includes Tatay Jessie&rsquo;s task to get Nanay Grace out to Canada. He reassures them that if the plan is fulfilled, in two years they will be whole again as a family. The fourth scene is two years more into the past. Grace is about to leave the house to go to the US embassy for her visa. She talks about the prospect of working as a caregiver in New York. She repeats to Jessie their plan to prepare the future for their children, adding that with the worsening of the country&rsquo;s economy, there is a need for practicality. Jessie and Grace lament how they started as activists against the United States but now are forced to leave for New York. As she calls on V.I., Mawsi, and Eman for an embrace before she leaves, she realizes how young her children are and decides not to pursue her visa application. The fifth and final scene is set during the Mendiola Massacre in 1987. Fleeing the massacre, activists Jessie and Grace find themselves hiding in an alley where they meet for the first time. Grace is frightened to leave the spot. Jessie convinces her to relax. They go out to the streets and pretend to be lovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play&rsquo;s structure, inspired by Harold Pinter&rsquo;s <strong><em>Betrayal</em></strong>, starts at the present and in succeeding scenes goes deeper into the past. The play shows the deterioration of the Filipino family as the parents, former activists, turn into menial migrant laborers in the United States and Canada.

The leaders agree but, without Maniago&rsquo;s knowledge, they plan to use Maniago&rsquo;s name to turn the protest into a war. The governor-general leads well-armed troops from Manila to Pampanga. He succeeds in pacifying the Kapampangan. The Kapampangan present their grievances and de Lara accedes to their requests. However, when de Lara sends three generals to present his reply to the Kapampangan, the three generals are captured and imprisoned by the revolt&rsquo;s leaders, who had earlier removed Maniago as their leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Lara reacts swiftly, surrounding several villages of Pampanga with his battle troops. Once again, the Kapampangan panic and they release one general. The formerly argumentative leaders ask Maniago to head them once more. Maniago orders the release of the two remaining generals and sends de Lara an apology. The latter says he will accept their apology only if all the leaders of the revolt will meet him in de Lara&rsquo;s camp. During the meeting, de Lara reprimands but also pardons the leaders. He then invites the leaders to go to Manila, promising them important positions in the native army. The leaders acquiesce. Maniago prepares to go to Manila despite his wife&rsquo;s protestations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Act 2 begins two months after.
