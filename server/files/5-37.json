Philippine drums, which are played at festive celebrations, processions, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, are of many varieties, shapes, and sizes. Drums are often made of wood, while drumheads consist of goat, deer, cow, pig, or reptile skin. They are attached to the body and tightened through different techniques of lacing using rattan and string. Other drumheads use hoops made of wood and padded rattan. Only very few Philippine drums have the skin nailed permanently to the body.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A drum&rsquo;s shape can be <b>cylindrical</b>, <b>conical</b>, <b>barrel</b>, <b>kettle</b>, or <b>goblet</b>.

Philippine flutes are usually made of <i>buho </i>(light bamboo) in lengths ranging from 50 to 100 cm. They are classified according to how they are held when played relative to the body&mdash;transverse, vertical, or semi-transverse&mdash;and according to the types of their blowing ends: <b>lip-valley</b> or <b>notch</b>, <b>nose</b>, <b>ring</b>, <b>chip-on-ledge</b>, or <b>whistle/plug</b>.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most common flute is the notch or lip-valley, which has a carved-out mouthpiece and is held vertically.

Cordillera nose flutes usually have three finger holes and a thumbhole. In Mindoro, the Hanunuo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> have the <b>lantoy</b><i> </i>or <b>palawta</b>,<i> </i>a flute played by nose or mouth; the latter is also played by the Buhid and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>. A rare kind of nose flute among the Cuyunon of Palawan is also called <b>lantoy</b>, which has two finger holes near the open end of a long tube about 90 cm long and 2 cm across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The chip-on-ledge type of flute is sounded by blowing through the narrow air passage that is created by attaching a piece of bamboo to the tube or protruding ledge. This is called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> <b>bulungudyong</b>,<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot) <b>tulala</b>,<i> </i>and Maguindanaon <b>tampong</b><i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The whistle-type flute has blowing ends partly stopped by wooden plugs.

The earliest <b>bronze drums</b> date from around late third to early second millennium BCE in a region known as Dong Son, which covers present-day North Vietnam, Laos, and Yunnan in Southern China. This bronze instrument spread to as far as places in Java Sea in ancient times, but no extant evidence of bronze drum has ever been found in the Philippine archipelago to date. What bronze instrument took root in the islands was the <b>bronze gong</b>, which came in various sizes and shapes, either flat or with a central boss or knob.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Bossed gongs</b> are predominant in Southeast Asia. They differ in diameter, shape, and depth of their rims, and the manner in which they are played. In the Philippines, they are found in Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu archipelago, which participated in millennia-old maritime trade network with Borneo (Brunei and Kalimantan), Sumatra, Melaka, and even as far South as Java. <b>Flat gongs</b>, along with bossed gongs, are found in the hills of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Central Vietnam, some parts of Indonesia, and northern Philippines, and they came to the Philippine islands beginning the sixth century from China, indirectly passing through trading ports of Continental Southeast Asia, west of Nusantara, like Funan, Champa, and Melaka, before they reached the other side in Brunei or Jolo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In northern Philippines, flat gongs made of bronze, brass, or iron are found among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot), for whom gong playing is part of peace-pact gatherings, marriages, prestige ceremonies, feasts, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>. The instruments are highly valued as family heirlooms, especially those made of bronze alloy, and their owners enjoy great prestige.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">The flat gongs are called <b>gangsa</b> by the Bontok, Ibaloy, Bugkalot, and Kalinga. Other terms are <b>cangsa </b>(Bontok), <b>gangha</b> (Ifugao), <b>hansa</b> (Isneg), <b>pahyuk</b> (Bugkalot), and <b>palay-an</b> or <b>palay</b> (Ayta Magbukun). The word &ldquo;gangsa&rdquo; comes from the Sanskrit word <i>kansa</i> or <i>kangsa</i>, which means &ldquo;metal bell&rdquo; or &ldquo;brass alloy&rdquo; and has cognates for the same type of instrument called <b>khan</b> or <b>khenha</b> among the Edde of Central Vietnam or gangsa in old Javanese and Malay. The gongs vary in size, averaging about 30 cm in diameter with a rim depth of about 5 cm. Only males play gongs.</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gongs are either struck with a stick or slapped with the hands. The Kalinga call the style of playing a gong using a stick <b>pattong</b>: the gong is suspended from a V-shaped bone or wooden handle held in the left hand while the right hand strikes the gong with the stick. If played <b>topayya </b>style, it is secured to the player&rsquo;s loincloth or belt, lain across the lap that acts as a resonator, struck by the left palm at the center to create a ringing sound, struck similarly by the palm then slapped strongly by a hand that then slides to the gong&rsquo;s outer edge. The Tinguian call this style <b>sinuklit</b>, while the Bontok call it <b>takik</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Gangsa</b> are played in an ensemble, the number of the gongs and the combinations with other instruments varying from group to group as well as within one group. The Kalinga and Tinguian topayya ensemble consists of six gangsa of graduated sizes. The first four gongs&mdash;<b>balbal</b>, <b>salbat</b>,<b> katlo</b>,<b> </b>and <b>kapat</b>&mdash;produce identical rhythmic patterns in staggered entries. The <b>pokpok </b>or fifth gong makes a repeated two-tone drone over which the <b>anungos </b>(sixth gong) plays a freer rhythmic pattern. The basic musical element of drone and melody may be applied to this contrapuntal structure, with the four gongs in canon supplying the melody and the two gongs the drone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalinga have a six-gong ensemble played in <b>palook </b>or <b>pattong</b> (also <b>pattung</b>)<b> </b>style while dancing. Holding the gong handles in the left hand, the performers dance in a line in alternate steps without moving from their place, all the while striking the inside of the gong with a stick. Then the lead man begins moving, followed by the rest of the gong-bearing men, who form long curving lines, stoop, sway, and crouch while holding the gongs close to, then away from the body. They play two basic contrasting rhythms called <b>dawdaw </b>and <b>sapi </b>in a fast tempo. Soon, the women join the dance with outstretched arms, their feet moving to the gong rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Ibaloy <b>sulibaw </b>ensemble combines two gangsa with a pair of iron bars called <b>palas </b>and two conical drums, the smaller of which is called the sulibaw (76 cm tall) and the larger <b>kimbal </b>(80 cm tall). These narrow conical drums are made of hollowed-out logs with a deerskin head. At their biggest bulge they measure about 20 cm in diameter. The drums are slanted beside the male performer who is seated on a low stone or log. Both drums are struck with palms, sounding a continuous rhythmic drone against which the two gongs play individual rhythmic patterns in counterpoint.

Central and Southern Philippine bossed gongs are of three types. The <b>agung</b>,<b> </b>with their deep, slightly turned-in rims, are hung on wooden frames or from house rafters, or if small enough, held in the hand. They are played singly, in groups, or as part of larger ensembles. They are also called <b>pulakan </b>(Tausug, Sama), <b>buahan</b> (Tausug), <b>bua </b>(Sama), <b>lebua </b>and <b>pengegungan </b>(Yakan). The <b>gandingan </b>have narrower, very slightly turned-in rims, and their bosses are not as prominent as the agung&rsquo;s. They are suspended and played in ensembles or singly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gongs-in-a-row, graduated bossed gongs laid in a row on a wooden frame or mat, is called <b>kulintang</b>, which plays an important soloistic role in gong ensembles. The name of the instrument is derived from the word <i>tang</i>, which means sound. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> kulintang have eight gongs, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> eight to eleven, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> five to seven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kulintang (Maguindanao, Maranao) or <b>kulintangan </b>(Tausug, Sama, Yakan) is the solo instrument in large ensembles that include suspended gongs and drums. The suspended gongs are classified according to the sounds they produce. The <b>babendil </b>(Maguindanao, Yakan) or <b>babandir </b>(Maranao), which are about 20 cm in diameter and have a narrow, very slightly turned-in rims, make a thin sound when struck on the rim with a bamboo stick. The one or two suspended agung produce stopped, muffled sounds. The Maguindanaon and Maranao suspended gandingan generally produce freely vibrating sounds. The Tausug, Sama, and Yakan strike the agung in such a way that they vibrate freely. When used in this manner, the agung are called <b>tunggalan </b>(Tausug), <b>tamuk </b>(Sama), or <b>lerukan</b> (Yakan). Drums called <b>debakan </b>or <b>dabakan </b>(Maguindanaon), <b>dadabuan </b>(Maranao), or <b>tambul </b>(Sama) set the rhythmic patterns. The Yakan use a piece of split bamboo called <b>gandang </b>in lieu of the drum. The last kulintang gong is played by another performer who strikes a punctuating ostinato and is called <b>tungtung </b>(Tausug), <b>solembat</b> (Sama), and <b>nulanting </b>(Yakan). Mindanao highlanders play suspended agung, singly or combined with drums or other instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> of Zamboanga del Sur use suspended agung called <b>gagung</b>.<b> </b>Used singly, the gagung summons people from the fields, communicates messages during courtship, accompanies dancing, or announces a death. The Subanon low-bossed, narrow-rimmed gandingan is used only in a sacred ritual, the <b>megayap</b>,<b> </b>where it is combined with a gagung and a pair of porcelain bowls. The <b>babandil</b> is larger than the gandingan, with a wider turned-in rim. The three varieties of gongs are used in different combinations to form ensembles that are performed during weddings and other festive occasions or <b>beklog</b>.<b> </b>The gandingan ensemble is made up of a large gong called <b>gagung</b> <b>pon</b>,<b> </b>a babandil,<b> </b>and a pair of porcelain bowls called <b>pinggan</b>.<b> </b>The <b>thanggunggu </b>ensemble uses two gagung: the large gagung pon and any of the smaller gagung called <b>gagung thumbaga </b>or <b>burnay</b>,<b> gagung tiyanggi</b> or <b>shalabon </b>or <b>gagung galang</b>.<b> </b>Three gagung&mdash;a gagung pon and a pair of smaller gagung&mdash;comprise the <b>gandang-gandang </b>ensemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Zamboanga del Norte, two performers play the gagung&mdash;one striking the boss, the other the rim&mdash;to accompany the <i>sabay</i><b> </b>dance. Occasionally, three performers play one gagung: using a cloth-padded mallet, one strikes the boss, one the gong&rsquo;s face, and one the rim with two bamboo sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> play one agung to accompany the <i>saut</i>,<b> </b>a dance depicting the war between the Magahat and the eventually victorious Bukidnon. It also announces the arrival of the groom&rsquo;s party during a wedding. At festivities that celebrate a bountiful harvest, dancers wearing cascabels on their legs and ankles are accompanied by an agung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The south Cotabato <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> agung, <b>salmagi</b>,<b> </b>are played by men for entertainment, particularly during wedding festivities. Three salmagi are played in ensemble. Two are hung next to each other; the third is placed apart and played by striking the boss with a <b>bagol</b>,<b> </b>a padded beater, and dampening the vibrations by holding the rim or <b>falnimak</b>.<b> </b>The second performer, seated on the floor, plays the pair of salmagi using a bagol held in each hand and assisted by a third person who keeps the gongs from swaying against each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Small, light gongs with narrow rims, which produce more delicate sounds, are used by the Tiruray in an ensemble of five agung. The smallest gong is called <b>segarun</b>.<b> </b>It leads the music with its steady, regular rhythm. The <b>manitad</b>,<b> maning gula</b>,<b> tumabuk</b>,<b> </b>and <b>tumuktuk </b>follow with their own rhythmic patterns. The ensemble is played for visitors during community gatherings or festive occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Palawan, a gong ensemble called <b>basal </b>performs during feasts and ceremonies. It is made up of at least four instruments: a drum or <b>gimbal</b>;<b> </b>two small suspended gongs with turned-in rims called <b>sanang</b>; and a large, wide-rimmed, high-bossed agung. Sometimes one or two more agung are added to the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are also ensembles of 6-11 hanging melody gongs called <b>tagunggu </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, Bukidnon, Tagakaolo, Kalagan) or <b>kulintangan </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> Cotabato). The melody gongs are hung on ropes in pyramidal order, with the smaller- and higher-pitched gongs near the top. The Manobo Cotabato kulintangan uses eight graduated bossed gongs hung from a bamboo frame and held in place by ropes. The gongs, from highest to lowest pitch, are called <b>pagunsaran</b>,<b> paantuhan</b>, <b>paumbahan</b>,<b> ahongan</b>,<b> a-gungan</b>,<b> pat-tulos</b>,<b> pa-apos</b>, and <b>bandilan</b>.<b> </b>A melody player strikes the seven higher-pitched gongs with one beater, and a drone player strikes a continuous, even beat on the bandilan. A cylindrical, wooden drum, <b>gib-ba</b>,<b> </b>completes the ensemble. The melody player occasionally leaves the instrument to dance in small steps and with open arms to the rhythm of the drone-gong player. The ensemble is played exclusively for entertainment during large community feasts where the entire village dances to the music of the gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bagobo <b>tagunggo </b>or <b>tagonggo</b>,<b> </b>with its 9-11 gongs, is also played by a melody and a drone player. The ensemble may be complemented with one or two drums. The Tagakaolo tagunggo utilizes six gongs: five melody gongs and one drone gong called <b>patawaganan</b>. Drone and melody, with their diverse and subtle permutations, also underlie gong music in the northern Philippines. In the Kalinga flat-gong ensemble, the drone is played with the <b>pokpok </b>and ornamented with improvisatory rhythms on the <i>anungos</i><b> </b>while the <i>balbal</i>,<b> </b><i>salbat</i>,<b> </b><i>katlo</i>,<b> </b>and <i>kapat</i><b> </b>gongs provide a melody of staggered but uniform rhythmic patterns. In the kulintang ensemble of the Maguindanaon, melody is produced by the kulintang, and various drones with different timbral colors played on the dabakan, gandingan, and babandir.<b> </b>The steady, unchanging pattern on the dabakan and babandir mingle with the stopped and freely vibrating colors of the agung and gandingan. Drone and melody are also manifest in the Subanon tagunggo or hanging-gong ensembles, as well as in smaller ensembles where the drone is known as <b>dlabu</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An infinite variety of timbral colors is created by the gongs&rsquo; size, shape, and more importantly, the manner in which they are played. Ringing, stopped, shrill, pitched, and unpitched sounds are juxtaposed to create a rich dynamic texture.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

The sound box is a five-sided, semicircular cone on the rear side, with holes at the back to facilitate string changes. The front of the box is enclosed by a vibrating soundboard to which the strings extend. The neck holds either metal or wooden pegs for tuning.</span></p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tuning system is based on a seven-note diatonic scale, either in the major or minor modes. Strings are either nylon, metal, or a combination of both. Hardwoods make up the majority of materials used in the harp. Softwoods, like <i>palochina</i> or marine plywood, are sometimes used for the soundboard. Judging by the number of harps used, nangka wood seems to be the ideal material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine harps are believed to have originated from Spanish Renaissance-era harps brought to Latin America, then introduced to the Philippines via the Acapulco-Manila galleon trade in the late 16th century. The Filipino harp was played in many Hispanized areas from northern Luzon to the Visayas. More than one 19th-century author declared the harp to be the <i>instrumento nacional</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Philippine harps have common elements, comparative harp research done in the Ilocos and the Visayas shows differences in structural design and musical repertory. Structural differences tend to be more varied in Visayan harps when compared to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> harps. Visayan harps are generally shorter with fewer strings (80-120 cm at the forepillar and 25-32 strings) than Ilocano harps (130-50 cm and 30-36 strings). Two structural types are observed in the Visayas: the staved, five-board compound body and the hollow bodied type, which is carved from a single wood log, usually nangka. Most Ilocano harps have a staved sound box with wider soundboards (60 cm versus the Visayan&rsquo;s 45 cm) and deeper resonating boxes at the base (approximately 35 cm versus 27 cm). Zoomorphic carvings at the joint where the neck and forepillar meet are noticed on a good percentage of Visayan harp designs. Ilocano harps almost always have either a floral or star pattern in the same area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional repertories are based, for the most part, on dance music and popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk songs</a> in the dialect of a given region. Three of the most important traditional songs played on harps in the Visayas are the <b>kuratsa</b>,<i> </i><b>kuradang</b>,<i> </i>and, most importantly, the <b>balitaw</b>. Ilocano repertory includes songs in the vernacular, plus the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\">rigodon</a>,<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\">pandanggo</a></i>,<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\">jota</a>,<i> </i>various waltzes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/789\">polkas</a>, and other traditional European dances.

The sound box is a five-sided, semicircular cone on the rear side, with holes at the back to facilitate string changes. The front of the box is enclosed by a vibrating soundboard to which the strings extend. The neck holds either metal or wooden pegs for tuning.</span>"

				"value": "While Philippine harps have common elements, comparative harp research done in the Ilocos and the Visayas shows differences in structural design and musical repertory. Structural differences tend to be more varied in Visayan harps when compared to <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> harps. Visayan harps are generally shorter with fewer strings (80-120 cm at the forepillar and 25-32 strings) than Ilocano harps (130-50 cm and 30-36 strings). Two structural types are observed in the Visayas: the staved, five-board compound body and the hollow bodied type, which is carved from a single wood log, usually nangka. Most Ilocano harps have a staved sound box with wider soundboards (60 cm versus the Visayan&#x2019;s 45 cm) and deeper resonating boxes at the base (approximately 35 cm versus 27 cm). Zoomorphic carvings at the joint where the neck and forepillar meet are noticed on a good percentage of Visayan harp designs. Ilocano harps almost always have either a floral or star pattern in the same area."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Perhaps the most common string instrument in the world, the <b>lute</b> consists of a resonating chamber and a neck with strings that run the full length of the instrument. Players move their fingers up and down the neck, shortening the strings and producing various pitches. The strings may be plucked with the fingers or with the aid of a plectrum. Lutes that are bowed are classified as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/808\"><b>fiddles</b></a>. <b>Plucked lutes</b> come in various sizes and shapes. Important differences include the relative length of the body and neck, the shape of the back, the number of strings, and the presence or absence of frets. Lutes with long necks antedate those with short necks. Sometimes the neck of the lute is an elongation of the body. The shape of the resonating chamber may be rounded or flat. The neck may have frets that guide the performer&rsquo;s fingers.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, indigenous plucked lutes are found at present only in Mindanao and Palawan, and perhaps still in Mindoro highlands, among Islamic and non-Islamic groups. However, up until 18th century CE, historical sources written by Spanish missionaries documented that these were also found partly in the islands of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Panay, and even Luzon (Brandeis). An example is the Visayan <b>buktot</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The two-stringed plucked lute of the Muslim Maranao and Maguindanao is called the <b>kutyapi</b> or <b>kusyapi</b>, which most likely came from the island of Borneo, where it is known among a number of aboriginal peoples there as <b>sapeh</b> (<b>sape</b> or <b>sambe</b>). This type of lute is believed to have originated from Kerala, South India, from where it evolved into another type, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">zither</a>, called <b>kaccapa</b> of Continental Southeast Asia. Similar plucked lute instruments are played by non-Muslim groups: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2364\">Mansaka</a> <b>binarig</b>, <b>binudyaan</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kitara</b>,<b> faglong</b>,<b> faglung</b>,<b> foglong</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> <b>fegarong</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> <b>hagolong</b>,<b> hagelong</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> <b>katyapi</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> <b>kotapi</b>, <b>kutapi</b>; Manobo <b>fuglung</b>, <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kudlung</b>, <b>kudyapi</b>, <b>kutyapi</b>,<b> kudyung</b>; Ata <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kuglong</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> <b>kudlong</b>; Mangguangan <b>kudlong</b>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a> <b>kudlong</b>; Mansaka <b>kudlong</b>, <b>kudlung</b>; and Higaonon <b>piyapi</b>. Among these non-Muslim groups, plucked lutes are often paired with bamboo polychordal zither in marriage negotiations, which explains why the term &ldquo;kudlung&rdquo; or its variant &ldquo;fuglung,&rdquo; in some groups, would alternate with the term &ldquo;kutyapi&rdquo; (two-stringed lute).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kutyapi of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a> are longer than the inland lutes. The kudyapi is favored by community elders on formal occasions; the instrument may be heard at informal gatherings as well. The Maguindanaon kutyapi, made of light wood, has a boat-shaped resonating chamber. Two metal strings attached to a common <b>ngilung</b> (string holder) run the length of the instrument. The <b>sumayog </b>(drone string) vibrates freely. The <b>tamusan </b>(melody string) can be stopped at any of the 12 <b>dumalon</b> (frets) glued to the body of the lute. A <b>sungkol </b>(bridge) raises the melody string above the highest fret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kutyapi is held in the performer&rsquo;s lap like a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>. The left hand slides back and forth along the neck of the instrument while the fingers stop the melody string between the frets. The middle finger of the right hand plucks both the melody and drone strings with a rattan <b>kubit</b> (plectrum).<b> </b>The tapping of the right thumb on the body of the instrument provides an accompanying rhythm to the melody and drone as a special effect displaying the player&rsquo;s dexterity. Kutyapi music often has subtle metaphorical meanings concerning love. It is not generally played during festive occasions, for its music is easily drowned out by the noise and general merrymaking; it is more appropriate for courting and other more intimate occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Maranao kutyapi has florid and ornate designs on its body. Intricate carvings decorate the neck end and belly end of the instrument. In Ditsan, Lanao del Sur, the nine frets are called <b>damaran</b>.<b> </b>The pegs by which the strings are tightened or loosened are called <b>kaliug</b>.<b> </b>The bridge that raises the strings above the frets is the <b>tomokod</b>.<b> </b>The drone string or <b>hugong </b>plays the rhythm, and the second string plays the melody. The instrument is played solo or in ensemble. Solo music includes abstract pieces and those derived from vocal music. <b>Kapumalitubug</b>,<b> </b>for example, imitates the flow of the Malitubug River that runs between Lanao and Bukidnon, while <b>kapemunda </b>describes the separation of lovers. The kutyapi is joined by the <b>serong aganding </b>(parallel-stringed lute), <b>kubing </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>), and <b>insi </b>(ring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>) to form the serenading <b>kapanirong </b>ensemble. The musicians are not suitors, but act in behalf of their lovestruck relative or friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lutes of the inland communities are smaller. The distinction of this subtype of lute from the long and slim two-stringed lutes of groups within the orbit of Muslim influence is confirmed by surviving examples of small lutes preserved in Spanish museums and by the instrument called <b>buktot</b> that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a> had documented in his 1932 book. This subtype has a coconut shell for its resonator that is attached to the underside of the board with a large opening for capturing the sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>katyapi </b>of Lantacan, Bukidnon, played mostly by men, is shaped like a crocodile or a bird, and its 11 frets are<b> </b>glued on with beeswax. Its melodies express different sentiments: a man seeking a tryst with his loved one, a woman&rsquo;s response to a man&rsquo;s offer of love, a man bidding farewell on the eve of his departure for a faraway place. Sometimes the katyapi imitates sounds from nature, like the chirping of the <i>irol-irol</i><b> </b>bird at dusk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon kutapi is long necked, its body comprising a third of its total length of about one meter. It is carved out of a softwood log&mdash;the <i>thawan</i><b> </b>(light colored) or <i>mananggula</i><b> </b>(dark colored). The resonating chamber is fitted with a <b>thalap </b>(cover).<b> </b>At the top of the neck, the <b>dluwang </b>(two holes)<b> </b>accomodate <b>dleyonan </b>(pegs).<b> </b>A single wire string is attached to the left peg and then stretched from atop the body to the bottom end and returned to the top of the neck and attached to the right peg. The <b>panuso </b>(four frets) are glued onto the neck of the instrument with beeswax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lute is held upright, the neck slightly slanted to the right of the player. The bottom of the lute sits on the player&rsquo;s lap, wedged between the thighs. The left string acts as a drone and is plucked by the thumb. The melody string is played by the finger. The third and fourth finger holding a small piece of wood called <b>gulothok </b>or<b> sambulan</b>,<b> </b>occasionally thump the body of the lute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are two ways of tuning the Subanon lute. Both strings are tuned to the same pitch for dances, such as the <i>shoten</i>, <i>dumandeng matagandaw</i>, and <i>anderetendem</i>. The <i>thalak</i><b> </b>dance for weddings and festive gatherings is accompanied by the lute, whose drone string is tuned higher than the melody string. The Subanon kutapi is played by both men and women for courtship, self-entertainment, or to accompany dances. When not accompanying dances, melodies are derived from <b>abuyuk </b>(familiar love songs)<b> </b>and bear titles taken from the verses. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><i>pangalay</i></a><b> </b>dance is accompanied by a piece called <b>dumanding</b>;<b> </b>the <i>saot</i><b> </b>dance of shield-bearing boys is accompanied by the <b>sawten</b>.<b> </b>In Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte, the kutapi is sometimes played by two men: one playing the drone and melody strings, the second striking one of the strings with two small sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In South Cotabato, the Tboli dye their hagelong black. Intricate designs of various geometric shapes are etched out, exposing the natural light color of the wood; red ornamentation may be added. The drone and melody strings are made of abaca or, more recently, wire. A bamboo plectrum is used to pluck the strings and tap an accompanying rhythm on the body of the lute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Mandaya kudlong has eight frets or <b>bangun</b>, which can be moved to alter the tuning. Both strings are tuned to the same pitch and plucked with a plectrum tied to the performer&rsquo;s middle finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Mansaka tune the kudlong in two ways: when tuned with four or five frets, the lute is called the <b>binarig</b>;<b> </b>when tuned with eight frets, it is called the <b>binudya</b>.<b> </b>The strings are tuned in fifths. The performer squats with the side of the kudlong resting on his thighs. The left hand stops the strings, the right hand plucks them. The Mansaka play the kudlong for entertainment, solo or to accompany a song. Sometimes it is played in ensemble with a <b>takol</b> (five-stringed zither).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Blaan two-stringed lute is played for courtship, marriage, death, or to accompany dancing. Sometimes, two fuglung are played in ensemble with the <b>sluray </b>(zither). The Ata kudlong is played by a man who dances with the instrument, while following the footsteps of a dancing woman playing the <b>saluray </b>(polychordal zither).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a> <b>kusjapiq </b>is considered a man&rsquo;s instrument, and the names of its parts correspond to those of the male anatomy: <b>ulu </b>(head), <b>dabdab </b>(chest), <b>duru</b> (breasts or frets), <b>utin </b>(penis), <b>balibang </b>(hips), and <b>ipus </b>(tail). The long neck is the <b>tawil</b>,<b> </b>the resonating chamber the <b>ruwang</b>.<b> </b>The drone string is called <b>lambagan</b>.<b> </b>The melody string, <b>saningan</b>,<b> </b>is stretched over six frets, which can be arranged to play two scales, <b>bagit </b>or <b>kulilal</b>.<b> </b>When played as a solo instrument, the kusjapiq pieces bear descriptive or narrative titles. It plays in ensemble with one or two <b>pagang </b>(zither) or with another lute accompanied by the alternate improvised singing between men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Southern Philippine lutes are generally boat-shaped and long-necked, with a drone and melody string. They are all fretted, but distanced differently. The Maguindanaon and Maranao lutes have frets glued to the body or resonating chamber. Other lutes, like the Subanon kutapi, are fretted on the neck. Generally, the frets can be moved to change the tuning or scale, and are glued with beeswax. In some lutes, both strings are tuned to the same pitch, while others are tuned differently. All lutes are played similarly: one hand plucks the strings with a plectrum, the other stops the strings. Performers commonly tap rhythms on the lute&rsquo;s body to intensify the music. Some groups play the lute while dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lute is played solo or to accompany singing or dancing. It is also played in ensemble with another lute, a zither, or other instruments. Both men and women play the lute on various occasions: self-entertainment, courtship, marriage festivities, mourning, or lulling a child to sleep. When accompanying a dance, the music often takes on the name of the dance. Pieces are named after the source of inspiration&mdash;a song or a line from a song. Often, the music imitates nature: animal and bird sounds, as well as flowing waters or whispering winds.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

Players move their fingers up and down the neck, shortening the strings and producing various pitches. The strings may be plucked with the fingers or with the aid of a plectrum. Lutes that are bowed are classified as <a href=\"/5/37/808\"><b>fiddles</b></a>. <b>Plucked lutes</b> come in various sizes and shapes. Important differences include the relative length of the body and neck, the shape of the back, the number of strings, and the presence or absence of frets. Lutes with long necks antedate those with short necks. Sometimes the neck of the lute is an elongation of the body. The shape of the resonating chamber may be rounded or flat. The neck may have frets that guide the performer&#x2019;s fingers."

The Maguindanaon and Maranao lutes have frets glued to the body or resonating chamber. Other lutes, like the Subanon kutapi, are fretted on the neck. Generally, the frets can be moved to change the tuning or scale, and are glued with beeswax. In some lutes, both strings are tuned to the same pitch, while others are tuned differently. All lutes are played similarly: one hand plucks the strings with a plectrum, the other stops the strings. Performers commonly tap rhythms on the lute&#x2019;s body to intensify the music. Some groups play the lute while dancing."

Both men and women play the lute on various occasions: self-entertainment, courtship, marriage festivities, mourning, or lulling a child to sleep. When accompanying a dance, the music often takes on the name of the dance. Pieces are named after the source of inspiration&#x2014;a song or a line from a song.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">A musical instrument shaped like a bow, the <b>musical bow</b> consists of a bamboo or wooden stave or a length of mature reed that may be curved by the tension of one to two strings stretched across its ends. The instrument ranges in length from about 37 cm to big hunting bows 5 ft long. Musical bows are known as <b>timawa</b><i> </i>among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2328\">Agta</a> of Cagayan; <b>busog</b> among the Dumagat in Palanan, Isabela; <b>gitaha</b><i> </i>and<i> </i><b>palat</b><i> </i>among the Dumagat of Casiguran, Quezon; <b>bayi</b> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2368\">Aeta</a> of Pinatubo, Zambales; and <b>gurimbaw</b><i> </i>among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> of Tayabas, Quezon. Some Cordillera groups&mdash;notably, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> in the Buwaya region, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> of Abra, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot) of Nueva Vizcaya&mdash;play this instrument. The stories about Aeta slaves in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> songs of the Buwaya Kalinga indicate that the Cordillera peoples adopted the instrument through their interaction with the Aeta roaming the same mountain ranges. Similarly, the presence of the musical bow called <b>butting</b><i> </i>among the Yogad of Isabela may be linked to Aeta groups, like the Dumagat who reside in the same area.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Musical bows often utilize resonators. The gitaha rests on top of a tin can, which is laid on the musician&rsquo;s chest. The gitaha player can also place one end of the bow in the mouth, which acts as a resonator. By changing the shape of the mouth and lightly pressing on the strings at the opposite end, the player can produce varying pitches and tone colors.

The instrument ranges in length from about 37 cm to big hunting bows 5 ft long. Musical bows are known as <b>timawa</b><i> </i>among the <a href=\"/1/2/2328\">Agta</a> of Cagayan; <b>busog</b> among the Dumagat in Palanan, Isabela; <b>gitaha</b><i> </i>and<i> </i><b>palat</b><i> </i>among the Dumagat of Casiguran, Quezon; <b>bayi</b> among the <a href=\"/1/2/2368\">Aeta</a> of Pinatubo, Zambales; and <b>gurimbaw</b><i> </i>among the <a href=\"/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> of Tayabas, Quezon.

The stories about Aeta slaves in <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epic</a> songs of the Buwaya Kalinga indicate that the Cordillera peoples adopted the instrument through their interaction with the Aeta roaming the same mountain ranges.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The <b>organ</b> is a wind instrument, its tones produced by air passing through a set of pipes of different lengths. The largest and most complex of musical instruments, it has keys that control valves that release air from a wind-chest into the pipes. The many sets of pipes are controlled from two or more keyboards called manuals, and a pedal keyboard.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dating back to pre-Christian times, the organ probably descended from the <b>panpipe</b>, a type of syrinx. The invention of the <b>hydraulis</b>, or <b>water organ</b>, is attributed to a Greek engineer, Ktesibios, who lived in Alexandria around the third century BC. The hydraulis was a powerful instrument, with wind pressure supplied by a water compressor while the various pipes were sounded by the manipulation of slide valves. It was used by the Greeks and Romans at festivals and games, and during the rites of the mystery cults. During the early Christian centuries, bellows that pumped air into the pipes replaced the water compressors, and the size and number of pipes greatly increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the mid-fifth century, the organ was used in churches in Spain for high festivals. By the 11th century, large organs were in general use in Europe, but it was not until the 13th century that the capacity, compass, and mechanism began to be developed. Keys gradually replaced the awkward slides, enlarging pitch and tonal ranges. Pedals were invented in the 14th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During that period, a miniature portable organ, called <b>portative organ</b>, and a small stationary organ, the <b>positive</b>, were used extensively. In the portative or <b>organetto</b>, the player provided his own air supply, using the right hand for the keyboard and the left for the bellows. It was monophonic, suited to playing a solo dance tune. There were usually two rows of pipes with a range of up to two octaves. The positive, on the other hand, required two or three sets of bellows and someone else to operate them so that the player could use both hands on the keyboard. Although not portable, the positive could be easily moved, and smaller versions were often placed on a table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of organ building and organ music began around 1600 and continued well into the 19th century. The organ of this period was distinguished by great brilliance and variety of tones, and its extreme clarity provided a perfect medium for the performance of polyphonic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 19th-century Romantic movement, with its emphasis on expressive orchestral sound, brought with it a decline in organ building and organ music. Builders attempted unsuccessfully to create a one-person orchestra. However, the later 19th and 20th centuries saw the introduction of a vast number of new tonal effects and great advances in mechanical construction. In Paris in 1867, electricity was first used to activate the keys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of pipe organs exist throughout the Philippines, usually German, Dutch, or Spanish manufactured. The largest is the four-manual organ in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, followed by the three-manual organ in the Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint John. Two manual organs can be found in the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a>, San Sebastian, University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music, San Beda, St. Scholastica, Christ the King Church in Green Meadows, Christ the King Chapel at the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) Seminary, Lourdes, St. Stephen, Paco, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a>, all in Metro Manila. Outside of Metro Manila, pipe organs were built in the churches of Tayabas, Quezon, in the early 1900; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a>, ca 1816, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/291\">Dalaguete</a>, ca 1880, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/272\">Boljoon</a>, ca 1880, all in Cebu; Bacong, Negros Oriental, 1894; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, 1824, Dimiao, 1830-50, Garcia Hernandez, 1894, Loay, 1830-50, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/322\">Loboc</a>, 1830-50, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/323\">Loon</a>, 1830-50, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/339\">Maribojoc</a>, ca 1890, all in Bohol; Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, 1892; and Jimenez, Misamis Oriental, 1894. Other current installations include the German organ at the EDSA Shrine, Pasig, Metro Manila, and the pipe organ at the University of the Philippines College of Music. Prominent Filipino pipe organists include Armando Salarza, Eric Dimson, Jun Flores, and Alejandro Consolacion II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most unique and historically most important pipe organ is the <b>bamboo organ</b> of Las Pi&ntilde;as. It was built from 1816 to 1824 by Spanish Augustinian Recollect <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\">Fr Diego Cera</a> (1762-1832), who also constructed the Las Pi&ntilde;as Church from 1797 to 1819. In 1880, the organ and the church were severely damaged by three earthquakes. The organ was disassembled and the pipes kept in the old sacristy. In 1882, a strong typhoon tore up the church roof and the wind-chest of the organ was damaged further. The church was rebuilt in 1888, but the organ remained unplayable for the next several decades. It was only in 1973 that the entire instrument was shipped to Bonn, Germany, for restoration. Repair work was done in a room in which the temperature and humidity of Las Pi&ntilde;as were simulated. On 13 Mar 1975, the completely restored organ was flown back to the Philippines, and on 9 May of the same year was inaugurated in a concert by German organist Wolfgang Oehms. Every year since then, the Bamboo Organ Festival has become an important music event featuring local and foreign performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two scholars from the St. Joseph Parish in Las Pi&ntilde;as, Cealwyn Tagle and Edgar Montiano, underwent three years of intensive on-the-job training for pipe organ construction and maintenance in Austria. Upon their return in the early 1990s, their first assignment was to construct a pipe organ at the St. Joseph&rsquo;s Academy Auditorium, adjacent to the church where the bamboo organ is located. The organ was inaugurated in 1994, and from then on, they have constructed new pipe organs and restored existing ones in the older churches under the company Diego Cera Organbuilders, Inc. They constructed pipe organs for the Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in Novaliches, Union Church of Makati, Lamoiyan Corporation in Para&ntilde;aque, Cathedral of Cebu, Immaculate Conception Church Parish in Pasig, Conservatory of Music in UST, Lipa Cathedral, San Carlos Seminary in Makati, San Sebastian Cathedral in Lipa, and Our Lady of Loreto Church in Sampaloc, Manila. They also restored the pipe organs of the San Agustin Church and the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, allowing the two historical churches to celebrate an annual music festival featuring pipe organ music as the main focus. The San Agustin International Music Festival was inaugurated in 1998, while the Manila Cathedral Pipe Organ Festival began in 2006. They have also renovated the pipe organs of Espiritu Santo in Tayuman, San Fernando de Dilao in Paco, Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City, Santisimo Rosario Church inside the UST Campus, and the Palo Cathedral in Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>electric organ</b> was invented in 1935 by American Laurens Hammond to overcome the three main problems of pipe organs: high cost, large size, and the need for regular tuning. The commercial success of the Hammond Organ paved the way for other manufacturers of similar electronic instruments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Today, the electronic organ, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/829\">synthesizer</a>, makes use of the latest electronic and computer technology and is capable of recreating not only the sounds of traditional orchestral instruments with amazing accuracy but also a host of sound effects so useful in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop music</a>. In the Philippines, the electronic organ has been highly popular for over two decades, and can be found throughout the country in homes, churches, and places of entertainment. Yamaha is the leading brand, and the company held an annual competition from the 1970s until the late 1990s and sent representatives to the Southeast Asian Electone Festival, the winner of which advanced to the International Yamaha Electone Concours in Japan.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

It was built from 1816 to 1824 by Spanish Augustinian Recollect <a href=\"/5/42/3936\">Fr Diego Cera</a> (1762-1832), who also constructed the Las Pi&#xF1;as Church from 1797 to 1819. In 1880, the organ and the church were severely damaged by three earthquakes. The organ was disassembled and the pipes kept in the old sacristy. In 1882, a strong typhoon tore up the church roof and the wind-chest of the organ was damaged further. The church was rebuilt in 1888, but the organ remained unplayable for the next several decades. It was only in 1973 that the entire instrument was shipped to Bonn, Germany, for restoration. Repair work was done in a room in which the temperature and humidity of Las Pi&#xF1;as were simulated. On 13 Mar 1975, the completely restored organ was flown back to the Philippines, and on 9 May of the same year was inaugurated in a concert by German organist Wolfgang Oehms. Every year since then, the Bamboo Organ Festival has become an important music event featuring local and foreign performers."

Upon their return in the early 1990s, their first assignment was to construct a pipe organ at the St. Joseph&#x2019;s Academy Auditorium, adjacent to the church where the bamboo organ is located. The organ was inaugurated in 1994, and from then on, they have constructed new pipe organs and restored existing ones in the older churches under the company Diego Cera Organbuilders, Inc. They constructed pipe organs for the Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in Novaliches, Union Church of Makati, Lamoiyan Corporation in Para&#xF1;aque, Cathedral of Cebu, Immaculate Conception Church Parish in Pasig, Conservatory of Music in UST, Lipa Cathedral, San Carlos Seminary in Makati, San Sebastian Cathedral in Lipa, and Our Lady of Loreto Church in Sampaloc, Manila. They also restored the pipe organs of the San Agustin Church and the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, allowing the two historical churches to celebrate an annual music festival featuring pipe organ music as the main focus. The San Agustin International Music Festival was inaugurated in 1998, while the Manila Cathedral Pipe Organ Festival began in 2006. They have also renovated the pipe organs of Espiritu Santo in Tayuman, San Fernando de Dilao in Paco, Santo Domingo Church in Quezon City, Santisimo Rosario Church inside the UST Campus, and the Palo Cathedral in Leyte."

The commercial success of the Hammond Organ paved the way for other manufacturers of similar electronic instruments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Today, the electronic organ, like the <a href=\"/5/37/829\">synthesizer</a>, makes use of the latest electronic and computer technology and is capable of recreating not only the sounds of traditional orchestral instruments with amazing accuracy but also a host of sound effects so useful in <a href=\"/5/35/790\">pop music</a>. In the Philippines, the electronic organ has been highly popular for over two decades, and can be found throughout the country in homes, churches, and places of entertainment. Yamaha is the leading brand, and the company held an annual competition from the 1970s until the late 1990s and sent representatives to the Southeast Asian Electone Festival, the winner of which advanced to the International Yamaha Electone Concours in Japan.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The <b>piano</b> is a keyboard instrument invented in 1709 by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1730), which he called <i>gravicembalo col piano e forte</i> (a harpsichord with soft and loud sounds). Unlike the earlier <b>harpsichords</b> and <b>clavichords</b>, louder and softer sounds could be produced at will on the newly invented piano, using greater or less force on the keys. Only three of Cristofori&rsquo;s instruments still remain: one dated 1720 is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York;&nbsp;another dated 1722 is in Rome;&nbsp;and one dated 1726 is in Leipzig. They are surviving ancestors of an instrument that has spread all over the world.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano came into being out of necessity. In the early 1700s, the domestic keyboard instruments were the clavichord, which had expressive dynamic qualities but was very faint in tone, and the harpsichord, which was louder and more brilliant but was incapable of dynamic gradations. The natural desire seems to have grown for a keyboard instrument combining the clavichord&rsquo;s capability of accentuation, <b>crescendo</b>, <b>diminuendo</b>, and <b>cantabile</b>, with the force and brilliance of the harpsichord. It remained only for Cristofori to figure out the escapement&mdash;a device for releasing the hammer after it has struck the string&mdash;and the piano was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the player strikes a key, a felt hammer is thrown at a string or group of strings, and a felt damper is lifted so that the string is allowed to vibrate freely, thus producing the sound. Resonance and amplification are provided by a wooden sounding board, usually of spruce, under the strings. An escapement allows the hammer to fall back even though the key is being held down. The wedge-shaped damper remains off the strings until the key is released, at which time it clamps down on the strings and cuts off the sound. Both the escapement and dampers were inventions of Cristofori. The tone of the piano can be varied in intensity, or loudness, by varying the amount of force used in the keys. Thus, a concert pianist can produce many levels of shadings between his or her loudest and softest tones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Grand pianos have three pedals while uprights usually have two. The pedal to the right is the sustaining pedal, often improperly called the <b>loud pedal</b>. When pressed down it lifts all the dampers, allowing the strings to continue sounding until the pedal is released. The use of this pedal requires the utmost care and precision&mdash;faulty pedaling can make the music messy and blurred. The pedal on the left is the <b>soft pedal</b>. When pressed down, it moves the hammers to the right&nbsp;and hits only one or two strings instead of three. On an upright piano, the whole set of hammers is brought nearer to the strings for a less powerful blow. The middle pedal, the <b>sostenuto</b>, is found on most grand pianos but not on all uprights. This operates an apparatus, which catches only dampers in their raised position until the pedal is released. This allows the player to sustain a note or a chord that will not be blurred by the addition of other tones played after the pedal is pressed down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano keyboard usually consists of 88 keys making up a compass or range of seven and a quarter octaves. The earliest pianos of Cristofori had a compass of 4&frac12; octaves. This compass was gradually increased. The concert grand piano of Mozart, on exhibit at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, has five octaves. In 1790, the English piano maker Broadwood made the first piano with six octaves. In 1824, Liszt was still playing in Paris on a piano with six octaves. The works of Schumann and Chopin require beyond six and a quarter octaves, although Bosendorfer of Austria makes pianos with eight octaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modern grand pianos range in size from the 2.74 m <b>concert grand</b> down to 1.57 m <b>baby grands</b>. These sizes are normal&mdash;there are instruments as long as 3.35 m and shorter than 1.5 m. Large upright pianos more than 1.2 m high have been largely superseded by lower instruments: the studio upright (about 1.16 m high), the console (about 1 m high), and the spinet (about .91 m high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of the piano after the perfection of its lever system is largely concerned with the development of the metal bracing that could withstand the ever increasing tension imposed by the thicker strings required for increased loudness and brilliance. The greatest single advance was the invention of the one-piece cast-iron frame by Alpheus Babcock in 1825. He was also the first to conceive of <b>cross-stringing </b>or<b> overstringing</b>, an arrangement in which the strings of treble and middle registers fan at a higher level. These two features were given what is essentially their present form<i> </i>in the grand piano exhibited in 1855 by Steinway and Sons of New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piano has the greatest number of compositions written for it. Its versatility has made it even more popular in homes and concert halls. Its range of seven and quarter octaves is greater than any other traditional instrument, with the exception of the large pipe organ. It is capable of an extremely wide range of dynamics, from the softest pianissimo to the loudest fortissimo. It can be played solo or serve as accompaniment to other instruments. It is at home with any style of music&mdash;from classical to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a> to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a>. Any style of playing is possible: full chords, rapid arpeggios, fast scale passages, several melodies at the same time, etc. Many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestral</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operatic</a> works have been transcribed so that they can be played on the piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, pianos from Europe, such as those produced by the Swiss maker C. Rondorf &amp; Co, were being imported during the Spanish colonial period. In 1879, Pio Trinidad established his own piano tuning and repair shop on Calle Alcala, now known as Raon Street in the Quiapo district of Manila. Later, he learned to manufacture his own, and by 1896 he had assembled his first piano, with both case and frame made of acle wood, the bridge of the instrument made of dungon, and the sounding board made of kalantas. This first piano was later donated to President Emilio Aguinaldo in Malolos. In 1903, Trinidad established Pio Trinidad &amp; Co, a piano manufacturing and repair shop along Calle Ronquillo. For exhibition at the 1904 Saint Louis Exposition, he built a special piano made of 17 kinds of wood, which eventually won an award, together with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a> he designed for the same occasion. His piano factory was able to turn out more than a hundred pianos by 1905. Trinidad continued with his piano shop until 1921 when he sold it to Rafael and Luis Echegoyen, the owners of La Lira Music Store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other companies that imported pianos before World War II include Estrella del Norte, Echegoyen, Felipe Yupangco, Lyric Music House, Getz Brothers, and Jacinto. The manufacture of pianos in the Philippines began in the 1950s with P. E. Domingo, F. Yupangco, and Jacinto. They substituted the local almaciga wood in place of the costly imported spruce for the sounding boards. The cast-iron frame, pin block, and wood case began to be made locally. The most critical parts, however, continued to be imported: the action or lever system, keyboard, felt hammerheads, and strings. Soon, other local manufacturers followed: Trebel, Lyric, Weinstein, and Javincello. Available imported brands include Yamaha, Kawai, Sammick, Royale, Daewoo, and Steinway &amp; Sons.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

It is at home with any style of music&#x2014;from classical to <a href=\"/5/35/779\">jazz</a> to <a href=\"/5/35/793\">rock</a>. Any style of playing is possible: full chords, rapid arpeggios, fast scale passages, several melodies at the same time, etc. Many <a href=\"/5/36/802\">orchestral</a> and <a href=\"/5/35/786\">operatic</a> works have been transcribed so that they can be played on the piano."

In 1879, Pio Trinidad established his own piano tuning and repair shop on Calle Alcala, now known as Raon Street in the Quiapo district of Manila. Later, he learned to manufacture his own, and by 1896 he had assembled his first piano, with both case and frame made of acle wood, the bridge of the instrument made of dungon, and the sounding board made of kalantas. This first piano was later donated to President Emilio Aguinaldo in Malolos. In 1903, Trinidad established Pio Trinidad &amp; Co, a piano manufacturing and repair shop along Calle Ronquillo. For exhibition at the 1904 Saint Louis Exposition, he built a special piano made of 17 kinds of wood, which eventually won an award, together with the <a href=\"/5/37/830\">violin</a> he designed for the same occasion. His piano factory was able to turn out more than a hundred pianos by 1905. Trinidad continued with his piano shop until 1921 when he sold it to Rafael and Luis Echegoyen, the owners of La Lira Music Store."

The manufacture of pianos in the Philippines began in the 1950s with P. E. Domingo, F. Yupangco, and Jacinto. They substituted the local almaciga wood in place of the costly imported spruce for the sounding boards. The cast-iron frame, pin block, and wood case began to be made locally. The most critical parts, however, continued to be imported: the action or lever system, keyboard, felt hammerheads, and strings. Soon, other local manufacturers followed: Trebel, Lyric, Weinstein, and Javincello. Available imported brands include Yamaha, Kawai, Sammick, Royale, Daewoo, and Steinway &amp; Sons.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

The Blaan otot is a toy reed instrument made of coconut leaves.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">A <b>synthesizer</b> is a machine that can produce and process sounds electronically in real time, usually from a keyboard. Originally developed for use by composers of <b>electronic music</b>, the synthesizer has become extremely popular because of its widespread use in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">popular</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a> music. Because the synthesizer is an extremely versatile apparatus, which can duplicate the sound of conventional musical instruments as well as novelty sounds, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that there were early electronic instruments whose technological innovations contributed to the development of the present-day synthesizers. The most important of these early electronic instruments were the <b>telharmonium</b>, <b>theremin</b>, <b>spherophone</b>, <b>partiturophone</b>, <b>ondes martenot</b>, and<b> trautonium</b>.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<b> </b>telharmonium was invented by Thaddeus Cahill (1867-1934). It weighed 200 tons and was exhibited in New York in 1906. This machine disappeared before World War II. The theremin, built before 1920 by Leon Theremin, consisted of a small box with two antennae&nbsp;and was manipulated by a performer standing in front of it and moving his hands up and down through the air. It was widely demonstrated in the 1920s and several composers wrote for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The spherophone was a kind of primitive electronic organ first built in 1923 by Jorge Mager (1880-1929). After two prototypes, Mager constructed a larger and more sophisticated machine, the partiturophone, which had many manuals and special effects such as vibrato. These machines were lost in World War II. The ondes martenot, constructed by Maurice Martenot in 1928, has a keyboard and a number of other manual controls with two separate loud speakers. One of its special features was the capability to slide between pitches. The trautonium was invented by Friedrich Trautwein in 1930. It was an instrument operated by means of a wire touched by the finger, the pressure of touch determining loudness and the location of the finger determining pitch. Composers continued to use the trautonium until the mid-1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1950s, Herbert Belar and Harry Olsen constructed the Mark II RCA Music Synthesizer, which was later donated to the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. This machine, of which only a model was made, was the most advanced electronic music apparatus of its time, giving the composer a large measure of control over the aspects of the sounds synthesized. However, even with such equipment available, electronic music composers still had to put a piece of music together. Even rudimentary phrasing, articulation or change of timbre could involve many grueling hours for the production of mere seconds of music. The two most natural vocal or instrumental means of musical expression, <b>crescendo</b> and <b>diminuendo</b>, required the most calculated and laborious manipulation of volume controls and filters. The musician was unable to hear, much less modify, a sound as it was being produced. It proved to be a time-consuming process since everything had to be recorded on tape, which was later spliced into small sections to &ldquo;construct&rdquo; the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1965, Robert A. Moog in New York originated the <b>modern synthesizer </b>in a commercial package. The invention revolutionized electronic composition by speeding up the laborious process of doing away with the drudgery of assembling small sections on tape. Donald Buchla in California and Paul Ketoff in Rome also independently constructed synthesizers for commercial use, employing the newer transistor technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The synthesizer has controls that establish the time of attack, sustain, delay, and end of a sound. Other properties, such as pitch, amplitude, timbre, reverberation, and modulation, are controlled automatically, usually from a keyboard. Keyboards are the most important manual control devices within synthesizers. Although they are often modeled on the black-and-white semitonal keyboards of conventional instruments, many other designs are in use&mdash;black-and-white keys do not always indicate semitonal intervals, though the pitches are normally separated by equal pitch distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Synthesizer keyboards have a number of special features: the keys may be pressure-sensitive, allowing a new means for the control of some property of the sound, and there may be buttons or switches to transpose the keyboard. Prior to 1976, most synthesizers could perform only one note at a time. Since 1976, polyphonic synthesizers have become an important part of pop-music making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of <b>digital synthesizers</b> in the late 1970s paved the way for music produced solely from digital sounds, and it instigated the fabrication of smaller and less expensive keyboard instruments. By 1988, the <b>workstation synthesizer</b> was introduced, with a feature that allowed for the sequencing of entire songs through the use of separate tracks for recording individual parts. At the turn of the 21st century, software synthesizers were developed, which simplified the creation of music using only personal computers or laptops, through the aid of a software that generates digital sounds without the need for conventional keyboard instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before World War II, Busoni enthusiastically prophesied the importance of electronic music. The synthesizer presented composers not only with a complete spectrum of new sounds but with a remarkable variety of sounds that could be made to play by itself, repeatedly or as required.

				"value": "A <b>synthesizer</b> is a machine that can produce and process sounds electronically in real time, usually from a keyboard. Originally developed for use by composers of <b>electronic music</b>, the synthesizer has become extremely popular because of its widespread use in <a href=\"/5/35/790\">popular</a>, <a href=\"/5/35/779\">jazz</a>, and <a href=\"/5/35/793\">rock</a> music. Because the synthesizer is an extremely versatile apparatus, which can duplicate the sound of conventional musical instruments as well as novelty sounds, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that there were early electronic instruments whose technological innovations contributed to the development of the present-day synthesizers. The most important of these early electronic instruments were the <b>telharmonium</b>, <b>theremin</b>, <b>spherophone</b>, <b>partiturophone</b>, <b>ondes martenot</b>, and<b> trautonium</b>."

				"value": "The<b> </b>telharmonium was invented by Thaddeus Cahill (1867-1934). It weighed 200 tons and was exhibited in New York in 1906. This machine disappeared before World War II. The theremin, built before 1920 by Leon Theremin, consisted of a small box with two antennae&#xA0;and was manipulated by a performer standing in front of it and moving his hands up and down through the air. It was widely demonstrated in the 1920s and several composers wrote for it."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The spherophone was a kind of primitive electronic organ first built in 1923 by Jorge Mager (1880-1929). After two prototypes, Mager constructed a larger and more sophisticated machine, the partiturophone, which had many manuals and special effects such as vibrato. These machines were lost in World War II. The ondes martenot, constructed by Maurice Martenot in 1928, has a keyboard and a number of other manual controls with two separate loud speakers. One of its special features was the capability to slide between pitches. The trautonium was invented by Friedrich Trautwein in 1930. It was an instrument operated by means of a wire touched by the finger, the pressure of touch determining loudness and the location of the finger determining pitch. Composers continued to use the trautonium until the mid-1950s."

				"value": "In the early 1950s, Herbert Belar and Harry Olsen constructed the Mark II RCA Music Synthesizer, which was later donated to the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. This machine, of which only a model was made, was the most advanced electronic music apparatus of its time, giving the composer a large measure of control over the aspects of the sounds synthesized. However, even with such equipment available, electronic music composers still had to put a piece of music together. Even rudimentary phrasing, articulation or change of timbre could involve many grueling hours for the production of mere seconds of music. The two most natural vocal or instrumental means of musical expression, <b>crescendo</b> and <b>diminuendo</b>, required the most calculated and laborious manipulation of volume controls and filters. The musician was unable to hear, much less modify, a sound as it was being produced. It proved to be a time-consuming process since everything had to be recorded on tape, which was later spliced into small sections to &#x201C;construct&#x201D; the music."
			},

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In 1965, Robert A. Moog in New York originated the <b>modern synthesizer </b>in a commercial package. The invention revolutionized electronic composition by speeding up the laborious process of doing away with the drudgery of assembling small sections on tape. Donald Buchla in California and Paul Ketoff in Rome also independently constructed synthesizers for commercial use, employing the newer transistor technology."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The synthesizer has controls that establish the time of attack, sustain, delay, and end of a sound. Other properties, such as pitch, amplitude, timbre, reverberation, and modulation, are controlled automatically, usually from a keyboard. Keyboards are the most important manual control devices within synthesizers. Although they are often modeled on the black-and-white semitonal keyboards of conventional instruments, many other designs are in use&#x2014;black-and-white keys do not always indicate semitonal intervals, though the pitches are normally separated by equal pitch distances."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Synthesizer keyboards have a number of special features: the keys may be pressure-sensitive, allowing a new means for the control of some property of the sound, and there may be buttons or switches to transpose the keyboard. Prior to 1976, most synthesizers could perform only one note at a time. Since 1976, polyphonic synthesizers have become an important part of pop-music making."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The development of <b>digital synthesizers</b> in the late 1970s paved the way for music produced solely from digital sounds, and it instigated the fabrication of smaller and less expensive keyboard instruments. By 1988, the <b>workstation synthesizer</b> was introduced, with a feature that allowed for the sequencing of entire songs through the use of separate tracks for recording individual parts. At the turn of the 21st century, software synthesizers were developed, which simplified the creation of music using only personal computers or laptops, through the aid of a software that generates digital sounds without the need for conventional keyboard instruments."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Before World War II, Busoni enthusiastically prophesied the importance of electronic music. The synthesizer presented composers not only with a complete spectrum of new sounds but with a remarkable variety of sounds that could be made to play by itself, repeatedly or as required. Because of the astonishing and imitative qualities of the synthesizers, its use has been commercialized and has been mainstreamed as a performance instrument, combined with modern computer/digital technology.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Eric Dimson, updated by <a href=\"/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

Two F-shaped sound holes are cut into about the middle of the soundboard. Connected to the body is the neck with a fingerboard made of ebony, which projects over the soundboard on the lower end. At the top end of the neck is the nut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Four strings tuned to G, D1, A1, and E2 run from the upper end of the tailpiece, over the bridge, through the fingerboard, and to the nut, and these strings are secured by the ebony pegs in the peg box. The tailpiece is fastened by a heavy piece of gut running over the ebony saddle and is secured by the end pin. Connected to the tailpiece is also a fine-tuning device for the E-string. Meanwhile, perched on the bridge is the mute, a comb-shaped rider that stifles some of the vibrations of the bridge and, consequently, of the body, resulting in a thinner timbre. Over the peg box is the scroll. By tuning the pegs, the tension of the strings may be adjusted to their proper pitches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The chin rest, attached to the soundboard on the left side of the tailpiece, was invented in 1829 by violinist Ludwig Spohr (1724-1859), some 300 years after the first violins were handcrafted by the celebrated Italian string-instrument makers of Brescia (Gasparo de Salo, Maggini), Cremona (Amati, Stradivari, Guarneri, etc.), and Milan (Testore, Guaadangini) in the 1550s. The bow was perfected only in 1875 by Francis Tourte (1747-1835) in Paris. Made of horsehair strung on both ends of a wooden stick, the bow is lubricated by rubbing the horsehair with rosin.

The former is capable of playing a melody made up of interlocking pitches, while the latter is principally an idiophone that produces dance rhythms. Except for board zithers, these tube zithers are made of bamboo and are idiochords, which means that the strings are made of sheaths stripped from but attached to both ends of the bamboo&rsquo;s body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Polychordal zithers are found among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> in the north; and among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>, Tagakaolo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2364\">Mansaka</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a> in the south. The instruments consist of a bamboo tube about 12 cm in diameter, closed at both ends by nodes, but partially opened for better resonance. Strings are etched out of the bamboo body and remain attached at both ends about seven centimeters from each node, and are kept in place by rattan or woven bamboo rings. The strings are raised and given tension by inserting small bamboo or wooden frets beneath each string near the ends. The number and placement of the etched-out strings vary from 3 to 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalinga <b>kulibet </b>or <b>kolitong </b>has six, occasionally 10, strings. In the six-stringed kulibet, two strings are etched out on one side of the tube, and four on the opposite side. The player holds the instrument with both hands, one end of the instrument resting against his lower waist. The two front strings are plucked with the thumbs, and the four dorsal strings are plucked with the middle and index fingers. Alternate fingers of both hands produce a continuous melody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Isneg <b>ohitang </b>or <b>uritang </b>is played by women for self-entertainment and relaxation. It has five strings: the two front strings are plucked with both thumbs, the three dorsal strings by the other fingers. The five- or six-stringed <b>kollesing </b>of the Bugkalot is held by a man while a woman strikes the strings with small bamboo sticks. The Ifugao sometimes play their zithers in an ensemble called <b>lube</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The polychordal zither has many names: <b>kolitong</b>,<b> kollitong</b>,<b> kuletong</b>,<b> kullitong </b>(Bontok and Kalinga); <b>kulesin</b>,<b> kulising </b>(Bugkalot); <b>kolliteng</b>,<b> kulitteng </b>(Isneg); <b>salorai</b>,<b> saluray</b>,<b> saluroy</b>,<b> saw-ray </b>(Manobo and Ata); <b>sigitan </b>(Subanon); <b>sloroy</b>,<b> senday</b>,<b> sluray</b>,<b> sludoy </b>(Blaan, Tagakaolo, Tboli); <b>takul </b>(Mansaka); <b>tangkew </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2329\">Agusanon Manobo</a>); <b>tangke </b>(Tiruray); <b>tangko</b>,<b> tangku </b>(Mangguangan and Dibabawon); <b>togo</b>, <b>tugo </b>(Manobo and Tiruray, Maguindanao); and <b>pagang </b>(Palawan). The Palawan eight- or nine-stringed pagang may be played solo or with the <b>kusjapiq </b>(lute) in duets, trios, or quartets accompanied by <b>karang </b>and <b>kulilal </b>songs alternately sung by men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon sigitan has five strings. It is played by two people: one plucks the strings while another strikes the side of the tube with bamboo sticks called <b>glapikal</b>.<b> </b>The sigitan plays a tune called <b>da-endit </b>to accompany a dance. Other pieces express love, sorrow, sadness, or joy. The Tiruray eight-stringed tangke is played with a plectrum by two women, one plucking the drone, the other the melody. The Blaan, Ata Matigsalug, and Tboli polychordal zithers are often played with the two-stringed lute. Both the Blaan sluray and the Tboli sludoy are five stringed. Blaan women play the sluray for self-entertainment or to express love or sorrow. Played in ensemble with two <b>fuglong </b>(lutes), it accompanies festive dancing, especially at weddings. The Bagobo tugo has seven strings, while the Bukidnon Matigsalug saluray has six strings. In one courting dance, the female plays and dances with her saluray as the male, playing his <b>kudlong </b>(lute) and singing, follows the woman in small mincing steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The parallel-stringed tube zither is found in northern Luzon, Zambales, Mindoro, Mindanao, and Palawan. In the Cordillera highlands, it is called <b>bambam</b>, <b>pas-ing </b>by the Isneg, and <b>tambi </b>by the Kalinga. It is made of heavy bamboo about 40 cm long, closed at both ends with a node. Two bamboo strands about two inches apart are etched out of the body. Small wooden bridges near both ends lift the strings and give them tension. Beneath the strings, at midpoint, a small bamboo plate clipped to the strings covers a hole. The strings are struck with a bamboo stick. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2368\">Pinatubo Aeta</a> play a similar instrument called <b>tabengbeng </b>mainly to help pass the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Hanunuo <b>kudlong</b> or <b>tabungbung </b>is made from a closed internode of bamboo, with two strings etched out of the tube and raised by small bamboo frets. For better resonance the tube is split from one end and kept slightly open by a small bamboo sliver. Children play the kudlong by plucking one string at a time with a plectrum. The Hanunuo <b>batiwtiw </b>is similarly constructed as the kudlong but is closed only on one end. It has a single string etched out of the body and raised by a stick laid across the tube. When the stick is struck by a plectrum it produces a buzzing sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Palawan, the two-stringed <b>patigunggung </b>is played by men for entertainment. It is constructed like the Isneg <b>bamban</b>.<b> </b>The bamboo piece covering the middle hole, <b>lubu</b>,<b> </b>is called <b>letep</b>.<b> </b>The frets under the strings, <b>kwerdas</b>,<b> </b>are called <b>basikal</b>.<b> </b>The performer sits on the floor with legs outstretched. One end of the patigunggung rests against his stomach leaning slightly toward his left hand, which holds the tube. The right-hand fingers pluck the strings. In Lanao del Sur, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> <b>serong aganding </b>is played solo or together with the <b>kutyapi </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lute</a>), <b>insi</b> (ring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>), or <b>kubing </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>). Like the other parallel-stringed zithers, the serong aganding has two strings. The performer sits, grasping the tube with three or four of his left-hand fingers while the thumb plucks one of the strings. The right palm raises and drops the cover on the middle hole, dampening and varying the sounds caused by the plucked strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Subanon <b>thambabok </b>is used to send messages of love during courtship, though more often it is used for self-entertainment and relaxation. When accompanying dances, it imitates the rhythmic patterns played on the <b>gagung </b>(bossed gong). Using one hand, the player strikes the strings with light, bouncing strokes. The other hand opens and closes the upper node, which is cut open, varying the sound quality of the vibrating strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> play their <b>takumbo </b>to scare off insects in the corn fields. It is played while dancing&mdash;the left and right foot alternately match the rhythms struck on the bamboo strings by one hand, as the other hand busily opens and closes the cut upper node of the tube. Other zithers are the <b>katimbok </b>(Manobo, Tagakaolo) and <b>tabobo </b>(Manobo). The Ifugao have the <b>tadcheng</b>,<b> tedcheng</b>,<b> gacheng</b>, which has two to four strings etched from the bamboo half-tube body. Depending on the style of playing, the strings may be plucked or struck with small bamboo sticks, often simulating gong rhythms. It is played by boys and men for entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No longer played today in Ifugao, but preserved in museums, are the single-stringed half-tube zither, split-single-stringed tube zither, and heterochord strip-board zither. A variation of the half-tube zither is the board zither, whose body is made of a wooden board, also called tadcheng by the Ifugao. Four metal strings&mdash;three melody, one drone&mdash;are used in the Ibaloy <b>kaltsang</b>,<b> </b>which is played exclusively by women.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong>Corazon C.

Two bamboo strands about two inches apart are etched out of the body. Small wooden bridges near both ends lift the strings and give them tension. Beneath the strings, at midpoint, a small bamboo plate clipped to the strings covers a hole. The strings are struck with a bamboo stick.
