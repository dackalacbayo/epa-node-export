The landscape has greatly contributed to this variety of expressions in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2#occupationaldance\">occupational</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic</a> dances. Many of these dances reflect their locales&rsquo; environment and social milieu while some are linked to regional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> and poetic literatures articulated in the people&rsquo;s choreographic formulations. There are also some acknowledged influences from other Asian countries. On the other hand, the colonial experiences introduced Western choreographic expressions to the Philippines. Spain brought its own devotional, social, and theatrical dances and those of its European neighbors. When the Americans established themselves in the country at the turn of the century, they brought in more social and theatrical dances, especially in the popular genres with some from the Caribbean Islands. During both colonial periods, the indigenous peoples continued their own dances that reflected their beliefs and occupations. These expressions had particular ways of engaging with foreign influences and colonial realities. With the increased interest in indigenous cultures, more researchers started to explore the rich terrain of indigenous dances in the 20th century. After the country gained independence, postcolonial Philippines continued to witness the dynamic life of Philippine dance as more transformations occurred in the forms introduced during the colonial eras and as new ones emerged and enjoyed popularity in the country. The first fifteen years of the 21st century saw the vitality of Philippine dance as it interacted not just with sociopolitical, economic, and cultural forces, but also with the rapid changes in technology. The trajectory of Philippine dance has shown how this cultural expression has always and will always be a living form, with a strong pulse that creatively responds to the beat of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"indigenousTradition\" name=\"indigenousTradition\"></a>The Indigenous Tradition</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">Many of the ethnic tribes have been in the Philippines for many millennia. Their survival through years of colonial invasions has been due to their hardy industry, as witnessed by the rice terraces of the Cordilleras, or to their indomitable spirit, as exemplified by the desire for political independence of the Muslims in the south. Their spirit for survival has also been inspired and strengthened by animistic beliefs and shamanistic leadership. Close and familiar as the people were with their environment which to them possessed mysteries and potencies that had to be courted or propitiated, the people created rituals and incantations to the divine Bathala or Laon, to the </span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">diwata </span></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">or spirits of the mountains, rivers or trees, or to the </span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">anito </span></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">or spirits of ancestors who may either curse or bless their descendants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">In the north, the </span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">mambunong </span></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">or</span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\"> katalonan</span></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">and in the south, the </span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">balyan </span></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">or</span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\"> babaylan</span></em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">,</span> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">took on priestly duties offering rituals to assure a good harvest, to cure the sick or to ensure success in war. Many rites were meant to get in touch with the spiritual world that is related to the psychic resources and needs of the people&mdash;like the </span><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\">pagdiwata</strong> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">of Palawan which involves offerings during a festival to solicit a good harvest; the</span><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\"> lapal</strong> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> which is meant to communicate with the diwata of the forest; the </span><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/54\">dugso</a> </strong> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">among the Higaonon which is a thanksgiving ritual for a bountiful harvest, the birth of a male child or for victory in war; the </span><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\">ca&ntilde;ao</strong> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">in the Cordilleras during which a chicken, pig, or carabao may be sacrificed; and the </span><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\">sanghiyang </strong> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">of Alfonso, Cavite which is</span> <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400;\">the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dance</a> over fire.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geographic locations of the indigenous groups greatly influence the kind of work they engage in. With zestful spontaneity and resourcefulness, the ethnic Filipinos continue to express themselves directly, and with unrestrained humor and easy joyfulness in work or play. As a consequence, many tasks are turned into dances of communal fun. The rice culture is replete with dances of seeding, planting, harvesting, threshing, winnowing, and pounding. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a> of the north mime the same process with a bamboo pole as prop and add an enacted lullaby. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> of the south also imitate rice or corn planting. Fetching water among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> maidens becomes a stylized display of skill in balancing pots on their heads, a singular feat for a people living in the varied terrain of the mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those close to the sea enact fishing&mdash;with a net in <strong>pasigin</strong> in Aklan, and in <strong>mangingisda,</strong> or with handheld fishtraps in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo sa bulig</strong></a>, the last two from Bocaue, Bulacan; with a spear in <strong>agpanikop</strong> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, and in <strong>tawti</strong> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>; and with bare hands in <strong>kin-naras</strong> in Ilocos. To signal the shore to the fisherfolk at night, the <strong>oasioas</strong> is dexterous in flinging to and fro lighted glasses wrapped in large kerchiefs, which create a twinkling constellation of grace. There are many more occupational dances on cotton beating, spinning, weaving, basket making, pot making, and broom making. Gold panning is demonstrated in the <strong>pabirik</strong> from Bicol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For spiritual blessings, in defending themselves and their territories, for revenge or victory, the people created even more dances. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/92\"><strong>sagayan</strong></a>, elaborate headdresses, the kris (a Muslim sword), and a shield underscore the bravery of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>. If work or war is imaginatively turned into dance, the surrounding animal life also lends itself to imitative dances that are both graphic and symbolic. After all, men, women, animals, plants, and the surroundings are one in nature. A sense of playful communion is inherent in the Blaan dance imitating squirrels called <strong>kinugsik-kugsik.</strong> Other animals that inspire imitation are the fish among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> in <strong>tahing baila</strong>, the crab among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2340\">Capiznon</a> in <strong>inalimango</strong>, the snake among the people of Meycauayan, Bulacan in <strong>culebra,</strong> and the fireflies among the Batangue&ntilde;o in <strong>alitaptap</strong>. As the Philippines is a bird country, it has a great number of dances depicting birds, including poultry. The <strong>pabo</strong> is an imitation of the turkey, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/60\"><strong>itik-itik</strong></a> of the duck, the <strong>kalapati</strong> or <strong>sinalampati</strong> of doves, and, the most famous of them all, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a> of the&nbsp;<em>tikling&nbsp;</em>birds which farmers try to trap because they prey on the rice fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a number of hawk dances&mdash;the <strong>kinabua</strong> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, the <strong>man-manaok</strong> among the Manobo, the <strong>banog-banog</strong> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>, and the <strong>binaylan</strong> among the Higaonon. Dancers of the Kalinga courtship dance <strong>salip</strong> or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontoc</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/86\"><strong>pinanyowan</strong></a> look like swooping birds of the highlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among certain groups, dance could also dramatize popular narratives. To the Maranao, for instance, a choreographed elaboration on the epic <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></em></strong> has the hero Bantugan pursuing a princess, Gandingan, during a supposed earthquake. Today, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a> reenacts this scene in a climactic crescendo of clashing crisscrossed bamboo poles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous dances have been affected by the changing times. The performances of many of these dances are mostly of theatrical nature especially in urban centers and no longer integrated into the daily lives of the indigenous folk. Continued practice of and interest in indigenous dance traditions need to be encouraged through research and performance of these gestural treasures to deepen the understanding of Filipino identity and ingenuity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a id=\"hispanictraditions\" name=\"hispanictraditions\"></a><strong>Hispanic Traditions and Transformations</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the coming of the Spaniards and the spread of Christianity, the people transferred the object of their worship to the saints, though they did not completely abandon their native impulse and style. Animistic rituals were injected with Catholic doctrine, symbols, and saints while movement traditions were given new musical accompaniment in church songs and recited verses. With many occasions to celebrate, like the feasts of the local patron saints, of the Virgin Mary, and Christ&rsquo;s birth, death, and resurrection, Christianity turned native to a certain extent and became a vehicle for the Filipino way of spiritual and communal expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folkloric expression adheres in the dance veneration of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores in the <strong>turumba</strong> of Pakil, Laguna; in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo</strong></a> or fertility dance for the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salambao, Santa Clara and San Pascual in Obando, Bulacan; in the worship of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in the <strong>sinulog</strong> in Bohol and Cebu; in the rhythmic movements of the <strong>ati-ati</strong> in Aklan and Cuyo; and in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>subli</strong></a> for the Santa Cruz in Batangas. Indigenous practices are the roots of these religious celebrations whose devotion have shifted to Christian personages, objects, and beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign influences from countries other than Spain found their way to Philippine soil through the heightened socioeconomic and cultural exchange encouraged by the Acapulco-Manila galleon trade. Supposedly from Mexico is the dance called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/82\"><strong>pastores de belen</strong></a> which is about the visit of the shepherds to Jesus&rsquo;&nbsp;stable in Bethlehem. As it survives in Bicol and Cebu, the pastores is very secular in color and gaiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> enacting the encounter between the sorrowful Mater Dolorosa and the Risen Christ on Easter morning, the child-angel lowered from a scaffold lifts the veil of sorrow from the image of the Virgin Mary. In the dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>bati</strong></a>, which means &ldquo;greeting,&rdquo; the resurrection of Christ is welcomed by individuals who wave flags, dance, and create music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performed to honor town patron saints like Santiago Matamoros, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a> is a dance that depicts the fight between Christians and Moors. Similarly, the <strong>palo-palo</strong> of Ivana, Batanes is danced with cane sticks; and the <strong>maglalatik</strong> with coconut shells (<em>latik&nbsp;</em>or condensed coconut milk) of Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna enact the same theme. Today these dances display the men&rsquo;s agility, a contest between two camps costumed in different colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Spanish government imposed itself on the people and the latter were proselytized into Christianity, the European way of life filtered down into the people&rsquo;s social and economic activities. There was an empowerment of the Filipino elite. Social dances of the West found performance platforms in the grand celebrations hosted by wealthy families replacing indigenous practices. In social functions, the French quadrille called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon de honor</strong></a> (or its subsequent American equivalent, <strong>virginia</strong>) highlighted balls in ordinary towns and cities, as well as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an Palace</a>. These secular events completed the feast days, celebrated the trips of the galleons across the Pacific or welcomed a new governor general or bishop. Another social dance performed during weddings is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> where plates are set for gifts of money. This dance was adopted by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a> of Cagayan and Isabela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other dances popular during the Spanish period were European dances like the <strong>minuet</strong>, locally known as <strong>minueto</strong>; the <strong>cachucha</strong>, locally called <strong>katsutsa</strong>; <strong>fandango</strong>, popularly called <strong>pandanggo</strong>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota</strong></a>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka</strong></a>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/72\"><strong>mazurka</strong></a>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\"><strong>valse</strong></a>, known as <strong>balse</strong>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/55\"><strong>schottische</strong></a>, locally called <strong>escotis</strong>; and even the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/83\"><strong>zapateado</strong></a>, locally called <strong>pateado</strong>. All of these underwent regional transformation in the colony, evident in the variations of the jota from northern Cagayan to the southern provinces. As they became localized, these dances gained regional characteristics, adapting bamboo, coconut, or shell castanets, scented handkerchiefs, and&nbsp;<em>paypay&nbsp;</em>(native fans). Musical accompaniment was also indigenized through a variety of native instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dances about love, courtship, and marriage abound in the islands. In these dances many devices used are really ploys&mdash;a blanket, a scarf, a handkerchief, a fan, a hat, and even a plate or a drinking glass. Traditionally, the female dancer is meant to be modest and undemonstrative; thus, these ploys help in the subterfuge. The male dancer is expected to be aggressive, resourceful, naughty even. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, kerchiefs are used for&nbsp;<em>alcamfor&nbsp;</em>(a scent) and in the <strong>sayaw sa pag-ibig</strong>. Fans are flirtation props in the <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong> and the <strong>putritos</strong>, as hats are in the <strong>pandanggo sa sambalilo</strong>. In Bohol, a boy offers a saucer in the <strong>pingan-pingan pino</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Zambales <strong>sinambali</strong> and the Bicol <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/79\"><strong>pantomina</strong></a>, coins are showered on a wedding couple. There is even a dance between a male and a female, spurned by their respective beloveds, who luckily find each other in the <strong>timawa</strong> from Capiz or among the guerilla fighters in the <strong>voluntario</strong> from Iloilo. A classic wedding dance is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera botole&ntilde;a</strong></a> from Zambales, an elegant transformation of a dance from Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lowland <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a> continued to be performed until the American period but were slowly threatened by the spread of American culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<h2><a id=\"americantraditions\" name=\"americantraditions\"></a><strong>American Traditions and Transformations</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12 Jun 1898, the Filipinos declared independence from Spain but by December of that same year, Spain had sold the islands to the United States of America, which set out to crush the Philippine Republic in order to establish itself as the new colonizer of the Philippines. Inevitably, the American cultural infusions came in. Most pervasive was the use of English as medium of instruction in schools. It was first dispensed by visiting Americans and later by Filipinos sent to the US as&nbsp;<em>pensionados&nbsp;</em>(scholars).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A most popular entertainment was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/46\"><strong>vaudeville</strong></a> brought to the country in the 1930s and 1940s by foreign artists who taught the Filipinos different kinds of dances such as the <strong>fox-trot</strong>,<strong> cakewalk</strong>,<strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/104\">tap dance</a></strong>, and the <strong>charleston</strong>. Eventually, Filipinos took center stage, replaced the imported performers, and in time, vaudeville combined foreign and local talents, themes, and tastes. It was thus localized and called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>. This kind of mix resulted in creating local counterparts of American originals, such as the dancing pair <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a><strong> </strong> and Nieves Manuel, the &ldquo;Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of the Philippines.&rdquo; During World War II, the formulaic bodabil format dominated movie houses which were prohibited from showing American movies. This time, it included a drama and dance at the end and became known as the stage show. The visiting groups brought in by the Japanese performed at Manila&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>. At the end of World War II, the country&rsquo;s stage and television shows were influenced by the popularity of Broadway and Hollywood performer Gene Kelly who danced tap, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\"><strong>jazz</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>ballet</strong></a> in his films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The social dances from America, like the fox-trot, cakewalk, <strong>ragtime</strong>, <strong>slow drag</strong> and <strong>tango</strong>, raged on and went into clubs and cabarets with the prominent in society. Meanwhile, the earlier balse, pandanggo, <strong>polka</strong>, and <strong>mazurka</strong> from the Spanish period continued in rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local ballet took ground with visits of foreign troupes, like the Russian Baroufski Ballet Circus with ladies in pink tights in 1902, or the visit of Anna Pavlova in 1922 that inspired <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2503\">Anita Kane</a>, whose migrant father worked in the Paracale mines in Camarines Norte. Kane is credited with choreographing the first full-length ballet <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/164\"><strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></a></em></strong> to original music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a> in 1939. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2384\">Luva Adameit</a>, a Polish-Russian, came in 1927 and stayed in the Philippines all her life. From her came the country&rsquo;s first prominent dancers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2449\">Remedios de Oteyza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2479\">Inday Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2467\">Joji Felix-Velarde</a>. They became choreographers, with Orosa-Goquingco merging native themes and dances with ballet technique and aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong>Free dance</strong>,&rdquo; which referred to any departure from ballet&rsquo;s classicism and later named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>modern dance</strong></a>, was already seen with Ada Delroy in the vaudeville circuit. While there were other exponents, the most significant was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\">Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</a> who ran three seasons at the Manila Metropolitan Theater with her Manila Ballet Moderne from 1939 to 1940. She drew in both folk and ballet dancers to realize her range in repertoire. During the war and postwar years, she left an indelible influence on many, including those who later moved to the academe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even as these new forms of dance were being introduced from the West, indigenous and folk dances continued to be performed in the hinterlands and the rural areas. Various indigenous groups from north to south kept on with their own ritual, occupational, and imitative dances that addressed and reflected their daily lives and animistic beliefs. In Christianized areas, there prevailed dances linked to religious devotions, like the pandanggo in Bulacan, turumba (tripping-like) in Pakil, the <strong>bati</strong> (greeting) in Antipolo, the <strong>sinulog</strong> (like water-surge) in Cebu, <strong>ati-atihan</strong> (imitating the native <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aetas</a>) in Aklan, and the varieties of the <strong>pastores</strong> (shepherds) in Bicol and in other Philippine islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Tolentino</a> (later Aquino) was determined to save Filipino folk dances from the incursions of the Americans and the Jazz Age. Encouraged by the project of recovering Filipino art works by University of the Philippines (UP) president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5123\">Jorge Bocobo</a>, she went out to the field with musician <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a> and her husband-photographer Ramon Tolentino to find and record the indigenous and folk dances of the Filipinos. The multifarious and far-reaching results of her efforts include: the formation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2615\">UP Folk Song and Dance Club</a> in 1937 for the dissemination of knowledge on and performances of folk dances; the publication of her research findings in the Philippines and in the United States before and after World War II; and the encouragement of further regional researches that followed in her wake. Her influence was pervasive in physical education and dance research, the latter institutionalized through the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society</a> in 1945. Ultimately, Philippine dances won local adherents among public school teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a id=\"philippinedancethird\" name=\"philippinedancethird\"></a><strong>Philippine Dance During the Third Republic (1946-72)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine dance reflected the nation&rsquo;s neocolonial condition and realities following World War II and after gaining independence from the United States. During this period, Americanization permeated education and media. Fulbright scholarships facilitated the immersion of Filipino scholars to artistic trends in the West resulting in Filipino dancers training abroad through scholarships. The rise of mass media facilitated the entry of colonial cultural imports in the country. In theater, transitions were apparent as dance shifted from theatrical stage to the media platform. Broadway musicals, popular in the late 1950s to 1970s, were made into films and shown in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even as American cultural influences flooded the country once more, Philippine dance sought to accommodate or appropriate these foreign forms and harness them for the expression of Filipino themes. Thus the Filipinization of various cultural imports prevailed during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, major global events such as the start of the Cold War and the Cultural Revolution in China affected the sociopolitical events in the country. In the late 1960s, there was a rise in student activism and widespread demonstrations against imperialism and corruption in government. Dance in this period was utilized to promote ideological goals for mass movement. As a result, revolutionary-themed plays, skits, and musicals were featured in street rallies and protests which highlighted the tumultuous history of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With global mobility due to advancements in transportation, various foreign performers introduced ballet immediately after World War II to the 1960s, and mentored local dancers who later shaped the form to suit the Philippine cultural mold. With the establishment of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">ballet schools</a> in the capital and also in the regions, ballet performances were transformed and developed to express native dance themes and styles. Anita Kane was influential with her Filipinist ballet such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/170\"><strong>Mutya ng Dagat</strong></a></em></strong> (Muse of the Sea), <strong><em>Inulan sa Pista</em></strong> (Rained-out Feast), and <strong><em>Aswang</em></strong>. Two of Orosa-Goquingco&rsquo;s known productions incorporating indigenous themes were <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/173\"><strong>Noli Dance Suite</strong></a></em></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/142\"><strong><em>Filipinescas: Philippine Life, Legend&nbsp;and Lore in Dance</em></strong></a>. From the late 1960s to the 1970s, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2486\">Hariraya Dance Company</a>, under the direction of Remedios de Oteyza and Inday Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa mounted <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/161\"><strong>Legend of Sarimanok</strong></a></em></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/148\"><strong><em>Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong></a> (Adarna Bird) while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2444\">Dance Theater Philippines (DTP)</a> produced <strong><em>Katakataka Sin Rajah Indarapatra</em></strong> (Stories of Rajah Indarapatra), <strong><em>Babae at Lalake</em></strong> (Woman and Man), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/206\"><strong>Zagalas de Manila</strong></a></em></strong> (Young Maidens of Manila), <strong><em>Kalingan</em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/194\"><strong>Tanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Elopement).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the performances of foreign companies in Manila and the proliferation of local ballet instructors, choreographers established ballet schools such as the School of Classic Dance of Anita Kane and the Classic Ballet Academy of de Oteyza which both opened in 1947. In the 1950s, the Manila Ballet Academy was considered the biggest among all the dance schools in the Philippines. The Hariraya Dance Company of Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa was established in 1968, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2439\">Vella Damian</a>&rsquo;s School of Ballet and Dance Arts, in 1969. In other parts of the country, Carmen Dakudao Locsin opened her Locsin Dance Workshop in Davao in 1947 and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2584\">Fe Sala-Villarica</a> established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2427\">Cebu Ballet Center</a> in 1951.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, modern dance flourished through the initiative of foreign choreographers and local adherents who incorporated indigenous expression into the modern dance style. Spanish modern dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2576\">Manolo Rosado</a>&rsquo;s choreographed pieces based on folk traditions and history were <strong><em>The Debutant, The Fisherman and the Mermaid</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ultimo Adios</em></strong> (Last Farewell). Rosalia Merino (later Santos) had Filipino subject matter in her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/174\"><em><strong>Of Cocks and Kings</strong></em></a>,<em><strong> Ugaling Pilipino</strong></em> (Filipino Attitudes), and <strong><em>Sari Manok</em></strong>. But it was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;establishment of her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company</a> and its performance of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><strong>Amada</strong></a></em></strong>, 1970, that further strengthened the foothold of modern dance in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, inaugurated in 1969, served as an important venue for staging ballet, modern dance, and other cultural shows. Other cultural establishments during the period include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2931\">FEU Auditorium</a>, the University of the Philippines (UP) Theater, Mapua Auditorium, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a>, Rizal Theater, Philam Life Auditorium, Meralco Theater, Folk Arts Theater, and the Manila Film Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the entry and popularity of foreign dances, there persisted a threat to Philippine folk dances, despite their continued relevance in local communities. Folk dancer and researcher Francisca Reyes (now Aquino), who led the documentation of Philippine folk dances since the 1930s, expanded her scope of work, coming out with local and international publications like <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dance Steps for All Occasions</em></strong>, <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances and Songs</em></strong>, and the six-volume <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dance</em></strong>, from 1945 to the 1970s. She established the Filipiniana Folk Dance Society in 1949 and was a key figure in setting up the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society</a>. Due to her contributions in enriching Philippine folk dance, Aquino received the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1963 and was named first National Artist in dance in 1973. Furthering Aquino&rsquo;s aim to preserve folk dances, national and regional researchers also documented, performed, and popularized folk dances in different parts of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine folk dance achieved its renaissance in the 1950s when various folk dance troupes were recognized in the international stage. In 1958, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> successfully represented the country at the Brussels Universal Exposition. Their achievement was soon followed by other local dance troupes such as the Far Eastern University (FEU) Folk Dance Troupe, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2514\">Leyte Filipiniana Dance Troupe</a>, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a>, and many other local dance troupes. There were also several university-based folk dance troupes established between the 1940s and 1970s: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2615\">University of the Philippines Folk Song and Dance Club/Troupe</a>, the Philippine Normal College&rsquo;s (PNC) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a>, the Leyte State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2514\">Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</a>, the Mindanao State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2445\">Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2611\">University of Santo Tomas&rsquo;&nbsp;Salinggawi Dance Troupe</a>. The popularity of folk dancing was such that they were featured and incorporated into local films. Later, folk dances were performed in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants which signaled its future commercialization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While rural folks continued to revel in native dances, urban dwellers widely accepted popular American dance trends as part of the vibrant social life during the neocolonial period. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\"><strong>Social dances</strong></a> during this period followed the American dance trends and were usually performed in&nbsp;<em>kabaret&nbsp;</em>(dance halls), grand balls at hotels, and gatherings at social clubs. Filipinos were infatuated with the <strong>mambo</strong>,<strong> samba</strong>, and <strong>cha-cha</strong>, as well as <strong>camel walk</strong>, <strong>aqua velva</strong>, <strong>shiminy</strong>, and <strong>esalato</strong> in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s, the popularization of <strong>rhumba</strong>, <strong>tango</strong>, <strong>swing</strong>, and <strong>limborock</strong> led to the proliferation of ballroom dancing schools which were mostly found in Quiapo. Television became a major conduit for these social dances from the 1960s to the 1970s. The cha-cha and <strong>boogie</strong> were popularized in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></a></em></strong> while <strong><em>Helen</em></strong> featured the latest dance craze with Helen Gamboa&rsquo;s signature song and dance &ldquo;Bang-Shang-A-Lang.&rdquo; <strong><em>Dance-O-Rama</em></strong> drew attention to a range of dance moves such as the <strong>chicken</strong>, <strong>mashed potatoes</strong>, <strong>the shovel</strong>, and <strong>watusi</strong>, while <strong><em>Dance Time with Chito</em></strong> featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2563\">Al Quinn</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2421\">Lito Calzado</a>, and Chito Feliciano further intensified the dance craze. Later trends like the <strong>twist</strong>, <strong>boogaloo</strong>, <strong>bossa nova</strong>, <strong>frug</strong>, <strong>pachanga</strong>, and <strong>hustle</strong> found their way to more TV dance shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the time the Philippines was granted independence to the impending declaration of Martial Law, Philippine dance remained transformative. While it continued to be influenced by Western dance practices, it also sought its own independence and identity. Thus, the Philippine dance scene reflected the paradoxes of the country&rsquo;s neocolonial experiences which were characterized by the constant interplay of sociocultural forces: localization and internationalization, preservation and adaptation, importation and exportation, and transformation and conservation of the nation&rsquo;s cultural identity. All these continuously shaped Philippine dance in the succeeding years as the country underwent drastic political and economic upheavals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a id=\"philippinedancefourth\" name=\"philippinedancefourth\"></a><strong>Philippine Dance During the Fourth Republic (1972-86)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1935 Philippine Constitution prohibited a third presidential term but President Ferdinand E. Marcos sought to perpetuate himself in power. The most expedient measure for the continuation of his rule was to declare martial law. The Marcos administration justified the call for a state of emergency because of the widespread violent youth protests, the communist threat, as well as the growing armed secessionist movement among organized Muslim Filipinos. Thus, on 21 Sep 1972, Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 placing the whole country under a state of martial law. Press and broadcast media were shut down. Critics and opponents of the government were imprisoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then First Lady Imelda Marcos took the lead in using art and culture to propagate the tenets of the Bagong Lipunan or New Society under the authoritarian regime. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> became the nerve center of national and international activities in art and culture while the Folk Arts Theater was built in 1974 as a venue for more popular presentations for the masses. Another project with such a goal was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> which was restored in 1978. The regime built an art hub outside the National Capital Region called the National Arts Center atop Mt Makiling. This was the site of the Philippine High School for the Arts, built in 1977, which offered academic dance courses to high school scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Western classical dance forms such as ballet and modern dance flourished under martial law. State support became concentrated on select dance companies. In ballet, the main beneficiary was the Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company, subsequently called the CCP Dance Company and renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a> in 1981. Ballet classics comprised the main offering of CCP as typified by &ldquo;Aurora&rsquo;s Wedding&rdquo; (Act 3 from the <strong><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></strong>) restaged in 1976 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2422\">Gener Caringal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2544\">Effie Na&ntilde;as</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2462\">Tony Fabella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2524\">Lydia Gaston</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>, and Marius Petipa; and the Filipino adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><strong><em>Nutcracker</em></strong></a>, 1978, created by Alfred Rodrigues, Effie Na&ntilde;as, Gener Caringal, Armin Wild, and Alice Reyes. Other dance companies such as Dance Theater Philippines and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2486\">Hariraya Ballet Company</a>, which no longer enjoyed CCP&rsquo;s support, pursued their artistic goals by performing at <strong><em>Ballet at the Park</em></strong> and <strong><em>Puerta Real Evenings</em></strong> in Luneta and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, respectively. Whether supported by the administration or not, artists of ballet and modern dance produced a bountiful harvest of original works drawing inspiration from indigenous culture, Philippine literature, and history. Examples of works during this period are Eddie Elejar&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/155\"><strong>Kapinangan</strong></a></em></strong>, 1972; Gener Caringal&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><strong>Ang Sultan</strong></a></em></strong> (The Sultan), 1973; Lydia Gaston&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/113\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> Bulan</em></strong></a> (Moon Child), 1976; Alice Reyes&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>Rajah Sulayman</em></strong>, 1975 and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/193\"><strong>Tales of the Manuvu</strong></a></em></strong>, 1977; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Cora I&ntilde;igo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous and folk dances continued to thrive among Christianized lowland groups as among ethnic groups all over the country. Folk dance groups that stylized elements from these indigenous and folk dances prospered in this period because folkloric and stylized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> of indigenous dances like the <strong>singkil</strong>, maglalatik, and the <strong>tinikling</strong> were popular, because they were exotic. The most prominent dance company under martial law was the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company whose international fame was already undisputed even in the late 1950s. The glamour of Bayanihan performances were effective in promoting the government&rsquo;s policies and programs. A relatively new dance company, the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group, also enjoyed state support because it had its own niche as being more &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; and anthropological in choreography and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">production design</a>. Meanwhile, tourism as a major program of the regime gave rise to the construction of new venues of folkloric dancing in plush hotels and international convention sites. Tourism promotion in the provinces also initiated the commercialization of <strong>street dancing</strong>, the classic example of which is the hybridization of the Ati-Atihan into a parade fashioned after the Mardi Gras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside Manila, dance and cultural research flourished, even in places where there were continued military operations such as Southern Philippines. One significant development in dance was the undertaking of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a><strong> </strong> who pioneered in the documentation of the dances and related artistic expressions of the Sulu Archipelago. These dances were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong>/<strong>pansak</strong>/<strong>igal</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/68\"><strong>langka</strong></a> or martial style, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/69\"><strong>lunsay</strong></a> or song-dance. Up north, the militant struggles of the Cordillera peoples against big government projects such as the Chico River Dam and the Cellophil Resources Corporation led to a strong opposition against the Marcos dictatorship under the Cordillera Peoples&rsquo; Alliance. The Cordillera peoples expressed their sentiments through their indigenous dances that upheld their socio-economic-cultural rights and affirmed their struggle for self-determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social dances were propagated through entertainment TV, which was important to show normalcy under a state of military rule. TV dance shows rose in popularity with programs like <strong><em>Discorama</em></strong> and <strong><em>Penthouse</em></strong>. Movie stars like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> and Alma Moreno danced in their own variety programs. Disco music and dancing became a craze with the rise of Original Pilipino Music (OPM). Local dance movies starred Vilma Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4691\">Maricel Soriano</a>. The numerous disco night clubs, such as the iconic Coco Banana, were the watering holes of the disco-dancing crowd. In the early 1980s, Michael Jackson won the hearts of Filipino fans with his signature moves that accompanied his hit songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The economic prosperity in the early years of martial law, which was due to large borrowing and spending, eventually resulted in a huge deficit in the balance of payments. The economic woes of the country were aggravated by the international oil crisis. The situation of the lower classes worsened as unemployment rose, thus forcing many Filipinos to work abroad. Among these were the entertainers who were either singers or cultural dancers. Thus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/50\"><strong>cultural dancing</strong></a>, which consisted of a repertory based on folk and pop dances, became a means of upward social mobility. Training schools in cultural dancing proliferated, the main purpose of which was to train amateurs as overseas cultural dancers, with Japan as the most popular destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance in theater under martial law included Broadway musicals and the restaging of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> at the Metropolitan Theater. Conchita Sunico, the Met&rsquo;s executive director produced <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\"><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></a></em></strong> (The Flirt) and <strong><em>Ang Palabas Bukas</em></strong> (The Show Tomorrow) in 1979; <strong><em>Cats</em></strong> in 1984; and <strong><em>Aristocrats</em></strong> in 1985. Dance, creative movement, and martial arts were utilized in the staging of historical plays, allegorical plays, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/56/497\">adaptations</a> of foreign plays with veiled opposition to martial law. This strategy was used by theater groups like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a> and its youth arm, the Metropolitan Teen Theater League. Examples of these theater productions were <strong><em>Ang Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</em></strong> (<em><strong>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</strong></em>), 1977; <strong><em>Sampung mga Daliri</em></strong> (Ten Fingers), 1978; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/606\"><strong><em>May-i, May-i</em></strong></a>, 1979; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/527\"><strong><em><strong>Canuplin</strong></em></strong></a>, 1980; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong>Pilipinas Circa 1907</strong></a></em></strong>, 1982; and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/626\"><strong><em>Nukleyar I</em></strong> and <strong><em>II</em></strong></a> (Nuclear I and II), 1982/1985. The progressive Christian Churches were instrumental in using dance in theater for emancipation, such as Teatro Pangkatilingban (Community Theater) spearheaded by Fr Alan Abadesco in Negros and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3025\">Kolambugan Dance Theater</a> organized by Fr Dong Galenzoga in Lanao del Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major catalyst that united different sociopolitical forces opposing martial law was the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr in 1983. Enraged by the blatant murder of Senator Aquino, choreographers expressed their sociopolitical sentiments. Many groups used ballet and modern dance to create works that were openly anti-Marcos. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\">Basilio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/169\"><strong><strong>Misa</strong> Filipina</strong></a> </em></strong> (Filipino Mass), 1984, portrayed the death of Ninoy Aquino within the framework of the Roman Catholic mass. The 1928 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">kundiman</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo;</a> (My Country) was revived by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a> in the early 1980s and was interpreted by many dancers in all kinds of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">venues and spaces</a>. The groups <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3166\">Peryante</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4116\">Patatag</a> performed their <strong>kilos-awit</strong> or songs fused with creative movements and dance performed during street demonstrations. This form had been used by Tambisan sa Sining to organize workers since 1979. MAKIISA, the First National Theater and People&rsquo;s Festival on Theater and Culture, was convened in Dec 1983 in Manila, with workshops on the arts that included music, mime, and indigenous dances. Broad coalitions and alliances were instrumental in staging the rallies and demonstrations before the historic Feb 1986 uprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Marcos dictatorship ended with the 1986 EDSA Revolt. Martial law, which lasted 14 years in the history of the Philippines, was a significant period for the development of dance and other art forms. The era witnessed the development of state-sponsored aesthetics that raised the artistic level of ballet, modern dance, folk dance, and theater. It was an aesthetics that may be viewed as elitist by the anti-dictatorship forces. However, repression and militarization did not impede the development of an aesthetics of protest. In fact, the era gave rise to divergent forces which developed various artistic forms that expressed dissatisfaction with the existing sociopolitical and economic situation. Such discontentment led to the groundswell of protests which overthrew the Marcos dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a id=\"philippinedancefifth\" name=\"philippinedancefifth\"></a><strong>Philippine Dance During the Fifth Republic (1986 Onward)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance in the Philippines after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 took another turn as changes were felt in the sociopolitical and cultural spheres of the country. The political climate was one of inclusion, and this had an effect on the cultural life of the nation. Still reeling from the oppression of the martial law period, the Filipinos were hopeful that participatory democracy would reestablish a government respectful of human rights and freedoms. At the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), the new thrusts of Filipinization which emphasized original Filipino works, democratization which gave venue and productions <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/25\">grants</a> to dance companies, decentralization which encouraged participation of dance artists from the regions, promotion of artistic excellence, and reorientation of international exchanges translated into changes in the dance scene. Established in 1992, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a> aimed to provide more institutional support to the arts. Through its National Committee on Dance, dance practitioners, teachers, community-based performing groups, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a>, schools, arts councils and foundations, and even local government units, had the opportunity to apply for dance project grants enabling them to research on, create, perform, and compete in dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet scene felt a sense of reinvigoration with the regular season performances of CCP&rsquo;s two companies: Ballet Philippines (BP) which was generally identified with classical ballet as well as &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; modern pieces, and the newly-established resident company <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre (PBT)</a> with its classical ballet works complemented by a contemporary repertoire. Also within the confines of CCP and intensifying the choreographic impulse of the period was BP II, established in the 1990s under the direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a>. Soon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2523\">Lisa Macuja</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\">Ballet Manila (BM)</a>, was established as another strong company with its full-length classical ballets in the Russian tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These three major companies provided Filipinos with a range of productions to choose from. BP&rsquo;s veteran and young choreographers created a wide selection of pieces: <strong><em>Gabriela</em></strong> by Corazon I&ntilde;igo; <strong><em>Tambol at Padyak</em></strong> (Drum and Stomp) by Tony Fabella; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/198\"><strong><em>Icarus</em></strong></a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\">Enrico Labayen</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/176\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pakiusap</strong></strong>: A Mail Order Bride</em></strong></a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2494\">Kristin Jackson</a>; <strong><em>Swimming the Pasig River</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\">Alden Lugnasin</a>; <strong><em>Itak ni Andres</em></strong> (The Sword of Andres) by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2575\">Dwight Rodrigazo</a>; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/132\"><strong>Crisostomo Ibarra</strong></a></em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2541\">Paul Morales</a>; <strong><em>Rey-sing</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2386\">Carissa Adea</a>; <strong><em>Two of You</em></strong> by Ea Torrado; and <strong><em>You, Me, Us</em></strong> by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2626\">Ronelson Yadao</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from producing full-length ballets like Tom Pazik&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em></strong>, <strong><em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em></strong> and <strong><em>La Bayadere</em></strong>, PBT reworked earlier pieces such as David Campos-Cantero&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/130\"><strong><em>Carmina Burana</em></strong></a>. The company staged mixed-bill productions such as <strong><em><strong>Tribu</strong>te to Maestro Lucio San Pedro</em></strong>, <strong><em>Curtain Call</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Serenade and Other Ballets</em></strong>, and popular works including Gener Caringal&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pangarap na Bituin</em></strong> (A Dream Star), <strong><em>Bituing Walang Ningning</em></strong> (Star Without Sparkle), and <strong><em>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</em></strong> (May It Never End).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the full-length classical ballets in the Russian tradition staged by BM, the company also produced original works like <strong><em>Tatlong Kuwento ni <strong>Lola</strong> Basyang</em></strong> (Three Stories of Lola Basyang) based on the tales of enchantment of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> and <strong><em>Alamat: Si Sibol at si Gunaw</em></strong> (The Legend of Sibol and Gunaw) based on Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1551\">myths</a>, tales, and contemporary environmental issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also contributing to the vibrant scene of ballet were the many ballet schools during the post-martial law era. The Association of Ballet Academies, Philippines&rsquo; (ABAP) roster has around 30 members working together to strengthen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">ballet education</a> in the country. A number of its members and the three major ballet companies joined the CCP&rsquo;s annual <strong><em>Balletfest</em></strong> launched in 1987 to further stimulate ballet in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modern dance</strong> which was introduced to the Philippines in the late 1920s was continuously propelled particularly by Locsin whose works braided the vocabularies of indigenous movements and modern dance. Her works which Filipinized both ballet and modern dance became popularly known as &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; and was a strong presence in the dance scene in the 1980s. Some of her known works during this period were <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>Hinilawod</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong><em>Bagobo</em></strong></a>,<strong><em> Moslem</em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/121\"><strong>Babalyan</strong></a></em></strong>. Other dancers explored the incorporation of Philippine material and indigenous themes in their modern works: Gener Caringal in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><strong><em>Ang Sultan</em></strong></a> (The Sultan), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a> in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/144\"><strong>For the Gods</strong></a></em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\">Edna Vida</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/203\"><strong><em>Vision&nbsp;of Fire</em></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2490\">Eli Jacinto</a> in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/186\"><strong>Sa Panimula ng Buhay</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Beginning of Life).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foregrounding Philippine culture and national issues was Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <strong><em>Neo-Filipino</em></strong> series featuring Filipino-themed choreographies characterized by a range of dance vocabularies and techniques, including modern and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/7#contemporarydance\">contemporary dance</a>. From the 1990s onwards, the series saw a wealth of works from both seasoned and budding choreographers: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2581\">Hazel Sabas</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>Cry for Home</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2616\">Victor Ursabia</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pas Galawgaw</em></strong>, Rodrigazo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bread of Angels</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2537\">Brando Miranda</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Rhapsody</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2521\">Max Luna</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kati, Taog</em></strong>, Lugnasin&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ulaging (Daog-dog sa Sang Libong Kulog)</em></strong>, Gerardo Mercardo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Krus ng Alitagtag</em></strong> (The Cross of Alitagtag), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/5802\">Christine Crame</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sinotris Gentillorum</em></strong> (The Miraculous Virgin and Guardian of God the Father), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2447\">Judell de Guzman</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Juan at ang Bagong Adan</em></strong> (Juan and the New Adam), Novy Bereber&rsquo;s <strong><em>To Whom it May Concern</em></strong>, Edna Mae Labitoria&rsquo;s <strong><em>PG 13</em></strong>, and Eisa Jocson&rsquo;s <strong><em>I am not a robot, maybe a cyborg</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decade of the 1990s saw the emergence of a new breed of dance makers working outside major institutions, and with minimal state support. The efforts of carving out spaces for <strong>contemporary dance</strong> began among a small group of independent artists who were likewise key figures in the establishment in 2009 of the Contemporary Dance Network Philippines, which was later renamed Contemporary Dance Network Manila in 2011. Earlier works of contemporary dance include <strong><em>Truth.con Furia</em></strong> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\">Myra Beltran</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2442\">Dance Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2433\">Jay Cruz</a>&rsquo;s Dancing Wounded Contemporary Dance Commune, <strong><em>R-18</em></strong> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2389\">Airdance</a>, and <strong><em>Anatomy of Love and Desire</em></strong> curated by Donna Miranda. Several contemporary pieces also made use of Philippine rituals and epics as seen in <strong><em>Sulog sa Kinabuhi</em></strong> (Surge of Life) by Al Bernard Garcia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/172\"><strong><em>Nasalapu-an</em></strong></a> (Birthing) by Japheth Mari Cabling and Abigail Carlos, and pieces created by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2507\">Elena Laniog</a> and Sergio Gahol for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s play <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/585\"><strong><em><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong>: Ang Banog ng Sanlibutan</em></strong></a> (Labaw Donggon: Hawk of the Universe).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance of indigenous dances which was expected to diminish, let alone vanish, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, actually continued in different places of the country. Dance was still integral to the Kalinga&rsquo;s <strong>bodong</strong> (peace pact) rite, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/42\"><strong>bendiyan</strong></a>, and the Sulu archipelago&rsquo;s rituals to drive away spirits causing illness. Many locals and pilgrims praying for fertility and other blessings continued to dance in honor of Obando&rsquo;s patron saints and Pakil&rsquo;s patroness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But indigenous dances survived not only in their &ldquo;natural&rdquo; contexts as they were likewise integral to the nation&rsquo;s tourism, labor, and employment programs. <strong>Folk dances</strong> charmed tourists who were looking for quaint cultural performances within the cozy spaces of hotels and restaurants. Also part of the Local Government Unit&rsquo;s efforts to boost tourism during the post-EDSA period was the promotion of regional folk dance festivals such as the Panagbenga or the Flower Festival in Baguio, Dinagyang in Iloilo, Sinulog in Cebu, MassKara in Bacolod, Tinagba Festival in Iriga City, Kaamulan Festival in Bukidnon, and the Agal-Agal Festival in Tawi-Tawi. The Aliwan Fiesta, dubbed as the Mother of All Fiestas, began in 2003 and held every summer in the Star City Complex, Pasay City. It has brought together the best performing groups of some of the aforementioned festivals. Folk dance also went beyond national borders as Filipino cultural entertainers learned to perform indigenous dances before international audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further boosting interest in Philippine indigenous dances were the endeavors of the CCP to promote them by sustaining two regular dance festivals, the <strong><em>Pangalay: A Festival of Philippine Folk Dances</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Sari-Saring Sayaw, Sam</em></strong><strong><em>a-Samang Galaw: Mga Tradisyon at Interpretasyon</em></strong> (Different Dances, Unified Movements: Traditions and Interpretations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Academe was also a home to folk dance groups which represented their respective institutions. Some of the many groups still active today are the St Louis University Dance Troupe, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2612\">University of the East Dance Troupe</a>, the Sining Kalinangan Mapua Tech Dance Company, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2614\">UP Filipiniana Dance Company</a>, the University of Santo Tomas Salinggawi Dance Troupe, the Araullo University Dance Group, the Bulacan State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2420\">Lahing Kayumanggi Dance Troupe</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2506\">Lahing Batangan Dance Troupe</a> of the Lyceum of the Philippines University in Batangas, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2594\">Silliman University Kayahag Dance Troupe</a>, and the Palawan State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2596\">Sining Palawan Dance Troupe</a>. Not part of academe but persistently committed to promoting indigenous dances are groups such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2470\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino Memorial Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2394\">AlunAlun Dance Circle</a> cofounded by Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancing in television shows became ubiquitous during the post-EDSA era and this phenomenon intensified the interest in <strong>social dance</strong>. TV dancing was in full swing in the 1980s with talented groups dancing <strong>commercial pop</strong>, <strong>jazz</strong>, <strong>ballroom</strong>, <strong>funk</strong>, and <strong>broadway</strong> in shows such as <strong><em>Vilma!</em></strong> later retitled <strong><em>Vilma In Person</em></strong>; <strong><em>Superstar</em></strong>; <strong><em>Maria! Maria!</em></strong>, later retitled <strong><em>Maricel Live!</em></strong>; <strong><em>The Other Side of Alma</em></strong> and <strong><em>Loveliness</em></strong>; <strong><em>Manilyn Live!</em></strong>; <strong><em>Lotlot and Friends</em></strong>; <strong><em>Tonight with Dick and Carmi</em></strong>; <strong><em>POPS!</em></strong>; <strong><em>Vina</em></strong>; and <strong><em>The <strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong> Show</em></strong>. The <strong>Spanish hustle</strong>, <strong>salsa</strong>, <strong>LA walk</strong>, <strong>swing</strong>, <strong>the bop-bop girl</strong>, and <strong>cycling punk</strong> were also popularized in TV dance contests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after, record companies strategically deployed their own groups to promote their labels. In the 1990s, noontime shows like <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></em></strong> (Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!) thrilled the viewers by having sexy back-up dancers like the Sex Bomb girls in their daily contests. Ballroom dancing on TV then took another turn in the mid-1990s when Binibining Pilipinas-Universe Charlene Gonzales and 1993 Miss Universe Dayanara Torres dazzled their audience in <strong><em>Eezy Dancing</em></strong> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4975\">ABC 5</a>, which was later retitled <strong><em>Keep&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>on Dancing</em></strong> on <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN 2</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A higher level of ballroom dancing appeared in the form of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/51\"><strong>dancesport</strong></a> in the late 1990s, and easily gained a following among dance enthusiasts, both young and old. Lucy Torres-Gomez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Shall We Dance</em></strong>, which eventually became <strong><em>Celebrity Dance</em></strong>, contributed to the popularization of this dance form. Since the launching in the country of competitive style of ballroom dancing, regular competitions have been held throughout the year, not only in Manila, but also in the other regions of the Philippines. The Filipinos&rsquo; talent for this athletic dance has been witnessed by audiences of international dancesport showdowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular music, songs, and dances gained their respective audiences. Making waves and changing the landscape of dance in the Philippines during this time was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\"><strong>hip-hop</strong></a>, reaching the country via the music and movies on hip-hop culture in the United States. Soon, the dance form became popular via local television, movies, and music, with the strong presence of rapper Francis M and his crew, The Eclipse (b-boy crew) and Spindicate Posse (DJ crew) in the 1990s, and later, Mastaplann, Andrew E, and the Disco Mix Club (DMC) Philippines headed by former radio Dj Jessie Cambosa. Dance clubs and discotheques became usual spaces of encounters among hip-hop rappers and dancers, as were parking lots which served as face-off venues. In the 21st century, dance studios became a major breeding ground of hip-hop groups such as the Philippine All-Stars and the UP Street Dance Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning 2000s, there emerged a strong contender for viewership of basketball fans&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/48\"><strong>cheerdance</strong></a>. Introduced through the University Athletic Association of the Philippines&rsquo;&nbsp;cheerdance competition in the mid-1990s, the form has acquired a distinct and prestigious identity as excited spectators root for their respective dance groups: UP Pep Squad, UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe, NU Pep Squad, De La Salle University Animo Pep Squad, Ateneo Blue Babble Battalion, and the UE Red Squad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If television was crucial in the perpetuation of social dance and hip-hop, e-mail, cellular phones, social media, and other circuits of communication were behind the success of the <strong>dance flash mob</strong> in the 21st century. Referring to surprise dance performances by people mobilized by digital technology, this dance form has been used by the global campaign of One Billion Rising aimed to get together one billion people to put a stop to violence against girls and women. Begun in the Philippines in 2012, the campaign since then has rallied girls, women, men, and the LGBT (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgenders) to protest current national issues inextricably linked to women&rsquo;s concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although national support for dance in the past 30 years could hardly be a source of total optimism and dance practitioners could not be too sanguine about how this so-called ephemeral form has been perceived, dance in the Philippines proved its vitality as the period saw the emergence of performers and choreographers working independently, more daring choreographic works, impressive productions in festivals, intelligent use of dance to articulate various issues, and a distinct sensibility in responding to tourism, media, and technological leaps. Most of these outstanding works have earned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/25\">recognition</a> from institutions and award-giving bodies: the Philippine Legitimate Stage Artists Association&rsquo;s (Philstage) Gawad Buhay (Life Honor) and Natatanging Gawad Buhay (Honor for Life), the CCP&rsquo;s Gawad CCP Para sa Sining, the City of Manila&rsquo;s Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award, the NCCA&rsquo;s lifetime-achievement award Dangal ng Haraya (Honored Contribution), Gawad Alab ng Haraya (Brilliant Contribution Prize), and for a brief period the Pasasalamat ng Bayan sa Sayaw (National Gratitude in Dance), the Aliw Awards Foundation, Inc&rsquo;s Aliw Awards, and National Artist Award. The more congenial sociopolitical and cultural climate after martial law proved to be promising enough for the ingenious Filipino whose imaginative energy could not be denied or contained. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

				"value": "There is a dazzling diversity of dance in the Philippines because of the country&#x2019;s geography, history, and ethnicities. The landscape has greatly contributed to this variety of expressions in <a href=\"/7/55/469\">ritual</a>, <a href=\"/6/46/96\">social</a>, <a href=\"/6/45/2#occupationaldance\">occupational</a>, and <a href=\"/6/46/73\">mimetic</a> dances. Many of these dances reflect their locales&#x2019; environment and social milieu while some are linked to regional <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epic</a> and poetic literatures articulated in the people&#x2019;s choreographic formulations. There are also some acknowledged influences from other Asian countries. On the other hand, the colonial experiences introduced Western choreographic expressions to the Philippines. Spain brought its own devotional, social, and theatrical dances and those of its European neighbors. When the Americans established themselves in the country at the turn of the century, they brought in more social and theatrical dances, especially in the popular genres with some from the Caribbean Islands. During both colonial periods, the indigenous peoples continued their own dances that reflected their beliefs and occupations. These expressions had particular ways of engaging with foreign influences and colonial realities. With the increased interest in indigenous cultures, more researchers started to explore the rich terrain of indigenous dances in the 20th century. After the country gained independence, postcolonial Philippines continued to witness the dynamic life of Philippine dance as more transformations occurred in the forms introduced during the colonial eras and as new ones emerged and enjoyed popularity in the country. The first fifteen years of the 21st century saw the vitality of Philippine dance as it interacted not just with sociopolitical, economic, and cultural forces, but also with the rapid changes in technology. The trajectory of Philippine dance has shown how this cultural expression has always and will always be a living form, with a strong pulse that creatively responds to the beat of the nation."

These settlements came to be known as barangay, after <em>balangay</em>, the outrigger boats that the natives of Southeast Asia used to navigate the waters with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Native societies were governed by chieftains known as rajah or datu and were divided into three main classes: the ruling elite called&nbsp;<em>maginoo</em>, which owned property and slaves; their friends and followers called&nbsp;<em>timawa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>maharlika</em>, who were freemen and helped the datu in times of war; and their servants and slaves called&nbsp;<em>alipin&nbsp;</em>who were owned by the upper class (Brancia 2010, 22). Slaves were tasked with manual work, and some slave girls danced to entertain royal visitors (Scott 1994, 18). The stratification, however, was not absolute: a noble could be a slave, possibly by incurring debt, while a slave can purchase his freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most ancient barangay lived close to bodies of water as these were abundant with food sources. It was also practical for trading groups to live by the coastline as traveling by water used to be the main mode of transportation to the other islands. There were also some who chose the protection offered by the interior lands and highlands. These mountain dwellers lived on farming, pastoralism, hunting and gathering, and occasional bartering with lowlanders and islanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closely connecting the people to their surroundings were their animistic beliefs. To them the environment possessed mysteries and potencies that had to be courted or propitiated, so the people created <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> and incantations to the divine Bathala or Laon, to the&nbsp;<em>diwata&nbsp;</em>or spirits of the mountains, rivers or trees, or to the&nbsp;<em>anito&nbsp;</em>or spirits of ancestors who may either curse or bless their descendants. Communication with the spirits was presided over by the native shamans, who took on priestly duties offering rituals to assure a good harvest, to cure the sick or to ensure success in war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today there are over 100 ethnolinguistic groups scattered all over the Philippine islands, representing nearly 14 percent of the country&rsquo;s population (de Vera 2007, 2) who live in lands referred to as ancestral domains with a culture that still acknowledges the traditional structures of social, political, and economic relations. An important component of these ethnic cultures are the dances, which continue to perform important functions in the community&rsquo;s way of life. These include: the <strong>ritual dances</strong>, which connect the material world to the spiritual; the <strong>life-cycle dances</strong>, which celebrate an individual&rsquo;s birth, baptism, courtship, wedding, and demise; the <strong>occupational dances</strong>, which transform defense and livelihood activities to celebratory performances; the <strong>animal dances</strong> which mimic the movements of animals; and <strong>dances with narratives</strong> which are based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a> and stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"ritualdance\" name=\"ritualdance\"></a>Ritual Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rituals sustain the spiritual and social life of the indigenous Filipinos, who enact these rites&mdash;always with instrumental music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chanting</a>, and often dancing&mdash;as &ldquo;part of communal life cycles, but they also serve as a popular medium of dramatic expression and entertainment that reflects the people&rsquo;s nature, culture and aspirations&rdquo; (Amilbangsa 1983, 1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of these rites is the shaman called&nbsp;<em>baylan&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>babaylan&nbsp;</em>in the south and&nbsp;<em>mumbaki</em>,&nbsp;<em>mandadawak</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>manalisig&nbsp;</em>(a lesser mandadawak<em>)</em>,&nbsp;<em>mambunong&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>katalonan&nbsp;</em>in the north. The shaman speaks in a mysterious language &ldquo;intelligible&rdquo; to the gods, offers the sacrifices, and dances in a trance. The babaylan among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan are of&nbsp;<em>ginuu&nbsp;</em>(noble) standing, have an &ldquo;aura of magico-religious potential&rdquo; and are &ldquo;stable individuals who often have a deep understanding of how the society works and of psychological problems of individuals&rdquo; (Fox 1982, 209-10). It is not unusual that they cannot dance except in the <strong>pagdiwata</strong> ceremonies, done during the&nbsp;<em>bilug&nbsp;</em>(full moon). Around the shaman is the support of kin (like a help called&nbsp;<em>taga-iring</em>) who form a sodality. The position may be inherited or received by &ldquo;calling.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tagbanwa&rsquo;s pagdiwata is a ritual of thanksgiving for the rice harvest and for general well-being. The babaylan dances the characteristics of the spirits who enter them in a trance. Before an altar full of offerings (rice wine in jars, china bowls of rice, betel, ginger, onion, pepper, candles), dressed and armed with an&nbsp;<em>alindugan&nbsp;</em>(hood),&nbsp;<em>palaspas&nbsp;</em>(fronds), a kris or dagger, and accompanied by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> playing, the babaylan chants on a ceremonial swing, drinks, and dances. Lighting a cigarette may symbolize &ldquo;the fire of the supernaturals&rdquo; while floating a turtle on the wine may mean the visit of a sailor spirit who fights epidemics (Fox 1982, 224-25). Lasting from 8 to 12 hours, the pagdiwata invites not only the highest deity Magindusa but also other deities to join in the feast of drinking, eating, chewing of betel, and smoking, so that none might be slighted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bukidnon, there are the&nbsp;<em>hinaklaran&nbsp;</em>(offering) festival and the ritual of the three datu. In the first, there is chanting and dancing around an altar. The women dance the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/54\"><strong>dugso</strong></a> while a&nbsp;<em>baylan&nbsp;</em>ceremoniously chants her invocation. The ritual can go on for some six hours to assure the blessings of the spirits, a good harvest or good fortune. Also for everyone&rsquo;s well-being, the rite of the three Kaamulan datu enacts a regional unity where the datu offer chicken of various colors, pouring their blood beside offertory water and coins. In the past, the new datu Man Sicampo Man Langcayan of Tikala-an (formerly Pusod ha Dagat or Navel of the Sea) invited Kapetan Pedro Tayabong, datu of Lambagowon (now Cagayan de Oro), the sultan of Dodsaan, the sultan of Maguindanao, and the sultan of Tagolaan for a pact of friendship. They sealed this over a dug hole where they placed a Quran, a Bible, a durian fruit, and chicken, and over which they placed a&nbsp;<em>balagun&nbsp;</em>(rattan vine) which symbolized a would-be betrayer&rsquo;s fate. A feast of seven days followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up north, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> in the mountains of Abra worship their anito and their great god Kabunian. They are led by a medium called mandadawak or&nbsp;<em>alpogan</em>. Their&nbsp;<em>pinauban&nbsp;</em>ritual pours out blood over or ties strings around the&nbsp;<em>pinaeng</em>, stones of unusual shape found at the entrance of the village. The story goes that the spirit of Kabunian (or Apadel, Kalagang) once entered these pinaeng stones. Male participants may pray the&nbsp;<em>diam&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>dimdimi</em>, and make a pig cry for the gods to hear. The women dance around and sing the&nbsp;<em>salidumay</em>. All these are to ask for rain or pray for everyone&rsquo;s well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When life is threatened by illness, the Tinguian celebrate the <strong>bawi</strong>. In the&nbsp;<em>bawi-bawi</em>, a simulated house, is the center around which a mandadawak and his/her assistant make a pig cry, again for the spirits to hear. In the <strong>manerwap</strong>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a> bring baskets of chicks to the hills; their chirping supposedly helps attract the spirits. For a similar cause, the Apayao stage a <strong>dawak</strong>. The female mandadawak exchange verbal chants, take up large scarves and head axes, and sprinkle the sick with water. Squatting, the sick and their relatives are all covered with a ceremonial blanket. When the cure is done, everyone rises up to dance. Another Cordillera ritual dance is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>&nbsp;<em>tinungor</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> of Zambales stage the <strong>anituan</strong> to drive away the evil spirits that cause sickness. The patient or patients are covered with a red cloth and are surrounded by the shaman and the patient&rsquo;s relatives. They threaten the spirits to go away with their bows and arrows, spears and sticks. Should this fail, they resort to talking with the spirits and propitiating them with gifts and food. Effect is declared when the red cloth is pulled away, and everyone joins in a celebratory dance of shuffling walks, shaking, and skipping around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believing that they are descendants of the union of the sun and moon, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a> of Davao hold various rituals to court the favors of various environmental spirits. In their <strong>anito baylan</strong>, each of the female baylan holds a red scarf and a small&nbsp;<em>kalasag&nbsp;</em>(shield) with shell and bead attachments which are sounded with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a>. They shuffle around in curves and circles, moving forwards and backwards, spinning and shaking in a trance. The dance is full of agility and vigor, and is colorful with the Mandaya&rsquo;s dyed and patterned abaca clothes, elaborate headdresses, and red scarves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As profoundly religious a people are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, also of Davao. They believe in Pamulak Manobo who created the heaven and the earth, and molded the first man named Toglai and woman named Toglibon. Their daily life is ruled by rituals, among these the awesome four-day <strong>gin-um</strong> which of old included human sacrifice. Like the Mandaya, they are colorfully dressed in their tie-dyed&nbsp;<em>tinalak&nbsp;</em>(woven abaca) clothes and elaborate ornamentation, perhaps suggested by their god&rsquo;s passage over a rainbow to descend to Mount Apo to create Toglai and Toglibon. Their assiduous, if sometimes fearful, religiosity includes the healing ritual where the female baylan dolefully officiates before a tall altar with incense, and daubs with blood of the sacrificial chicken the body of the sick. They also flick a red cloth or scarf to help effect an appeal to the gods and give vigor to their patients. The patient himself finally joins in the dance, a cleansing exercise that finally restores his vitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a> of the northeast Cordillera are as colorful in their clothes and feasts, as they are fierce in their headhunts. A rite for everyone&rsquo;s well-being gathers on a mat a coconut which also simulates a decapitated head brought in by a victorious&nbsp;<em>mengal&nbsp;</em>or headhunter, coconut fronds and flowers, bamboo strips, pots, and chickens. The officiating shaman puts these things in order, and whips the ground and the chickens. The whole community starts dancing in pairs, and then all together. To the beat of gongs and other percussion instruments, they spread out their arms with their ubiquitous blankets, slightly turning left and right, lightly swooping around each other, keeping their feet busy with earthy shuffling steps, sometimes skipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing the spirits may include all sorts of procedures. In the Umayamnon babaylan dance, a man dresses up as a woman, inasmuch as most babaylan are women, but as man he retains his strength which pleases the gods. With scarves, the babaylan encircles a bush, the symbol of life, where most spirits reside, and utters incantations. This spiritual dimension of life suffuses the indigenous Filipinos&rsquo; celebrations so that shamanistic dances are found almost everywhere. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/47\"><strong>buklog</strong></a>, this becomes clearer when the community itself joins in the act of propitiation and celebration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up before sunrise, the men go out to the open field, away from diurnal duties, to raise a sacred building reaching for the clouds. It rises at sunup and is gone by sundown. There will be no trace left of its sturdy and supple strength, no remnant of its cabalistic ceremony&mdash;except in the memory of its celebrants. The best wood is chosen for strength, the best bamboo for pliancy, and the best food, rice wine, and incense for efficacy. A baylan chooses the sacred spot where the buklog is to rise; measuring three to four times an adult person&rsquo;s height, it towers out, alone, in the open. The baylan then leads the people and offers food and incense to the spirits. They and the people drink and dance in the manner of their epics and ancestors. To give thanks for a bountiful harvest, to deflect any illness or misfortune, the Subanon of Zamboanga hold hands, keep a common rhythm, and move as one body in a symbolic circle. The woven bamboo floor bounces up and down. The people keep in step around a central pole called&nbsp;<em>pathaw&nbsp;</em>(long pestle) that pounds against a log called&nbsp;<em>dulugan&nbsp;</em>(mortar) dug below, sometimes with resonating jars beneath to echo the rhythms of the buklog to the hills and plains. A totemistic support pole looks over the whole ceremony with godly detachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the Subanon, the buklog is an old, old rite, a communal celebration, a now subliminal sexual symbol, an offering to the gods, a spiritual experience. In the epic tale of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1940\"><strong>Sandayo</strong></a></em></strong>, the noble Subanon rose up to the clouds with their servants, who came down again and told of a heaven of gold and light. Their ceremonial buklog is most unique in the land in being held high up on a special yet temporal flooring that must be dismantled by sundown. In the buklog the communal participation is total, as everyone joins in a circular dance, a symbol of their unity as a people and of their union with the divine&nbsp;<em>diwata&nbsp;</em>(nature spirits).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through these rituals, life is asserted and reasserted&mdash;life that is more than the survival and health of the individual and the tribe but includes the balance and fruitfulness of nature. This life then makes possible the birth of more lives, renewing life&rsquo;s length, strength, and meaningfulness in the young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"lifecycledance\" name=\"lifecycledance\"></a>The Life Cycle Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The life of the young is devoutly and joyfully ushered in, nurtured, and promoted. A child&rsquo;s life is so guarded among the Tinguian. In their <strong>gabbok</strong>, one of the subtribes of the Tinguian ritually transfers the health of the elders to the child. A mandadawak examines a pig&rsquo;s bile and other inner parts for a good omen. These are rubbed and crowned on the baby for good health. Then taking up in turns a china bowl, an ax, and a chicken, she dances around with the manalisig. Still dancing and with a spear, she strikes a helpless pig on the ground and then snaps out of her trance. The Tinguian also have a lullaby dance called the <strong>idudo</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> mark the same rite. Known to be brave and beautiful, feared for the headhunts of the&nbsp;<em>minger&nbsp;</em>and admired as the &ldquo;peacocks of the mountain,&rdquo; the Kalinga keep a couple and their child under a blanket while a shaman chants over them, periodically wiping the couple and their baby. Someone steals the ritual blanket away so that the mandadawak may run after it, shake it, and restore it over the family. Finally, the child is walked around an altar, the shaman and others following with arms and implements that may project their bravery and industry in rice planting. For the couple&rsquo;s first male child, Kalinga maidens perform a dance called <strong>lumagen</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> of Davao and Cotabato are rich in ritual imagination. In their exchange of cradles called&nbsp;<em>aslolog aban</em>, held on a mat that is a common ritual object in the south as the blanket is in the north, the parents assure the marriage of their children earlier on. In their dramatic dance <strong>pandamgo</strong> (dream), a Matigsalug mother imitates the care of her small baby, from bathing to combing her hair. The baby grows up to be a child, a teenager, and finally a marriageable young lady. The mother continues prettifying her and teaching her the use of a slung&nbsp;<em>malong&nbsp;</em>(tubular skirt) which seems to symbolize mature responsibilities. Soon two men make their suits with favors represented by beautiful necklaces. The mother takes her choice which the young lady does not favor. There ensues a fight between the suitors, and the mother and daughter end up crying over the deaths of their favored ones. This dance builds up interest as girls in graduated ages playing the daughter come out from behind a screen of malong, while the musicians and dancers play the same rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if parents become overprotective sometimes, children nevertheless grow up with fun, usually playing all kinds of games. Such are the song-and-dance games of the Muslim youth. Early in life, they are already fastidious in taste, whether they live around the placid Lanao Lake or by the rough Sulu and Celebes Seas. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> girls pretend to be mothers themselves by singing and swaying to lullabies. Or they play with boys, as in&nbsp;<em>pokpok alimpapukok</em>, until a certain age when they must seek their separate games (the boys have their own games, like the&nbsp;<em>sungayan kabaw&nbsp;</em>or tug-of-war), or just be onlookers. The boys among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Badjao aka Sama Dilaut</a> discover graceful agility in the sea with their toy vintas. On reaching a particular age, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> boy&rsquo;s hair is cut in&nbsp;<em>paggunting</em>; the boys are ceremoniously made up and weighed in the&nbsp;<em>pagtimbang</em>&mdash;both for reasons of health. They graduate from Quran reading in the&nbsp;<em>pagtamat</em>. Here there are many rituals and gifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up north in the Cordilleras, the Ifugao boys may play with their flat tops or learn the dexterous rhythm of their music and dances, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/52\"><strong>dinuy-a</strong></a>. Their counterparts among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> and Kabanglasan in Mindanao learn the gliding <strong>inagong</strong> and hunting dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As distinct a rite of passage as these events are the occasions when girls and boys learn the different dances of their sex. A Matigsalug girl learns to play the boat-shaped <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lute</a> called&nbsp;<em>kudlong&nbsp;</em>while marking rhythm with her feet. Rhythmic skill is tested even more among the Tagakaolo in their&nbsp;<em>udol</em>, both a resonating log and a dance around it. Bukidnon, Tigwahanon, Matigsalug, and Higaonon girls join adults to learn a range of dances that simulate planting, wave parallel hands to bamboo guitars or&nbsp;<em>saluray</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>display pennant-like fronds or&nbsp;<em>lukay</em>, and imitate hawks as in the <strong>banog-banog</strong>. To the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> girls, <strong>mag-asik</strong> is to dance and a dance is so named. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> documented the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> mag-asik, meaning &ldquo;to sow,&rdquo; which is just what the Bukidnon girls imitate in their dugso, which also means &ldquo;to dance.&rdquo; To the elaborately adorned and bell-belted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, <strong>kadal</strong> means dance, but it may come in imitation of a bird (<em>blilah</em>), a monkey (<em>iwas</em>), and other animals. To the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>igal</strong></a> means rhythmic steps or dance. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> means the same, and it comes in different varieties. It is studied by girls and some boys early on for mastery. It is a very restrained but highly articulated form, with a style that has affinity to Balinese, even Thai, classical dance. It may be performed with extended nails or&nbsp;<em>janggay&nbsp;</em>and balanced on supported bamboo poles as in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay ha pattong</strong></a> (Amilbangsa 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most young men&rsquo;s dances enact a fierce fight or a martial art. The <strong>idaw</strong> is a hunting ritual from the Cordillera that is performed before tribal wars. According to Bontoc tradition, the capture of an Idaw bird is a good omen and may lead to victory. The dance portrays warriors in battle and uses spears and shields as props.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courtship is enacted by adventurous young men and attractive maidens whenever the Matigsalug play the saluray and&nbsp;<em>kuglong</em>/<em>haglong</em>/<em>faglong</em>, and sing and dance together. Among the Kalinga, the&nbsp;<em>gangsa&nbsp;</em>dominates the rhythm of the <strong>salip</strong> where a rooster-like male swoops around a maiden who as well spreads out her arms wide or keeps them on her hips. He may hold in hand a gift for her. There is also the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/93\"><strong>salidsid</strong></a>, a courtship or wedding dance from Tanudan, Southern Kalinga, performed by the bride and the groom to the syncopated beat of the gangsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar imitation of two mating fowls obtains in the <strong>manmanok</strong> of the Bago. They use blankets that are spread out with their hands or are kept around the hips. The men seem to scratch the ground, while the women keep shuffling steps close together and to the ground. Again, blankets enlarge the movements of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/103\"><strong>takik</strong></a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> with hands held up and flicking with percussive accents. The nearby <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a> of Nueva Vizcaya dance out a similar rooster-and-hen courtship in <strong>bumbuak</strong>, without the usual blankets but with active hands and shuffling, skipping steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even more gamesome is the Maguindanao chase-and-run through several&nbsp;<em>malong&nbsp;</em>(tubular cloth) held up by friends. Surprising is the dance of the lovers performed inside one such malong in which dancers strike symmetrical poses. The malong also serves as a whip against intruders in the danced liaison. Flirtatious but bolder are the <strong>salok</strong> or scooping hand gestures of the old, old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/79\"><strong>pantomina</strong></a> in Bicol, which is still danced by the much marginalized Abiyan. More sedate is the <strong>dalling-dalling</strong> of the Tausug (from the English word &ldquo;darling&rdquo;) also called <strong>pagsangbay</strong>. A dance that displays grace as much as affection, it is considered a courtship dance, especially when done in pairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Yakan, a young man has to dress up fastidiously to visit a girl. In the negotiation for marriage called&nbsp;<em>muatangan</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>the whole community is involved. The man is borne on the shoulders of his companions, bringing the dowries. On the final day, the man rides a horse and is shaded with an umbrella. The wedding itself called <strong>pagkawin</strong> is long and complex, with the bride and groom heavily made up. The groom offers food to his bride and puts a scarf of cloth on his seated bride&rsquo;s shoulders. Flirtatiously but demurely she rejects all these several times but finally accepts. In their sumptuous makeup and colorful headdresses and&nbsp;<em>sablay&nbsp;</em>(blouse), the couple finally dances in the schooled style of the <strong>pindulas</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pagkawin</strong> is also the name of the Sama Dilaut (Badjao) wedding which is celebrated on a boat, with maidens dancing by the bride&rsquo;s side as musicians play the&nbsp;<em>kulintangan</em>,&nbsp;<em>agong</em>, and the tambourine-looking&nbsp;<em>dambara</em>. As in the Yakan rite, a datu or imam officiates and covers the groom&rsquo;s hand and his own (with their thumbs &ldquo;kissing&rdquo;) with a ceremonial cloth. To finalize the relationship, they both hold the bride&rsquo;s head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <strong>kasal sa banig</strong>, the Bagobo go through the exchanges of food and chewing of betel by a stream. The couple is made to incline their heads and their hair is wound together. Similarly, the <strong>kawin</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> includes the exchange of food, plus the sacrifice of a pig on which the groom and bride ritually place their feet. In the end they both step over the pig. General festivity follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food is again exchanged in the Matigsalug&rsquo;s <strong>paasawauy</strong> where there is an exchange of gifts between the bridal parties. The groom&rsquo;s thigh is placed over the bride&rsquo;s while they are seated on a mat. The datu talks to the couple about marital obligations and finally makes them stand back to back with their heads together. Again marriage is negotiated on a mat among the Blaan. In their <strong>samsung</strong> the parents negotiate over the dowry, much coming from the groom&rsquo;s side (prized gongs, jewelry, implements, etc.). There is also an exchange of verbal chants and of&nbsp;<em>kampilan&nbsp;</em>called&nbsp;<em>falimac.&nbsp;</em>From the bride&rsquo;s side a&nbsp;<em>tinalak&nbsp;</em>cloth is given to the groom&rsquo;s parents to clarify that she had not been &ldquo;bought.&rdquo; Finally, the groom is urged to put a foot on his bride&rsquo;s shoulder, while the hesitant bride does the same, maybe with a provocative shove. Then they dance and everyone else follows. In their tinalak clothes, headscarves, and jewelry, the people dance to the&nbsp;<em>tangungo&nbsp;</em>gongs and the perpetual tinkle of women&rsquo;s belt-bells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A most interesting marital arrangement is made in the <strong>pig-agawan</strong> of the Talaandig. Here, three maidens attract the attention of one man (the group has more women than men), with their tall feathered combs, bead jewelry, and embroidered scarves. Dancing all along, the man plays the role of the prized and fickle one, teasing each maiden as his or not his choice. After the women have taken turns shoving each other, the man finally chooses by laying his kris on one of the women&rsquo;s scarves. Similarly, the <strong>karasaguyon</strong> of the fastidious Tboli of Cotabato also provokes the women to preen themselves up endlessly and fight over a man who makes a choice for his fifth wife. These women are preferably sisters and cousins of his first wife, and they may be as young as 10 or 11 years of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After performing their own courtship dance called <strong>talip</strong> where the man lures a woman with an attractive blanket to place on her shapely shoulders, the Ifugao celebrate the&nbsp;<em>intaneg&nbsp;</em>or wedding with the festival dance called <strong>dinuy-a</strong>. In the presence of a&nbsp;<em>mumbaki&nbsp;</em>(priest) drinking ceremonial wine, the bride is dressed with the&nbsp;<em>dong-dong&nbsp;</em>and the groom with the horned&nbsp;<em>kango&nbsp;</em>on their heads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most ethnic groups, mourning is communally observed with song and dance. The Tinguian will have three to four women representing their villages and relations to the dead conversing over the victim; in the part called <strong>sangsang-it</strong>, they sing over their dead. The Abiyan will dance around the grave in the <strong>lidong</strong>. Young and old will do the same in the <strong>say-ang</strong>. In the <strong>monghimong</strong>, the Ifugao men turn up in mass at the burial of a murdered tribe member, bouncing up and down in rhythm on one or two feet. Wearing white headdresses from betel-nut palm, crowned with red&nbsp;<em>dongla&nbsp;</em>leaves, some carry a spear or two in hand. The rest carry the death sticks called&nbsp;<em>bangibang&nbsp;</em>which they beat in strict syncopation. These used to be stained with their enemies&rsquo; blood, now only with carabao or chicken blood. Their dead, seated and addressed by the living, is fetched at noon so that when he acts in revenge it will also be as clear and bright. In the <strong>udol</strong> of the Tagakaolo, the women lure back their men from battle by dancing around and beating a musical log called&nbsp;<em>udol</em>. This log is pounded, as belts and anklets with bells are shaken for the spirits to hear. The smoke of&nbsp;<em>kamangyan&nbsp;</em>(incense) also leads the spirits to find their way back home. This call of the grieving women can last for days.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"occupationaldance\" name=\"occupationaldance\"></a>The Occupational Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Life in the ethnic communities is characterized by a variety of activities relating to livelihood or defense. These activities are joyfully celebrated in mime and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most common to the varied ethnic cultures of the Philippines is the transformation of the rice cycle into dance. The various stages of the planting cycle have been expressed through dance. The Isneg of the north mime the process of seeding, planting, harvesting, threshing, winnowing, and pounding, accompanying some movements with a bamboo pole as prop and adding an enacted lullaby. The Tiruray&rsquo;s <strong>mag-asik</strong> highlights the sowing of seeds while the <strong>katlob</strong> dance shows men courting ladies while harvesting crops. The Bagobo have a dance enacting rice and corn planting. The Blaan act out a whole sequence, from men choosing and clearing a field, to women bringing food, the men digging the ground with poles, the women sowing seeds from their baskets, and finally, harvesting to a more leisurely rhythm of the haglong and gongs. The same is done by the Bukidnon with their <strong>tudak</strong> (digging poles), seed and harvest baskets, and pestles for pounding&mdash;all to the accompaniment of the same musical instruments and an open-mouthed bamboo&nbsp;<em>kalatong</em>. The Talaandig of northern Mindanao also enact the same planting style in their <strong>tudak</strong>, while the Aeta of Zambales, in their own manner, dance out the planting of gabi in <strong>mangbutot</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being hunters, many tribal peoples create actions appropriate to the object of the hunt&mdash;a bird, a beehive, a frog, or fish. The&nbsp;<em>lakulak&nbsp;</em>(frogs) are the imaginary objects of the hunt in the Matigsalug <strong>panulo</strong>. A man dances this out with his bolo, while a woman attends with a basket to store his takings. Similarly, an Aeta of Pampanga, boy or man, dances out much of his life, like in the traditional <strong>talipi</strong>, or a situation where he is attacked by bees as in the <strong>pinapanilan</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fishing itself is very much around in this archipelago of islands and lakes. The Blaan dramatically mime and dance out the <strong>amti</strong> with fish traps, prepare a plant&rsquo;s poison to daze their catch, build a fire for their meal, and mark the rhythm with their bodies, even as they crawl or are up on their busy feet. Those close to the sea enact fishing&mdash;with a net in <strong>pasigin</strong> in Aklan, and in <strong>mangingisda</strong>, or with handheld fishtraps in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo sa bulig</strong></a>, the last two from Bocaue, Bulacan; with a spear in <strong>agpanikop</strong> among the Manobo, and in <strong>tawti</strong> among the Sama and Tausug; and with bare hands in <strong>kin-naras</strong> in Ilocos. To signal the shore to the fisherfolk at night, the dance <strong>oasioas</strong> is dexterous in flinging to and fro lighted glasses wrapped in large kerchiefs, which create a twinkling constellation of grace. There are many more occupational dances on cotton beating, spinning, weaving, basket making, pot making, broom making, and even gold panning as in the <strong>pabirik</strong> from Bicol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Danger and defeat can engulf a tribe&rsquo;s life and the tribesmen have to put up a fight. Again, these are not just valiantly met but creatively danced out. Dancing not only instructs the young in the methods of fighting but also gives courage before (and after) a battle and even relieves if not actually transforms grief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1663, Father Francisco Colin, a Jesuit priest and historian, described what could possibly be a performance of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2336\">Boholano</a> war dance from the Visayas:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>The dances of men and women are generally performed to the sound of bells which are made in their style like basins, large or small, of metal, and the sounds are brought out quickly and uninterruptedly. For the dance is warlike and passionate, but it has steps and measured changes, and interposed are some elevations that really enrapture and surprise. They generally hold in the hands a towel, or a spear and shield, and with one and the other, they make their gestures in time, which are full of meaning. At other times with the hands empty they make movements which correspond to the movements of the feet, now slow, now rapid. Now they attack and retire; now they incite; now they pacify; now they come close; now they go away: all the grace and elegance, so much, in fact, that at times they have not been judged unworthy to accompany and solemnize our Christian feasts (Colin 1906, vol 40).</p>\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>William Henry Scott wrote that about 30 warriors who joined Rajah Tupas danced to the rhythm of a gong after the blood compact with Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565 (Scott 2010, 109).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/108\"><strong>tumahik</strong></a> of the Yakan, which is performed during weddings, is done by adult males with round shields and spears pretending to attack imaginary opponents. Here the movements of the combatants&rsquo; feet are as frenetic as the beaten music. Among the Sama Dilaut (Badjao), Tausug, and Sama, the <strong>silat</strong>, also known as <strong>kuntao</strong> and <strong>lima</strong>, belongs to the general and martial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/68\"><strong>langka</strong></a>. The Sama Dilaut learn this out at sea or on a boat where they spend most of their lives. Among the Maranao, the youth is initiated into the&nbsp;<em>marinaw</em>, a precombat chant and ceremony, that leads into the full-fledged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/92\"><strong>sagayan</strong></a> dance which transforms him into a respectable young man. Like the sagayan, the Subanon <strong>soten</strong> supplicates the spirits to give strength and courage to a warrior who shakes a shield and palm leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people created even more dances for spiritual blessings, in defending themselves and their territories, for revenge or victory. The Cordillera region has the <strong>idaw</strong>, a ritual performed before a war while the Maguindanao also have their version of the sagayan, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">martial dance</a> with elaborate headdresses, the&nbsp;<em>kris&nbsp;</em>(sword), and a shield underscoring the bravery of the warriors. The war dances are ceremonial rituals performed in preparation for battle or as celebratory gestures of victory. These involve mock battles and stylized versions of skill exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <strong>kalasag</strong>, the Matigsalug enact a combat with shields and spears. The dance is full of hops, skips, and vibratory hand movements with a spear. With outspread arms their movements are birdlike. As alert if not more is the <strong>pangayaw</strong> of the Talaandig, full of extrovert runs and chases, falling on knees, and clashing of shields. Round and elongated shields are contrastingly used by opposing camps in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2342\">Cuyunon</a> <strong>sinulog</strong>. Found in the island of Cuyo and smaller surrounding islets in the Visayas, the Cuyunon paint their faces in this dance, but they carry no swords or spears. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/63\"><strong>mangayaw</strong></a>, the Ikalahan of Nueva Vizcaya and nearby provinces, subtly shift weights and simply go around carrying their small shields and spears or bolo. Former headhunters mainly against the brave <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot) of the region, they have a story of how a monkey joined the victors and their dance has since been called <strong>tayaw in tadaw</strong> (dance of the monkey). The Kalinga also go into headhunts in their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/63\"><strong>kayaw</strong></a>. They watch out for an&nbsp;<em>idaw&nbsp;</em>bird and consult a mumbaki or shaman. A good omen leads them into a mock-war dance. On the other hand, a victory calls for the crowning of the mingers (those returning with head-trophies) with feathered headdresses called&nbsp;<em>lawi</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"animaldance\" name=\"animaldance\"></a>Animal Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If work or war is imaginatively turned into dance, the surrounding animal life also easily lends itself to imitative dances that are both graphic and symbolic. After all, men, women, animals, plants, and the surroundings are one in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Philippines is a bird country, there are several dances imitating movements and habits of birds. The <strong>pabo</strong> is an imitation of the turkey, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/60\"><strong>itik-itik</strong></a> of the duck, the <strong>kalapati</strong> or <strong>sinalampati</strong> of doves, the <strong>tarektek</strong> of the woodpecker, and, the most famous of them all, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a> of the <em>tikling</em> birds which farmers try to trap because they prey on the ricefields. There are also a number of hawk dances&mdash;the <strong>kinabua</strong> among the Mandaya, the <strong>man-manaok</strong> among the Manobo, the <strong>banog-banog</strong> among the Blaan, and the <strong>binaylan</strong> among the Higaonon. Dancers of the Kalinga courtship dance <strong>salip</strong> or the Bontoc <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/86\"><strong>pinanyowan</strong></a> look like swooping birds of the highlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A favorite subject of a number of dances imitate monkeys. These dances are found among most Aeta groups in the Philippines. Those from Labo, Camarines Norte have an unusual dance called <strong>pandong</strong> mimicking a family of monkeys caught in a downpour and finding minimal shelter in a&nbsp;<em>pandong&nbsp;</em>or twigs with leaves. The Aeta from Botolan, Zambales also dance as if they were monkeys swinging from branches or scratching their bodies with lice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other animals whose movements have inspired Aeta dances are the centipede in the dance <strong>talek gayaman</strong>, monitor lizard in <strong>talek babarek</strong>, the fly in <strong>talek lango</strong>, and shrimps in <strong>talek paro</strong>. Squirrels mating or moving around or climbing up and down trees are imitated by the Manobo in <strong>kinugsik-kugsik</strong> and by the Bagobo in <strong>kulasog renek ka kayo</strong>. A sense of playful communion is inherent in the dances imitating the fish among the Yakan in <strong>tahing baila</strong>, the crab in <strong>inalimango</strong>, the snake in <strong>culebra</strong>, and the fireflies in <strong>alitaptap</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"dancewithnarratives\" name=\"dancewithnarratives\"></a>Dances with Narratives</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Among certain groups, dance could also dramatize popular narratives. To the Maranao, for instance, a choreographed elaboration on the epic <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></strong> has the hero Bantugan pursuing a princess, Gandingan, during a supposed earthquake. Today, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a> reenacts this scene in a climactic crescendo of two pairs of clashing crisscrossed bamboos. The <strong>sagayan</strong> dance shows the different phases of Bantugan&rsquo;s adventure: from preparing for the battle, to his adept skill in sword-fighting, until his glorious victory. In this dance, the men wear plumed hats and pants under multilayered skirts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bukidnon&rsquo;s <strong>pandamgo</strong> (dream/dreaming) is about a barren Matigsalug woman dreaming of having a daughter who, among the Bukidnon, is expected to bring in a substantial dowry to the family. The dance shows the close and delicate relationship between mother and daughter. The mother lovingly raises her daughter until she reaches adolescence when she is courted by two men, one of whom she favors. As the other man is favored by the mother, a duel ensues between the suitors who end up killing each other. Both mother and daughter mourn the death of their favored one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"traditionsandtransformations\" name=\"traditionsandtransformations\"></a>Traditions and Transformations</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rites and dances are still being performed because they serve the belief and social systems of the ethnic Filipinos. If life is deemed hard, these rites and dances give expression and solace to their needs, sometimes give them courage and determination. These rites and dances are revivified by action and movements, and by the motives and spirits that inspire or require them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art is a means of coping. In its basic function, art deals with the actualities and problems of existence. Making baskets, for instance, deals with the need to store seeds for eating and planting. Weaving cloth is for the purpose of providing a second protective skin. Making arms helps men to meet a challenge that has to be confronted. Yet baskets, clothes, and arms, when made by the tribes, have not remained crude but have, in fact, no matter how raw the materials, produced visual feasts that more than satisfy need. In like manner, being born, growing up, getting married, working and fighting to live, and dealing with grief have not only been coped with. They have been staged and are still staged in rites and dances that go beyond mere survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than just filling the external and internal (psychological and spiritual) needs, these rites and dances are in fact modes of celebration. They themselves are facts of life, and are more than just modes of symbolization. They are as real as baskets, clothes, and arms&mdash;artifacts that cannot be kept in museums or between book covers, not even in the two-dimensional films. They are of celebrations in their actual form and fun. They are a dimension of life itself, and life is incomplete, unintelligible, and unexciting without them. Indeed, celebration ties up all sorts of dances, which sometimes defy scholarly classification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rediscovery of ethnic materials in their pristine liveliness brings its own refreshing excitement to the modern eyes. Avid folk arts researchers find endless pleasure in unearthing forms and permutations in shapes, sounds, steps, and senses that reveal the prodigal imagination of the ethnic people. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">Costumes</a> for dance reflect the material culture, traditional knowledge and customs, local habits and social life styles of the different indigenous groups. The unique fashion of each tribe exhibits the artistry and craftsmanship encouraged by the community and its surrounding environment. The costumes feature unique <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">weaving</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, and other traditional methods of textile design. With their costumes and instruments, rites and dances also provide substance to present-day <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documentation</a> and presentation. The success of many folkdance troupes has for the most part rested not only on their fidelity but also on their creative approach to tribal crafts and customs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1930s, Francisca Reyes-Aquino, known as the mother of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a>, began her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">research</a> of traditional dances, songs, and games. She traveled to various towns and provinces to gather materials and knowledge of the dances and the elements of its performance, including context and costuming, from older members of tribes and villages. Included in her discoveries were dances by the different ethnic groups in the country. She and her team collected over a hundred dances and these were later published in books that served as manuals for the teaching of Philippine folk dances. Aquino&rsquo;s body of work contributed much to the preservation and promotion of indigenous culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous life continues to serve as inspiration for modern artistic expressions. The introduction of foreign dance genres in the country has provided platforms through which indigenous traditions are socialized to the public. Dance artists have turned to Filipino indigenous knowledge and practices in their assimilation and &ldquo;Filipinization&rdquo; of foreign dance forms. Dancer and choreographer National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a> stylized movement from Philippine ethnic dances and integrated these into concert dance productions in the 1960s including the full-evening <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/142\"><strong><em>Philippine Life, Legend&nbsp;and Lore in Dance</em></strong></a>.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>She and her dance troupe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2468\">Filipinescas</a>, earned a lot of raves for their efforts in finding intersections between foreign movement vocabulary and ethnic traditions. The wide repertoire of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> staged by National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2571\">Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</a> brim with ethnic materials from tribal folkways. Similarly, the unflagging research drive and assiduity of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a> have kept vibrant and vital his folkloric group&rsquo;s repertoire, classified into published and unpublished dances of the Philippines. Both the Bayanihan and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a> mount shows that present traditional Filipino dances in local performance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">spaces</a> and abroad. The performances of these dances promote a sense of national identity and help in building communities especially among Filipinos living outside of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a> uses the term &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; to suggest the transformation of indigenous rites and dances for the contemporary stage. Earlier works had already used ethnic inspiration, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Babae at Lalake</em></strong> (Woman and Man) and <strong><em>Kalingan</em></strong>, 1968; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>&rsquo;s Maguindanao-based <strong><em>Katakata sin Rajah Indarapatra</em></strong> (Stories of Rajah Indarapatra), 1968, later expanded in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/154\"><strong>Juru-Pakal</strong></a></em></strong> (The Enchanted Kris), 1971, and his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/155\"><strong>Kapinangan</strong></a></em></strong>, 1972; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Lam-ang</strong></em></strong>, 1974; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2422\">Gener Caringal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><strong><em>Ang Sultan</em></strong></a> (The Sultan), 1973, and <strong><em>Tomaneg at Aniway</em></strong> (Tomaneg and Aniway), 1975; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2511\">Felicitas Layag Radaic</a>&rsquo;s Igorot-based <strong><em>Nan-Pangkat</em></strong>, 1975; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2510\">Luis Layag</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>La Mora</em></strong>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\">Basilio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Morang Tarjata</em></strong>, 1974 (done in collaboration with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2393\">Reynaldo Alejandro</a> in New York) and <em><strong>M</strong></em><strong><em>osque Baroque</em></strong>, 1975; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2566\">Benjamin (Villanueva) Reyes</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>Alamat</em></strong> (Legend), 1976; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2573\">Ester Rimpos</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>Duo</em></strong>, 1977; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;<strong><em>At a Maranaw Gathering</em></strong>, 1970, <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/137\"><strong>Dugso</strong></a></strong></em></strong>, 1972, <strong><em>Rajah Sulayman</em></strong>, 1975, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/193\"><strong><em>Tales of the Manuvu</em></strong></a>, 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorporating indigenous materials in choreographic works continued in the 1980s and 1990s. This was done in Borromeo&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Bamboo</strong> Fantasy Philippine Revue</em></strong>, 1986; Alice Reyes&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/182\"><strong><em>Rama, Hari</em></strong></a> (Rama, King), 1980; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2432\">Eric Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ca&ntilde;ao</em></strong>, 1980; Layag&rsquo;s <strong><em>Labaw Dunggon</em></strong>, 1985; Basilio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Paglalang</em></strong> (Creation), 1983, <strong><em>Sa Baybayon</em></strong> (By the Seashore), 1986, the dance drama <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/115\"><strong><em>Ang Babaylan</em></strong></a> (The Shaman), 1988, with director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3516\">Edward Defensor</a>, and <strong><em>Oriental Fantasy</em></strong>, 1990. Like Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2490\">Eli Jacinto</a> has used his experience in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\">modern dance</a> with a folk dance group in his own contemporized Filipino dances. Locsin also intensified her neo-ethnic creative procedure in her innovative, and sometimes controversial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong><em>Igorot</em></strong></a>, 1987, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong><em>Bagobo</em></strong></a> and <strong><em>Muslim</em></strong>, both in 1990; <strong><em>Hinilawod</em></strong>,&nbsp;1<em>9</em>91, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress), 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young choreographers have also created contemporary dance works integrating indigenous rituals. Al Bernard Garcia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sulog sa Kinabuhi</em></strong> (Surge of Life), 2011, is based on the buklog ritual while Japheth Mari Cabling and Abigail Carlos&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/172\"><strong><em>Nasalapu-an</em></strong></a> (Birthing), 2013, was inspired by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/44\"><strong>binanog</strong></a> (hawk dance) and birth ritual of the Panay Bukidnon tribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, living abroad has inevitably drawn Filipino choreographers back to their ethnic roots. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2429\">Joy Coronel</a>&rsquo;s long stay in New York drew her to ethnic forms and themes in <strong><em>Salip</em></strong>, <strong><em>Yakan</em></strong>, <strong><em>Muslim</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kulintangan</em></strong>, in the same manner that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2494\">Kristin Jackson</a> dealt with a Kalinga ritual in <strong><em>Kolias</em></strong>, 1984. Even before she left for the United States, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a> staged <strong><em>Arem</em></strong>, 1975, in Manila, transformed into <strong><em>Ifugaos</em></strong> in New York. Later, she did her trancelike <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/144\"><strong><em>For the Gods</em></strong></a>, 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are Filipinos living and running their creative folkloric troupes in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Folkloric groups abroad assert and project Filipino identity in a transformational manner. In the Philippines, folk troupes continue to dig into the indigenous folkways and, significantly since the 1970s, have focused on their regional and provincial grounds and resources. Despite some thoughtless and uncreative transformations, these contemporary researchers, choreographers, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a> recreate and even revitalize indigenous materials for the modern and urban <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">audiences</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Slaves were tasked with manual work, and some slave girls danced to entertain royal visitors (Scott 1994, 18). The stratification, however, was not absolute: a noble could be a slave, possibly by incurring debt, while a slave can purchase his freedom."

These mountain dwellers lived on farming, pastoralism, hunting and gathering, and occasional bartering with lowlanders and islanders."

An important component of these ethnic cultures are the dances, which continue to perform important functions in the community&#x2019;s way of life. These include: the <strong>ritual dances</strong>, which connect the material world to the spiritual; the <strong>life-cycle dances</strong>, which celebrate an individual&#x2019;s birth, baptism, courtship, wedding, and demise; the <strong>occupational dances</strong>, which transform defense and livelihood activities to celebratory performances; the <strong>animal dances</strong> which mimic the movements of animals; and <strong>dances with narratives</strong> which are based on <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epics</a> and stories."

Lighting a cigarette may symbolize &#x201C;the fire of the supernaturals&#x201D; while floating a turtle on the wine may mean the visit of a sailor spirit who fights epidemics (Fox 1982, 224-25). Lasting from 8 to 12 hours, the pagdiwata invites not only the highest deity Magindusa but also other deities to join in the feast of drinking, eating, chewing of betel, and smoking, so that none might be slighted."

The ritual can go on for some six hours to assure the blessings of the spirits, a good harvest or good fortune. Also for everyone&#x2019;s well-being, the rite of the three Kaamulan datu enacts a regional unity where the datu offer chicken of various colors, pouring their blood beside offertory water and coins. In the past, the new datu Man Sicampo Man Langcayan of Tikala-an (formerly Pusod ha Dagat or Navel of the Sea) invited Kapetan Pedro Tayabong, datu of Lambagowon (now Cagayan de Oro), the sultan of Dodsaan, the sultan of Maguindanao, and the sultan of Tagolaan for a pact of friendship. They sealed this over a dug hole where they placed a Quran, a Bible, a durian fruit, and chicken, and over which they placed a&#xA0;<em>balagun&#xA0;</em>(rattan vine) which symbolized a would-be betrayer&#x2019;s fate.

Their&#xA0;<em>pinauban&#xA0;</em>ritual pours out blood over or ties strings around the&#xA0;<em>pinaeng</em>, stones of unusual shape found at the entrance of the village. The story goes that the spirit of Kabunian (or Apadel, Kalagang) once entered these pinaeng stones. Male participants may pray the&#xA0;<em>diam&#xA0;</em>or&#xA0;<em>dimdimi</em>, and make a pig cry for the gods to hear. The women dance around and sing the&#xA0;<em>salidumay</em>.

For a similar cause, the Apayao stage a <strong>dawak</strong>. The female mandadawak exchange verbal chants, take up large scarves and head axes, and sprinkle the sick with water. Squatting, the sick and their relatives are all covered with a ceremonial blanket. When the cure is done, everyone rises up to dance.

Like the Mandaya, they are colorfully dressed in their tie-dyed&#xA0;<em>tinalak&#xA0;</em>(woven abaca) clothes and elaborate ornamentation, perhaps suggested by their god&#x2019;s passage over a rainbow to descend to Mount Apo to create Toglai and Toglibon. Their assiduous, if sometimes fearful, religiosity includes the healing ritual where the female baylan dolefully officiates before a tall altar with incense, and daubs with blood of the sacrificial chicken the body of the sick. They also flick a red cloth or scarf to help effect an appeal to the gods and give vigor to their patients.

The officiating shaman puts these things in order, and whips the ground and the chickens. The whole community starts dancing in pairs, and then all together. To the beat of gongs and other percussion instruments, they spread out their arms with their ubiquitous blankets, slightly turning left and right, lightly swooping around each other, keeping their feet busy with earthy shuffling steps, sometimes skipping."

In the Umayamnon babaylan dance, a man dresses up as a woman, inasmuch as most babaylan are women, but as man he retains his strength which pleases the gods. With scarves, the babaylan encircles a bush, the symbol of life, where most spirits reside, and utters incantations. This spiritual dimension of life suffuses the indigenous Filipinos&#x2019; celebrations so that shamanistic dances are found almost everywhere. In the <a href=\"/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> <a href=\"/6/46/47\"><strong>buklog</strong></a>, this becomes clearer when the community itself joins in the act of propitiation and celebration."

There will be no trace left of its sturdy and supple strength, no remnant of its cabalistic ceremony&#x2014;except in the memory of its celebrants. The best wood is chosen for strength, the best bamboo for pliancy, and the best food, rice wine, and incense for efficacy. A baylan chooses the sacred spot where the buklog is to rise; measuring three to four times an adult person&#x2019;s height, it towers out, alone, in the open. The baylan then leads the people and offers food and incense to the spirits. They and the people drink and dance in the manner of their epics and ancestors. To give thanks for a bountiful harvest, to deflect any illness or misfortune, the Subanon of Zamboanga hold hands, keep a common rhythm, and move as one body in a symbolic circle. The woven bamboo floor bounces up and down. The people keep in step around a central pole called&#xA0;<em>pathaw&#xA0;</em>(long pestle) that pounds against a log called&#xA0;<em>dulugan&#xA0;</em>(mortar) dug below, sometimes with resonating jars beneath to echo the rhythms of the buklog to the hills and plains. A totemistic support pole looks over the whole ceremony with godly detachment."

In the epic tale of <strong><em><a href=\"/9/78/1940\"><strong>Sandayo</strong></a></em></strong>, the noble Subanon rose up to the clouds with their servants, who came down again and told of a heaven of gold and light. Their ceremonial buklog is most unique in the land in being held high up on a special yet temporal flooring that must be dismantled by sundown. In the buklog the communal participation is total, as everyone joins in a circular dance, a symbol of their unity as a people and of their union with the divine&#xA0;<em>diwata&#xA0;</em>(nature spirits)."

A mandadawak examines a pig&#x2019;s bile and other inner parts for a good omen. These are rubbed and crowned on the baby for good health. Then taking up in turns a china bowl, an ax, and a chicken, she dances around with the manalisig. Still dancing and with a spear, she strikes a helpless pig on the ground and then snaps out of her trance. The Tinguian also have a lullaby dance called the <strong>idudo</strong>."

Someone steals the ritual blanket away so that the mandadawak may run after it, shake it, and restore it over the family. Finally, the child is walked around an altar, the shaman and others following with arms and implements that may project their bravery and industry in rice planting.

In their dramatic dance <strong>pandamgo</strong> (dream), a Matigsalug mother imitates the care of her small baby, from bathing to combing her hair. The baby grows up to be a child, a teenager, and finally a marriageable young lady. The mother continues prettifying her and teaching her the use of a slung&#xA0;<em>malong&#xA0;</em>(tubular skirt) which seems to symbolize mature responsibilities. Soon two men make their suits with favors represented by beautiful necklaces. The mother takes her choice which the young lady does not favor. There ensues a fight between the suitors, and the mother and daughter end up crying over the deaths of their favored ones.

Or they play with boys, as in&#xA0;<em>pokpok alimpapukok</em>, until a certain age when they must seek their separate games (the boys have their own games, like the&#xA0;<em>sungayan kabaw&#xA0;</em>or tug-of-war), or just be onlookers.

Rhythmic skill is tested even more among the Tagakaolo in their&#xA0;<em>udol</em>, both a resonating log and a dance around it.

To the <a href=\"/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> girls, <strong>mag-asik</strong> is to dance and a dance is so named. <a href=\"/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> documented the <a href=\"/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> mag-asik, meaning &#x201C;to sow,&#x201D; which is just what the Bukidnon girls imitate in their dugso, which also means &#x201C;to dance.&#x201D; To the elaborately adorned and bell-belted <a href=\"/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, <strong>kadal</strong> means dance, but it may come in imitation of a bird (<em>blilah</em>), a monkey (<em>iwas</em>), and other animals.

The <a href=\"/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> means the same, and it comes in different varieties. It is studied by girls and some boys early on for mastery. It is a very restrained but highly articulated form, with a style that has affinity to Balinese, even Thai, classical dance. It may be performed with extended nails or&#xA0;<em>janggay&#xA0;</em>and balanced on supported bamboo poles as in the <a href=\"/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay ha pattong</strong></a> (Amilbangsa 1983)."

For more than three hundred years, Spain ruled the islands, first from Mexico for 250 years and later directly from Spain. This regime altered the social, political, economic, and cultural spheres of life in the Philippine islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain governed the Philippines through the governor-general and the Royal Audiencia (supreme justice), the army and navy, and the administrative departments. The governor-general was usually a&nbsp;<em>peninsular</em>, a Spaniard born in Spain, to ensure loyalty to the crown. On the provincial level,&nbsp;<em>alcaldes mayores&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>corregidores&nbsp;</em>served as governors as well as tax collectors of provinces and unpacified military zones. The alcalde mayor was usually an&nbsp;<em>insular&nbsp;</em>or a Spaniard born in the Philippines. Cities and provinces were divided into towns or pueblos that were headed by&nbsp;<em>gobernadorcillos</em>. Any wealthy native or Chinese mestizo could become a gobernadorcillo. Members of the precolonial&nbsp;<em>maharlika&nbsp;</em>and the new elite became known as the&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>during the Spanish regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The remodeling of Filipino society also came in the form of a colonial economy that was a far cry from the subsistence economy the early Filipinos were used to. Initially, the Spanish institutionalized the&nbsp;<em>encomienda</em>, &ldquo;a system where large tracts of land were granted by the king to well-connected individuals&rdquo; (Rice 2009, 262). As decreed by King Phillip II, lands were assigned to loyal Spanish subjects called&nbsp;<em>encomenderos</em>, who collected taxes and took charge of their areas to facilitate the conquest and control of the native population. Filipino natives were relocated from the barangay ruled by the village chieftain called datu into the encomiendas. Throughout the regime, native Filipinos paid taxes and males were drafted for labor, communal public work, postal clerkship, and military conscription. The indigenous notion of communal ownership was replaced by private landholding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish rule was highly theocratic. The State worked in sync with the Roman Catholic Church and Spanish Catholic missionaries helped in the propagation of Catholicism which was the official religion of the colony under the protection of the King. In the same vein, they were crucial in the promotion and acculturation of the natives in the Castilian way of life. The religious&mdash;Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Recollects, and Jesuits&mdash;taught the natives how to read and write the Roman alphabet and restructured indigenous beliefs and practices. They offered programs in primary, secondary, and tertiary education as well as vocational schools that imparted lessons on agriculture and industrial techniques. Formal schooling, however, was initially limited to the&nbsp;<em>insulares</em>, and the Spanish tongue set them apart from the&nbsp;<em>indios&nbsp;</em>or Christianized natives. In 1610, Filipino writer and publisher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5598\">Thomas Pinpin</a> lobbied for Filipinos to learn Spanish and in the late 19th century, schools accommodated the sons of wealthy Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Acapulco-Manila galleon trade from 1565 to 1815 greatly encouraged interactions between Mexico/Spain and the Philippines. Apart from economic trade, there was also cultural exchange in the arts. Foreign dance influences were witnessed by Filipinos with the arrival of European troupes. These travelling groups greatly popularized European dances and plays. Direct relations with Spain and other countries were further facilitated by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This new route cut the travel time to Spain in half and paved the way for greater influx of ideas and cultural forms from the West. The Suez Canal also encouraged the empowered Filipino upper class to study in Europe. Upon their return, these&nbsp;<em>ilustrados&nbsp;</em>(enlightened) allowed for the European way of life to filter down into the people&rsquo;s social and economic activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But native Filipinos did not simply assimilate Hispanic culture; they shaped the elements of culture to synchronize with their existing beliefs and ways of life. To facilitate evangelization, missionaries banked on the parallel elements of pre-Hispanic animistic practices and Roman Catholicism. At the same time, native belief in the afterlife, the reverence for the&nbsp;<em>anito&nbsp;</em>(ancestral spirits), the use of amulets and mysterious objects in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> assimilated Catholic codes that conformed with the indigenous culture of the people. Christianity almost inevitably lapsed into animistic tradition and resulted in the indigenization of orthodox Catholicism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"functionofdance\" name=\"functionofdance\"></a>The Functions of Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon their arrival, the Spanish colonizers found a people whose level of civilization was already well defined. The ancient Filipinos had their own system of writing, a government based on the barangay, and a wealth of myths and legends. They had a tradition of songs and poems and had woven music and dance into the day-to-day tapestry of their lives. They danced to celebrate love, marriage, birth, thanksgiving, victory in war; they danced to prepare for battles and to mourn their dead. In 1521, Pigafetta related that while he was a guest at the house of the Cebu chief&rsquo;s son-in-law and heir, four beautiful young women entertained him by dancing and making &ldquo;harmonious sweet sounds from brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 167-171). In 1663, Fr Francisco Colin wrote that during banquets there was always singing of songs like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><em>cundiman</em></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><em>comintan</em></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><em>balitao</em></a>, the&nbsp;<em>saloma</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>talindao</em>, some of which were only sung, while others (possibly the first three) were danced as well. Colin noted (Blair and Robertson XL, 67):</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>The dances of the men and women are generally performed to the sound of bells which are made in their style like basins, large or small, of metal, and the sounds are brought out quickly and uninterruptedly. The dance may be war-like or passionate, but it has steps and measured changes, and interposed with some elevations that really enrapture and surprise.</p>\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Early Spanish chroniclers described Philippine native dances using words that translated to &ldquo;frisky, unruly, unchaste&rdquo; (Mojares 2013, 49).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizing the importance of these dances, the church sought to harness them for the propagation of the new faith. In this, the friars showed much wisdom, focusing special attention on the education of the young. In 1609 Morga observed:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>At the same time that the religious undertook to teach the natives the precepts of religion, they labored to instruct them in matters of their own improvements, and established schools for the reading and writing of Spanish among the boys. They taught them to serve in church, to sing the plainsong, and to the accompaniment of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/820\">organ</a>; to play the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>, to dance, and to sing. There are many dances and musicians on the other instruments which solemnize and adorn the feast of the most holy sacrament, and many other feasts during the year. (Blair and Robertson XVI, 152).</p>\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Dances in the Spanish colonial rule served as a means of worship and socialization. Religious communication found expression and allies in dance and music. There were dances, too, that allowed people to get acquainted with each other. They became effective and entertaining means through which Hispanic ideas and values were communicated throughout the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the spread of Christianity, the people transferred the object of their worship to the saints, though they did not completely abandon their native impulse and practices. Religious syncretism developed on a massive scale. With many occasions to celebrate, like the feasts of the local patron saints, of the Virgin Mary, and Christ&rsquo;s birth, death and resurrection, Christianity became a vehicle for Filipino spiritual and communal expression. Even secular dances would have Christian elements as can be seen in folkloric expressions in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>subli</strong></a> which is performed to honor the Holy Cross of Bauan, Batangas; the dance veneration of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores in the <strong>turumba</strong> of Pakil, Laguna; the dance worship of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in the <strong>sinulog</strong> in Bohol and Cebu; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo</strong></a> or fertility dance for the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salambao, Santa Clara, and San Pascual in Obando, Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subli is a performance ritual commemorating the origin of the Holy Cross, locally referred to as Mahal na Poong Santa Cruz. The large wooden cross was discovered in the early decades of Spanish rule in Alitagtag, a part of Bauan, Batangas. Dance steps of the subli include simple footwork such as walking with small steps on the balls of the feet with the heels off the ground (similar to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>&nbsp;<em>bourree</em>), and the flicking of fingers and wrists referred to as <strong>pagtatalik</strong>. Distinctive rhythm played on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a> provides the musical background for the movements along with the singing of eight devotional prayers by the female dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>turumba</strong> of Pakil, Laguna is performed in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. According to tradition, the turumba festival originated in 1788 upon the discovery of a painted image of the Virgin Mary along the shoreline of Laguna de Bay. The townsfolk tried to carry the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> to a nearby church but they were not able to move it until the parish priest and churchgoers made a vow to make an annual pilgrimage to the site. The people danced and sung praises while the sacristans carried the painting to the church. The Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores de Turumba is believed to perform miracles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The turumba includes sections in which performers fall to the ground and distort the shape of their bodies while following the procession. French Paul P. de la Gironiere described a performance of the turumba between 1830 and 1840 as a procession participated in by sick people hoping for a miracle:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>Some religious festivals especially those in the countryside, are influenced by beliefs. For instance, there is a procession celebrated yearly in the town of Pakil where all the sick and invalid take part in by dancing. In this manner, they believe, that they will get cured of their sufferings&hellip; It is a strange spectacle to see all these poor devils make superhuman efforts and incredible contortions until the Blessed Virgin is returned to the church. These unfortunate ones at the end of their strength throw themselves to the ground gasping and rest motionless for hours. Those who are seriously ill often die of exhaustion, while others regain their health or get worse (De la Gironiere 1954).</p>\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Pakil is still known for the turumba festival, the longest running festival spanning seven fiestas over seven months that culminate in processions with lively dancing. Recently, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">street dance</a> competition has been held in October of every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipinos continued to express their belief and petitions to the god introduced by the Spanish colonialists through movement and music, but under the regulation and control of the religious. In Cebu, people annually celebrate the Sinulog Festival in January. The <strong>sinulog</strong> is a ritual dance in honor of the child Jesus, Se&ntilde;or Santo Ni&ntilde;o. Believed to be rooted in animistic religion, the sinulog used to be performed for wooden statues around town until the Cebuano appropriated the dance for the Catholic faith, with the tolerance of the friars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early accounts of the sinulog described women dancing in a &ldquo;mass of howling, gesticulating humanity&hellip; with piercing and unnatural cries, panting and perspiring&rdquo; (Leonard 1922). This manner of worship was not encouraged. The church controlled the performances of the devotees by exiling them from the church chambers. The sinulog we know today consists of the following steps: the&nbsp;<em>natural&nbsp;</em>(two steps forward, one step backward) and the&nbsp;<em>kinampilan&nbsp;</em>(one step forward, one step backward) to the sound of beating drums. Devotees shout their petitions while they march with cries of &ldquo;<em>Pit&nbsp;</em><em>Se&ntilde;or!</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the modification of rituals and existing dances, the Spaniards also contributed to the wealth of Philippine movement practices with the introduction of their own dance traditions and other dances from Europe. The communal celebrations allowed for Philippine ethnic dance to interact with Hispanic dance traditions. These dances became staple dance forms in various life-cycle celebrations throughout the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance was a main component of many events that allowed Filipinos and foreigners to socialize with one another. The performances of these dances are said to have retained the air and some figures of their original amalgamation with foreign forms. These dances spread throughout the country, developing into different versions and were known by other names. With the introduction of European culture in general, many of the old native dances disappeared or were slowly displaced by the movement vocabulary introduced by the colonialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In social functions of the Filipino elite, the French quadrille called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon de honor</strong></a> (or its subsequent American equivalent, <strong>virginia</strong>) as well as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros</strong></a>, which resembled French dances of the Middle Ages, highlighted balls in towns and cities, as well as in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an Palace</a>. These secular events completed the feast days, celebrated the arrival of the galleons from Mexico, or welcomed a new governor general or bishop. Similarly, dances such as the <strong>estudiantina</strong> (Atimonan, Quezon), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/79\"><strong>pantomina</strong></a> (Bicol Region), <strong>la simpatika</strong> (Pangasinan, Ilocos), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de Tayabas</strong></a> (Tayabas, Quezon), and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\"><strong>valse vieja</strong></a> (Pangasinan and Ilocos) tell of the lives of privileged Filipinos who attended grand parties wearing fine vestments and gowns. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/80\"><strong>Paseo dances</strong></a> such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/80\"><strong>paseo de Bicol</strong></a> from Oas, Albay and the <strong>paseo de Narciso</strong> from Narciso, Zambales allowed the elite to show off their new garments and meet their peers in the town plaza. These dances and others similar to them came to be known as <strong>Maria Clara dances</strong> for they captured the elegance and gallantry of the&nbsp;<em>mestizas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>ilustrados&nbsp;</em>(enlightened). Another <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social dance</a> performed during weddings is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> where plates are set for gifts of money. This dance was adopted by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a> of Cagayan and Isabela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In no time, other parlor dances from Spain, France, and other European countries, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\"><strong>valse</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>fandango</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/55\"><strong>schottische</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/72\"><strong>mazurka</strong></a>, <strong>minueto</strong>, <strong>paseo</strong>, <strong>marcha</strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a>, were adopted and adapted to the tastes and needs of a colonial society and the conditions of climate and seasons in a tropical archipelago. Toward the end of the Spanish regime, the <strong>jota</strong>, <strong>habanera</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\"><strong>balse</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka</strong></a>, <strong>mazurka</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/55\"><strong>escotis</strong></a> (from schottische), and <strong>paseo</strong> were in vogue among different social classes. It is said that the Filipinos were so fond of the dances that no fiesta or family reunion was celebrated without much dancing among themselves. In general, the natives accepted what were performed here by foreigners or what they saw abroad. In 1846 Jean Mallat noted:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>The fandango, the capateado, the cachucha, and other Spanish dances have been adopted by the Indians, and they do not lack grace when they dance them to the accompaniment of castanets which they play with a remarkable precision. They also execute some dances of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, such as, for example, the jarabes, where they show all the Spanish vivacity with movements of their figure, of their breasts, of their hips, to right and left, forward and backward, and pirouettes, whose rapidity is such that the eye can scarcely follow them (Blair and Robertson XLV, 277).</p>\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Exposed for almost four centuries to the influence of European dances, the Filipinos gradually assimilated these dances, evolving their own versions and derivations of the different forms. The elegance of the body and arm movements of foreign dances fascinated the Filipinos, so they adopted these. However, the sharp and fast movements of most European dances were tempered and softened by the languid grace that is characteristic of many Filipino dances. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">Costumes and props</a> associated with the original dances were either changed, adapted, or done away with. All of these European dances also underwent regional transformation in the colony, as is evident in the existing variations of the jota, balse, habanera, and pandanggo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"hispanicdance\" name=\"hispanicdance\"></a>Hispanic Dance Forms</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"thejota\" name=\"thejota\"></a>The Jota.</strong>&nbsp;The jota, a dance in fast duple time and a great favorite during the Spanish colonial era, was originally performed by the Spaniards at their social gatherings, together with the polka, valse, and habanera. Whenever there were not enough Spanish nationals to do the dance, Filipinos were invited to take part in it. Upon learning the jota, these Filipinos in turn taught other Filipinos. The dance became the Philippines&rsquo; most popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a>, maybe because of its gay and lively tempo and the agile movements that went with it. The dance soon spread, first among the well-to-do and later to the rural communities. In the latter, the dancing was usually started by the old people and followed by the younger ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early Filipinos came up with their own versions of the jota. There are over a hundred recorded and unrecorded jotas from all over the country. Philippine jotas are known to be delightful and lively dances performed at social affairs. Some jotas are integral parts of grand celebrations such as weddings. It became popularly known as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a> and social events were deemed incomplete without the performance of a jota (Tabije-Andin 1993, 25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota moncade&ntilde;a</strong></a> from Moncada, Tarlac differs from other jotas in that it is performed during funerals and wakes. Also referred to as the <strong>jota florana</strong>, this dance is unique for its section called <strong>patay</strong> (dead), a <strong>marcha funebre</strong> section, where the dancers slow down and act as though they are comforting one another in order to cope with loss and grief. This version combines Spanish and Ilocano movements. Its initial movements are lively and fast, accented by the scintillating rhythm of elongated bamboo castanets; the second part is characterized by a contrasting slow rhythm, typically native in mood and execution. The dance reverts to the fast tempo at the end. This version of the jota originally danced by the old people of Moncada, Tarlac, does not include the more intricate patterns of the Spanish jota. Instead, it simply adopted the lively tempo and the simple dance steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jota was originally performed on special occasions, like the&nbsp;<em>guling-guling&nbsp;</em>(eve of Ash Wednesday), the&nbsp;<em>tambora&nbsp;</em>(eve of Christmas), or on feast days of saints. Later, it was performed in social gatherings such as weddings, town fiestas, feasts for honored guests, and baptismal parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common step found in the jota is the waltz, a step-close-step pattern executed to a triple measure. Stamp, brush, touch, and jump and their combinations and variations like the waltz turns and accented waltz steps are also done, all to liven up the dance. The slow rhythm in the middle part of the dance is typically Ilocano wherein the figure called patay is done with slides and very slow steps as the dancers console each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this dance, the female dancers wore and still wear the&nbsp;<em>maria clara</em>, the upper-class female costume of the 1880s named after the heroine of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not). This is a floor-length paneled skirt of silk or satin, of black and white or other colors, with floral prints or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, without a&nbsp;<em>tapis&nbsp;</em>(overskirt). The&nbsp;<em>camisa&nbsp;</em>or blouse is usually made of handwoven&nbsp;<em>pi&ntilde;a</em>, and has wrist-length, richly embroidered flowing bell sleeves. Over this camisa is worn a&nbsp;<em>pa&ntilde;uelo</em>, a square piece of the same material as the camisa folded into a triangular collar scarf covering the back and shoulders. The footwear is beaded or embroidered slippers. The male dancers wore and still use the barong tagalog, a loose fitting shirt worn long over the pants. It has a close fitting neck with collar and long, cuffed sleeves. Its material is usually the same as the ladies&rsquo; pi&ntilde;a, worn plain or embroidered. The pants and shoes are black. Silver-studded salakot (native hat) and canes were added by folkloric groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance is accompanied by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\"><em>rondalla</em></a>, a band of stringed instruments, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/804\"><em>bandurria</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/814\"><em>laud</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/819\"><em>octavina</em></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, and&nbsp;<em>bajo</em>. Usually, the bandurria in the ensemble has six pairs of double strings. It is played with a plectrum. The laud is similar to the bandurria except that it has a long neck, wider body, and a lower pitch. Shaped like a small guitar, the octavina has a mellow tone quality and is tuned like the laud. The five-stringed Philippine guitar is an adaptation of the Spanish guitar. The&nbsp;<em>bajo de unas&nbsp;</em>or bass guitar has four strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>malague&ntilde;a</strong> from Malaga, Spain, is another lively dance adapted by the Filipinos. It is one of the favorite jota dances of the old people from San Pablo, Laguna. The dance utilizes stamps, turns, and the <strong>jaleo</strong> which is done with the partners&rsquo; right elbows near each other. They perform waltz steps turning around clockwise, looking at each other over their right shoulders, and doing small running steps typical of many Spanish dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other adaptations and interpretations of the jota in the different regions, performed during fiestas, usually by the elite. Most of the jotas are named after their places of origin, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota paloana</strong></a> from Palo, Leyte, <strong>jota manile&ntilde;a</strong> from Manila, <strong>jota cavite&ntilde;a</strong> from Cavite, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota cabangan</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota de Olongapo</strong></a> from Zambales, <strong>jota ecijana</strong> from Nueva Ecija, <strong>jota laoague&ntilde;a</strong> from Laoag, Ilocos Norte, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>la jota samare&ntilde;a</strong></a> from Samar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>la jota San Joaquin</strong></a> from Iloilo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota batangue&ntilde;a</strong></a> from Batangas, <strong>jota de paragua</strong> from Cuyo, Palawan, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota bicolana</strong></a> from the Bicol region. The <strong>jota san joaquina</strong> from Iloilo uses castanets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other livelier versions of the Jota are the <strong>la jota Isabella</strong> named after Queen Isabella of Spain, Manila&rsquo;s <strong>noche de gala</strong> and <strong>la jota manile&ntilde;a</strong> with bamboo castanets, and the <strong>array</strong> from Ermita, Manila. The latter is more spritely compared to others and has a flirtatious feel. The dance is performed with the use of tambourines by the ladies and is accompanied by verses sung in old Ermite&ntilde;o Tagalog dialect. Other adaptations include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>la jota yogad</strong></a> and <strong>la jota pilipina</strong> from Echague, Isabela; and <strong>la sevillana</strong> from Iloilo. The costumes, props, and even the gestures and formations of these dances necessarily vary from town to town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"habanera\" name=\"habanera\"></a>The Habanera.</strong> Introduced during the Spanish colonial period, the habanera, a piece of music named after Havana in Cuba where it originated, is also a courtship dance in slow duple meter accompanied by step-close-step pattern, similar to the <strong>tango</strong> with its syncopated beat. The Filipinos have their own version with elements from the original dance. Most of the habanera dances come from the Pangasinan and Ilocos regions, Zambales, and Capiz. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera de soltera</strong></a> is performed by a betrothed couple during one of seven ceremonies before their wedding, specifically during the fifth ceremony in the home of the bride-to-be. After the feast in which the relatives of both the bride and groom take part, the couple dance to express the love and happiness they wish in the marriage. It is called habanera de soltera because this is the last time the couple will dance in their single state. Apart from the basic habanera step, additional movements include slides, knee bends, and hops. A variation of the habanera step features the double-cross habanera step. This is done in two measures with two cross steps before the habanera step. Also used in the dance is the typical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong>kumintang</strong></a> of Pangasinan called <strong>kewet</strong>, which means turning the hand outward from the wrist, with the fist loosely closed and the thumb sticking out. For contemporary performers of this dance, the girl wears a maria clara, preferably in white as this is the dance of a betrothed couple, and slippers, while the boy wears any old-style barong tagalong, trousers, and any colored shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>habasinan</strong>, another Pangasinan dance, is a gay and beautiful habanera. Derived from the word &ldquo;haba&rdquo; from habanera and &ldquo;sinan&rdquo; from Pangasinan, the courtship dance is both expressive and romantic, and is usually performed during weddings and other social gatherings. The <strong>habanera</strong> from Ilocos Sur, as performed by the Ilocano peasants, depicts the modesty of traditional Ilocano women. From Botolan, Zambales comes the very colorful and lively dance <strong>habanera botole&ntilde;a</strong>. In the early days, this was supposedly performed in honor of a departing parish priest. Later, the dance became a festival dance performed during social gatherings for various occasions. Capiz has its own version of the habanera called <strong>habanera capise&ntilde;a</strong> which is one of the most popular courtship dances, performed during social gatherings at baptisms, weddings, fiestas, and other important occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"polka\" name=\"polka\"></a>The Polka.</strong> The polka, considered the national dance of Bohemia (Czechoslovakia), was among the first dances introduced by the early European immigrants to the Philippines and by Filipinos who had been to Europe. It was popularized in the Islands not later than 1859. It was usually performed as a ballroom dance during fiestas or grand social affairs. The basic dance step of the polka is executed to a duple meter with a step-close-step pattern following the one-and-two rhythm. Other polka steps used in the dance are the heel-and-toe polka, the hop polka, the gallop, chasing steps, and the hop step. This is a dance in duple meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every locality would have its own version, but the basic steps of the plain polka, and the heel-and-toe polka were always included. The <strong>Quezon polka</strong> is performed in sets of four pairs in square formation. In Bataan, the dance is called <strong>polka tagala</strong>. In one figure of the dance, the ladies kick their voluminous skirts forward and backward to show off their beautiful lace petticoats. In Batangas, the dance was called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka sa nayon</strong></a>, while in Mindoro it was known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka sala</strong></a>. Among the Visayans, the dance was called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka antigo</strong></a>, and in Negros Occidental <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka italiana</strong></a>. In Ilocos Norte, there is a courtship dance called <strong>sileledaang</strong>, which means laden with sorrow. Interestingly, the dancers here show their fondness for each other using the basic polka step to a tempo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>maliket-a-polka</strong> is another version of this dance form. &ldquo;Maliket&rdquo; in Pangasinan means happy, therefore, happy polka. This is danced during fiestas in honor of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, patron saint of a barrio of Pangasinan. When this dance is performed today for the stage, the&nbsp;<em>balintawak&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>tapis&nbsp;</em>and soft&nbsp;<em>pa&ntilde;uelo&nbsp;</em>draped over the left shoulder is used by the girls while the&nbsp;<em>camisa de chino&nbsp;</em>and any pair of colored trousers are used by the males.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"rigodon\" name=\"rigodon\"></a>The Rigodon and Other Quadrille Dances.</strong> Foreign dance influences from countries other than Spain seeped into Filipino consciousness during the Spanish rule. Spanish music-theater, used to teach moral lessons to the local populace, also became an effective means to popularize European dances, as&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">zarzuela</a>&nbsp;</em>actors were also singers and dancers. Poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5797\">Flavio Zaragosa Cano</a> was even recorded to have referred to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4320\">Patrocinio &ldquo;Monang&rdquo; Carvajal</a>, daughter of zarzuela star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3276\">Patrocinio Tagaroma</a>, as &ldquo;Diosa del Baile&rdquo; (Villaruz 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other dances introduced during the Spanish period were the quadrille dances, most important of which is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon</strong></a>. To the Filipinos, the rigodon or <strong>rigodon de honor</strong> is the best ceremonial dance. Introduced to the French court by a dancing master named Rigaud, it was first known as <strong>Rigaudon</strong>. In Britain, it was later called the <strong>Rigadoon</strong>. The dance got to Manila in the 19th century and was called rigodon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rigodon is performed to orchestral music with a lively rhythm. The most popular quadrille dance in the country, it is usually performed at State functions by high government officials and people of high social class. In the square formation, distinguished or important personages are the&nbsp;<em>cabeceras&nbsp;</em>or head pairs, and the less important ones the&nbsp;<em>costados&nbsp;</em>or side pairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are many versions of it, the dance is always in quadrille formation. The cabeceras always perform the dance steps first, followed by the costados. After the <strong>saludo</strong> or <strong>anuncio</strong>, the dance starts with the figure of ladies meeting, followed by the <strong>zeta</strong>, <strong>casamiento</strong> or <strong>abanico</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>visita</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>cadenilla</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>cambio pareja</strong>, and finally the <strong>cadena</strong>. In all the figures, the dancers walk in a stately manner following the rhythm of the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting facet of the rigodon is its music. It is composed of at least five numbers, each one complete in itself and usually taken from popular operas of the day. The last musical theme is the work of a Filipino composer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\">Jose Estella</a>. Before World War II, the male dancers were requested to wear formal mess jackets or white tuxedo, black pants, and black tie for the rigodon. The ladies, except Muslim and foreign women, were requested to come in&nbsp;<em>traje de meztiza&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>terno</em>, the native formal attire for women, characterized by butterfly sleeves, stiff pa&ntilde;uelo, and long train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other types of quadrille dances are the lanceros from Pagsanjan, Laguna; the <strong>pasakat</strong> from Santa Rosa, Laguna; the <strong>los bailes de ayer</strong> or <strong>maharlika</strong> from Tarlac; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de lingayen</strong></a> of Pangasinan; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de Negros</strong></a> from Silay, Negros Occidental. The Silay version of the lanceros is in linear formation, not in quadrille formation like the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"paseoandchotis\" name=\"paseoandchotis\"></a>The Paseo and Chotis.</strong> The&nbsp;<em>paseo&nbsp;</em>or promenade was a favorite pastime of the elite, where upper class ladies tried to outdo one another in donning their best finery. Eventually, the <strong>paseo</strong> became a dance, and gave birth to many different local versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/80\"><strong>paseo de Bicol</strong></a> from Oas, Albay is adapted from the paseo. During the celebration called&nbsp;<em>aurora&nbsp;</em>(dawn), the old people gather in the church to pray for a good harvest or to overcome impending calamities, while the young folks promenade with their loved ones around the church or in the churchyard. The dancers use a variety of steps in the dance: the waltz step, the waltz turn, the change steps, the sway balance with a waltz, and the three steps and a point. For this dance, the girls wear the traditional Bicol costume, the&nbsp;<em>patadyong</em>, and&nbsp;<em>camisa&nbsp;</em>with butterfly sleeves. A folded soft pa&ntilde;uelo hangs on the left shoulder. The boys wear the barong tagalog or camisa de chino and colored trousers. Another dance that may be considered a paseo is the <strong>andaluz de Negros</strong> where a lady encounters and relates to four gentlemen as she strolls around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballroom dancing became even more popular with the arrival of the <strong>escotis</strong> or <strong>chotis</strong>, a derivation of the foreign schottische, one of the oldest European dances. Many say it is Germanic in origin; other say it came from Poland and was brought to the Philippines in the 1850s. Performed as a ballroom dance during social gatherings, the escotis of Capiz and Aklan uses the step-close-step-hop-step pattern of the European schottische, while the chotis of Camarines Sur uses the localized version&mdash;the step, brush, step, brush, step, step, step, pause. The music of the escotis is similar to the polka but played a little slower. Many say the dance is a mixture of polka and a slow waltz. Like the <strong>chotis de Negros</strong>, the escotis from Capiz and Aklan can also be danced in informal social gatherings; hence the&nbsp;<em>patadyong&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>kimona&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>camisa&nbsp;</em>with butterfly sleeves may be used by the women, and the camisa de chino and dark trousers by the men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>chotis dingre&ntilde;a</strong> from Dingras, Ilocos Norte, is a dance of the elite. Being formal, it uses a&nbsp;<em>serpentina&nbsp;</em>skirt with a train and stiff camisa and pa&ntilde;uelo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that the escotis is still popular among the people inhabiting the mountains of Capiz, particularly in Panitan and Tapas. It was and still is an interesting practice of the people there to test the durability and strength of a newly built house by performing the dance at its housewarming. This is because the dance makes use of hops in a fast tempo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"balse\" name=\"balse\"></a>The Balse.</strong> The waltz or the <strong>valse/balse</strong>, the dance step and the musical form, was easily adapted by Filipinos and can be found in many Filipino folk dances such as the <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong> from Bicol and the Panay Islands, <strong>sayaw Santa Isabel</strong> from Bulacan, <strong>lanceros de Tayabas</strong> from Quezon, and <strong>pampilpelalecan</strong> from Pangasinan. The use of the waltz proliferated in dances for religious feasts, weddings, and other social occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance in slow triple meter is seen in almost all Philippine dances. This dance form descended from the <strong>peasant landler</strong>, a dance from Southern Germany. It had spread throughout Europe and had become one of the principal dances in social celebrations in many countries, Spain included. By the 19th century, the balse was already popular in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical of the waltzes is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a>, a lively courtship dance very popular throughout the country, particularly in the Tagalog and Visayan regions. In these areas, it was customary in the past for a young man to make known his amorous intentions to a young woman in a social gathering through song and dance. In most cases the poetic words of the song were composed on the spot, keeping to the plaintive strains of the music while the pair danced slow waltz steps around each other. This is the step-close-step pattern in rhythm. Often, other waltz steps were also improvised like the waltz turns, the waltz balance, and the cross waltz. If the dancers were good, the dance could last for hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A courtship dance known throughout the Philippines is the <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong>.&ldquo;Cari&ntilde;osa,&rdquo; meaning affectionate, lovable, or amiable, typifies the Filipina maiden&rsquo;s modesty and humility, and is another dance using the waltz step. Using a fan and a handkerchief, the dancers go about their courtship in a coquettish way through hide-and-seek movements, never missing a step with the music. There are many versions of this dance but the hide-and-seek movements with the fan and handkerchief are common to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Balse</strong> was a popular dance in Marikina, Rizal during the Spanish period. It was usually performed after the&nbsp;<em>lutrina</em>, a religious procession. The participants in the procession gathered in the house or yard of the&nbsp;<em>hermana&nbsp;</em>or sponsor for light refreshments. During or after the refreshments, there was dancing and singing, and the balse was one of the dances performed. The music was usually provided by a&nbsp;<em>musikong bumbong&nbsp;</em>or bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestra</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other folk dances that make use of the waltz and its variations are the <strong>santa rosa</strong> from Marilao, Bulacan; the <strong>bucasoy</strong> from Alimodian, Iloilo; the <strong>magkasuyo</strong> from Quezon; the <strong>saad</strong> from Capiz; and the <strong>molinete</strong> from Negros Occidental. The dances are performed for any social or religious occasion. The <strong>sayaw santa isabel</strong> is performed on the thanksgiving feast after a good harvest, during&nbsp;<em>balaihan&nbsp;</em>or engagement ceremonies, weddings or religious processions. For these dances, the girl wears the less formal balintawak, with&nbsp;<em>tapis&nbsp;</em>or overskirt, and soft pa&ntilde;uelo or kerchief over one shoulder, and a&nbsp;<em>salakot&nbsp;</em>or wide-brimmed hat decorated with brightly colored flowers. The&nbsp;<em>corcho&nbsp;</em>or leather slippers with cork heels and&nbsp;<em>bakya&nbsp;</em>or wooden clogs are worn by the ladies. The boy wears a camisa de chino and trousers of any color, and slippers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"pandanggo\" name=\"pandanggo\"></a>The Pandanggo</strong>. As popular as the jota and balse, the pandanggo was another favorite dance of Filipinos during the Spanish period. In Spain, the <strong>fandango</strong> is a lively Spanish dance done to a slow-to-quick rhythm. With characteristic adaptability, the steps of the original fandango were blended into the native dances resulting in soft but lively versions. It is usually performed for entertainment and merrymaking, with dancers keeping rhythm with castanets or tambourines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many different types of the pandanggo. The <strong>pandanggo ivatan</strong>, a wedding dance from Batanes, <strong>pandanggo dumaguete&ntilde;o</strong> from Dumaguete, and the <strong>pandanggo rinconada</strong> from Camarines Sur are named after their places of origin. Meanwhile, the <strong>pandanggo sa ilaw</strong> (fandango of lights), <strong>pandanggo sa sambalilo</strong> (fandango of hats), <strong>pandanggo sa pa&ntilde;o</strong> (fandango of kerchiefs), and <strong>pandanggo sa tapis</strong> (fandango of over-skirts) are identified by the objects used in the dance. Some pandanggo are known by their characteristic movements, such as the <strong>enga&ntilde;osa</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandanggo sa ilaw from Mindoro is perhaps the most difficult and demanding of the pandanggo. Here, the dancer executes not only waltz steps but also the cross-waltz described earlier with waltz turns and sway-balance steps with a point, as the lady dancers gracefully and skillfully balance three lighted&nbsp;<em>tinghoy&nbsp;</em>or oil lamps on her head and on the back of each hand. The last step is done on a step-cross-step-point pattern in two measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, the dance was performed to the clapping of the hands of onlookers. Later upon the request of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a>, who discovered this dance together with her research team, a lively melody in triple meter was composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, a member of her team, who kept the original rhythm. Today, this melody is often mistaken as a folk song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance is often performed during gatherings as one form of entertainment. In Mindoro, the costumes for the dance were the balintawak with tapis for the lady and long red trousers and barong tagalog for the gentlemen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another version, the pandanggo sa sambalilo from Camiling, Tarlac uses a hat. Here, the focus is on the male dancer who tries to pick up the hat from the floor with his head with great skill. The <strong>pandang-pandang</strong> is an extraordinary and exciting wedding dance from Antique. It was and still is customary for a newly married couple to perform this during the reception. Legend has it that this dance originated at one wedding dance. A newly married couple was supposed to be dancing normally, when a gecko (lizard) happened to get into the pants of the bridegroom. In his attempt to get rid of the gecko, the groom moved about in a frenzy, hopping and jumping, hitting his thighs and buttocks without missing the rhythm of the music. The spectators, thinking that it was all part of the dance, clapped their hands to cheer him on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandanggo ivatan is a wedding dance from Batanes. The bride and groom open the dance, after which the groom gives his gala (wedding gift in cash or in kind) to the bride. This is the signal for the guests to offer their own gala, each of which is preceded by a brief dance by the married couple to symbolize the start of their new life together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandanggo rinconada is a favorite of the people of the Rinconada district in Nabua, Camarines Sur. This is a festival dance performed by young and old people during the Christmas season. The enga&ntilde;osa, a festival dance from Samar also popularly known as <strong>pandangyado mayor</strong>, was believed to have been introduced by the Spaniards during the latter part of the 19th century. Retaining its Castilian flavor, the dance has lilting music and enticing movements, hence the name &ldquo;enga&ntilde;osa.&rdquo; For this dance, the maria clara and barong tagalog and black trousers and black shoes are worn by contemporary groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"mazurka\" name=\"mazurka\"></a>The Mazurka.</strong> Competing with the other dances in popularity is the <strong>mazurka</strong>, one of the national dances of Poland in triple meter. After the subjugation of Poland by Russia, the mazurka was naturalized by Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the dance form was introduced in the Philippines, the Filipinos readily integrated it in their repertoire of folk dances. As usual, there are as many versions of this dance as there are localities that accepted it as part of their folk dances. The step pattern is a slide, cut, hop, step to a triple measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>mazurka boholana</strong> is a traditional ballroom dance popular in Bohol during the Spanish period. This was originally performed by couples informally gathered in the ballroom, with no definite sequence of steps and figures. What makes the dance interesting is the combination of mazurka, <strong>redoba</strong>, and <strong>sangig</strong> steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the contemporary performers of the mazurka, the costume used is the maria clara for the girls and barong tagalog and black trousers for the boys. Almost always, the mazurka are ballroom dances and they are performed in both open and closed ballroom dance positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>mazurka val</strong> is a variation from Pangasinan. The steps are a combination of mazurka and valse, hence the name. One interesting feature of this dance is the figure where the boy exhibits his skill in dancing and both partners display coordination in movement as the boy carries the girl while dancing on his feet. The girl wears a Maria Clara or a turn of the century costume with a long train, the end of which is carried or tied to the middle finger of her right hand. The <strong>mazurka visaya</strong> from Negros Occidental combines folk and ballroom dance movements. According to the old people familiar with the dance, only a few could perform the dance properly because of its difficult and intricate step patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Mindoro comes another version, the <strong>mazurka mindore&ntilde;a</strong>. This beautiful festival dance was the premier dance of the elite of Mindoro. Don Antonio Luna, considered one of the best dancers of his time, popularized the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"surtido\" name=\"surtido\"></a><strong>Surtido</strong>. Filipinos quickly adopted and adapted to the different dance forms and styles they learned from foreigners. Filipino ingenuity came in their varied performances of the dances and their playfulness in putting dances together. This practice of combining movements from different dances came to be known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/101\"><strong>surtido</strong></a>. &ldquo;Surtido&rdquo; means assorted and refers to dances which combine movements from different dances. Examples of these are the <strong>polkabal</strong>, <strong>jotabal</strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/101\"><strong>surtido cebuano</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The polkabal acquired its name from two popular dances, the polka and the balse. The composite name was given to this lively dance by the people of Atimonan, Quezon. Among the interesting steps used are the <strong>luksong uwak</strong>, <strong>ensayo</strong>, <strong>contra-gansa</strong>, and <strong>punta y tacon</strong>. On the other hand, the <strong>mazurka valse</strong> from Negros Occidental is a combination of the mazurka and the balse steps; the jotabal from Gumaca, Quezon combines the jota and the balse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name <strong>pasakat</strong> from Santa Rosa, Laguna is the corruption of the original French&nbsp;<em>pas de quatre&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>paseo de cuatro</em>. This French ballroom dance was introduced in the Philippines during the latter part of the 19th century. When no name could be given to a dance because of the combination of many dance steps and music, the term &ldquo;surtido&rdquo; was also used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many regional versions of this dance. There is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/101\"><strong>surtido norte</strong></a> from Ilocos Norte, which combines the different steps and music of the Ilocos region. It also uses the half-closed fist movement called the <strong>kumintang</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Bantayan, Cebu comes the beautiful <strong>surtido cebuano</strong>. Originally danced like the rigodon in square formation with cabeceras and costados, it is sometimes performed in sets of two pairs. The dance is composed of a variety of steps danced to a medley of Visayan airs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the Spanish occupation, there were indigenous groups which managed to retain their religious beliefs and culture. Ethnic groups which inhabited remote islands had limited contact with colonizers and missionaries. British mariner Thomas Forrest wrote vivid recollections of Maguindanao in 1774. Forrest recorded life&mdash;the political system, their material culture, and traditions&mdash;that was free from Spanish jurisdiction. In one occasion Forrest was invited to Rajah Muda&rsquo;s fort and the Sultan&rsquo;s palace where &ldquo;at night 15 ladies standing behind one another formed a half-moon which moved slowly and in a circle. The men never mix with women in any amusement of this kind or even touch them, or take notice of them by look or otherwise as they pass, yet not seeming to avoid them&rdquo; (Pires 1971, 278). Many of the indigenous tribes that remained unfazed by Spanish colonialism were Muslim. The religious differentiation in the Philippines became even more apparent with the lowland Filipinos&rsquo; acceptance of Catholicism. The <strong>moro-moro</strong> dance, the movement component of the&nbsp;<em>moro-moro komedya</em>, is a visual and kinesthetic depiction of the Christian-Muslim/Moorish conflict. Serving as secular entertainment, the war dance moro-moro has permutations all over the country. The popular dance <strong>maglalatik</strong> from Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna is also considered a moro-moro dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"researchandtransformations\" name=\"researchandtransformations\"></a>Research and Transformations</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A good number of the dances with Hispanic influence still exist today. Some dances are still performed in their original form but many have been modified according to native taste or convenience. In Paranaque, during Easter Sunday, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>bate</strong></a> is danced for the&nbsp;<em>salubong&nbsp;</em>which reenacts the meeting of the Virgin and the Risen Christ. In Batangas, the subli is still performed by men and women to honor the Santa Cruz, patron of Bauan. In Bicol, the <strong>pantomina</strong> is danced in social gatherings, particularly during wedding celebrations, just as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/82\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> is performed by groups of about 13 men and women in &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo; costumes during the Christmas season. In the eastern part of the Visayas, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\"><strong>kuratsa</strong></a> is still very much a part of merrymakings. In Pakil, Laguna, the turumba is sung and danced by devotees during the procession of the Nuestra Senora de los Dolores while in Obando, Bulacan, people dance to petition the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salambao, Santa Clara, and San Pascual Bailon for a spouse or a child. Finally, many formal gatherings today still feature the stately rigodon, especially during coming-of-age parties for debutantes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dances have become popular in the past few decades because they have been <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documented</a> by researchers and are now being performed by professional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">dance companies</a> as well as students in school. Most performances, especially in basic education institutions, are staged based on the notation prescribed in the teaching manuals of Francisca Reyes-Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research on Philippine folk dances was started by Francisca Reyes-Aquino (then Tolentino) in 1931. With University of the Philippines (UP) Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5123\">Jorge Bocobo</a>&rsquo;s thrust towards documentation of folk music and dance, Reyes-Aquino, Antonino Buenaventura, and other faculty researchers embarked on a wide-scale documentation of traditional folk songs and dances. These dances were later published by Reyes-Aquino in her six-volume work titled <strong><em>Philippine <strong>Folk Dance</strong>s</em></strong> which has become the principal source book for folk dance scholars and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Reyes-Aquino, the other scholars who did their own researches were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2463\">Libertad V. Fajardo</a> who published her study on Visayan dances; Juan Miel and Petronila Suarez who focused on the dances of Samar and Iloilo, respectively; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2598\">Jovita Sison-Friese</a> who worked on the dances from Pangasinan; Teresita Ines-Pascua who published her studies on Ilocano dances; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2402\">Jose Balcena</a> who documented the dances from Capiz; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a> who did extensive research on the dances of the Sulu Archipelago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outstanding and pioneering research was also done by the artistic directors of the foremost folk dance companies in the country, specifically, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\">Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2413\">Paz Cielo Angeles-Belmonte</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Baranggay</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a>. There are also a few others who studied Philippine folk dances but due to financial constraints could not do consistent research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by these researches, many folk dance groups were formed to showcase the dances outside their places of origin. In 1937, Reyes-Aquino formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2615\">UP Folk Song and Dance Club</a> and the Filipiniana Dance Troupe. In 1949, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society</a>, a group composed of teachers all over the country was organized, also by Reyes-Aquino. Soon after, companies were established which presented these folk dances as theater. The Baranggay Dance Company was founded in the Philippine Normal College by Reyes-Aquino&rsquo;s student, Paz Cielo Angeles-Belmonte in June 1947. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> was formed in the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University in 1957, and since then has introduced Philippine folk dances to audiences around the world. The ROFG was founded by former Bayanihan dancer-researcher Ramon Obusan in September 1972, and is now one of the leading folk dance companies in the country. Other notable companies are those based in the UP, Far Eastern University, University of Santo Tomas, University of the East, and Mindanao State University in Marawi. While the presentations of these dance companies are largely theatrical and stylized, with glittering costumes and elaborate props, they still succeed in showcasing and popularizing Philippine culture through dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interest in folk dance grows stronger today, not only because of the growing number of folk dance companies formed over the past decades, but also because folk dance has become part of the education curriculum in the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Scholars all over the country almost always include folk dances in their activities, programs, and projects. Moreover, the dynamic practices of folk dance teachers are kept alive through the years by the Philippine Folk Dance Society (PFDS) formed by Reyes-Aquino in 1949. The PFDS promotes research and documentation of folk dances and allows for those involved in study and pedagogy of folk dances to exchange ideas with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, with its thrust towards developing and promoting Philippine culture, instituted annual folk dance workshops at the Folk Arts Theater, and folk dance workshops and performances by different companies (including its resident companies, the Bayanihan and the ROFG) in CCP venues and all over the country. The CCP has also given <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/25\">awards</a> to artistic directors of outstanding folk dance companies, folk dance researchers, and artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in the current search for a Filipino idiom in dance, contemporary choreographers have gone back to folk dance for inspiration.

Initially, the Spanish institutionalized the&#xA0;<em>encomienda</em>, &#x201C;a system where large tracts of land were granted by the king to well-connected individuals&#x201D; (Rice 2009, 262). As decreed by King Phillip II, lands were assigned to loyal Spanish subjects called&#xA0;<em>encomenderos</em>, who collected taxes and took charge of their areas to facilitate the conquest and control of the native population. Filipino natives were relocated from the barangay ruled by the village chieftain called datu into the encomiendas. Throughout the regime, native Filipinos paid taxes and males were drafted for labor, communal public work, postal clerkship, and military conscription. The indigenous notion of communal ownership was replaced by private landholding."

The State worked in sync with the Roman Catholic Church and Spanish Catholic missionaries helped in the propagation of Catholicism which was the official religion of the colony under the protection of the King. In the same vein, they were crucial in the promotion and acculturation of the natives in the Castilian way of life. The religious&#x2014;Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Recollects, and Jesuits&#x2014;taught the natives how to read and write the Roman alphabet and restructured indigenous beliefs and practices. They offered programs in primary, secondary, and tertiary education as well as vocational schools that imparted lessons on agriculture and industrial techniques. Formal schooling, however, was initially limited to the&#xA0;<em>insulares</em>, and the Spanish tongue set them apart from the&#xA0;<em>indios&#xA0;</em>or Christianized natives. In 1610, Filipino writer and publisher <a href=\"/9/9/5598\">Thomas Pinpin</a> lobbied for Filipinos to learn Spanish and in the late 19th century, schools accommodated the sons of wealthy Filipinos."

Apart from economic trade, there was also cultural exchange in the arts. Foreign dance influences were witnessed by Filipinos with the arrival of European troupes. These travelling groups greatly popularized European dances and plays. Direct relations with Spain and other countries were further facilitated by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This new route cut the travel time to Spain in half and paved the way for greater influx of ideas and cultural forms from the West. The Suez Canal also encouraged the empowered Filipino upper class to study in Europe. Upon their return, these&#xA0;<em>ilustrados&#xA0;</em>(enlightened) allowed for the European way of life to filter down into the people&#x2019;s social and economic activities."

They had a tradition of songs and poems and had woven music and dance into the day-to-day tapestry of their lives. They danced to celebrate love, marriage, birth, thanksgiving, victory in war; they danced to prepare for battles and to mourn their dead. In 1521, Pigafetta related that while he was a guest at the house of the Cebu chief&#x2019;s son-in-law and heir, four beautiful young women entertained him by dancing and making &#x201C;harmonious sweet sounds from brass <a href=\"/5/37/810\">gongs</a>&#x201D; (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 167-171).

Legend has it that this dance originated at one wedding dance. A newly married couple was supposed to be dancing normally, when a gecko (lizard) happened to get into the pants of the bridegroom. In his attempt to get rid of the gecko, the groom moved about in a frenzy, hopping and jumping, hitting his thighs and buttocks without missing the rhythm of the music.

Forrest recorded life&#x2014;the political system, their material culture, and traditions&#x2014;that was free from Spanish jurisdiction. In one occasion Forrest was invited to Rajah Muda&#x2019;s fort and the Sultan&#x2019;s palace where &#x201C;at night 15 ladies standing behind one another formed a half-moon which moved slowly and in a circle. The men never mix with women in any amusement of this kind or even touch them, or take notice of them by look or otherwise as they pass, yet not seeming to avoid them&#x201D; (Pires 1971, 278). Many of the indigenous tribes that remained unfazed by Spanish colonialism were Muslim. The religious differentiation in the Philippines became even more apparent with the lowland Filipinos&#x2019; acceptance of Catholicism. The <strong>moro-moro</strong> dance, the movement component of the&#xA0;<em>moro-moro komedya</em>, is a visual and kinesthetic depiction of the Christian-Muslim/Moorish conflict. Serving as secular entertainment, the war dance moro-moro has permutations all over the country.

Moreover, the dynamic practices of folk dance teachers are kept alive through the years by the Philippine Folk Dance Society (PFDS) formed by Reyes-Aquino in 1949.

As a result, the new country was embroiled again in the ensuing Philippine-American War, which officially ended in 1901, with the beginning of the American colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite objections from the anti-imperialists in the United States, the McKinley administration sent several batches of American teachers called the Thomasites, after the ship that they came in from the United States. They imposed the English language and oriented the people to American culture. And to hasten the Americanization of the Filipinos, the American colonial government sent&nbsp;<em>pensionados&nbsp;</em>(Filipino pensioners or scholars) to the United States to train in American universities. On the other hand, American popular culture was propagated all over the islands by the theatrical form called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/46\">vaudeville</a>,&rdquo; later Filipinized to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/46\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, which showcased American popular dances, songs, and comic acts. Together with bodabil, the movies from Europe and the United States exposed Filipinos to the Western way of life, which became their ideal, and the dances associated with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"komedya\" name=\"komedya\"></a>From Komedya to Bodabil</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But even after the takeover of the Philippines by the American government and the attempts at Americanizing the Filipinos, the old Hispanic culture which was centuries old, continued to flourish especially in the provinces. The Hispanic&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a>&nbsp;</em>continued to be the popular form of entertainment during town fiestas. As in the past, the komedya performance had theatrical conventions which included <strong>marcha</strong> (march), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a> (double step), <strong>eskaramursa</strong> (waltz), and the <strong>batalla</strong> (choreographed combat). Princesses would sing and dance the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\"><strong>balse</strong></a> (waltz) during intermissions. Komedya performances would last for days in the towns and the countryside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also surviving the change in political order, the Spanish&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">zarzuela</a>&nbsp;</em>continued and evolved into its Tagalog form. Earlier stars, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2936\">Praxedes &ldquo;Yeyeng&rdquo; Fernandez</a> who was noted for her <strong>tango</strong> and <strong>can-can</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3276\">Patrocinio Tagaroma</a> who married comedian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2823\">Jose Carvajal</a>, and their daughter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4320\">Patrocinio Carvajal</a> who was called a &ldquo;Diosa de Baile&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5797\">Flavio Zaragosa Cano</a>, still appeared in Teatro del Oriente in Compania de Zarzuela Comico-Lirica. But the Spanish zarzuela was swiftly being replaced by the native&nbsp;<em>sarsuwela&nbsp;</em>in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, and Hiligaynon. Most prominent examples of the Tagalog sarsuwela were <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1902, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\"><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></a></em></strong> (The Flirt), 1926, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2888\">Servando de los Angeles</a>; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), 1919, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>. With the sarsuwela&rsquo;s plot and music came dances like balitaw and balse. Active theaters in Manila were the Zorrilla, Filipino, Nacional, Universal, Oriente, Paz, Libertad, and Sirena. Like the komedya, the sarsuwela was deployed to the regions, especially at fiestas. Due to the sarsuwela&rsquo;s popularity, sarsuwela-type films were made, such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><strong><strong>Pakiusap</strong></strong></a> </em></strong> (Plea), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a> </em></strong> (Real Mother), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></strong></a> </em></strong> (Beautiful Star), and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></a> </em></strong> (My Love), all with singing and dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the direct American rule from 1901 to 1946, the United States brought in American musical and theatrical innovations. The local bodabil saw dancing in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1372\">variety shows</a>. Its origin is in the American vaudeville gestated from songs in Normandy, France, later popularized as theater in the United States. Consequently, this was also propagated in the Philippines. It catered to both Filipinos and American expatriates. Minstrel troupes (typically with blacks, and whites putting on black make-up) sailed across the Pacific. They featured popular music, the <strong>buck-and-wing</strong> and <strong>clog</strong> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/104\"><strong>tap</strong></a> dancing (of Irish or African origin), <strong>soft-shoe</strong>, and straight-forward <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz and blues</a> musical genres. Made famous in the United States, this variety show was called <strong>vod-a-vil</strong> by Cebuano jazz pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a>. Eventually, it was known as bodabil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Americans brought in the <strong>skirt-dance</strong> and <strong>pseudo-orientalia</strong> or <strong>exotic</strong> (also called <strong>aesthetic</strong>) dancing. The first dance ingeniously manipulated the skirt, while the second took on the fascination with oriental culture from the Near to the Far East. All these enthralled audiences at the Zorrilla, Libertad, Paz (formerly Orpheum), Filipino, Alhambra, and Cosmopolitan. Among the new bodabil houses were Savoy Nifties (later Clover) and Sirena (later Lux), and all hyped up their shows as &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Tony Pastor was the &ldquo;father of American vaudeville,&rdquo; John Cowper, who came to the Philippines with Henry Brown, was called the &ldquo;dean of Philippine vaudeville.&rdquo; Cowper&rsquo;s first venture was at Paz Theater with an all-European cast in 1911. He lost money and ended up working for the famous Lou Borromeo. Meanwhile, Brown formed a group at the Lux and also produced shows at the Rivoli and Savoy. European dancers&mdash;like Anita, Emilia, Teresa, Planella, Malgrosa, Francisca Nabalo (famous for her &ldquo;flea dance&rdquo;), the Agita Sisters (&ldquo;a clever Spanish trio&rdquo;), and the Frezagonda Sisters&mdash;performed alongside American entertainers (Villaruz 2006, 70).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her own class was Ada Delroy, who billed herself &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s greatest dancer.&rdquo; In 1900, she introduced Filipinos to what was a pyrotechnical and choreographic success in Europe. She must have imitated the American Loie Fuller (1862-1926), so celebrated at the Paris Folies-Bergere that they built a theater for her at the 1900 Paris World Fair (Horst Koegler 1982, 166). Fuller turned the skirt-dance into a spectacle with her own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costumes and lighting design</a>. A contemporary of Isadora Duncan, she was celebrated in the art nouveauor new art of the time. From Fuller&rsquo;s <strong><em>Serpentine Dance</em></strong> and <strong><em>Fire Dance</em></strong>, Delroy might have derived her own <strong><em>The Fire of Life</em></strong>. It was probably based on the English Rider Haggard&rsquo;s orientalist novel <strong><em>She</em></strong>. This was well received at the Zorrilla in 1900. The then current fashionable orientalism was pervasive, like depicting Salome in Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s play and Richard Strauss&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a>&mdash;the composer casting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\">Jovita Fuentes</a> as Salome. For her part, prima ballerina Anna Pavlova portrayed Asian deities with the Indian dancer Uday Shankar (Mukhopadhyay 2004, 16-21).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign vaudeville artists continued to visit in the 1930s and 1940s. The most notable were the African-American &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; Richard and Raymond Reynolds, who taught tap dancing and the <strong>charleston</strong> to Filipinos. Others were Helen and Lucy Martin, and the remarkable Portuguese &ldquo;Don&rdquo; Jose Zarah who came with a Spanish troupe and stayed on. Zarah spent World War II with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>&rsquo;s Merrymakers at the Dalisay, Strand, and Palace theaters. He became an independent dancer and impresario at the Clover (earlier the Savoy Nifties), performing <strong>flamenco</strong> and other Spanish dances with Bebe Marcaida. He also guided Charito &ldquo;Chuchi&rdquo; Hernandez as a choreographer into the 1960s. Hernandez rose from a chorus girl in 1927 to become a dancer of character and international dances, jazz, tap and some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> learned from the Spanish-American Carmen &ldquo;Chuchi&rdquo; MacLeod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, Filipinos replaced the imported entertainers. In the 1900&rsquo;s, Sunday Reantaso founded the first Philippine Vaudeville Company. Sarsuwela stars in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a> (&ldquo;Queen of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">Kundiman</a>&rdquo;) joined <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a> (&ldquo;Queen of the Jazz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Carmen Miranda of the Philippines&rdquo;) on the bodabil stage. With the advent of the movies, Hollywood musicals left their mark on the bodabil. Movie dancing stars were led by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Soon enough they got bodabil&rsquo;s counterparts in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a> and Nieves Manuel. Also idolized on stage and in film was child star and tap dancer Shirley Temple, who first won fame with black partner Bill &ldquo;Bojangles&rdquo; Robinson. Among Temple&rsquo;s local counterparts was the young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\">Tita Duran</a>, later singing and dancing with husband <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a>. Before the World War II ended, Gene Kelly rose from Broadway and Hollywood as versatile icon in tap, jazz, and ballet, all seen in his many films. In turn those films influenced our stage and later television. In various degrees, local stagings imitated the geometric spectacles of Busby Berkeley. His style can be traced back to the <strong>ballet&nbsp;</strong><strong>mecanique</strong> of Luigi Manzotti (1835-1905), an example of which was seen from <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\">Dubsky</a> in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing in 1929, a John Maynard favorably compared Philippine bodabil to the American product, describing Buster Dunson at the Savoy as &ldquo;a clever and versatile dancer.&rdquo; Dunson trained the famous Garcia Sisters, Flor and Modesta, and designed costumes for shows. Maynard called Katy de la Cruz &ldquo;the greatest favorite of Manila variety,&rdquo; naming her &ldquo;the Sophie Tucker of the Philippines.&rdquo; There were singer-dancers like Toy-Toy, Leonora Reyes, Elizabeth &ldquo;Dimples&rdquo; Cooper, Vitang Escobar, Nazarina Farias, Carmen &ldquo;Miami&rdquo; Salvador (with a &ldquo;hula wiggle that is entirely unequalled by any other performer&rdquo;), and the Garcia Sisters who formed with Dunson a &ldquo;three-cornered combination [that was] the best dancing act Manila has ever had.&rdquo; In <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></em></strong>, Maynard enthused, &ldquo;There is a dainty nymph-like grace and beauty about those tiny Malay figures possessed by no other race in the world. They are quick in learning their routines, and are natural dancers&rdquo; (Maynard 1929a, 164-65, 305-07; 1929b, 40-43).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in World War II, 1942 to 1945, they banned American films, and Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1087\">movie production</a> also ground to a halt. Joining the war with its allies in Germany and Italy, Japan took the agenda of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This included the teaching of the Japanese language and the encouragement of local artists. Writing about those times, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a> said that when the bodabil was dying &ldquo;in the dingy houses on Echague where it was making a last stand, [it] returned to triumph&rdquo; (Joaquin 1990). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4339\">Joe Climaco</a> was among the first to stage a show during the Japanese occupation. People queued for hours in the morning, as they did for food and other things, before the theaters opened at noon for the three shows of the day. Various conglomerations sprouted, such as the Merrymakers of Lou Salvador, the Philippine Artists&rsquo; League of Sammy Rodriguez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>, the Filipinas Revue of Jose Climaco and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, the Stage Revue of Ruben and Corazon Roque, the Stage Revue of Jose Generoso, and the production outfit of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe</a>. Salvador staked out Dalisay, Strand, and Palace; Rodriguez and Avellana, the Avenue; the Roques, the Lyric; Climaco, the Life; Generoso, the State; and Poe, the Capitol, theaters found in Quiapo, Santa Cruz, and Avenida, Rizal. It was during this period that bodabil expanded to include the &ldquo;drama-skit&rdquo; and was then renamed <strong>stage show</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the general opposition to the Japanese, there was also a shift of mind with their emphasis on Asia for the Asians in cultural expressions. Back in 1939, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa</a> danced for a cultural mission in Japan. This was a year before she had choreographed <strong><em>Morolandia</em></strong>, inspired by her childhood in Sulu where her father had a medical assignment. For the stage shows in the war years, Filipino folk dancers joined the musicians and actors. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Tolentino</a> (later Mrs Aquino) staged dances for the bodabil stage. Earlier in 1937, she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2615\">University of the Philippines Folk Song and Dance Club</a>. It was under the auspices of UP Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5123\">Jorge Bocobo</a> who espoused the serious and broad study of Filipino culture. Her two dancers in Patria Panajon and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2588\">Lucio Sandoval</a> danced at the Avenue for Avellana&rsquo;s productions, like <strong><em>Pista ng Bayan</em></strong>. A third was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2413\">Paz Cielo Angeles-Belmonte</a> who staged dances for Climaco in State Theater and for Fernando Poe in Avenue Theater. In 1946, she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a> at the Philippine Normal School (now University).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, the bodabil or stage show maintained its popularity. To celebrate the end of the Japanese occupation, Salvador staged &ldquo;a mammoth stage show&rdquo; at the Apollo for 40 days. It featured the biggest stars such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a>. The stage show came to be the regular double-feature with the movies into the last days of Clover and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House (MGOH)</a> to the 1960s. Clover showcased the choreography and direction of the Portuguese Don Jose Zarah. The MGOH was subsequently owned by Toribio Teodoro, who reconstructed it with air-conditioning, and inaugurated it in 1947 in the presence of Pres Manuel Roxas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"ballet\" name=\"ballet\"></a>Ballet</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballet took its first steps on the bodabil stage. In 1901, the &ldquo;ballet girls&rdquo; of the Lilliputians (a term for children groups) came from Australia to grace the Zorrilla in 1901. They performed <strong><em>Amber</em></strong>, <strong><em>Housemaids</em></strong>, <strong><em>Seaweed Ballet</em></strong>, <strong><em>Widow Ballet</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Pierrot Ballet</em></strong>. Similarly, the company of youth in the Japanese Infantile Company opened at Teatro Oriental in Santa Cruz with what was billed a &ldquo;Japanese ballet.&rdquo; In 1902, the Baroufski Imperial Ballet Circus performed in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Hashim&rsquo;s National Cycle Track</a> (later MGOH). It advertised 25 &ldquo;ballet beauties&rdquo; in dance pantomimes called <strong><em>The Sea Robbers</em></strong>, <strong><em>Faust</em></strong>, and one about the Boer War. The <strong><em>Manila Times</em></strong> described the pantomime as a &ldquo;mammoth production,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;the lovers of lingerie, pink tights and shapely anatomy with pretty faces were not disappointed when the nightly ballet and pantomime numbers were given.&rdquo; Circus troupes, like the Barnes and Cogill-Sutton companies, gave performances at the Zorrilla which were &ldquo;the best that had been given in Manila since many moons.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A certain Paul Nijinsky came to Manila in 1915 and 1916, declaring himself a member of the Imperial Russian Ballet in St Petersburg. He performed for the Belgian Red Cross at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>. He danced to Chopin, Saint-Saens, Grieg, Wieniawski, and Schubert, music then found too serious for ballet but which approach was espoused by Isadora Duncan. This &ldquo;Nijinsky&rdquo; attributed his costumes to Serge Diaghilev&rsquo;s own designer Leon Bakst in the famed Ballets Russes, danced barefoot, and was assisted by &ldquo;the best local talents.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1922, the world&rsquo;s most celebrated ballerina Anna Pavlova saw those local talents during one of her global tours. Like Sarah Berndhardt, Pavlova performed on vaudeville and music-hall stages around the world, popularizing ballet as no other artist had done. Pavlova&rsquo;s performances at the MGOH inspired many young girls. One of them was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2503\">Anita Kane</a> who decided to study in Manila with Katrina Makarova, a refugee from the Russian Revolution who claimed links with St Petersburg Imperial Ballet (Sembrano 2015, C-2). From Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2584\">Fe Sala-Villarica</a>&mdash;who later trained with Kane&mdash;studied in Manila with Mara Selheim who also claimed Russian descent. (Many then used pseudo-Russian names, often by their own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a>&rsquo; marketing ploy.) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2620\">Remedios Villanueva Pi&ntilde;on</a> mentions Olga Dontsoff and Vladimir Bolsky to have briefly taught in Ermita. From 1924 to the mid-1930s, the Englishwoman Kay Williams also ran a studio there. Among her pupils was opera&rsquo;s diva <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4078\">Mercedes Matias Santiago</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kane herself lived in the Philippines for most of her life. She grew up in Paracale, Camarines Norte, where her father worked for a mining company. Later she trained further in England and USA, and started a graded teaching system in the Philippines. Briefly, she also taught dance in the University of the Philippines. Kane produced the first full-length ballet <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/164\"><strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></a></em></strong>, 1939, to original <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/31\">music</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a>. Elisa Robles essayed the title role. In 1951, Kane worked with composer Marcelino Carluen for <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/184\"><strong>Reconstruction Ballet</strong></a></em></strong>, on the Filipino efforts to reconstitute their lives after the World War II. Her Anita Kane Ballet Company was later called Pamana Ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2384\">Lubov &ldquo;Luva&rdquo; Adameit</a> was more influential than either Makarova or Williams. She graduated from the Malinovsky School of Ballet and Free Art in Kiev. She claimed she danced with Pavlova&rsquo;s company (not necessarily that of 1922). With her manager G. Leibovitz and pianist Ivan Sitnik, she came to Manila in 1927 to found her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2430\">Cosmopolitan Ballet and Dancing School</a>. Briefly, she also taught at Philippine Women&rsquo;s College (now University). Some of Adameit&rsquo;s students started young in their careers as choreographers in&nbsp;<em>veladas&nbsp;</em>(evening parties) and shows for Manila Carnival. Distinguished were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2449\">Remedios &ldquo;Totoy&rdquo; de Oteyza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a>, Mitos Sison, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2479\">Maria Luisa &ldquo;Inday&rdquo; Gaston</a> (later Ma&ntilde;osa) and her sister <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3996\">Conchita</a> (who became an international opera diva), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2434\">Chloe Cruz-Romulo</a>, Pacita Madrigal-Gonzalez (later Warns), Elsie Uytiepo-Torrejon, Chona Recto-Kasten, and Esperanza Santos. The last named her own ballet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">school</a> after Adameit. Another Adameit alumna is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2472\">Fely Franquelli</a> who was among the first to make a dent abroad as a solo artist in the 1930s. At her coming home, she enjoyed the rave review of writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5462\">Salvador P. Lopez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adameit&rsquo;s annual recitals were staged at the MGOH and later at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>. Among her original ideas was putting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a> <strong>en pointe</strong>, as in the <strong><em>Cari&ntilde;osa</em></strong> and <strong><em>Planting Rice</em></strong>, thus nurturing the seeds of stylized folkloric ballet. This path was extended by Orosa-Goquingco in well-plotted and unified ballets. Her most significant works are <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/200\"><strong>Trend: Return to Native</strong></a></em></strong>, 1941, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/142\"><strong><em>Filipinescas: Philippine Life, Legend and Lore in Dance</em></strong></a>, 1961, parts of which consolidated some of her earlier works like <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/202\"><strong>Vinta</strong></a></em></strong> and <strong><em>Morolandia</em></strong> (1938). Orosa-Goquingco&rsquo;s works that combined classical ballet and folk dance was hailed as &ldquo;an important milestone in what cultural historians now call the period of stylization in the history of Philippine dance&rdquo; (Laconico-Buenaventura 2012, 128). For her early and later works, Orosa-Goquingco was named National Artist in 1976. Another one of Adameit&rsquo;s noted pupils was de Oteyza, who herself won a prize for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> at the Manila Carnival. Later she studied in Paris with retired Russian prima ballerinas Olga Preobrajenska and Lubov Egorova, and the young choreographer George Balanchine who was a great influence in her succeeding choreographies set to music by Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Frank, Khachaturian<em>,&nbsp;</em>Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel, Gershwin, and much later to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3942\">Rodolfo Cornejo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3914\">Alfredo Buenaventura</a>. Her school group evolved from the de Oteyza Ballet in the 1950s to Manila Ballet Company, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2486\">Hariraya Ballet Company</a>, 1968, collaborating with Inday Gaston Ma&ntilde;osa, both from the Adameit school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another student of Adameit was Rosalia Merino-Santos, her &ldquo;baby ballerina,&rdquo; known as such for her skill and versatility. She danced Adameit&rsquo;s <strong><em>Planting Rice</em></strong> on pointe, and was first to do the difficult <strong>fouette</strong> (continuous spinning en pointe). She also studied ballet with Joseph Stemberski, Spanish dance with Conchita Sotelo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> with Reyes-Aquino, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>modern dance</strong></a> (then called <strong>ausdrukstranz</strong> or expressionistic dance) with Trudl Dubsky-Zipper. She went on to pursue modern dance for her master&rsquo;s degree in Wisconsin with Margaret H&rsquo;Doubler (who started the first dance degree in US), with Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey in Bennington College, and with Mary Wigman and Harald Kreutzberg in Europe. Her thesis in Wisconsin was a lecture-demonstration on dance as choreographic process, called <strong><em>What Is Dance</em></strong>, 1958. She came to direct the Far Eastern University (FEU) Folk Dance Troupe and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2466\">FEU Modern Experimental Dance Group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the war years, the Hungarian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2602\">Paul Szilard</a> taught and choreographed in Manila, particularly for the Metropolitan Theater (later the Manila Metropolitan Theater). Before and through the war years, he worked with dancers who had trained with Adameit for his versions of the classics <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong> and <strong><em>Sylvia</em></strong>, his own <strong><em>The Four Seasons</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Mad Thinker</em></strong>, and &ldquo;Dance of the Hours&rdquo; in the opera <strong><em>La Gioconda</em></strong> (The Jocund One). In 1953, he organized Philippine Art Theater to stage its <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a></em></strong> production which stylized Philippine folk dances into a ballet-theater form. Later he became an impresario in New York and sent prominent dance companies to Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"moderndance\" name=\"moderndance\"></a>Modern Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the ballets first seen on the vaudeville stage, there were theatrical dances that did not conform to the strict tenets of classical ballet. One is called <strong>modern dance</strong>. Later, its aesthetics and formulation refocused and is now called <strong>contemporary dance</strong>. At first it was an outright rebellion against the aesthetics of ballet. The coming of Ada Delroy was a foretaste of it in the Philippines. A further intimation of modern dance was seen at the MGOH in 1926 with the Denishawn company that went to the Far East and South East all in two years. The group was led by the couple Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn. St Denis was known for her adaptation of oriental dances. On the other hand, Shawn availed of both American Indian and Greek imageries. Later he espoused the cause of the male dancer with his All-Men Dancers Group (1933). He also founded the Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow in Massachusetts, where he founded a dance festival. The Denishawn&rsquo;s repertoire had mixed Western and Asian-inspired works which were also featured in the vaudeville circuit in USA. In Manila, the group added <strong><em>The Cosmic Dance of Shiva</em></strong> by Shawn and <strong><em>A Japanese Court Dancer</em></strong> by St Denis. While briefly in the Philippines, Shawn went to Baguio to view dances of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontoc</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, and Apayao. About these he wrote in <strong><em>Dance Magazine</em></strong> (Feb 1927): &ldquo;We went to a natural area in the hills and there saw dancing in the most violent contrast to the anemic and unoriginal dancing of the [Christian] Filipinos.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the European end came the Austrian Kaethe Hauser in 1932. She started a school in modern dance, known at that time in Europe as <strong><em>Ausdrukstanz</em></strong> or creative/interpretive dance, then advertised as ballet to attract a clientele. Among her pupils was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2576\">Manolo Rosado</a>, already notable in Spanish dance and who later fully turned to modern dance. After Rosado studied in Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow, Shawn hailed him as &ldquo;among the most talented artists of our generation,&rdquo; while dancer-author La Meri hailed him as &ldquo;the poet of dance.&rdquo; In 1937, Hauser also brought in a fellow Viennese, the Czechoslovakian Trudl Dubsky. In Europe, Dubsky was a major member of Gertrude Bodenweiser&rsquo;s troupe. (Bodenweiser was the first to bring modern dance to Australia. After the war some of those she had influenced, like Shona MacTavish, appeared as teachers or dancers in the Philippines.) Before coming to Manila, Dubsky appeared with the noted German modern dancer Harald Kreutzberg, and in the famous Max Reinhardt productions in Berlin. For a time she taught for the Vienna State Academy and choreographed for the Camargo Society that helped usher in the solid foundation of ballet in Britain. Moving to the Philippines, Dubsky taught modern dance at the Academy of Music and Foreign Dances in UP. Among her first tasks in Manila was working with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>, conductor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra (MSO)</a>. After Lippay died, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\">Herbert Zipper</a> became MSO&rsquo;s conductor. These coincidences led to Dubsky&rsquo;s marriage to Zipper. Of Jewish-Austrian extraction, Zipper was incarcerated in a German concentration camp. There he composed &ldquo;Dachau Song&rdquo; to boost the spirit for his fellow prisoners (Cummins 1992). With Zipper&rsquo;s support, Dubsky formed the Manila Ballet Moderne that ran annual productions at the MGOH between 1939 and 1941. Dubsky was intensely prolific, producing numerous works all in those seasons. She produced <strong><em>Petite Suite&mdash;Au Bord de la Seine</em></strong> (Little Suite&mdash;of the Seine) to Debussy, <strong><em>The Iron Foundry</em></strong> to Mossolow, <strong><em>Peer Gynt Suite</em></strong> to Grieg, <strong><em>Voices of Spring</em></strong> to Strauss, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/181\"><strong>Pictures at an Exhibition</strong></a></em></strong> to Moussorgsky, <strong><em>Polovestsky Dances</em></strong> to Borodin (from his opera <strong><em>Prince Igor</em></strong>), <strong><em>The Toy Box</em></strong> to Schubert, and <strong><em>The Women of Arles</em></strong> to Bizet. Immediately after the war, she revived her group for dance concerts for the USAFFE (USA Forces in the Far East), and tried soliciting funds in the US for an arts center in Manila. One of Dubsky&rsquo;s dancers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Cora Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a>, attributes to her the gift of drawing out dance potentials from athletes and amateurs to elicit inspired performances. Those she trained include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2569\">Ricardo Reyes</a> and Lucio Sandoval (both known as &ldquo;Mr. Folk Dancer&rdquo;); playwright <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a>; and dancers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2572\">Adina Rigor-Ferrer</a>, Maggie Shea, and Villanueva-Pi&ntilde;on. Others danced for her, like de Oteyza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2467\">Felix-Velarde</a>, Merino-Santos, and Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa who came from the Adameit and other schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila Ballet Moderne&rsquo;s prewar seasons were linked to the Metropolitan Theater story, a dream of Mayor Tomas Earnshaw. It was designed by architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>. The &ldquo;Met&rdquo; was done in the art nouveau style, its interior featured the Filipino flora&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5369\">A. V. H. Hartendorp</a> hailed its pinnacles as &ldquo;a tiara of &hellip; minarets&rdquo; that fly &ldquo;on wings of song&rdquo; (after Mendelssohn). The foyer had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">murals</a> <strong><em>Sayaw</em></strong> (Dance) and <strong><em><strong>Awit</strong></em></strong> (Song) (Laconico-Buenaventura 2010, 113-14, 118-19). Before and during the war time, the Metropolitan Theater hosted the dance productions of Adameit (after MGOH), Orosa-Goquingco, Szilard, and Dubsky. In the war time, it continued to serve as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">venue</a> for both concerts and operas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time saw a consolidation of Filipino artistry in these forms, including that of several composers. There were also dramatic presentations that helped nurture the rise of Filipino actors and playwrights. During the Commonwealth, Pres Manuel L. Quezon espoused the policy of&nbsp;<em>Filipinizar a los Filipinos&nbsp;</em>or &ldquo;Filipinize the Filipinos&rdquo; (Laconico-Buenaventura 2010, 128). The war did not stop the activity of dancers of local and visiting variety troupes, mostly appearing at the Met. These shows came to be paired with the showing of films that increasingly came to Filipino hands. In 1939, the Marcus Follies (supposed to have followed Ziegfeld&rsquo;s on Broadway) brought in 80 variety artists who stayed on for a month&rsquo;s showing. Among the hits were numbers <strong><em>Under the Sea</em></strong> that had a 25-foot dive, and &ldquo;an eye-popping fan dance performed with real ostrich feathers from South Africa.&rdquo; In 1941, there was a novelty act with the dancer-impersonator Alfred Stebel who imitated a ballerina, a hula-girl, and the witty comic idol in Mae West. The Japanese authorities brought in their own revues to entertain their soldiers. In 1942, they had Namiki Mitoko singing Japanese and Latin songs, and Namimi Satoye rendering a Spanish dance. A chorus line had a &ldquo;hot <strong>rhumba</strong>&rdquo; that changed everyone&rsquo;s idea about the &ldquo;ever bowing and gentle kimonoed Haponesa,&rdquo; now replaced by a &ldquo;pert, modern Japanese girl&rdquo; (Laconico-Buenaventura 2010, 131-34, 161).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Met, the Japanese period allowed Filipino talents from schools and stages to sustain presentations. Many rose to the challenges of both <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/56/484\">acting</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/56/493\">playwriting</a>. At the same time, many women went into social work. Based at the Met, the Volunteer Social Aid Committee (VSAC) served Filipino and American prisoners in feeding, nursing, and entertaining. In 1943 and 1944, they staged benefit shows, and often sponsored the presentations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2908\">Dramatic Philippines</a> and Music Philippines. Among the VSAC members who were in ballet were Ma Teresa Escoda Roxas, Chona Recto, and the sisters Totoy and Maitos de Oteyza. After the war, two of their members, Helen Benitez and Conchita Sunico, were awarded the Philippines&rsquo; Legion of Honor. Cristina Laconico-Buenaventura reports that when one was asked to join VSAC, &ldquo;No one &hellip; ever said no&rdquo; (Laconico-Buenaventura 2010, 169).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"folkandsocialdance\" name=\"folkandsocialdance\"></a>Folk and Social Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1930s saw the blossoming of nationalism in dance. UP president Jorge Bocobo sent out to the field folk dancer Francisca Reyes (later Tolentino, then Aquino), musician <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, and photographer Ramon Tolentino to do research in Philippine folk dance and music. The work officially started in 1937, but earlier Reyes had already initiated research work as a student. Consequently, this project became her lifetime work. The team scoured the countryside, low and high lands, on foot and in bancas to find those dances and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">document</a> them in musical scores and verbal directions. In 1927, New York publisher Silver Burdett and Company published <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dance and Games</em></strong> (coauthored with Petrona Ramos), and delayed by the war, <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong> in 1946. Now known as Mrs Serafin Aquino or &ldquo;Mrs Aqui,&rdquo; she went on to publish her monumental work with the six-volume <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances</em></strong> that came between 1950 and 1976. All became the &ldquo;bible of folk dances&rdquo; used in the physical education curriculum. It cannot be ascertained whether the dances in the postwar books were in fact researched on before or after the war. To maintain the incentives in folk dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">research</a>, Aquino formed in 1949 the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society (PFDS)</a> which has extended her influence to this day. Beyond research, Aquino also espoused the perpetuation of folk songs and dances in performance. In 1937, she organized the University of the Philippines Folk Song and Dance Club that toured Luzon and the Visayas. Hindered by the war, this came to a halt. Yet in those years she staged folk dances for the stage shows in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">cinema houses</a>. Her dancer Paz Cielo-Belmonte also did the same in the productions of Climaco in State Theater and of Poe in Avenue Theater. Right after the war in 1945, Aquino formed the Filipiniana Dance Troupe to entertain active American and Filipino forces. Ever a guiding spirit in Philippine dance, Aquino was the first in dance to be named National Artist in 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reflecting the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social dances</a> from the Spanish to the American times, the PFDS continues to document dances for its annual workshops and its eight-volume <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/18\"><strong><em>Sayaw</em></strong></a>. Among those identified to have lived on through the American period is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros</strong></a> (from lancers) which quadrille formation is equivalent to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon</strong></a> (from the French <strong>rigaudon</strong>). The lanceros was originally popular for 50 years in England. Philippine variations are found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de Lingayen</strong></a> in Pangasinan, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de Negros</strong></a> in the Visayas. The <strong>ba-ingles</strong> (from&nbsp;<em>baile&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ingles</em>) has similar formations, and according to Aquino it was first brought in by the early English traders. A variation has survived in Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, danced in peasant clothes and embellished with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong>kumintang</strong></a> (wrist-circling) gesture. Using more formal gowns like in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> or <strong>maria clara</strong>, the <strong>birginia</strong> is thought of as from the Virginia reel in US, as it reels in and out in the final figure called <strong>caracol</strong>, a spiral pattern. At the same time, the earlier Hispanic dances like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\">jota</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\">balse</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo</strong></a> prevailed as the most popular of social dances, some of them integrated in the sarsuwela performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From those and earlier times, and persisting to this day, are Christian-related <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dances</a> of the folk, like the adapted pandango in Obando, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>bati</strong></a> in the&nbsp;<em>salubong&nbsp;</em>in Antipolo, <strong>turumba</strong> in Laguna, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>subli</strong></a> in Batangas, <strong>sinulog</strong> in Cebu and parts of the Visayas, <strong>gapnod</strong> in Negros Oriental, <strong>ati-atihan</strong> in Aklan, <strong>sanghiyang</strong> in Cavite, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/82\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> in Bicol. This is not to speak of the innumerable non-Christian ritual dances that are meant to propitiate the&nbsp;<em>encantos&nbsp;</em>and other spirits that subsist among the numerous ethnic groups through the islands (Obusan 1994).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American colonialism drastically changed Philippine social life. While the folk continued to dance their versions of the Hispanic jota and pandanggo in the towns and barrios, the urban public tried out the fashionable foreign dances in cabarets, locally called&nbsp;<em>kabaret</em>.&nbsp;At first, a &ldquo;color line&rdquo; separated Caucasians from Malay Filipinos, but Nick Joaquin (whose brother was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">band</a> musician) tells how Manuel L. Quezon and Gov-Gen Francis Burton Harrison broke the line by dancing across it. The most famous cabarets were in Santa Ana (advertised as the biggest dance-floor in the world), Maypajo in Tondo, La Loma in Santa Cruz, and the Rainbow in San Juan del Monte. They hosted floor shows, like the&nbsp;<em>carioca&nbsp;</em>in the style of film&nbsp;stars Astaire and Rogers. With the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1935, there were fireworks in Luneta, balls, and a floor show with Carmen &ldquo;Miami&rdquo; Salvador, Bayani Casimiro&mdash;the Fred Astaire of the Philippines, and the Diaz Sisters at the Santa Ana. Right up until the 1950s and 1960s, there were still cabarets in the small towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the dancing clubs, there were many dancing schools and grand balls at the Oriente Hotel. Rich Chinese, like the Palancas, threw balls of their own. Elite social clubs like the Mancommunidad, Smiles, Kahirup, and Club Filipino held their own affairs with social dancing. The musical and dance rages were the <strong>ragtime</strong> and cakewalk. Holdovers from the previous century were the can-can, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera</strong></a>, <strong>square dance</strong>, and the <strong>two-step</strong>. The first years of the century saw a dizzying array of dances: the <strong>boston</strong>, <strong>bunny hug</strong>, <strong>camel walk</strong>, <strong>crab</strong>, <strong>fish tail</strong>, <strong>grizzly bear</strong>, <strong>maxixe</strong>, <strong>one-step</strong>, <strong>slow drag</strong>, <strong>tango</strong>, <strong>veleta</strong>, <strong>turkey trot</strong>, and other dances named after animals. There were also new-fangled <strong>fox-trot</strong> and <strong>lindy hop</strong> in the 1920s; the rhumba, charleston, <strong>black bottom</strong>, <strong>shimmy</strong>, <strong>variety drag</strong>, and <strong>quickstep</strong> in the 1930s; and the <strong>beguine</strong>, <strong>big-apple</strong>, <strong>hokey-pokey</strong>, <strong>jitterbug</strong>, <strong>lambeth walk</strong>, <strong>conga</strong>, <strong>paso doble</strong>, and the <strong>samba</strong> in the 1940s. The list shows a lot coming from the Caribbean and the black population cultures, reflecting their unrestrained and infectious feeling. Yet the idols of the day were the urbane Irene and Vernon Castle for their class and elan, and the astute Astaire and Rogers for their agility and panache&mdash;seen in the last Hollywood couple&rsquo;s song and dance films. From the beginning of the American period, many ballroom-dancing schools were advertised, and many were still operating in Quiapo until the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish dance in both flamenco and folk forms continued to live through American times. Many like Conchita Sotelo taught the versatile Merino-Santos. Santos&rsquo;s ballet contemporaries, like Mitos Sison and Chloe Cruz Romulo, also turned to Spanish dance. Another exponent in Manolo Rosado also turned to modern dance, but he combined these while dancing in Europe and Mexico. The younger <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2546\">Ruben Nieto</a> studied flamenco here and abroad, and was a dancer on stage and in films. Nieto&rsquo;s influence remains in his postwar partner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a>. Another maestro in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2481\">Guillermo Gomez</a> said that his own mother was coached by the famous Antonia Merce, known as La Argentina, when she came before the war. Beyond her Spanish repertoire, La Argentina also danced the cari&ntilde;osa, a version of the pandanggo and <strong>binasuan</strong>, and thus introduced these Filipino dances to the world (Gomez 1994). Gomez also acknowledges the long work of Portuguese Jose Zarah with Bebe Marcaida into the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine ties forged with the United States lasted beyond 1946 when independence was gained. From culture to governance, these ties were not soon rescinded due to forces of economic circumstance and political dominance. At the same time, Filipinos adapted and modified cultural influences to suit their own lives and needs. Imaginative Filipino artists who studied abroad came back to assert their own specific idioms and identities, leading others at home to find their own modes of expression. The restriction against American films in World War II and Japan&rsquo;s stress on Asian identity made the Filipinos capitalize on their own modes of cultural expression. Examples were how the American vaudeville was transformed into the Filipino bodabil, and how the regional folk dances documented by Francisca Reyes-Aquino became part of the stage presentations in schools and movie houses. These stage adaptations of folk dance continued in dramatized stylization as scripted by Orosa-Goquingco. This transformation may have been earlier hinted at by her teacher Adameit. All these Philippine encounters with the world have effects on the life of the contemporary Filipino, and on the course and discourse in dance to this day. The forms of expression brought in by both American and Asian colonial experiences were transformed in form and content by the inventiveness and creative imagination of the Filipino people. Whatever forms of adaptation and translation emerged, these transformations came out as identifiably and meaningfully Filipino. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

In May, Cmdre George Dewey of the United States sailed across the Pacific to subdue the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. But even after the surrender of the Spanish to the Americans, the latter did not leave, having decided to buy the islands from Spain for 20 million dollars. As a result, the new country was embroiled again in the ensuing Philippine-American War, which officially ended in 1901, with the beginning of the American colonial period."

And to hasten the Americanization of the Filipinos, the American colonial government sent&#xA0;<em>pensionados&#xA0;</em>(Filipino pensioners or scholars) to the United States to train in American universities. On the other hand, American popular culture was propagated all over the islands by the theatrical form called &#x201C;<a href=\"/6/46/46\">vaudeville</a>,&#x201D; later Filipinized to <a href=\"/6/46/46\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, which showcased American popular dances, songs, and comic acts.

Earlier stars, like <a href=\"/7/7/2936\">Praxedes &#x201C;Yeyeng&#x201D; Fernandez</a> who was noted for her <strong>tango</strong> and <strong>can-can</strong>, <a href=\"/7/7/3276\">Patrocinio Tagaroma</a> who married comedian <a href=\"/7/60/2823\">Jose Carvajal</a>, and their daughter <a href=\"/4/26/4320\">Patrocinio Carvajal</a> who was called a &#x201C;Diosa de Baile&#x201D; by <a href=\"/9/9/5797\">Flavio Zaragosa Cano</a>, still appeared in Teatro del Oriente in Compania de Zarzuela Comico-Lirica. But the Spanish zarzuela was swiftly being replaced by the native&#xA0;<em>sarsuwela&#xA0;</em>in <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, and Hiligaynon. Most prominent examples of the Tagalog sarsuwela were <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1902, by <a href=\"/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>; <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/582\"><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></a></em></strong> (The Flirt), 1926, by <a href=\"/7/7/2888\">Servando de los Angeles</a>; and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), 1919, by <a href=\"/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and composer <a href=\"/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>. With the sarsuwela&#x2019;s plot and music came dances like balitaw and balse. Active theaters in Manila were the Zorrilla, Filipino, Nacional, Universal, Oriente, Paz, Libertad, and Sirena. Like the komedya, the sarsuwela was deployed to the regions, especially at fiestas. Due to the sarsuwela&#x2019;s popularity, sarsuwela-type films were made, such as <strong><em><a href=\"/4/24/1261\"><strong><strong>Pakiusap</strong></strong></a> </em></strong> (Plea), <strong><em><a href=\"/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a> </em></strong> (Real Mother), <strong><em><a href=\"/4/24/1125\"><strong><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></strong></a> </em></strong> (Beautiful Star), and <strong><em><a href=\"/4/24/1169\"><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></a> </em></strong> (My Love), all with singing and dancing."

The local bodabil saw dancing in <a href=\"/8/64/1372\">variety shows</a>. Its origin is in the American vaudeville gestated from songs in Normandy, France, later popularized as theater in the United States. Consequently, this was also propagated in the Philippines. It catered to both Filipinos and American expatriates. Minstrel troupes (typically with blacks, and whites putting on black make-up) sailed across the Pacific. They featured popular music, the <strong>buck-and-wing</strong> and <strong>clog</strong> or <a href=\"/6/46/104\"><strong>tap</strong></a> dancing (of Irish or African origin), <strong>soft-shoe</strong>, and straight-forward <a href=\"/5/35/779\">jazz and blues</a> musical genres. Made famous in the United States, this variety show was called <strong>vod-a-vil</strong> by Cebuano jazz pianist <a href=\"/5/42/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a>. Eventually, it was known as bodabil."

All these enthralled audiences at the Zorrilla, Libertad, Paz (formerly Orpheum), Filipino, Alhambra, and Cosmopolitan.

He lost money and ended up working for the famous Lou Borromeo. Meanwhile, Brown formed a group at the Lux and also produced shows at the Rivoli and Savoy.

She must have imitated the American Loie Fuller (1862-1926), so celebrated at the Paris Folies-Bergere that they built a theater for her at the 1900 Paris World Fair (Horst Koegler 1982, 166). Fuller turned the skirt-dance into a spectacle with her own <a href=\"/6/47/29\">costumes and lighting design</a>. A contemporary of Isadora Duncan, she was celebrated in the art nouveauor new art of the time. From Fuller&#x2019;s <strong><em>Serpentine Dance</em></strong> and <strong><em>Fire Dance</em></strong>, Delroy might have derived her own <strong><em>The Fire of Life</em></strong>. It was probably based on the English Rider Haggard&#x2019;s orientalist novel <strong><em>She</em></strong>. This was well received at the Zorrilla in 1900. The then current fashionable orientalism was pervasive, like depicting Salome in Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s play and Richard Strauss&#x2019;s <a href=\"/5/35/786\">opera</a>&#x2014;the composer casting <a href=\"/5/42/3991\">Jovita Fuentes</a> as Salome. For her part, prima ballerina Anna Pavlova portrayed Asian deities with the Indian dancer Uday Shankar (Mukhopadhyay 2004, 16-21)."

Before coming to Manila, Dubsky appeared with the noted German modern dancer Harald Kreutzberg, and in the famous Max Reinhardt productions in Berlin. For a time she taught for the Vienna State Academy and choreographed for the Camargo Society that helped usher in the solid foundation of ballet in Britain.

With Zipper&#x2019;s support, Dubsky formed the Manila Ballet Moderne that ran annual productions at the MGOH between 1939 and 1941. Dubsky was intensely prolific, producing numerous works all in those seasons. She produced <strong><em>Petite Suite&#x2014;Au Bord de la Seine</em></strong> (Little Suite&#x2014;of the Seine) to Debussy, <strong><em>The Iron Foundry</em></strong> to Mossolow, <strong><em>Peer Gynt Suite</em></strong> to Grieg, <strong><em>Voices of Spring</em></strong> to Strauss, <strong><em><a href=\"/6/49/181\"><strong>Pictures at an Exhibition</strong></a></em></strong> to Moussorgsky, <strong><em>Polovestsky Dances</em></strong> to Borodin (from his opera <strong><em>Prince Igor</em></strong>), <strong><em>The Toy Box</em></strong> to Schubert, and <strong><em>The Women of Arles</em></strong> to Bizet.

Many rose to the challenges of both <a href=\"/7/56/484\">acting</a> and <a href=\"/7/56/493\">playwriting</a>. At the same time, many women went into social work. Based at the Met, the Volunteer Social Aid Committee (VSAC) served Filipino and American prisoners in feeding, nursing, and entertaining. In 1943 and 1944, they staged benefit shows, and often sponsored the presentations of <a href=\"/7/7/2908\">Dramatic Philippines</a> and Music Philippines. Among the VSAC members who were in ballet were Ma Teresa Escoda Roxas, Chona Recto, and the sisters Totoy and Maitos de Oteyza. After the war, two of their members, Helen Benitez and Conchita Sunico, were awarded the Philippines&#x2019; Legion of Honor. Cristina Laconico-Buenaventura reports that when one was asked to join VSAC, &#x201C;No one &#x2026; ever said no&#x201D; (Laconico-Buenaventura 2010, 169)."

				"value": "The 1930s saw the blossoming of nationalism in dance. UP president Jorge Bocobo sent out to the field folk dancer Francisca Reyes (later Tolentino, then Aquino), musician <a href=\"/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, and photographer Ramon Tolentino to do research in Philippine folk dance and music. The work officially started in 1937, but earlier Reyes had already initiated research work as a student. Consequently, this project became her lifetime work. The team scoured the countryside, low and high lands, on foot and in bancas to find those dances and <a href=\"/6/47/32\">document</a> them in musical scores and verbal directions. In 1927, New York publisher Silver Burdett and Company published <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dance and Games</em></strong> (coauthored with Petrona Ramos), and delayed by the war, <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong> in 1946. Now known as Mrs Serafin Aquino or &#x201C;Mrs Aqui,&#x201D; she went on to publish her monumental work with the six-volume <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances</em></strong> that came between 1950 and 1976. All became the &#x201C;bible of folk dances&#x201D; used in the physical education curriculum. It cannot be ascertained whether the dances in the postwar books were in fact researched on before or after the war. To maintain the incentives in folk dance <a href=\"/6/47/32\">research</a>, Aquino formed in 1949 the <a href=\"/6/51/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society (PFDS)</a> which has extended her influence to this day. Beyond research, Aquino also espoused the perpetuation of folk songs and dances in performance. In 1937, she organized the University of the Philippines Folk Song and Dance Club that toured Luzon and the Visayas. Hindered by the war, this came to a halt. Yet in those years she staged folk dances for the stage shows in <a href=\"/2/5/245\">cinema houses</a>. Her dancer Paz Cielo-Belmonte also did the same in the productions of Climaco in State Theater and of Poe in Avenue Theater. Right after the war in 1945, Aquino formed the Filipiniana Dance Troupe to entertain active American and Filipino forces. Ever a guiding spirit in Philippine dance, Aquino was the first in dance to be named National Artist in 1973."

Among those identified to have lived on through the American period is the <a href=\"/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros</strong></a> (from lancers) which quadrille formation is equivalent to the <a href=\"/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon</strong></a> (from the French <strong>rigaudon</strong>). The lanceros was originally popular for 50 years in England. Philippine variations are found in the <a href=\"/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de Lingayen</strong></a> in Pangasinan, and the <a href=\"/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros de Negros</strong></a> in the Visayas. The <strong>ba-ingles</strong> (from&#xA0;<em>baile&#xA0;</em>and&#xA0;<em>Ingles</em>) has similar formations, and according to Aquino it was first brought in by the early English traders. A variation has survived in Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, danced in peasant clothes and embellished with the <a href=\"/6/46/64\"><strong>kumintang</strong></a> (wrist-circling) gesture. Using more formal gowns like in the <a href=\"/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> or <strong>maria clara</strong>, the <strong>birginia</strong> is thought of as from the Virginia reel in US, as it reels in and out in the final figure called <strong>caracol</strong>, a spiral pattern. At the same time, the earlier Hispanic dances like the <a href=\"/6/46/62\">jota</a>, <a href=\"/6/46/38\">balse</a>, and <a href=\"/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo</strong></a> prevailed as the most popular of social dances, some of them integrated in the sarsuwela performances."

While the folk continued to dance their versions of the Hispanic jota and pandanggo in the towns and barrios, the urban public tried out the fashionable foreign dances in cabarets, locally called&#xA0;<em>kabaret</em>.&#xA0;At first, a &#x201C;color line&#x201D; separated Caucasians from Malay Filipinos, but Nick Joaquin (whose brother was a <a href=\"/5/36/800\">band</a> musician) tells how Manuel L. Quezon and Gov-Gen Francis Burton Harrison broke the line by dancing across it. The most famous cabarets were in Santa Ana (advertised as the biggest dance-floor in the world), Maypajo in Tondo, La Loma in Santa Cruz, and the Rainbow in San Juan del Monte. They hosted floor shows, like the&#xA0;<em>carioca&#xA0;</em>in the style of film&#xA0;stars Astaire and Rogers. With the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1935, there were fireworks in Luneta, balls, and a floor show with Carmen &#x201C;Miami&#x201D; Salvador, Bayani Casimiro&#x2014;the Fred Astaire of the Philippines, and the Diaz Sisters at the Santa Ana. Right up until the 1950s and 1960s, there were still cabarets in the small towns."

Elite social clubs like the Mancommunidad, Smiles, Kahirup, and Club Filipino held their own affairs with social dancing. The musical and dance rages were the <strong>ragtime</strong> and cakewalk. Holdovers from the previous century were the can-can, <a href=\"/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera</strong></a>, <strong>square dance</strong>, and the <strong>two-step</strong>. The first years of the century saw a dizzying array of dances: the <strong>boston</strong>, <strong>bunny hug</strong>, <strong>camel walk</strong>, <strong>crab</strong>, <strong>fish tail</strong>, <strong>grizzly bear</strong>, <strong>maxixe</strong>, <strong>one-step</strong>, <strong>slow drag</strong>, <strong>tango</strong>, <strong>veleta</strong>, <strong>turkey trot</strong>, and other dances named after animals. There were also new-fangled <strong>fox-trot</strong> and <strong>lindy hop</strong> in the 1920s; the rhumba, charleston, <strong>black bottom</strong>, <strong>shimmy</strong>, <strong>variety drag</strong>, and <strong>quickstep</strong> in the 1930s; and the <strong>beguine</strong>, <strong>big-apple</strong>, <strong>hokey-pokey</strong>, <strong>jitterbug</strong>, <strong>lambeth walk</strong>, <strong>conga</strong>, <strong>paso doble</strong>, and the <strong>samba</strong> in the 1940s. The list shows a lot coming from the Caribbean and the black population cultures, reflecting their unrestrained and infectious feeling. Yet the idols of the day were the urbane Irene and Vernon Castle for their class and elan, and the astute Astaire and Rogers for their agility and panache&#x2014;seen in the last Hollywood couple&#x2019;s song and dance films. From the beginning of the American period, many ballroom-dancing schools were advertised, and many were still operating in Quiapo until the 1960s."

Another exponent in Manolo Rosado also turned to modern dance, but he combined these while dancing in Europe and Mexico.

Another maestro in <a href=\"/6/6/2481\">Guillermo Gomez</a> said that his own mother was coached by the famous Antonia Merce, known as La Argentina, when she came before the war. Beyond her Spanish repertoire, La Argentina also danced the cari&#xF1;osa, a version of the pandanggo and <strong>binasuan</strong>, and thus introduced these Filipino dances to the world (Gomez 1994). Gomez also acknowledges the long work of Portuguese Jose Zarah with Bebe Marcaida into the 1960s."

				"value": "The Philippine ties forged with the United States lasted beyond 1946 when independence was gained. From culture to governance, these ties were not soon rescinded due to forces of economic circumstance and political dominance. At the same time, Filipinos adapted and modified cultural influences to suit their own lives and needs. Imaginative Filipino artists who studied abroad came back to assert their own specific idioms and identities, leading others at home to find their own modes of expression. The restriction against American films in World War II and Japan&#x2019;s stress on Asian identity made the Filipinos capitalize on their own modes of cultural expression. Examples were how the American vaudeville was transformed into the Filipino bodabil, and how the regional folk dances documented by Francisca Reyes-Aquino became part of the stage presentations in schools and movie houses. These stage adaptations of folk dance continued in dramatized stylization as scripted by Orosa-Goquingco. This transformation may have been earlier hinted at by her teacher Adameit. All these Philippine encounters with the world have effects on the life of the contemporary Filipino, and on the course and discourse in dance to this day. The forms of expression brought in by both American and Asian colonial experiences were transformed in form and content by the inventiveness and creative imagination of the Filipino people. Whatever forms of adaptation and translation emerged, these transformations came out as identifiably and meaningfully Filipino. <strong><span class>&#xA0;</span></strong>"

During this period, American influence in the country&rsquo;s political, cultural, and socioeconomic landscape continued to permeate every aspect of Philippine life. Neocolonial control was evident in trade and military pacts, signed to secure the Republic&rsquo;s dependence on its former colonizer (Guillermo 1999, 201). As a result, the country&rsquo;s aim to attain actual development and freedom was hampered by the economic structure characterized by the iniquitous relations between the former liberator and its newly-liberated colony (Doronila 1992, 174).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from socioeconomic and political control, it was necessary for Americans to colonize culture by propagating their influence through media and education. The Fulbright scholarship, an education exchange program which replaced the earlier&nbsp;<em>pensionado&nbsp;</em>system, ensured the Americanization of the country&rsquo;s educated class. At the height of the program in the 1950s, practically all Filipino artists and academics were given scholarships and lecture grants in American universities, subjecting them to &ldquo;cultural campaign&rdquo; through immersion in American society. As a result, the Filipino artist&rsquo;s creative and scholarly output can largely be evaluated in terms of &ldquo;keeping up with artistic trend in the United States and elsewhere in the West&rdquo; (Lumbera 1997, 181-82). In the 1950s, notable dancers who received scholarships to study abroad were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a> as a Fulbright scholar in 1959; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2566\">Benjamin Villanueva Reyes</a> who studied in New York through the sponsorship of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2424\">Ricardo Cassell</a>, Manila Music Lovers Society, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3877\">Asociacion Musical de Filipinas</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2511\">Felicitas Layag-Radaic</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a> through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2475\">Israel Gabriel</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2515\">Antonio Llacer</a> on full scholarships at different <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">schools</a> in the United States; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2467\">Joji Felix-Velarde</a> at Ballet Rambert School in London and Ballet Art Studio in New York through the support of British dancer and choreographer Alicia Markova.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Filipinos did not only seek <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">dance education</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/9\">influences</a> outside, but also received performances from the West. The Philippines enjoyed various shows in ballet, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\">modern dance</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> from international dance troupes such as the Royal Ballets of London and Copenhagen, the New York City Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet, and the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Kirov, Bolshoi, and Perm, and the folkloric ensembles, which visited the country from the 1950s to the 1970s. Moreover, famous foreign dancers and choreographers such as New Zealand-born <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2503\">Anita Kane</a>, Polish <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2384\">Luva Adameit</a>, American couple <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2424\">Roberta and Ricardo Cassell</a>, Hungarian exile <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2602\">Paul Szilard</a>, and Austrians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2453\">Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</a> and Kathie Hauser all contributed to the development of ballet, modern dance, and theatrical dance forms in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the late 1950s to the 1970s, Broadway <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>, which showcased theatrical and dance performances for live <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">audiences</a>, were adapted into movies. Famous musicals such as <strong><em>Showboat</em></strong> and <strong><em>King and I</em></strong>, 1951, <strong><em>Peter Pan</em></strong>, 1954, <strong><em>Oklahoma</em></strong>, 1955, <strong><em>Carousel</em></strong>, 1956, <strong><em>West Side Story </em></strong> and <strong><em>Cinderella</em></strong>, 1957, <strong><em>Gigi</em></strong> and <strong><em>Flower Drum Song</em></strong>, 1958, <strong><em>Wildcat</em></strong>, 1960, and <strong><em>Man of La Mancha</em></strong>, 1965, were made into films, and thereby also reached a wider audience. The rise of mass media in the West, thus, facilitated the entry of colonial imports in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1953, the Philippines had the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1339\">first television station</a> in Asia (Enriquez 1998, 35). Colonial mentality, especially with the expansion of eight television channels and their affiliated radio stations in the 1960s, was quickly disseminated through importation of foreign films and adaptation of American entertainment format (Ables 2003, 33). In 1955, there were about 6,000 television sets all over the country, which quickly increased with the introduction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1342\">colored broadcasting</a> in 1966. These developments in media technology paved the way for television to become one of the most influential sources of entertainment in the country (del Mundo Jr 1998, 400).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With TV entertainment, Filipinos soon yearned for American dance rhythms through the introduction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/46\"><strong>bodabil&nbsp;</strong><strong>dancing</strong></a>, <strong>ballet</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>modern dance</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\"><strong>social dance</strong></a>. Television dancing, in particular, gained following as dances were featured extensively on TV shows presented in a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1372\">variety show</a> format, a remnant characteristic of bodabil shows which faded in the 1960s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2498\">Dance Company</a> was the first to present group dancing on TV through its performance on <strong><em>Caltex Star Caravan</em></strong> in 1960 (Castro 1994, 214).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, well-known choreographers like Alice Reyes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2563\">Al Quinn</a>, Julie Borromeo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2421\">Lito Calzado</a>, and the Aldeguer Sisters worked behind the dance scenes of popular TV shows in the 1960s and 1970s such as <strong><em>The Lyn Madrigal Show</em></strong>, <strong><em>Superstar with <strong>Nora Aunor</strong></em></strong>, <strong><em>Friday Variety Show</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pilita Corales Show</em></strong>, <strong><em>That Young Image</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Tancho Tique Show Generation</em></strong>. In the previous decade, the audience already revered the performances on TV characterized by quick movement and increased dance dynamics of American dances, such as <strong>boogie woogie</strong> and <strong>rock n&rsquo; roll</strong>. Dance fads of the period such as <strong>mashed potato</strong>, <strong>twist</strong>, <strong>boogaloo</strong>, <strong>bossa nova</strong>, <strong>frug</strong>, <strong>pachanga</strong>, <strong>watusi</strong>, and <strong>hustle</strong> were popularized and taught in the hit television show, <strong><em>Dance Time with Chito</em></strong> (Villaruz 1994, 76).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite the trend of what seems like a &ldquo;passive colonial importation&rdquo; of American dances, there was also a nationalist move &ldquo;to bring out in art the long dominated indigenous cultures&rdquo; by presenting Philippine dances to a wider audience in both local and international stage (Guillermo 1998, 276). The revival of national consciousness against the neocolonial backdrop of the 1950s and 1960s was demonstrated through the success of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2468\">Filipinescas Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2612\">University of the East Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2614\">UP Filipiniana Dance Group</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2514\">Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</a> (Cortes et al. 2000, 391).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exportation of indigenous dance forms and cultural performances abroad signified not only growing internationalization, but also the awakening of nationalist sensibilities of Filipino as well as foreign dance teachers and choreographers in the country. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a>, Rosalia Merino-Santos, and Alice Reyes utilized Western dance forms such as ballet and modern dance to express folkloric themes and style. Thus, the 1960s and 1970s witnessed the influence of Philippine folk dance on ballet and modern dance (Corpus 2007, 108).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Philippine dance scene flourished, national and private cultural institutions awarded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/25\">grants and scholarships</a> to groups or individual dancers who excelled in the art form. There were venue grants for stage presentations and travel grants for group representation in international competitions. These grants, privately or publicly funded, ensured that dancers and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">dance companies</a> were supported either to impart their experiences from abroad or to make their mark outside the country (Villaruz 1994, 116).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the trend to express what was Filipino in dance arose, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">spaces</a> for cultural performances emerged to reach a wider audience through the construction of new venues such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2931\">FEU Auditorium</a> built in 1949, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a> in 1960, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/358\">Philam Life Auditorium</a> in 1961, the New Frontier Theater in 1968, and the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> in 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance, within the 26-year period of the Republic, reflected the paradoxes of neocolonial experiences of Filipinos who, on one hand, accommodated Western influences in the art form and, on the other, transformed these influences to project Filipino identity in the international landscape of dance. The nationalist projection of native dances on the international stage and the utilization of foreign dance forms to express native sensibilities reflected the country&rsquo;s longing to be recognized by both its own people and foreigners as having a distinct and rich dance culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, Philippine dance during the neocolonial period was vibrant in local adaptations of foreign dance forms, cultural importations from the West, and fusion of foreign and local dance forms. Indeed, as American neocolonial ideology was shaping the Philippine dance landscape, Filipino artists and performers were also seeking to shape dance with a Philippine cultural mold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"danceintheater\" name=\"danceintheater\"></a>Dance in Theater</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the lingering effect of American colonization, traces of Spanish influence in Philippine performing arts continued to thrive during the neocolonial period. The&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a>&nbsp;</em>in Tagalog and in other Philippine languages such as Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Bicolano, and Pampango were still performed in urban areas and in the provinces. Sarsuwela dancing included traditional dances such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/38\"><strong>balse</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka</strong></a> but also incorporated American dances like the <strong>fox-trot</strong>, <strong>cha-cha</strong> and <strong>boogie</strong>. With the rise of films in the 1950s, sarsuwela migrated into cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same transition from stage to film happened to&nbsp;<em>bodabil&nbsp;</em>and stage show, which remained popular after the war. Initially, bodabil was shown alternately with movies in Manila. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">Bodabil</a>, which featured songs, dance performances, and comedy skits, eventually replaced the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a> and sarsuwela. Bodabil shows were presented at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House (MGOH)</a> in Rizal Avenue and Clover Theater (previously called the Savoy) in Santa Cruz, Manila. The form continued to adopt popular trends in post-World War II American dances, such as <strong>mambo</strong>, <strong> cha-cha</strong>, and <strong>bossa nova</strong>, as well as popular dance styles of the period which included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/104\"><strong>tap</strong></a>, <strong>soft-shoe</strong>, <strong>can-can</strong>, <strong>apache</strong>, and <strong>adagio dancing</strong> (Villaruz 1989, 17-18).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodabil&rsquo;s established traditions lived on to the 1950s and 1960s. The theatrical genre was perpetuated by performers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a> and Nieves Manuel, partners dubbed as the &ldquo;Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of the Philippines.&rdquo; Other dancers were Paquito Bolero and Angelita &ldquo;Rhumba&rdquo; Rey, the Rusca Brothers who were known as the &ldquo;tap-dancing wizards,&rdquo; Dandy the &ldquo;tap-dancing expert&rdquo; who became the comedian Casmot, Millie Sparks aka Lopita, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4251\">Rosa Aguirre</a>, and Metring David. Comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\">Chichay</a> and Patsy both started as chorus girls, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a> were remarkable dancers. Much later came <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4744\">Ramon Zamora</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4275\">Jun Aristorenas</a> who both became <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1059\">action</a> movie stars. Lasting long as dancers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2591\">Shirley Santos</a>, Marie Cui, Arturo Zamora, and Aldo Joingco. The dancers who grew to be well-known choreographers for the stage shows, musicals or movies were &ldquo;Jun&rdquo; Salvador, Jake (or Jack) Jacinto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2391\">Jamin Alcoriza</a>, and Al Quinn (Pangan, 1979). In 1953, the life in the bodabil stage was captured in the film <strong><em>Vod-a-vil</em></strong> which starred its well-known performers such as Bayani Casimiro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>, and Jose De Villa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from local performers, there were also foreign performers on the bodabil stage such as British dancers and choreographers Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin, who visited the country with the Far Eastern Entertainment for the <strong><em>Fil-American Variety Show</em></strong> in 1948; American dancer, choreographer, educator, and social activist Katherine Dunham who performed with her company in 1957; and famous Spanish dancer and choreographer Luis Perez Davila known as &ldquo;Luisillo&rdquo; who graced the bodabil stage in 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When bodabil declined in the 1960s, theaters like Inday and Art featured burlesque dancing in <strong>haba-haba</strong> shows, an unsavory term for bodabil. The haba-haba, which was performed at the Alegria or the MGOH, featured less singing and dancing and more parading of women in skimpy clothes for &ldquo;fashion shows.&rdquo; Burlesque shows, housed in dodgy theaters such as the Gala, Cubao Cinema, and theaters near American bases in Olongapo, were later replaced by&nbsp;<em>bomba&nbsp;</em>or sex films that marked the decline of the bodabil era in the country (Fernandez 1994, 70). This went on to the 1970s in Dragon and Playboy theaters, where burlesque queens were known as Virgie Night, Betty Co, Nina White, Jenny Moh, and Carlotta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the 1960s also tried to restore the bodabil&rsquo;s prestige and popularity. The Araneta Coliseum and the New Frontier Theater (with a revolving stage) hired Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, daughter of stage show producer Jose Generoso, as choreographer-director. Many were lured to choreograph for the movie producers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4520\">LVN</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4606\">Premiere</a>. Among them were I&ntilde;igo, Alcoriza, Quinn, Rally Calvo, and flamenco dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2546\">Ruben Nieto</a>. Dancers Chichay and Dolphy became movie stars and were joined by singing-and-dancing love teams like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4418\">Tita Duran</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>. Bodabil&rsquo;s allure went on in television with its variety or stage show format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noted choreographers in those days were Quinn, Lito Calzado, Ernie Estrella, Julie Borromeo, Alice Reyes, Amelia Apolinario, and the Aldeguer Sisters Lally and Terry. There were also TV dance shows in the 1960s such as <strong><em>Dance Time with Chito</em></strong> which taught the <strong>cha-cha</strong>, <strong>mambo</strong>, <strong>twist</strong>, and <strong>bossa nova</strong>; <strong><em>Penthouse 7</em></strong> or later <strong><em>Penthouse Live</em></strong> followed up into the 1970s and 1980s. Thus, the migration of bodabil performers from stage to broadcast media spelled bodabil&rsquo;s decline on stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the sarsuwela and bodabil experienced transformations over the decades, there was another cultural phenomenon that drew the attention of Manila&rsquo;s middle and upper class&mdash;the Broadway musical. This form is considered by many to have been popularized, or perhaps even introduced to the Philippines by the American Jesuit <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3207\">Fr James B. Reuter</a> who was behind several musicals staged in Assumption San Lorenzo and St. Paul University&nbsp;Manila. For the latter, he directed <strong><em>The Sound of Music</em></strong> in 1964 featuring young performers who eventually gained prominence in either television, film, or theater. Some of them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4682\">Vic Silayan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4849\">Subas Herrero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4864\">June Keithley</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2590\">Tina Santos</a>. Unlike other musicals which became popular after their film versions were shown, <strong><em>The Sound of Music</em></strong>&rsquo;s movie version came to the Philippines after a year when Filipinos had already enjoyed its stage production. In 1965, Reuter&rsquo;s staging of <strong><em>My Fair Lady</em></strong> for Assumption San Lorenzo starred Agapito &ldquo;Butz&rdquo; Aquino, Gary Lising, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4884\">Nick Lizaso</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2434\">Chloe Cruz-Romulo</a>, Tony Manuud, and Cristina Caedo Galang. Stunning the audience was not just the astounding chandelier used for the ballroom scene, which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> &ldquo;lent&rdquo; for the duration of the production, but there were also all kinds of lavish ball outfits worn by the performers. And although the production came months after its film was released in the country, and despite its pricey tickets, Reuter&rsquo;s musical was a great success. <strong><em>Brigadoon</em></strong>, starring Aquino with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2771\">Baby Barredo</a> and Tina Santos, followed in 1966. The show impressed the audience with its Highland sword dance and the playing of bagpipes by Scotsmen in kilts outside the Fleur-de-Lis Auditorium on Herran Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind these high-quality Broadway musicals were not only talented artists who sang and danced to the audience&rsquo;s delight but also the live performance of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a>&rsquo;s Broadway musical arrangements. For years, these impressive productions provided the Filipinos with high-caliber entertainment until other companies such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a> and Julie Borromeo&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2444\">Dance Theater Philippines</a> shared the Philippine stage (Garcia 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance as an art form was not only utilized solely for entertainment but also for furthering social movements and sociopolitical goals. In the global context, the Philippines&rsquo; neocolonial period overlapped with the beginnings of the Cold War and the Cultural Revolution in China. During this tumultuous period in world history, dancing was influenced by revolutionary ideology that propagated specific goals for the movement. For instance, dances as part of the Chinese Cultural Revolution&rsquo;s propaganda were visible, such as the ballet <strong><em>Red Detachment of Women</em></strong>, 1970, that promoted the ideologies of the Communist Party (Lin 2009).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the late 1960s, the country witnessed the rise of student activism and widespread demonstrations against American imperialism and corruption in government. The founding of militant youth organizations, such as Kabataang Makabayan (KM) in 1964, heightened the political tensions between student groups and state forces during their encounters in rallies, riots, and demonstrations. Philippine art, as a result, became the battleground for youth groups to combat the State-sponsored program for art patronages that divorced the people from sociopolitical reality through its promotion of art-for-art&rsquo;s-sake aesthetics. Revolutionary artists&rsquo; organizations, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3674\">Nagkakaisang Progresibong Artista at Arkitekto</a> in 1971 and Konsehong Tagapag-ugnay ng Rebolusyonaryong Sining in 1972, were established to serve as a cultural arm of the movement (Guillermo 2001, 51). In outlining the basic premises of committed art forms, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5565\">Panulat Para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan</a> or PAKSA, a militant art group active in 1971, provided a framework to dramatize the &ldquo;three evils of Philippine contemporary society: imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism&rdquo; through the so-called new people&rsquo;s literature, music, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> (Guillermo 1987, 7). Thus, many young artists and writers of the period produced works that were &ldquo;reflective of a historical and social consciousness&rdquo; of the people through protest literature and revolutionary aesthetics (Guillermo 1993, 4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Philippine dance was incorporated in the movement&rsquo;s staging of skits, plays, and musicals, which highlighted street rallies and protests during this period of sociopolitical turmoil. With the development of proletarian theater in particular, dances were performed&mdash;together with songs, choral chants, and ensemble movement&mdash;on the streets and outdoor areas as part of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/478\">street plays</a> that confronted the ongoing struggle of the masses (Brigino et al. 2012, 131). Moreover, dances were also accompanied by marching songs during political protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Groups that used dance along with other art forms for their plays include pioneering proletarian theater groups Kamanyang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a> of Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3150\">Panday Sining</a> of KM. Kamanyang&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pakikibaka</em></strong> (Struggle), for instance, highlighted the treachery of imperialists, land owners, and the bourgeois in the dance performance &ldquo;Sayaw ng Pagtataksil&rdquo; (Dance of Betrayal) (PAKSA and NPAA Handbook 1991, 15). The Konsehong Tagapag-ugnay ng Rebolusyonaryong Sining organized several activist cultural groups such as Gintong Silahis, Sining Bayan, Kamanyang, Tanghalang Bayan, and Panday Sining and mounted <strong><em>Pest of Badway</em></strong> satirizing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">CCP</a>&rsquo;s penchant for Western musicals, in particular, the <strong><em>The Best of Broadway</em></strong>. Comprising of parodied vignettes from Broadway musicals, the performance was directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3212\">Leo Rimando</a> (Tiongson 2015; Quimpo 2012, 193). Dances and musicals choreographed by activists, thus, adhered to the themes and premise of proletarian art aimed to depict the mass campaign, the dialectical struggle in society, the triumph of mass action, and the symbolism for the movement&rsquo;s future (PAKSA and NPAA Handbook 1991, 23-25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"ballet\" name=\"ballet\"></a>Ballet</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after World War II to the 1960s, foreign ballet and Spanish groups started visiting the country. In war-torn Manila and other places, the stars of Ballets Russes Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin came in 1948, dancing in the MGOH and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie house</a> in Bacolod. They were followed by ballet stars Mia Slavenska, Alexandra Danilova, and Frederic Franklin. In the 1950s, Danilova returned with Michael Maule, Mocelyn Larkin, and Roman Jasinsky, dancing with Filipino dancers brought together by Kane. The 1950s witnessed performances of foreign ballet companies in Manila such as the Martha Graham and her company of 14 dancers at the FEU Auditorium in 1955. She also delivered a lecture-demonstration on modern dance to an audience of dancers and teachers at the Mapua Memorial Hall (Ylanan and Ylanan 1974, 170-71). Then followed more dance companies such as the San Francisco Ballet in Manila in 1957 (Ross 2007, 155), the Katherine Dunham and Company at the MGOH in 1957 and the New York City Ballet at the UP Theater in 1958 (Alejandro 1978, 234-35). Some of these companies were brought in by Hungarian exile, Paul Szilard, who strengthened ballet in the country when he organized the Philippine Arts Theatre and produced <strong><em><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></em></strong>, 1953, a presentation recognized for its infusion of folk dances into ballet theater. Through Szilard&rsquo;s initiative as a New York impresario, various American ballet companies came to perform in Manila from 1958 onward. This also led to long-term residences and short visits by Russian, English, American, and other foreign ballet instructors who helped shape ballet education in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One distinguished dancer and teacher-choreographer who returned to Manila in the 1950s was Ricardo Cassell after serving in the US Air Force during the war. This time he came with his wife Roberta who taught first for Anita Kane. On the other hand, Madrigal-Gonzalez invited him to teach in her Manila Ballet Academy, and to stage <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong><em><strong>Giselle</strong></em></strong></a> for her. Later Cassell and his wife founded their own dance studio on Taft Avenue. This gave birth to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2600\">Studio Dance Group</a> in 1953. The latter embarked on a mission to professionalize ballet by establishing an annual season and building an adventurous repertoire, mostly of original works. Already Cassell had worked with Villanueva Reyes in <strong><em>Giselle</em></strong>, and pushed for the latter&rsquo;s scholarship in New York. Many say that this youth was among the most gifted in those times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cassell&rsquo;s choreographic work is substantial in musical and dramatic range: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/141\"><strong><em><strong>Fifth Symphony</strong></em></strong></a> to Tchaikovsky, <strong><em>Adagietto</em></strong> to Mahler, <strong><em>The Transgressor</em></strong> to Gould, <strong><em>Ballet Blanc</em></strong> to Luigini, <strong><em>Sketch Class</em></strong> to Offenbach, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/147\"><strong><em><strong>Graduation Ball</strong></em></strong></a> to Strauss, <strong><em>Backstage</em></strong>, <strong><em>Merry Wives of Windsor</em></strong>, <strong><em>Divertissements</em></strong>, <strong><em>Beauty and the Beast</em></strong> to Ravel, <strong><em>Peter and the Wolf</em></strong> to Prokofiev, and several dances to Gershwin, including for a local film version of the composer&rsquo;s musical <strong><em>Lady Be Good</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cassell nurtured the artistic growth of many Filipino dancers: Villanueva Reyes, Julie and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a>, Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, Elizabeth Guasch, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2540\">Greta Monserrat</a>, Yvonne de los Reyes, Cristina Carrion-Bichara, Amerlia Garcia-Yulo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2508\">Mercy Lauchengco-Drilon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2561\">Lulu Puertollano</a>, Alice Reyes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>, Marcelino Garcia, Tony Llacer, Israel Gabriel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2534\">Cesar Mendoza</a>, Mario Recto, and Pancho Uytiepo. But in 1955 the Catholic hierarchy banned ballet dancing for girls, and this discouraged the Cassells who decided to return to the United States in 1956. During their brief stay, Manila enjoyed regular ballet performances for the first time. The dancers they left behind continued to professionalize the art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the performances of foreign companies in Manila and the proliferation of local ballet instructors, choreographers established ballet schools such as the School of Classic Dance of Anita Kane and the Classic Ballet Academy of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2449\">Remedios de Oteyza</a> which both opened in 1947; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2486\">Hariraya Dance Company</a> of Totoy de Oteyza and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2479\">Inday Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa</a>, 1968; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2439\">Vella Damian</a>&rsquo;s School of Ballet and Dance Arts, 1969. The Manila Ballet Academy was deemed to be the largest dance school in the 1950s. In the regional scene, ballet schools were pioneered by Carmen Dakudao Locsin of Davao through her Locsin Dance Workshop which was founded in 1947. In Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2584\">Fe Sala-Villarica</a> established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2427\">Cebu Ballet Center</a> in 1951 (Alejandro 1978, 49; Villaruz 1994, 124; Alejandro and Villaruz 1978, 235-36).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parallel to the growth of ballet schools was the establishment of a cultural arena to host ballet performances. Built in 1969, CCP served as an important venue for the staging of ballet, modern dance, and other cultural shows. Other places where significant ballet performances were held during the period were the FEU Auditorium, University of the Philippines (UP) Theater, Mapua Auditorium, Araneta Coliseum, Rizal Theater, Philam Life Auditorium, Meralco Theater, and the Folk Arts Theater (later Tanghalang Francisco Baltazar) (Villaruz 1994, 52).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early pioneers who developed ballet in the country were Polish-Russian Luva Adameit and New Zealander Anita Kane who trained the first generation of Filipino ballet dancers and choreographers during the neocolonial period. Anita Kane&mdash;who remained active in mentoring ballet dancers even after her retirement in the 1970s&mdash;promoted &ldquo;Filipinism&rdquo; in ballet. While touring around the country with her Kane (later Pamana) Ballet Company, she produced performances inspired by local themes and folk dance movements. Kane&rsquo;s Filipinist ballet output during the neocolonial period include the staging of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/184\"><strong><em><strong>Reconstruction Ballet</strong></em></strong></a>, 1951; <strong><em>La Mer</em></strong>, 1957; <strong><em>Mah Jong</em></strong>, 1962; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/170\"><strong><em><strong>Mutya ng Dagat</strong></em></strong></a> (Muse of the Sea), 1950; <strong><em>Inulan sa Pista</em></strong> (Rained-out Feast), 1961; <strong><em>Aswang</em></strong>, 1969; and <strong><em>Dularawan: Gintong Salakot</em></strong> (Image-Play: Golden Salacot), 1969. Luva Adameit, on the other hand, set up the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2430\">Cosmopolitan Ballet and Dancing School</a> on Pennsylvania Street, San Marcelino, Manila where she mentored Leonor Orosa-Goquingco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Adameit and Kane&rsquo;s Filipinism, Goquingco also incorporated indigenous themes in her stylized works especially in the well-recognized performances such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/173\"><strong><em><strong>Noli Dance Suite</strong></em></strong></a>, 1956, which integrated scenes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></a> </em></strong> (Touch Me Not); <strong><em>The Magic&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Garden</em></strong>, 1958, which is an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1567\">adaptation</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s fiction; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/142\"><strong><em>Filipinescas: Philippine Life, Legend&nbsp;and Lore in Dance</em></strong></a>, 1961, which is a full-evening suite. In 1950, Orosa-Goquingco worked on <strong><em>The Story of Man</em></strong> which was danced to a speech and singing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/801\">choir</a>, and in 1971, she choreographed for William Butler Yeats&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kalbaryo</em></strong> (Calvary), an adaptation by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a> which was directed by Brooks Jones. She also worked in drama with her own <strong><em>Her Son, Jose</em></strong>, 1955, which composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4030\">Lucrecia Reyes Kasilag</a> later developed into an operatorio in 1976. Among her works set to Western music are <strong><em>The Firebird</em></strong> to Stravinsky and <strong><em>The Clowns</em></strong> to Meyerbeer, and pieces in the <strong><em>Celebrazione &rsquo;89</em></strong> program that marked her 50 years in dance. She danced for a cultural mission to Japan in 1939 and acted in New York as a student in drama at Columbia University. She brought her Filipinescas Dance Company on several world tours in the 1960s and 1970s, winning festival awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remedios &ldquo;Totoy&rdquo; de Oteyza, another student of Adameit, studied in Paris with retired Russian prima ballerinas Olga Preobrajenska and Lubov Egorova, and the young choreographer George Balanchine who influenced her greatly. This was in her abstract ballets that were inspired by music, an interest drawn from her musically-inclined family. These include two ballets to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> concertos by Grieg and Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s <strong><em>Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</em></strong>, Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <strong><em>Serenade for Strings</em></strong>, Frank&rsquo;s <strong><em>Symphonic Variations</em></strong>, Khachaturian&rsquo;s <strong><em>Masquerade Suite</em></strong>,<em>&nbsp;</em>Gershwin&rsquo;s <strong><em>Rhapsody in Blue</em></strong>, Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <strong><em>Capriccio Espagnol</em></strong>, Ravel&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bolero</em></strong>, Dohnanyi&rsquo;s for a story ballet <strong><em>The Haunted Ballroom</em></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3942\">Rodolfo Cornejo</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Spectrum</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her ballet troupe evolved from the De Oteyza Ballet to become the Manila Ballet Company, and finally to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2486\">Hariraya Ballet (earlier Dance) Company</a> in 1968. Through the years she collaborated closely with Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa as its ballet mistress. For her part, the latter became the first artistic director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre</a> founded in 1987. Both women taught and choreographed for artists who became leaders in Philippine dance&mdash;Joji Felix-Velarde, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2382\">Maribel Aboitiz</a> (who both started with Adameit), Nelly Ledesma, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2518\">Sony Lopez-Gonzalez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2524\">Lydia Madarang-Gaston</a>, Lulu Puertollano, Vella Damian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2544\">Effie Na&ntilde;as</a>, Nida Onglengco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2410\">Maniya Barredo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2530\">Maiqui</a> and Mia (Monica) Ma&ntilde;osa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2504\">Gina Katigbak</a>, Eddie Elejar, Jamin Alcoriza, Edgar Mendoza, Rene Dimacali, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2432\">Eric Cruz</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from these performances, other native-inspired modern ballet performances using Filipino folklore include the production of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/168\"><strong><em><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></em></strong></a>, 1969, choreographed by Julie Borromeo and Felicitas Layag-Radaic; Nick Joaquin&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/167\">May Day Eve</a>,&rdquo; 1971, by Radaic; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/154\"><strong><em><strong>Juru-Pakal</strong></em></strong></a> (The Enchanted Kris), 1971, based on the legendary story of Indarapatra and Sulayman choreographed by Eddie Elejar. All these came from Dance Theater Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the 1960s, a development in dance emerged through the popularization of Philippine dance theater or creative dance (Goquingco 1980, 231). It was during this period that Broadway presentations blended with ballet and musical productions. Dance choreographers Julie and Rose Borromeo, starting in the 1960s, and Lally and Terry Aldeguer, in the 1970s, worked for Broadway adaptations and local musicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1960s onward, frequent visits of European ballet groups in the Philippines intensified due to the development in aviation and improvement of telecommunication systems worldwide (Corpus 2007, 36). There were more visits from international ballet troupes such as the Royal Ballets of London and Copenhagen; France&rsquo;s Paris Opera, Les Grands Ballets de France, and Ballet Theatre Contemporaine; America&rsquo;s New York City Ballet and San Francisco Ballet; and Soviet Union&rsquo;s Kirov, Bolshoi, and Perm and the Folkloric Ensembles. There were also visits made by ballet companies and folkloric troupes from Israel, Cuba, Venezuela, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia (Villaruz 1989, 19).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the continued development in ballet, two professional ballet companies were founded in 1968: the Hariraya Dance (later Ballet) Company and Dance Theater Philippines (DTP). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company</a> was founded later in 1970. Still echoing the Filipinist trend of the period, these ballet companies continued to incorporate native themes into their material. Philippine life and legends became common sources of ideas for choreographic works. The Hariraya, guided by de Oteyza and Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa, assigned Lulu Puertollano as ballet mistress and trained ballerinas like Effie Na&ntilde;as, Vella Damian, Maniya Barredo, and Nida Onglengco. It produced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/161\"><strong><em><strong>Legend of Sarimanok</strong></em></strong></a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3964\">Bayani Mendoza de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2393\">Reynaldo Alejandro</a>, and Roberto Caballero, 1968; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/148\"><strong><em>Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong></a> (Adarna Bird), by Rodolfo Cornejo, Remedios de Oteyza, and Inday Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa, 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DTP was led by its three founders: choreographers Julie Borromeo, Felicitas Layag-Radaic, and Eddie Elejar. Later, Tony Llacer and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2475\">El Gabriel</a> joined as ballet masters and choreographers of the company. In 1968, DTP staged <strong><em>Katakataka sin Rajah Indarapatra</em></strong> (Stories of Rajah Indarapatra) by composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4056\">Jose Maceda</a> and choreographer Eddie Elejar, <strong><em>Babae at Lalake</em></strong> (Woman and Man) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a> and Julie Borromeo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/206\"><strong><em><strong>Zagalas de Manila</strong></em></strong></a> (Young Maidens of Manila) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4093\">Julio Nakpil</a> and Julie Borromeo. In 1969, it produced <strong><em>Kalingan</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4117\">Angel Pe&ntilde;a</a> and Julie Borromeo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/194\"><strong><em><strong>Tanan</strong></em></strong></a> (Elopement) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4170\">Juan Silos Jr</a> and Layag-Radaic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballet during the neocolonial period flourished in the Philippines in three ways: through visits of foreign dance troupes and popular choreographers in the country; by the establishment of ballet schools through foreign and local tutelage; and via Filipinism or adoption of ballet as a dance form to express native themes and styles. The art form flourished due to the creative adaptation of both its foreign and local adherents who molded the dance form to suit the Philippine cultural landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"moderndance\" name=\"moderndance\"></a>Modern Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the challenges it faced when it veered away from strict rules of ballet, <strong>modern dance</strong> continued to flourish due to the determined efforts of its adherents who aimed at popularizing the form during this period. Modern dance had previously gained local admirers and practitioners in the Philippine stage following the introduction of the form by renowned choreographers such as Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn in 1926, and Vienesse Kaethe Hauser and Czech Dubsky-Zipper in the 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A student of Hauser, Spanish modern dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2576\">Manolo Rosado</a>, returned to Manila in 1958 following his success in the international stage. Rosado previously went to the USA in 1952 to study with Shawn, Graham, and Jose Limon. To identify himself, he bannered his &ldquo;mystic and poetic&rdquo; style in his teaching and presentations. He went on to dance with a Viennese company and Spanish ballet companies in Spain and Mexico. He brought back to Manila many of his heroic and poignant solo works. Among them were <strong><em>The Blind Beggar</em></strong> to Chopin, <strong><em>Judas</em></strong> to M. Salvador, <strong><em>El Greco</em></strong> to Turina, and <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong> to W. Newmann. In the 1960s, he created pieces based on folk traditions and life in Quiapo, <strong><em>The Debutant</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Fisherman and the Mermaid</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ultimo Adios</em></strong> (Last Farewell). Although he never had a group of his own, he staged ensemble works for others like the groups of de Oteyza and Julie Borromeo. His teacher Shawn called him &ldquo;among the most talented artists of our generation,&rdquo; while dancer-author La Meri hailed him as &ldquo;the poet of dance.&rdquo; Rosado&rsquo;s influence was limited but inspiring for those who witnessed his art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, Dubsky-Zipper also returned to the country after failing to collect funds in the US to establish an arts center by reviving Manila Ballet Moderne and conducting USAFFE dance concerts. Upon her return, the prolific Dubsky-Zipper collaborated with local artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a> and Nick Joaquin for Khatchaturian&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Idol</em></strong>, 1952, and Hindesmith&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pieta</em></strong>, 1953. She also choreographed Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/110\">A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</a> </em></strong> and <strong><em>The Fateful <strong>Dress</strong></em></strong>, 1951, and the ballet opera <strong><em>Bastien and Bastienne</em></strong>, 1952, to Mozart. She produced operas featuring dances such as <strong><em>Die Fledermaus</em></strong> to Strauss, 1954; <strong><em>Acis and Galatea</em></strong> to Mandel, 1959; notable, Tagalog productions of <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong>, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4151\">Conching Rosal</a>, 1956 and 1958; and <strong><em>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</em></strong> to Stravinsky, 1969 (Villaruz 1994, 54).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubsky-Zipper also mentored renowned dancer-choreographers Corazon Generoso (later, I&ntilde;igo), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2569\">Ricardo Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2588\">Lucio Sandoval</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2572\">Adina Rigor Ferrer</a>, Magie Shee, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2620\">Remedios Villanueva-Pi&ntilde;on</a>. Dancers and choreographers who danced for her include: Remedios de Oteyza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2508\">Mercedes Lauchengco</a> (later Drilon), Roberta Cassell, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2529\">Carlyn Manning</a>, Rosalia Merino-Santos, Lydia Madarang (later Gaston), Greta Monserrat, Inday Gaston (later Ma&ntilde;osa), Joji Felix (later Velarde), Chloe Cruz-Romulo, Jamin Alcoriza, Rally Calvo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2563\">Alcuin Pastrano</a> aka Al Quinn, and Eddie Elejar (Villaruz 1994, 54).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Dubsky-Zipper, other foreign practitioners of modern dance followed suit. In 1955, Martha Graham visited Manila and came back in the 1970s. Alvin Ailey and the Lavallade-Ailey American Dance Company presented dances characterized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> movement vocabulary at the Araneta Coliseum in 1962 (Ylanan and Ylanan 1974, 172). Supported by the US Department of State Cultural Exchange Program and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Folk Arts Center</a>, Jose Limon and his company had two shows at the Rizal Theater in 1963. Aside from these two performances, Limon also had performances in Cebu, and a lecture-demonstration of dance techniques to an audience of teachers at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (Ylanan and Ylanan 1974, 171). American Paul Taylor visited the country in 1967 during his Middle East and Asia tour and shared with Filipino dancers his technique of incorporating everyday movements in dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 1972 saw more international dance figures in the Philippines. Modern dance teacher-choreographer Norman Walker had a short stint as choreographer and dance master of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Dance Workshop. Carole Johnson held master classes and lecture-demonstrations at the Thomas Jefferson Library, FEU, and the CCP. Highlighting the marriage of theater and dance, she showed how these two could be used in creating works with important issues. And also giving master classes to ballet and modern dance students at the CCP was Emily Frankel whose experimental use of everyday sounds in her performance at the CCP Little Theater that same year left quite an impression on the audience (Ylanan and Ylanan 1974, 171). In 1976, the phenomenal Alwin Nikolais brought his innovative Dance Theater. He composed his music, choreographed, and designed his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">lights and costumes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With various foreign choreographers visiting the country, more modern dancers such as Pauline Koner, Garth Welch, Takaka Asakawa, and Gray Veredon were involved in mentoring future practitioners and performers of modern dance (Villaruz 1989, 31).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following her mentors Hauser and Dubsky-Zipper, Rosalia Merino-Santos went on to pursue modern dance for her master&rsquo;s degree in Wisconsin with Margaret H&rsquo;Doubler (who started the first dance degree in US), and also with Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey in Bennington College, and Mary Wigman and Harald Kreutzberg in Europe. Her thesis in Wisconsin titled &ldquo;What Is Dance,&rdquo; 1958, was a staged lecture-demonstration on the choreographic process. Her choreographies ranged from the abstract to the thematic as in <strong><em>Fanfare</em></strong> and <strong><em>Feminine Gender</em></strong>,&nbsp;both in 1958, and <strong><em>Opus 17</em></strong>. Then she turned to Filipino subjects: <strong><em>Ugaling Pilipino</em></strong> (Filipino Attitudes), 1963; excerpts from <strong><em>Sari Manok</em></strong>, 1968; and a part in <strong><em>Dularawan: Gintong Salakot</em></strong>, 1969, for the inaugural season of the CCP. With CCP she also staged <strong><em>Halina&rsquo;t Maglaro</em></strong> (Come and Play), 1971. Her most noted work is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/174\"><strong><em><strong>Of Cocks and Kings</strong></em></strong></a>, based on a legend retold by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5653\">Alejandro Roces</a> and to music by Kasilag. While teaching at Far Eastern University (FEU), she directed both the innovative <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2466\">FEU Modern Experimental Dance Group</a> and the FEU Folk Dance Troupe that won raves at Theatre de Nations in 1959. In her active years, she kept affiliation with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society (PFDS)</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2470\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino Memorial Foundation (FRAMF)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other dancers who were influenced to promote modern dance in the country were Rosado, who taught and briefly directed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2612\">University of the East Dance Troupe</a>, and Carmen Adevoso, who taught modern dance in public schools for a brief period before immigrating to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Alice Reyes, however, who made modern dance earn &ldquo;a legitimate place in Philippine theatrical dance scene&rdquo; through the debut performance of her Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company at the CCP during the Philippine Music and Dance Festival in 1970 (Corpus 2007, 42-43). Trained in modern dance at the Sarah Lawrence, Reyes reworked her master&rsquo;s thesis <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><strong><em><strong>Amada</strong></em></strong></a>, 1970, which was inspired by Nick Joaquin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Summer Solstice,&rdquo; after forming the company of 16 members from DTP, the Bayanihan alumni, and the UE Dance Company. In the same year, Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company presented the one-act ballet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/152\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Itim</strong> Asu</strong></em></strong></a> (Onyx Wolf) as its offering to the Philippine Music and Dance Festival in association with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4039\">League of Filipino Composers</a> at the CCP. Showcased along with Hariraya Ballet Company&rsquo;s presentation of <strong><em>Adarna</em></strong>, <strong><em>Itim Asu</em></strong> was highly regarded by critics as an achievement in Philippine dance (Vida 1994, 152-153).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s success led to the creation of the CCP dance summer workshop with Eddie Elejar in 1970. Featured pieces were those of Alice Reyes, Eddie Elejar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2462\">Antonio Fabella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2422\">Gener Caringal</a>, Rosalia Merino-Santos, Miro Zolan, Norman Walker, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Esteban &ldquo;Basilio&rdquo; Villaruz</a>. By 1972, the Philippines was assured of having established a modern dance troupe whose leading proponents aimed to develop the dance form for future audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"indigenousdance\" name=\"indigenousdance\"></a>Indigenous Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Third Republic, Philippine <strong>folk dance</strong> continued to thrive among the populace as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> dances remained relevant to the lives of the many groups throughout the archipelago. Folk dances continued to be performed among the ethnic groups.

There were also <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic dances</a> that imitated daily scenes and activities in the community. These were either mimetic dances that imitated animals such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/45\">bird dances</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/44\"><strong>banog-banog</strong></a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/44\"><strong>binaylan</strong></a> of the Higaonon, <strong>kinabua</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>,<em>&nbsp;</em><strong>man-manok</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>,&nbsp;<strong>paypato</strong> of the Ifugao, and the <strong>linggisan</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>; or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2\">occupational dances</a> rendering community activities such as planting, fishing, smoking out of bees, training for war, and headhunting. Examples of these dances are the <strong>tawti</strong> of the Tausug, <strong>pinapanilan</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>; and the different war dances like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/63\"><strong>kayaw</strong></a>, also known as <strong>mamakar</strong> or <strong>mangangayaw</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a> from the Central Mountain Province, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/43\"><strong>binabayani</strong></a> of the Aeta in Zambales, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/36\"><strong>ballangbang</strong></a> or <strong>tallibeng</strong> of the Applais group in the Western Mountain Province, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/76\"><strong>pallo-ok</strong></a> of the Tinguian or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Itneg</a> of Abra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Christianized groups there were also prayer dances like the <strong>turumba</strong> in Pakil, Laguna, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandangguhan</strong></a> in Obando, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>subli</strong></a> in Batangas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>malaket-a-polka</strong></a> (happy polka) in Estanza, Pangasinan, <strong>ati-atihan</strong> in Kalibo, Aklan, <strong>sinulog</strong> in Cebu, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/53\"><strong>diyandi</strong></a> in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte. Like the indigenous groups, the Christians have their mimetic animal folk dances such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a> (<em>tikling</em> birds), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/60\"><strong>itik-itik</strong></a> (ducks), and <strong>sinalampati</strong> (doves) and mock war dances like the <strong>maglalatik</strong> in Zapote and Loma of Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna. In weddings and other celebrations, the Christianized groups danced the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> in Cagayan and Isabela, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\"><strong>kuratsa</strong></a> in the Visayas and Bicol, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/65\"><strong>kuradang</strong></a> in Samar, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera</strong></a> in Ilocos, Cagayan, and Pangasinan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka sa nayon</strong></a> in Batangas, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka tagala</strong></a> in the Tagalog region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it remained a danger that folk dances might be lost with the changing times. Confronting this challenge of collecting, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documenting, and researching</a> on regional dances, folk dancer and researcher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a>, since the 1930s, contributed to the documentation, preservation, and enrichment of Philippine folk dances. With the support of UP Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5123\">Jorge Bocobo</a>, music composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, and photographer Ramon Tolentino, Aquino intensified and expanded her research which led to local and international publications of her valuable works on Philippine folk dances. In recognition of her works, Aquino was honoured in 1962 by the Ramon Magsaysay Foundation that pays tribute to distinguished Asians. Ever a guiding spirit in Philippine dance, Aquino was the first to be named National Artist in dance in 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within this period, Reyes-Aquino published the <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong> and later, the six-volume <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dance</em></strong>, 1953-70, as well as other writings: <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong>, 1946, <strong><em>Dances for All Occasions</em></strong>, 1950, <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances and Songs</em></strong>, 1966, as coauthor; and many other works on Physical Education (PE) and dance. In 1949, she established the Filipiniana Folk Dance Society, composed largely of educators all over the country. Through her pioneering work, further studies on regional folk dances increased. These materials then became useful sources, especially for public school teachers, who use Aquino&rsquo;s six-volume work on Philippine folk dances in teaching native dances in the PE program established in public schools in 1915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As volumes of Aquino&rsquo;s research works were published both in the Philippines and the United States, universities and regional colleges all over the country continued Aquino&rsquo;s explorations. Moreover, regional and national researchers further pursued Aquino&rsquo;s aim to intensify folk dance studies in the country. Among these noted dance scholars were Juan Miel, Petronila Suarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2598\">Jovita Sison-Friese</a>, Teresita Ines-Pascua, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2402\">Jose Balcena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2463\">Libertad</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2930\">Joan Fajardo</a>. Other researches were also done by artistic directors of Folk Dance companies such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2571\">Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</a> of the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2413\">Paz Cielo Angeles-Belmonte</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Baranggay Dance Troupe</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University-based folk dance troupes established during the period include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2615\">University of the Philippines Folk Song and Dance Club/Troupe</a>, 1948; the Philippine Normal College&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a>, 1958; the Leyte State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2514\">Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</a>, 1960; the Mindanao State University&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2445\">Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe</a>, 1966; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2611\">University of Santo Tomas&nbsp;Salinggawi Dance Troupe</a>, 1967 (I&ntilde;igo 1994, 79).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As various folk dance troupes began to flourish locally, Philippine dance troupes were beginning to be recognized in the international stage in the 1950s. In 1958, the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company caught the world&rsquo;s attention through its success at the Brussels Universal Exposition, which led to their Broadway and television performances across Europe and the US. Three years after Bayanihan&rsquo;s victory, a company called Ice Capades produced an ice skating show based on Philippine dances in Atlantic City, New Jersey. With Lucrecia Urtula as consultant, the company mounted the <strong><em>Philippine Dances Suite</em></strong>, 1961, featuring Philippine folk dances like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a> and <strong>sakuting</strong> (Garcia 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the Bayanihan, the Far Eastern University (FEU) Folk Dance Troupe also succeeded in dominating the international dance scene through its presentation at the Theatre des Nations in France in 1957 and its win in Mallorca and Caceres, Spain. Other dance groups that have gone on world tours and successfully gained international recognition include the Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe of the PNC, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2514\">Leyte Filipiniana Dance Troupe</a>, and the Fiesta Filipina Dance Troupe (Alejandro 1978, 50-51). In 1971, Ramon Obusan founded the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG) that subsequently gained international prominence and awards. Like the Bayanihan, the ROFG was always backed by a musical ensemble, for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\">rondalla</a> and ethnic music. Obusan also did the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costuming and scenery</a> for his group, drawn from his broad collection of cultural artifacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the 1950s onwards marked the renaissance of Philippine folk dance not only because local dance troupes achieved international success, but also because Philippine folk dances were popularized through their inclusion in local films. Years before this decade, however, LVN, one of the country&rsquo;s biggest movie producers, had already started showing musicals. Its inaugural film titled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><strong><em><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></em></strong></a> (My Love), 1939&nbsp;was followed by <strong><em>Hiyas ng Dagat</em></strong> (Treasure of the Sea), another musical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\">drama</a>, 1941 (Tiongson 2008, 24). It was in the 1950s, however, when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, considered one of the Philippines&rsquo;&nbsp;best directors, began creating films integrating Philippine folk dances. In 1955, moviegoers enjoyed the&nbsp;<em>pamamanhikan&nbsp;</em>(asking for the woman&rsquo;s hand in marriage) scene in the satirical movie <strong><em>Pilipino Kostum-No Touch!</em></strong> (Filipino Custom-No Touch!). The encounter between the Hispanized and Americanized Filipinos was depicted in a &ldquo;dance debate&rdquo; between the &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; who performed the <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo sa ilaw</strong></a>, <strong>tinikling</strong>, <strong>maglalatik</strong>, and &ldquo;the moderns&rdquo; who performed the <strong>charleston</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>boogie-woogie</strong>, <strong>cha-cha</strong>, and <strong>rock n&rsquo; roll</strong> (Tiongson 2008, 94-95). Also shown in the same year was the box-office hit musical <strong><em>Ikaw Kasi!</em></strong> (It&rsquo;s All Your Fault) which entertained the audience with songs, dances, and impressive gowns. This was followed in 1956 by another box-office hit, the Christmas musical, <strong><em>Bahala Na</em></strong> (Whatever Happens). Among the reasons behind the latter&rsquo;s success was the entertaining repertoire of 30 pairs of colorfully-costumed dancers performing modernized interpretations of folk dances like the tinikling, cari&ntilde;osa, <strong>patpat</strong>, and the <strong>bao</strong> (coconut shell) dance (Tiongson 2008, 104). <strong><em>Tingnan Natin</em></strong> (Let&rsquo;s See), also a Christmas musical comedy, was shown in 1957 (Tiongson 2008, 118).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dances were not only featured in musicals but also in LVN films that were critical of Philippine society. The popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1197\"><strong><em><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Congress</strong></em></strong></a> (Lazy Juan Goes to Congress), 1959, presented the Baranggay Dance Troupe of the PNC. The movie inspired the production of another Juan Tamad movie, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1198\"><strong><em><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Society</strong></em></strong></a> (Lazy Juan Goes to Society), 1960, which also featured a folk dance troupe. To ensure the success of <strong><em>Society</em></strong>, LVN hired a musical director for the film and got the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2465\">FEU Dance Group</a> to perform <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and various folk dances under the direction of Corazon I&ntilde;igo (Tiongson 2008, 143).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even while <strong><em>Society</em></strong> was in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1087\">production</a> process, Conde, director of the <strong><em>Juan Tamad</em></strong> movies, was already working on another movie featuring the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company which was already making waves in the dance scene after it was applauded at the Brussels World&rsquo;s Fair. With the theme of community development, the movie titled <strong><em>Bayanihan</em></strong>, 1959, had a well-shot dance sequence which Conde later edited and transformed into a 10-minute <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1062\">documentary</a> on the dance group. The film, which competed in the 5th International Film Festival on Music and Dance in 1960, in Valencia, Spain, did not only win the gold medal but also the silver medal in the Ibero-Americana y Filipina Section of the 4th International Festival of Documentary and Short Films in Bilbao, Spain that same year. The documentary continued to garner more local and international <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1075\">awards</a> (Tiongson 2008, 150).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the popularity of folk dances as a result of media exposure, they were also performed widely in schools as part of contests, field demonstrations, and performances to welcome visiting guests and dignitaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Spanish dances continued to thrive. Flamenco dancer Ruben Nieto studied in the Philippines and abroad. Coming home, he taught his partner Rose Borromeo, and formed an ad hoc ensemble with Marilen Martinez, Lito Arellano, Bobby Ongkiko, and danseur Eddie Elejar. He moved to Madrid in the 1970s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2481\">Guillermo Gomez</a>, whose mother studied under the renowned Antonia Merce or La Argentina, also taught Spanish dances. According to Gomez, aside from his mother&rsquo;s Spanish repertoire, she likewise danced the cari&ntilde;osa, a Filipino version of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\">pandanggo</a>, and the <strong>binasuan</strong>. The Portuguese Jose Zarah with Bebe Marcaida contributed to the popularization of Spanish dances until the 1960s. Although there was a period when interest in this type of dance waned, there was a revival of enthusiasm in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, the popularization of folk dance extended to commercial places, in hotels, clubs, restaurants, and foreign cruise ships where dances performed for visitors and customers, signaling the future commercialization of the folk dance form (I&ntilde;igo 1994, 80). With the Philippines&rsquo;&nbsp;link to Hawaii during the American period, Hawaiian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/88\">Tahitian, and Polynesian dancing</a> became popular. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">Learning was formalized</a> in dance schools, and went on stage in clubs and theaters. Well-known teachers were Lucy Gonzales, Naty Bas, Chiqui Ocampo, Nenuca Ros, Carmen Garcia, and Carmen Gonzales. Among the active groups were the Pacifica Cultural Dance Troupe, Maile Dance Company, Tiare Dance Troupe and the Aldeguer Sisters. Perhaps with a different kind of dancing required by clubs in Japan, the interest and investment in these faded away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"socialdance\" name=\"socialdance\"></a>Social Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>American influences in dance did not only lead to the country&rsquo;s accommodation of Western cultural products but they also altered the social life of the Filipino people. While rural Filipinos continued to dance Philippine folk dances, urban dwellers revelled in foreign steps and dance styles for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\"><strong>social dancing</strong></a>. Filipinos continued, throughout the duration of the Third Republic, to yearn for American beats and trends by performing <strong>rhumba</strong>, <strong>tango</strong>, <strong>samba</strong>, <strong>mambo</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a>, <strong>cha-cha</strong>, and the <strong>limbo rock</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These American dances were seen on TV variety shows that flourished during the rock and roll era of the 1950s. Dancing shows on TV mirrored the vibrancy of social dances in the country. Cha-cha and boogie were popularized in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><strong><em>The Nida-Nestor</em></strong> <em><strong>Show</strong></em></a>, 1964-72 which featured the popular tandem of Nida Blanca and Nestor de Villa. It was choreographed by Julie Borromeo who also worked with members of Dance Theater Philippines for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a>&rsquo;s weekly show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubbed as the original &ldquo;Dancing Queen,&rdquo; Helen Gamboa hosted her own show titled <strong><em>Helen</em></strong>, 1966-70, which also featured her signature song and dance &ldquo;Bang-Shang-A-Lang.&rdquo; Another dancing show, <strong><em>Dance-O-Rama</em></strong>, 1967-72, featured <strong>ad-lib</strong> or <strong>maskiPops</strong> (from &ldquo;maski papaano&rdquo; or anything goes) dance moves derived from popular dances such as <strong>chicken</strong>, <strong>mashed potatoes</strong>, <strong>the shovel</strong>, and <strong>watusi</strong>. There was also the hit TV show <strong><em>Dance Time with Chito</em></strong>, 1962-72, which was popularized by Al Quinn, Lito Calzado, and Chito Feliciano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1940s and 1950s, Filipinos danced to popular steps of mambo, samba, and cha-cha as well as <strong>camel walk</strong>, <strong>aqua velva</strong>, <strong>shiminy</strong>, <strong>esalato</strong>, and <strong>boogaloo</strong> (Bercades 1994, 103). A specific feature of popular American dances in the 1950s was its faster speed and increased dance dynamics; for instance, the <strong>boogie-woogie</strong>&rsquo;s combination complicated dance patterns and movements, and <strong>rock n&rsquo; roll</strong> incorporated ballroom acrobatics and somersault in its performance. Toward the 1960s and 1970s, popular dance trends of the period such as <strong>mashed potato</strong>, twist, boogaloo, <strong>bossa nova</strong>, <strong>frug</strong>, <strong>pachanga</strong>, watusi, and <strong>hustle</strong> were popularized and taught in television dance shows (Villaruz 1994, 76).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These fashionable dances of the period were performed usually in cabarets or known locally as&nbsp;<em>kabaret</em>, a spot for late-night dancing entertainment for the urban masses, which were still popular in small towns during the 1950s and 1960s (Villaruz 1994, 57). Meanwhile, for urban elites, membership in social clubs such as Kahirup, Smiles, Mancomunicad Pampangue&ntilde;a, and Club Filipino allowed them to enjoy foreign dances that blended with Philippine folk tradition. Aside from this, there were grand balls thrown by rich families or enjoyed at big hotels such as Oriente Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballroom dancing schools were found all over Quiapo in the 1960s which continued to feature swing, mambo, and limbo rock (Villaruz 1994, 57). Over all, there was a vibrant acceptance of popular American dance trends, mostly in urban areas, by Filipinos who were continuously enticed by the lure of American cultural products during the neocolonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine dance during the neocolonial period was a melange of cultural meanings as it registered the sociopolitical changes after the country was granted its independence. The strong American cultural influences that seeped through Philippine cultural practices were visible in the changes in the dance scene. The Third Republic might have been characterized by how Filipinos continued to be fascinated by the West but it also showed a working&nbsp;<em>with&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>around&nbsp;</em>the onslaught of changes. Foreign dance choreographers, companies, and pop dancers in the United States might have made a mark in the history of Philippine dance, but so did the works of Filipino scholars who were committed to documenting and preserving the country&rsquo;s folk dances. As much as there was the allure of anything American, there was likewise the desire to discover what was &ldquo;Filipino.&rdquo; There was, in other words, a counterculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media, in particular, film, might have been greatly responsible for the migration of American musicals to the Philippines, but the movies were also used to depict the multifaceted encounter between the foreign and the local cultures. Philippine dance anchored on the Filipino body manifested the overlayerings of American and Hispanic colonial legacies. As an ever-changing form, this dance and its various types, managed to keep its peculiar rhythm informed by the beat of the nation&rsquo;s history. And when the country pushed towards mid 20th century and found itself amidst the Cold War and the strong ideological influence of the Left in China, Philippine dance took another turn and became a strong form of political expression. In the bodies of activists, dance did not only protest against the state, capitalists, and the oligarchy. It also embodied an ideal for the country that was heading toward a dark future. From the time the Philippines was granted its political independence to the impending declaration of martial law, Philippine dance, despite colonial influences, was an affirmation of the local culture and a somatic expression of the people&rsquo;s aspirations. Dance in the country was a fertile ground for the battle between cultural and political meanings. As the Philippine nation continued to be enchanted by the West yet simultaneously pursued a vision of independence, Philippine dance remained tenacious and transformative. Dance was a constant reworking of both new and familiar idioms, generating nuanced ways of understanding the Filipino identity. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

During this period, American influence in the country&#x2019;s political, cultural, and socioeconomic landscape continued to permeate every aspect of Philippine life. Neocolonial control was evident in trade and military pacts, signed to secure the Republic&#x2019;s dependence on its former colonizer (Guillermo 1999, 201). As a result, the country&#x2019;s aim to attain actual development and freedom was hampered by the economic structure characterized by the iniquitous relations between the former liberator and its newly-liberated colony (Doronila 1992, 174)."

The Fulbright scholarship, an education exchange program which replaced the earlier&#xA0;<em>pensionado&#xA0;</em>system, ensured the Americanization of the country&#x2019;s educated class. At the height of the program in the 1950s, practically all Filipino artists and academics were given scholarships and lecture grants in American universities, subjecting them to &#x201C;cultural campaign&#x201D; through immersion in American society. As a result, the Filipino artist&#x2019;s creative and scholarly output can largely be evaluated in terms of &#x201C;keeping up with artistic trend in the United States and elsewhere in the West&#x201D; (Lumbera 1997, 181-82). In the 1950s, notable dancers who received scholarships to study abroad were <a href=\"/6/6/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a> as a Fulbright scholar in 1959; <a href=\"/6/6/2566\">Benjamin Villanueva Reyes</a> who studied in New York through the sponsorship of <a href=\"/6/6/2424\">Ricardo Cassell</a>, Manila Music Lovers Society, and <a href=\"/5/5/3877\">Asociacion Musical de Filipinas</a>; <a href=\"/6/6/2511\">Felicitas Layag-Radaic</a> and <a href=\"/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a> through <a href=\"/5/5/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</a>; <a href=\"/6/6/2475\">Israel Gabriel</a> and <a href=\"/6/6/2515\">Antonio Llacer</a> on full scholarships at different <a href=\"/6/46/37\">ballet</a> <a href=\"/6/47/30\">schools</a> in the United States; and <a href=\"/6/6/2467\">Joji Felix-Velarde</a> at Ballet Rambert School in London and Ballet Art Studio in New York through the support of British dancer and choreographer Alicia Markova."

Years before this decade, however, LVN, one of the country&#x2019;s biggest movie producers, had already started showing musicals. Its inaugural film titled <a href=\"/4/24/1169\"><strong><em><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></em></strong></a> (My Love), 1939&#xA0;was followed by <strong><em>Hiyas ng Dagat</em></strong> (Treasure of the Sea), another musical <a href=\"/4/21/1063\">drama</a>, 1941 (Tiongson 2008, 24). It was in the 1950s, however, when <a href=\"/4/4/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, considered one of the Philippines&#x2019;&#xA0;best directors, began creating films integrating Philippine folk dances. In 1955, moviegoers enjoyed the&#xA0;<em>pamamanhikan&#xA0;</em>(asking for the woman&#x2019;s hand in marriage) scene in the satirical movie <strong><em>Pilipino Kostum-No Touch!</em></strong> (Filipino Custom-No Touch!). The encounter between the Hispanized and Americanized Filipinos was depicted in a &#x201C;dance debate&#x201D; between the &#x201C;conservatives&#x201D; who performed the <strong>cari&#xF1;osa</strong>, <a href=\"/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo sa ilaw</strong></a>, <strong>tinikling</strong>, <strong>maglalatik</strong>, and &#x201C;the moderns&#x201D; who performed the <strong>charleston</strong>,&#xA0;<strong>boogie-woogie</strong>, <strong>cha-cha</strong>, and <strong>rock n&#x2019; roll</strong> (Tiongson 2008, 94-95). Also shown in the same year was the box-office hit musical <strong><em>Ikaw Kasi!</em></strong> (It&#x2019;s All Your Fault) which entertained the audience with songs, dances, and impressive gowns. This was followed in 1956 by another box-office hit, the Christmas musical, <strong><em>Bahala Na</em></strong> (Whatever Happens). Among the reasons behind the latter&#x2019;s success was the entertaining repertoire of 30 pairs of colorfully-costumed dancers performing modernized interpretations of folk dances like the tinikling, cari&#xF1;osa, <strong>patpat</strong>, and the <strong>bao</strong> (coconut shell) dance (Tiongson 2008, 104). <strong><em>Tingnan Natin</em></strong> (Let&#x2019;s See), also a Christmas musical comedy, was shown in 1957 (Tiongson 2008, 118)."

Philippine dance anchored on the Filipino body manifested the overlayerings of American and Hispanic colonial legacies. As an ever-changing form, this dance and its various types, managed to keep its peculiar rhythm informed by the beat of the nation&#x2019;s history. And when the country pushed towards mid 20th century and found itself amidst the Cold War and the strong ideological influence of the Left in China, Philippine dance took another turn and became a strong form of political expression. In the bodies of activists, dance did not only protest against the state, capitalists, and the oligarchy. It also embodied an ideal for the country that was heading toward a dark future. From the time the Philippines was granted its political independence to the impending declaration of martial law, Philippine dance, despite colonial influences, was an affirmation of the local culture and a somatic expression of the people&#x2019;s aspirations. Dance in the country was a fertile ground for the battle between cultural and political meanings. As the Philippine nation continued to be enchanted by the West yet simultaneously pursued a vision of independence, Philippine dance remained tenacious and transformative. Dance was a constant reworking of both new and familiar idioms, generating nuanced ways of understanding the Filipino identity. <strong><span class>&#xA0;</span></strong>"

In 1969, amid mounting political unrest and criticism against the Marcos administration, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> was built to focus on the performing arts such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballets</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestra</a> concerts. The CCP was part of the strategy of then First Lady Imelda Marcos to gain international recognition for the Philippines. The CCP also fitted the plan to make the country a hub for international events and a haven for tourists. During its inauguration, the CCP commissioned the creation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/168\"><strong><em><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></em></strong></a>, 1969, by several <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">dance companies</a> led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2444\">Dance Theater Philippines</a>. <strong><em>Mir-i-nisa</em></strong> was a grand ballet production based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s love story involving Muslim Filipino characters. The CCP also became the home base of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a> who created <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\">modern dance</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> in 1970 starting with the <strong><em>First Modern Dance Concert</em></strong> and followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/152\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Itim</strong> Asu</strong></em></strong></a> (Onyx Wolf) based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virgie Moreno</a>&rsquo;s provocative play that fuses historical facts with fiction. Despite the encouragement to use native themes with western art forms, the State&rsquo;s culture and arts program was labelled as elitist and colonial by Marcos&rsquo;s political rivals and by militant youth activists who were then relentlessly staging huge political rallies that often ended up in violent dispersals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> were used as effective tools of protest in the big rallies led by student activists in Manila during the eve of martial law. The battle cry of youth activists then was to resolve the fundamental problems of the Filipino people, namely, American &ldquo;imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism&rdquo; (Guerrero 1970, 40-68). Red Banner dances, an influence from the art forms of Mao Tse Tung&rsquo;s Chinese Cultural Revolution, were the usual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> that complemented marching <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/791\">protest songs</a>. One of the most daring face-offs between the State and the student demonstrators happened right at the corridor of CCP. The Konsehong Tagapag-ugnay ng Rebolusyonaryong Sining led militant cultural groups such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>, Sining Bayan, Kamanyang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3150\">Panday Sining</a> to mount a show titled <strong><em>Pest of Badway</em></strong>, a parody of the CPP presentation at the time, <strong><em>The Best of Broadway</em></strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3212\">Leo Rimando</a> directed the production consisting of farcical vignettes from Broadway musicals. The cultural activists daringly performed near the famous CCP fountain on the gala premiere to mock what they considered as another elitist production supported by the State and the ruling class (Tiongson 2015; Quimpo 2012, 193). Such song-and-dance performances were effective tools of entertainment and education during the pickets and rallies that stormed the national capital region of the country. But the huge youth demonstrations were silenced by a single declaration from Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&nbsp;</pre>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 21 Sep 1972, by virtue of Proclamation No 1081, Pres Ferdinand Marcos signed the declaration of martial law in the Philippines. Congress was abolished, democratic rights were curtailed, and press operations were halted. The Roces-owned <strong><em>Sunday Times Magazine</em></strong> was closed, its last edition which was never circulated had ballerina <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2590\">Tina Santos</a> on the cover (Villaruz 2005, 227). Television and radio stations were shut down. The National Media Production Center and the Office of the Press Secretary seized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> Channel 4. Critics of the government&mdash;politicians, members of the press, student activists, or mass leaders&mdash;were arrested and imprisoned. Those who eluded arrest went into hiding, sought political asylum abroad, or joined the underground movement. There were virtually no opponents left to challenge the regime except for the insurgencies led by the Communist Party of the Philippines, the National Democratic Front, and the New People&rsquo;s Army on one hand; and the Moro National Liberation Front and the Bangsa Moro Army on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southern Philippines became the target of massive militarization as Pres Marcos threatened to wipe out Moro insurgents in three weeks&rsquo; time after 21 Sep 1972. Before the deadline, 400 rebels in Marawi City defeated government troops. In reprisal, whole divisions of armed forces were deployed to Southern Philippines. By the end of 1972, the fighting escalated into a gory and bitter war that killed an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 civilians and rendered about one million people homeless and poor. At least 200,000 refugees fled to other parts of the Philippines and to Sabah. Contrary to the notion that a military rule was imposed because of Muslim insurgency, it was militarization under martial law that fueled the armed rebellion led by Nur Misuari (Mackenna 1998; Rasul 2015; Buendia 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several months after martial law declaration, the broadcast media resumed normal operations. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4860\">Kanlaon Broadcasting System Channel 9</a> which later became Radio Philippines Network was run by Roberto S. Benedicto, a Marcos ally who was also the Philippine ambassador to Japan and the head of the country&rsquo;s sugar industry. Benedicto then proceeded to open the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4766\">Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation Channel 2</a> and the Inter-island Broadcasting Corporation Channel 8 (Crewdson 1986). In 1974, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4842\">GMA Network</a> Channel 7 operated under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> official Gilberto Duavit Sr, accountant <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4858\">Menardo Jimenez</a>, and lawyer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4845\">Felipe Gozon</a> (GMA Network Corporate Profile 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architects of martial law knew that culture and the arts must be utilized to build acceptance and to popularize the tenets of the Bagong Lipunan or New Society. First Lady Imelda Marcos took the lead in the realm of art and culture. She immediately implemented projects that utilized art and culture to exemplify the good intentions and programs of the New Society. This was carried out through the construction of cultural institutions and edifices, and through the use of ethnic and folk icons for the goals of the regime. In 1973, the National Arts Center (NAC) was built on top of the legendary Mt Makiling, an active volcano. The unique arts center is an ivory tower set amidst an idyllic forest. Imelda Marcos in her speech during the NAC groundbreaking rites said that its establishment is the beginning of the &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; of Filipino culture. The NAC in 1977 was expanded with the inauguration of the Philippine High School for the Arts that offered a dance program on western <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a>, along with programs in the other arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To offset the image that the New Society only supported high art, the First Lady built the Folk Arts Theater (FAT) in 1974. During the inauguration of the FAT, deemed to be the venue for arts catering to the masses, a grand street parade titled <strong><em>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</em></strong> (History of the Race) was mounted. It was designed to be the biggest national parade with over 20,000 participants that included performing artists, members of ethnic communities, local officials from all over the archipelago, and the contestants of the 1974 Miss Universe beauty pageant. <strong><em>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</em></strong> essayed the history of the Filipino race from prehistory to the New Society. The spectacle attracted thousands of spectators along Roxas Boulevard and was broadcast live on nationwide TV (Jarales 2013, 5; Namiki 2007, 45). The FAT was the venue of the 1974 Miss Universe Pageant, a major cultural project of the regime to prettify the image of martial law, especially to foreign media. The first to be held in Asia, the 1974 Miss Universe pageant was aired live via satellite all over the world on 19 Jul 1974 from the FAT, with the Philippines&rsquo; Margarita Moran as the outgoing Miss Universe. To soften the image of military rule, the pageant opened with the Philippine Military Academy&rsquo;s honor guards marching gallantly with sashaying contestants. The crisscrossing guards and beauty queens were choreographed to create a kaleidoscope of masculine and feminine bodies. The pageant also featured a production number by the beauty contestants clad in Filipina costume, executing simple footwork and singing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\">&ldquo;Pamulinawen,&rdquo;</a> the favorite <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk song</a> of Pres Ferdinand Marcos (Miss Universe Beauty Pageant 1974; Romulo 1987, 98).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourism was a big program of the New Society, designed to enhance the image of the Marcos regime. Eight months from the imposition of martial law, the Department of Tourism was established in May 1973, headed by Jose Aspiras who was a former congressman and an avid follower of Imelda Marcos. The Philippines was promoted as a peaceful country and an ideal place for international events and conferences. One huge promotional project was the hosting of the IMF-World Bank Conference in 1976, slated at the newly-built Philippine International Convention Center within the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP Complex</a>. The preparation for the International Monetary Fund-World Bank Conference remains in history as one of the classic examples of incredible tourism development. The grand project resulted in the frenzied establishment of luxury hotels using government funds and taxpayers money, amounting to billions of pesos. In a few months, the rise of many five-star hotels changed the bay side landscape of Roxas Boulevard. These hotels and international venues needed theatrical performances with dance as major component. Meanwhile, tourism promotion in the provinces led to the development of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">street dancing</a> with touristic intentions (Apostolopoulos et al, 2013, 236-38).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the pronouncements of economic growth and development under Martial law, the gap between the rich and the poor widened under the regime. Unemployment rose and the economy had a big deficit in the balance of payments. An oil crisis in 1973 worsened the internal problems of the country. This explosive situation that could escalate into social unrest had to be diffused. Overseas employment was the answer. Labor employment abroad was a policy of martial law under the 1974 Labor Code of the Philippines. It is not surprising that from 36,035 overseas contracts in 1975, the number of overseas Filipino contracts rose to 434,207 in 1983. Among these OFWs were the cultural dancers who worked as entertainers abroad. There is no doubt about the contribution of the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to save the ailing economy: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) statistics show that remittances rose from $103 million in 1975 to $944.45 million in 1983 (Asis 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gap between the rich and the poor widened as the top 12.9 percent of the population enjoyed 45.5 percent of the country&rsquo;s total income. Marcos signed Presidential Decree 1177 in 1977 to ensure automatic payment of public debts. This was enforced to affirm the good standing of the New Society to foreign creditors. Thus, the dictatorship succeeded in increasing Philippine foreign debt from only $360 million in 1962 to $27 billion by the end of the regime. The decree guaranteed automatic debt service payment even for loans that did not benefit the people, such as borrowings used for the stalled Bataan Nuclear Power Plant and the suspended Chico River Dam (Almario 2011 and 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most dramatic struggles of the Filipino people in the 20th century was the Cordillera peoples&rsquo; opposition to a prominent development project funded by the World Bank. This was the Chico River Basin Hydroelectric Dam Project whose operation would submerge the ancestral lands of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontoc</a>. To consolidate themselves, the two ethnic groups formed the Kalinga-Bontoc Peace Pact Holders Association (KBPPHA) which propelled the anti-Chico Dam campaign. The KBPPHA grew and gained local and international support despite military efforts to suppress it. On 24 Apr 1980, government troops killed Macliing Dulag in Bugnay village, Tinglayan, Kalinga. Dulag, who was vocal about his opposition to the Chico Dam, was a respected leader of the Butbut group of the Kalinga. His assassination led to the groundswell of support for the anti-Chico Dam struggle from all over the country and from the international community. Dulag&rsquo;s martyrdom led to the unity of many villages and groups against the Chico Dam. The triumphs of anti-Chico Dam movement was followed by the successful protest of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> against Cellophil Resources Corporation (CRC). The CRC was owned by Herminio Disini, a Marcos crony who was given jurisdiction in 1973 to operate a logging and paper-pulp company covering 200,000 has in Abra. These struggles of the Cordillera peoples led to a strong united opposition against the Marcos dictatorship under the Cordillera Peoples&rsquo; Alliance. The struggles of the Cordillera peoples were expressed through their indigenous dances (Bolinget 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 1980s, the surge of the people&rsquo;s mass movements all over the country was already being felt despite the government&rsquo;s effort to suppress people&rsquo;s actions. The pressures on the regime from the international press and the worldwide human rights movement increased. The catalyst to the sociopolitical upheaval was the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr who returned to the Philippines after three years of exile in the US. Aquino was shot on the tarmac of the Manila International Airport immediately after he alighted from his airplane on 21 Aug 1983. His assassination further intensified the growing opposition against the Marcos dictatorship. These mass rallies and protest actions utilized theatrical performances using dance and creative body movements to educate and entertain the people. Even the apathetic sectors and members of the elite joined the surge of protests which led to the EDSA Revolt in February 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martial law lasted only about 14 years in the history of the Philippines but the period was very significant, especially in the realm of art and culture. Though this historical phase saw the continued development of western art forms which were primarily supported by the elite, it also witnessed the rise of divergent forces which developed various expressions that helped to overthrow the Marcos dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"balletandmoderndance\" name=\"balletandmoderndance\"></a>Ballet and Modern Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Centralization and control were the strategies of the authoritarian regime. The CCP itself echoed this policy by making the Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company, later called CCP Dance Company, its resident dance company in 1974. The CCP Dance Company was renamed as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines (BP)</a> in 1981. Imelda Marcos was the patron and chair of BP whose success with local and international audiences presented a good image of martial law. However, ballet was not the First Lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; art form, giving BP relative autonomy in creating its own form and content. But to keep away from any conflict with the martial dispensation, BP productions remained safely &ldquo;apolitical,&rdquo; and as such, were supportive of the tenets of martial law (Tan 1999, 9-12).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other dance companies no longer enjoyed support from the CCP. They survived by rehearsing and performing elsewhere. <strong><em>Ballet at the Park</em></strong> and <strong><em>Puerta Real Evenings</em></strong> were regular concerts under the sponsorship of Teodoro &ldquo;Ka Doroy&rdquo; Valencia, a journalist and Marcos ally who was also known as a philanthropist. The sponsored shows were meant to bring western classical dance forms like ballet to the masses. Dance Theater Philippines mounted works every month at Rizal Park from 1973 to 1986, and sustained two full seasons of original works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2511\">Tita Layag-Radaic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2462\">Tony Fabella</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2422\">Gener Caringal</a> at the Meralco Theater in early 1980s. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2486\">Hariraya Ballet Company</a>, after losing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">venue</a> and funding support from CCP, performed most often at Puerta Real, Intramuros until the early 1980s, and at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Manila Metropolitan Theater</a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2528\">Manila Metropolis Ballet</a> of Elejar and Fabella also filled the annual seasons at Puerta Real in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> during the 1980s, and later of <strong><em>Festival Four</em></strong> at the CCP and <strong><em>Sayaw Sining</em></strong> (Dance Art) at the Metropolitan Theater. The lack of support from the CCP did not discourage these ballet companies. In fact, many ballet dancers were developed outside of CCP such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2410\">Maniya Barredo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2439\">Vella Damian</a>, Jun Dalit, Teofilo Pila, Loulie Dalupan, Nini and Pinky Mendoza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2582\">Irene</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2581\">Hazel Sabas</a>, Emellie Rigonan, Sophia Radaic, Mary Anne Santamaria, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2618\">Anna Villadolid</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2523\">Lisa Macuja</a>, Eloisa Enerio, Jonathan Terry, Roberto Clemente, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2585\">Vivencio Samblace&ntilde;o Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2415\">Myra</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2414\">Ida Beltran</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2485\">Shirley</a> and Jeng Halili, Mila Ferrer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2383\">Rupert Acu&ntilde;a</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2456\">Ricardo Ella</a> (Villaruz 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imelda Marcos was keen on getting world recognition through ballet. The CCP produced western classical ballets such as&nbsp;<strong><em>Act III of <em><strong>S</strong></em>leeping Beauty</em></strong>, 1972; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><strong><em>The&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Nutcracker</em></strong></a>, 1976 and 1977; and <strong><em>The Firebird</em></strong>, 1979. In keeping with the regime&rsquo;s strategy of inviting international artists to put the Philippines on the world art scene, the First Lady gave the International Artist Award in 1976 to Margot Fonteyne who was a celebrity guest artist along with Rudolf Nureyev. Many of CCP&rsquo;s classical ballet productions featured world-acclaimed dancers like Natalia Makarova and Patrick Bissel in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong><em><strong>Giselle</strong></em></strong></a>, 1979; and Yoko Morishita in <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong>, 1979. The CCP also invited foreign choreographers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2542\">William Morgan</a> who mounted <strong><em>Napoli Divertissements</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Sleeping Beauty</em></strong> in 1983. Other foreign artists who came to perform or to train at the CCP were Martha Graham Dance Company, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Norman Walker, Garth Welch, Muneca Aponte, Rex McClaneghan, Alfred Rodrigues, Gerard Sibbritt, Takako Asakawa, Jan Stripling, Kenneth Gillespie, Gray Veredon, and Diana Haight (Fernandez 1981, 181-82). Ballet thrived under the regime because it was supported and patronized by the audience from the upper classes of society who either supported martial law or were silent about their opposition to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important ballet genre was the contemporary opera-ballet, as exemplified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2510\">Luis Layag</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Survival of St Joan</em></strong>, 1973, with music by Smokerise and lyrics by James Lineberger. There was the impetus for original Filipino works in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a> opera and ballets. These were typified by Julie and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mahal</em></strong> (Beloved), 1975, with music by Abel Labrador and Mon Faustmann; Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/193\"><strong><em><strong>Tales of the Manuvu</strong></em></strong></a>, 1977, with music by Nonong Pedero and the Afterbirth; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/182\"><strong><em>Rama,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Hari</em></strong></a> (Rama, King), 1980, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>. The librettos of the latter two rock operas were by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballet choreography expanded in interesting ways during this period. Inspirations came from literature, history, folk songs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop music</a>, folklore, local customs, and actual events. <em><strong>Kulas na Batugan</strong></em> (Lazy Kulas), 1973, choreographed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2467\">Joji Felix-Velarde</a> to the music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a> upholds the New Society&rsquo;s Green Revolution and land reform program with a storyline about a lazy farmer who falls in love with a landlord&rsquo;s daughter. There were the various interpretations of the storyline of <em><strong>Carmen</strong></em> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2432\">Eric Cruz</a>, Eddie Elejar, and Alice Reyes in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/127\">1976</a>, 1980, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/128\">1984</a> respectively; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2524\">Lydia Madarang-Gaston</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/113\"><em><strong>Anak-Bulan</strong></em></a> (Moon Child), 1976. The promotion of Original Pilipino Music, an important development under the martial law regime, had an impact on dance as shown by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/162\"><em><strong>Limang Dipa</strong></em></a> (Five Armstretches) by Tony Fabella with music by Ryan Cayabyab. The piece was a romantic and humorous choreographed program on Manila&rsquo;s urban street life that brought together the folk and the pop in an eclectic style. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Cora Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a> created <em><strong>Baile de Ayer</strong></em> (Dance of Yesteryears) based on a scene written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3942\">Rodolfo Cornejo</a>. It is a tragic tale about exploitation and revenge involving a peasant girl taken by a rich man as payment for her father&rsquo;s debts. Another work based on Philippine literature is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><em><strong>Sisa</strong></em></a>, 1978, featuring the character from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a>. Also by Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, its music was by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4030\">Lucrecia Kasilag</a>. A patriotic choreography was Basilio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/159\"><em><strong>La Lampara</strong></em></a> (The Lamp), 1980, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3954\">Jerry Dadap</a> that dramatized the concluding moments of Rizal before his execution using the lamp as a metaphor. Another literature-based work was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/165\"><em><strong>Masks</strong></em></a>, 1981, by Eddie Elejar, inspired by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poem</a> about human relationships, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4165\">Ramon Santos</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/205\"><em><strong>Yerma</strong></em></a>, 1982, was a modern dance choreographed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan</a> with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3980\">Francisco Feliciano</a> based on Federico Garcia Lorca&rsquo;s three-act play (Fernandez 1981, 136, 145; Villaruz 1994; Villaruz 2005, 133).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballet with folkloric and historical themes, earlier pioneered by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, also became a major genre in Philippine ballet during martial law. The creation of works towards &ldquo;Filipino ballet&rdquo; became an important consideration because ballet companies who toured outside the country realized that various audiences abroad clamor for original dances with Filipino themes and flavors. It became clear that finding ethnic or national identity in dance was important in the global context. Gener Caringal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><em><strong>Ang Sultan</strong></em></a> (The Sultan), 1973, with music by Kasilag, was about the forbidden love between a Muslim royal lady and an ordinary man. Works inspired by history are typified by Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Rajah Sulayman</strong></em>, 1975, about the Muslim leader of Manila who challenged Spanish rule, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3914\">Alfredo Buenaventura</a>. Choreography based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> heroes and mythical characters include <em><strong>Lam-ang</strong></em>, 1974, by Generoso-I&ntilde;igo; <em><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></em>, 1985, by Caringal; and <em><strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></em>, 1979, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2544\">Effie Na&ntilde;as</a>. Basilio&rsquo;s three-part <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/201\"><em><strong>Tropical Tapestry</strong></em></a>, 1983, featured &ldquo;Paglalang&rdquo; (Creation) about the myth of Malakas and Maganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant development in this period was the brief but remarkable life of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2404\">Ballet Federation of the Philippines</a> in the mid-1970s. It organized the annual national ballet festival from 1976 to 1978 and produced several full-evening ballet classics and original Filipino works. It drew provincial groups to perform in Manila and toured the provinces with <strong><em>Coppelia</em></strong> and a divertissement repertoire (Villaruz 1997).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the growing nationwide protests after the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr on 21 Aug 1983, works in ballet mirrored the signs of the times. Basilio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/169\"><em><strong>Misa Filipina</strong></em></a> (Filipino Mass), 1984, portrayed the death of Ninoy Aquino using the elements of the Roman Catholic mass and the contemporary interpretation of Christ. It was performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> with music by Ryan Cayabyab sung by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4204\">UP Concert Chorus</a>. The song <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo;</a> (My Country) which was revived by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a> in the early 1980s became the anthem of nationalist and anti-Marcos protesters. It was interpreted by many dancers and performed in alternative venues (Fernandez 1981, 184; Villaruz 2005, 133-147, 259; Villaruz 1997; Villaruz 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"folkandindigenousdance\" name=\"folkandindigenousdance\"></a>Folk and Indigenous Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional dances continued to flourish in their places of origin among the indigenous peoples all over the archipelago. These dances were performed according to the needs of the community members in every phase of life from cradle to grave. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">Ritual dances</a> were performed to drive away angered or malevolent spirits in order to protect the people from sickness. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">Courtship dances</a> among men and women were endemic as forms of entertainment and socialization. Marriage ceremonies were filled with music playing and community dancing. Dances to entertain as well as teach the young about life skills such as fishing, planting rice, and gathering honey were part of the artistic expressions of the people. Those that mimic the movements of birds, monkeys, wild boar, or fish express the people&rsquo;s affinity with nature. Such indigenous dances define the cultural identities of each ethnolinguistic group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the national capital region, folk dance groups that appropriated elements of indigenous performances in their folkloric choreography played an important role in the New Society&rsquo;s cultural program. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> enjoyed the patronage of Imelda Marcos and basked in the position of being the premiere dance group of the totalitarian administration. The relationship between the Bayanihan and the First Lady harked back to the time when the young Imelda Romualdez vied for the title of Miss Manila in 1952 with the support of one of the founders of Bayanihan, Helena Benitez of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. When Imelda Romualdez married Ferdinand Marcos and eventually became First Lady in 1965, the Bayanihan was already the most internationally-renowned dance group. Imelda Marcos saw the Bayanihan&rsquo;s potential in boosting the image of martial law. It became the favored dance company given grander opportunities. Its leaders were appointed to official government positions.&nbsp;Bayanihan&rsquo;s music director, Lucrecia Kasilag, assumed the position of CCP artistic director and FAT president. Bayanihan&rsquo;s dance director, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2571\">Lucrecia Urtula</a>, was named FAT director. Its costume director, Isabel Santos, was also named FAT costume director. The group&rsquo;s stylized, glossy, and spectacular folk dance performances suited the taste of the First Lady. Bayanihan was always the first to be tapped as official performers for dignitaries and guests in Malaca&ntilde;an&nbsp;or the CCP. Its shows were effective in promoting the government&rsquo;s policies and programs. In 1973, the Ministry of Tourism sponsored Bayanihan performers to promote the Balikbayan (homecoming) program for Filipinos in America. Within the same year, the government sponsored the group in Italy, France, Greece, Switzerland, Germany, England, Spain, Scandinavia, Vienna, and Thailand. In the coming years, the Bayanihan represented the country in &ldquo;cultural missions&rdquo; and promoted the government in events such as folk dance festivals all over the world (Bayanihan 2003; Namiki 2007, 54-59, 60).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As FAT artistic director, Urtula revived the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society</a> in 1975 and conducted the annual National Folk Dance Workshop first launched at the Philippine Normal College. Attended by hundreds of public school teachers and folk dance practitioners from all over the archipelago, the annual workshop was later conducted at the FAT in partnership with the CCP and the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. The Society undertook projects like the publication of folk dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">researches</a> and fieldwork to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">document</a> folk dances (Arandez 1997).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the centralization of power and resources on one folk dance company, Philippine folk dance still grew in other directions with the formation of new dance groups. One such organization was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a>. The ROFG was born on the very day martial law was declared when the national emergency disrupted the job of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a> as artistic director of the official dance group of the Bureau of Customs. On that fateful day, Obusan decided to seriously continue his aesthetic and intellectual pursuits in dance in his own house in Pasay City. The Bicol-born Obusan was a fisheries graduate of the University of the Philippines, Diliman who taught at the Aklan Polytechnic Institute after graduation. In Aklan, he had the opportunity to observe local customs and traditional practices. His propensity for anthropology led him to enrol at the UP Diliman under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\">Dr Espiridion Arsenio Manuel</a>. He then joined the Bayanihan as instrumentalist and dancer in the 1960s. However, Obusan disapproved of how the Bayanihan staged Philippine folk dances with its highly stylized movements with emphasis on glamorized images of dancers donned in glittery <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costumes</a>. Soon, Obusan formed his own informal folk dance group so that he could mount dances gathered from his cultural researches, naming it Ramon Obusan Folkdance Group. Then he changed &ldquo;folk dance&rdquo; to &ldquo;folkloric&rdquo; in the late 1970s to signify the &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; of the group&rsquo;s performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obusan started the ROFG at the right time. Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s numerous cultural programs and tourism projects needed all the available dance groups to grace public events like diplomatic missions, international conferences, festivals, beauty contests, corporate activities, and opening ceremonies of institutions. Through these extensive exposures, Obusan&rsquo;s relatively authentic approach to folk dancing became known. Soon, the difference between the styles of the Bayanihan and the ROFG became distinct. Since Imelda Marcos was ROFG&rsquo;s patron, many opportunities unfolded for the dance group. By 1974, the ROFG performed in over 20 countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The ROFG created its own niche in Philippine dance by using a more authentic look in its production <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">design</a>, by enlisting the participation of dancers from indigenous communities, and by staging dances with a more anthropological approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obusan&rsquo;s works under the Marcos regime demonstrated the influence of the First Lady on his concepts. The ROFG had its own version of <em><strong>Malakas at Maganda</strong></em> (The Strong and the Beautiful) and its own version of <em><strong>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</strong></em> titled <em><strong>Noon Po sa Amin</strong></em> (Yesterday in Our Town) which is a choreography on Philippine history from precolonial to contemporary era. Obusan was a down-to-earth leader who knew how to deal with people in power. His closeness with Imelda Marcos did not affect his position in the postmartial law era. In fact, after the downfall of Marcos, the ROFG was named official folk dance group of the CCP by the succeeding dispensation of Corazon Aquino (Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group 2015; Namiki 2007, 54-59).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the luxurious hotels that were built in key cities of the country, especially in Metro Manila, needed shows that offered cultural entertainment to attract tourists. Thus the late 1970s saw the spread of cultural shows in hotels, restaurants, and tourist sites all over the country. An example of a dance group involved in this type of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/50\">cultural dancing</a> is the Folklorico Filipino Dance Company established in the 1960s with dance suites influenced by the choreographies of the Bayanihan and the ROFG (Kultura Filipino 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dance groups that were formed in the earlier period continued to prosper, as exemplified by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2445\">Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe</a> based in MSU, Marawi City in Lanao del Sur. In the Visayas, the Kaanyag Pilipinas Dance Company was reorganized from the West Negros College Dance Company in 1975. The company had performed outside of Negros Occidental at the Luce Auditorium in Silliman University, 1977 and 1979; the Portopia &lsquo;81 Exposition in Kobe and a tour of Hyogo, Osaka and Port Islands, Japan, 1981; the Philippine Folk Festival at the Folk Arts Theater, 1981. Another group that expanded in the period was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2514\">Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</a>, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2558\">Teresita Pil</a>. At the time, it was the only Philippine regional dance group which garnered international recognition by winning the silver medal at the International Folklore Festival in Dijon, France, in 1980. In the National Capital Region, school-based dance companies like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2614\">UP Filipiniana Dance Group</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2612\">University of the East Dance Troupe</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2611\">UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe</a> continued their folk dance training and performances. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2465\">Far Eastern University Dance Group</a> also flourished at the time until it disbanded in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The declaration of martial law disallowed any form of public gathering even in the most remote areas of the country. The curtailment of the freedom of assembly aborted the premiere of a modern interpretation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s 1879 play, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/532\"><em><strong>El Consejo de los Dioses</strong></em></a> (Council of the Gods) in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi. The cancelled dance-drama was directed and choreographed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a> using <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\">pangalay</a> movement vocabulary (Amilbangsa 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tawi-Tawi was part of the Sulu Archipelago which was once the Sulu Sultanate&rsquo;s center of power. Historically, the Muslim Filipinos enjoyed a sovereign existence recognized by the colonizers under the sultanates of Sulu and Maguindanao. Two centuries before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, &ldquo;a vibrant and flourishing civilization&rdquo; thrived in Mindanao and Sulu archipelago (Buendia 2006; Wadi quoted in Rimban 2015). The sultanates&rsquo; high level of civilization can be seen from the exquisite dances, music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, arts, and crafts. These artistic expressions were documented by Fernando Amilbangsa who, in 1964, married Datu Punjungan Amilbangsa, a younger brother of Sultan Mohammad Amirul Ombra Amilbangsa of Sulu. A native of Marikina and a Christian, Fernando Amilbangsa embraced the local culture of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Samal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a> ethnic groups. She was lucky to have lived in Jolo before the carnage in Feb 1974 when the island capital was burned down by combined land, naval, and air forces. In the time of peace before 1972, she was able to witness dances in Jolo. She transferred to Tawi-Tawi two years before martial law, navigating the islands to witness obscure dances and rituals, and to conduct interviews among elders and local artists. In 1974, she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2604\">Tambuli Cultural Troupe (TCT)</a> based in the Mindanao State University, Bongao in Tawi-Tawi. The TCT became the performance laboratory to test her primary researches on three dance forms: the martial art called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/68\"><strong>langka</strong></a>, the song-dance called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/69\"><strong>lunsay</strong></a>, and the dominant dance style called <strong>pangalay</strong> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>igal</strong></a>. Variants of the pangalay were staged from field research, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>bula&rsquo;bula</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>tariray</strong></a> (bamboo or shell clapper dances), <strong>tauti</strong> (occupational dance on catching catfish), <strong>pangalay ha agung</strong> (dance on top of a big <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>igal ha pattung</strong></a> (dance on elevated twin bamboo poles). Fernando Amilbangsa also documented the ritual and shamanic dances such as the <strong>magjinn</strong>, <strong>magjuwata</strong>, <strong>magomboh</strong>, <strong>magsalba</strong>, and <strong>magpugot</strong>. These became part of the TCT repertoire brought to Manila in 1974 with performances in major institutions and universities such as the University of the Philippines, Diliman. In 1976, Fernando Amilbangsa mounted the group&rsquo;s first major production at the CCP. Art critics, the media, and the diplomatic corps in Manila welcomed the unknown dances staged in appealing yet primordial manner, which was also a testament to the sophisticated culture of the ethnic groups whose art and culture were being annihilated by the ongoing war. In the context of martial law, the warm reception accorded to the TCT gave hope and pride to the peoples of the Southern Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizing the dances of the South as a unique Filipino expression, Fernando Amilbangsa was invited by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> starting in 1977 to teach pangalay to its members. In 1978, Fernando Amilbangsa joined the Mindanao State University in Iligan City as faculty member. Here, she was chair and cofounder of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild</a> which also utilized pangalay and langka for its theatrical performances (Amilbangsa 1983, 13-52; Amilbangsa 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance research and publications in the martial law period were mainly on folk and indigenous dances. Juan C. Miel published <em><strong>Samar Folk Dances</strong></em>, 1973. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2598\">Jovita Sison-Friese</a> produced <em><strong>Philippine Folk Dances from Pangasinan</strong></em>, 1980. Teresita Pascua-Ines came up with <em><strong>Ilocano Folk Dances</strong></em>, 1973. Obusan documented his researches using video, which helped in the staging of the dances for the ROFG. Fernando Amilbangsa published a comprehensive research on the dances of the Tausug, Samal, Sama Dilaut, and Jama Mapun of the Sulu Archipelago in her book <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/15\"><em><strong>Pangalay: Traditional Dances and Related Folk Artistic Expressions</strong></em></a>, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissent under martial law became more powerful and meaningful through dance. One concrete example happened in 1981 during a commemorative gathering in Bugnay, Kalinga in honor of the slain Kalinga leader, Macliing Dulag. The celebration was punctuated by music playing and community dancing. The gathering became a yearly event held in far-flung villages until it culminated in the launch of the first Cordillera Day on 24 Apr 1985 at Belwang Sadanga, Mt Province. The first Cordillera Day was a momentous event held a year before the downfall of Marcos. Representatives from various sectors and peoples organizations supporting the cause of the Cordillera peoples converged to celebrate the victories in the anti-Chico Dam and anti-Cellophil movements. On this occasion, various Cordillera dances were performed. One of these was the Kalinga dance called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/76\"><strong>pallo-ok</strong></a> which is performed during the&nbsp;<em>bodong&nbsp;</em>(peace pact). In pallo-ok, men dance playing the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gangsa</a> or bronze gong as women execute specific footwork with extended arm positions, moving in various circular and linear formations, following the leader. After the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986, the second Cordillera Day was held in the town center of Bontoc to express the people&rsquo;s victory in the overthrow of the dictatorship. Since the first Cordillera Day in 1981, the annual event has been an intertribal celebration with dancing, rituals, gong-playing, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chanting</a> to express important political issues of the Cordillera peoples (Bolinget 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"streetdance\" name=\"streetdance\"></a>Street Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourism utilized ethnic symbols and rituals as exotic attractions to lure tourists, resulting in the commercialization and hybridization of indigenous dances and rituals. A case in point is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a>&rsquo;s Kaamulan. To local communities, kaamulan means any gathering for a specific purpose like a wedding, a rice harvest, or a community prayer. Under the regime&rsquo;s policy of creating events with high touristic value, kaamulan was chosen as a &ldquo;municipal event&rdquo; in 1974. The policy led to the revision of kaamulan&rsquo;s original meaning and intention. It was transformed into Kaamulan Festival with spectacular elements like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">street dancing</a> competition choreographed by outsiders and danced by performers sponsored by politicians. Commissioned choreographers would usually add pageantry because they consider the ritualistic indigenous dances as monotonous and ineffective for theatrical purposes. Tourism thus developed and legitimized a new breed of choreographers who were not mindful of cultural traditions and were wont to invent dance steps and movements to augment or replace the traditional ones (Ope&ntilde;a 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a grander scale than Kaamulan is the Ati-atihan Festival celebrated every January as a devotion to the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. The policy of promoting mass tourism after 1972 resulted in the transformation of the precolonial tradition into a weeklong event with highly theatricalized performances. Branded as the &ldquo;Filipino Mardi Gras,&rdquo; the festival culminates with a street dancing contest where dancers are transformed using fantastic costumes and makeup (Peterson 2011). The pageantry that characterizes the martial law festivals extends to other festivities that venerate the Santo Ni&ntilde;o such as the Sinulog and the Dinagyang. The commercialization and theatrical performance of ethnic rites for the sake of tourism is a legacy of martial law which has been adopted by succeeding administrations until the 2010s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revelry and pageantry had become the blueprint of local festivals, a practice that may suit other social purposes. In the early 1980s, the sugar industry under the monopoly control of Marcos cronies collapsed. Plantation owners were bankrupt. The sugar workers and their families were destitute and hungry. Then in another tragic turn, 700 Negrenses perished in the sinking of Don Juan passenger ship. It was a time of great despair. To dispel the depression that swept over Negros Occidental, the city officials of Bacolod along with local artists initiated a big fiesta which they called MassKara, after the English term for &ldquo;many people&rdquo; and the Spanish term for &quot;face.&quot; In an effort to lift their sinking spirits, some 450,000 people of the Bacolod danced and paraded in the streets garbed in colorful and outlandish attire, wearing masks with big smiles. Since then, the MassKara festival has been celebrated in October of every year (Lonely Planet 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the good image generated by tourism for the totalitarian rule, critics abroad continued to expose the human rights violations and corruption of the government through foreign media. To offset the bad publicity caused by the international press, the government launched the&nbsp;<em>balikbayan&nbsp;</em>(homecoming) program. Taglines and messages were developed to promote the program. Tourism public relations managers thought of ways to lure Filipino expats to visit the country. Filipinos abroad were lured to come back during Christmas because the Philippines had the longest yuletide season. Local governments were instructed to develop spectacular festivals, and the balikbayan were given tax exemptions and big travel fare discounts. Majority of the balikbayan came from the US. Many were hungry for the local fiesta and the street dancing which were the highlights of the touristic activities (Apostolopoulos et al 2013, 239-240).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"culturaldance\" name=\"culturaldance\"></a>Cultural Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The entertainment business is one of the opportunities for OFWs. Hundreds of thousands of Filipino entertainers, majority of them women, worked abroad either as singers or cultural dancers mostly in Japan, and in other Asian, Middle Eastern, and European countries. Their dancing included Philippine folk dances, jazzed up folk, Hawaiian, feathered follies, current popular dances, and novelty dances. Among these overseas workers were the &ldquo;Japayuki,&rdquo; a coined term with derisive connotations for the Filipina entertainer in Japan. The Asian country was the most common destination of cultural dancers, a trend that started in the late 1970s. This was a period of continued economic growth for Japan resulting in the demand for cultural dancers, vocalists, and hostesses in Japanese night clubs and hotels. Most of these exported performers had little training and experience in dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the legitimate recruiters who trained cultural dancers for overseas employment was Bella Dimayuga. She established the Bellestar Promotions, Inc to recruit young and pretty women wanting to become performing artists, providing training in her studio (ZoomInfo 2015). Dimayuga learned the essentials of the cultural dancing business in the 1960s. At the age of 16, she passed stringent measures to qualify as a cultural dancer in Las Vegas. She was among the dancers recruited to be part of the Philippine Dance Festival Company managed by Steve Parker, then the husband of Hollywood star, Shirley MacLaine. Having gained experience in dancing overseas, Dimayuga cofounded the Mabuhay Dance Troupe which offered cultural shows to several Asian countries with a repertoire on folk dances such as <strong>maglalatik</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a>. Thus, she gained valuable experience in the cultural dancing industry to become the &ldquo;impresario&rdquo; of local dancers who were deployed in overseas entertainment jobs that include performances in luxury cruise liners. She exported talents to the United States, Europe, and Asia. When Japan became a major destination for cultural performers, Dimayuga founded Bellestar Promotions to respond to the demand for entertainers in Japan. Dubbed as &ldquo;Bellestar dancers,&rdquo; her performers underwent months of training with a fixed curriculum of dancing and value formation aimed at preparing amateur talents to become migrant workers in Japan (UNTV 2014). These positive efforts did not offset the huge negative connotation of being a &ldquo;Japayuki.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the negative aspects of cultural dancing like vulnerability to sexual exploitation, the fact remains that the dollars brought in by these girls and women helped the Philippine economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"socialdance\" name=\"socialdance\"></a>Social Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">Social dances</a> were widely promoted through television. TV dancing was helpful in normalizing the situation under martial law. Dance shows and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1372\">variety programs</a> with a lot of dance segments were among the highly rated shows in the period. <em><strong>Penthouse Seven</strong></em> aired in 1974 on GMA Channel 7, first hosted by Archie Lacson with different female hosts. The show had an instructional segment that demonstrated the latest dance craze to TV <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/65/1376\">audiences</a>: pop dances such as the robot, the bump, the L.A. walk, the hustle, and the swing (Salterio 2008). The dance show became more popular when it was hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4101\">Martin Nievera</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3984\">Pops Fernandez</a> and re-launched as <em><strong>Penthouse ... Live!</strong></em>, starting in 1982 at GMA Channel 7. An afternoon TV show dedicated to disco music and dance was <em><strong>Discorama</strong></em>, 1975, which aired over GMA Channel 7 hosted by Bobby Ledesma and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4807\">Joey de Leon</a>. The show was barely <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/65/1374\">rating</a> until De Leon invited his buddies Vic and Tito Sotto to co-host the show (PEP Forum 2015). The 1980s saw the popularity of variety shows hosted by dancing stars. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> hosted and danced in <em><strong>VIP (Vilma in Person)</strong></em>. Alma Moreno was dubbed as the &ldquo;Tangga Queen&rdquo; as she danced wearing the skimpy underwear in shows like <em><strong>The Other Side of Alma</strong></em>, <em><strong>Rated A</strong></em> and <em><strong>Loveli-Ness</strong></em> (Francisco 2009; Donato 2014). TV dancing was a lucrative profession. Dance companies dedicated to TV dancing were formed during the period such as Penthouse Seven Dancers, Maribeth Bichara and the VIP Dancers, Disco Fantasy, Vicor Dancers, and Hotlegs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social dancing with emphasis on disco became a craze with the influence of Original Pilipino Music (OPM). The latter gave birth to the Manila Sound music genre. The promotion of OPM through mass media was a policy of the Marcos government and is considered the light and happy side of the martial law era. Manila Sound produced music for social dancing, particularly for disco, swing, rock and roll, and Latin pop dances. Manila Sound defined the 1970s, typified by songs such as &ldquo;Aawitin Mo, Isasayaw Ko&rdquo; (Sing It and I will Dance It), &ldquo;Magsayawan&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Dance), &ldquo;Disco Fever,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Swing it, Baby&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4231\">VST &amp; Company</a>; &ldquo;Manila, Manila,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bongga Ka &rsquo;Day&rdquo; (You&rsquo;re Fabulous, Girl), &ldquo;Annie Batungbakal&rdquo; by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4012\">Hotdog</a>; &ldquo;Ang Boyfriend Kong Baduy&rdquo; by Cinderella; and &ldquo;No Touch&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4025\">Juan de la Cruz Band</a>. Disco bars and clubs proliferated in the period. Top-billing the list was Ernest Santiago&rsquo;s Coco Banana which was enshrined in the song &ldquo;Annie Batungbakal&rdquo; by the pop group Hotdog. Coco Banana was the dancing bar for intellectuals, bohemians, fashion enthusiasts, and socialites. Meanwhile, the building spree of luxury hotels at the time did not ignore the disco mania. Every decent hotel was expected to have a good disco club. Famous disco places in the 1970s were Stargazer in Silahis International Hotel, Where Else in Hotel Intercontinental, Isis in Hyatt Regency, Lost Horizon at the Philippine Plaze Hotel, and Another World at the Manila Garden Hotel (Samonte 2014; Sioson-San Juan 2007; Loyola Diaries 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hollywood dance movies hit Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">cinema houses</a> with high box-office returns, led by <em><strong>Saturday Night Fever</strong></em>, 1977. The movie fueled the disco craze even more with its introduction of the hustle performed in partner or line formations. Subsequent foreign dance films like <em><strong>Fame</strong></em> in 1980, <em><strong>Flashdance</strong></em> in 1983, and <em><strong>Footloose</strong></em> in 1984, further promoted disco dancing. Local <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1087\">film production</a> flourished under martial law and ushered in the &ldquo;second golden age of Philippine cinema&rdquo; that engendered various film genres, among which were the movies inspired by OPM hits and disco. Vilma Santos had the most number of dance films starting with <em><strong>Let&rsquo;s Do the Salsa</strong></em> opposite Walter Navarro and Rolly Quizon in 1976; <em><strong>Disco Fever</strong></em> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4385\">Christopher de Leon</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3043\">Cocoy Laurel</a> in 1978; <em><strong>Rock, Baby, Rock</strong></em> with Spanish actor-singer Junior and Rolly Quizon; and <em><strong>Swing It, Baby</strong></em> opposite <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4723\">Romeo Vasquez</a>, both in 1979; and <em><strong>Good Morning, Sunshine</strong></em> also with Junior in 1980. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> danced as the character Annie in <em><strong>Annie Batungbakal</strong></em>, 1979, with Lloyd Samartino. Rio Locsin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4703\">Lorna Tolentino</a>, Junior, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4672\">Charo Santos</a> were cast in <em><strong>Disco Madhouse</strong></em>, 1980. Majority of the dance scenes in the foregoing films were choreographed by Geleen Eugenio. Youth-oriented <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1068\">comedy films</a> such as <em><strong>Pabling</strong></em> (Playboy) and <em><strong>Blue Jeans</strong></em> in 1981 were replete with dance sequences. The former showcased the dancing prowess of partners <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4691\">Maricel Soriano</a> and William Martinez while the latter featured an elaborate dance scene with singing trio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3868\">APO Hiking Society</a> and screen sweethearts Alfie Anido and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4300\">Dina Bonnevie</a>. In 1984, <em><strong>Bagets</strong></em> (Young Ones) showed a teenage <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4563\">Aga Muhlach</a> dancing like Michael Jackson (Star for all Seasons Filmography 2015; IMDb Annie Batungbakal 1979; Balbuena 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Manila Sound entertained the masses, the 1980s also saw the spectacular influence of Michael Jackson (MJ) on Filipino audiences with his <em><strong>Thriller</strong></em> album and singles such as &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; and &ldquo;Billie Jean,&rdquo; all released in 1982. These hits were accompanied by groundbreaking music videos that showcased the international idol&rsquo;s <strong>popping</strong> moves and signature dance steps. MJ dance patterns became the craze: zombie moves, pelvic thrusts, crotch grabs, head and foot walks, heel grooves, and the classic MJ moonwalk. In 1982, singer-dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4213\">Gary Valenciano</a> rose to popularity with his own popping gestures derivative of MJ&rsquo;s style. The popping style which developed from California in the 1960s influenced funk, break dancing, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\">hip-hop</a>&mdash;genres that became popular in the country starting in the early 1980s (Goot 2015; Sony Music Entertainment 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"danceintheater\" name=\"danceintheater\"></a>Dance in Theater</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The historic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> was expanded and renovated in the 1970s. Its luxurious Fiesta Pavillion which could accommodate over 2000 guests was the venue of grand musical revues about the city of Manila for three consecutive years. The big-budgeted productions featured song and dance sequences choreographed by Alice Reyes utilizing the cleverly designed costumes by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a> that allowed instant transformations which amazed and delighted audiences. With <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3211\">Leo Rialp</a> as the over-all director, the continuing theme on Manila was developed in three production concepts: <em><strong>Manila, Manila: As Time Goes By</strong></em>, 1977, scripted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4972\">Nestor Torre</a>; <em><strong>Manila, Manila: Doon Po sa Amin</strong></em> (Manila, Manila: In Our Place), 1978, scripted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>; and <em><strong>Manila, Manila: Ngayon at Kailanman</strong></em> (Manila, Manila: Now and Always), 1979, scripted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a> (Tiongson 2007, 257-59).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imelda Marcos restored the Metropolitan Theater (Met) in 1978. The Met&rsquo;s first offering was produced by Kabataang Baranggay titled <em><strong>Isang Munting Alamat</strong></em> about the evolution of the Filipino race with verse, music, and dance. Conchita Chuidian Sunico was the Met&rsquo;s executive director from 1978 to 1986. Sunico was a pre-World War II beauty queen and a socialite tasked to build a mass-oriented Met. A seasoned producer of grand operas and musicals, Sunico revived the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\"><em><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></em></a> (The Flirt) and <em><strong>Ang Palabas Bukas</strong></em> (The Show Tomorrow), both in 1979. The new venue became the home base of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2536\">Metropolitan Dance Theater Company</a> under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2408\">Veda Ba&ntilde;ez</a> who staged the company&rsquo;s first concert in 1982. Some of the succeeding productions were <em><strong>Tintinnabulation</strong></em>, 1983; <em><strong>The Great White Way I</strong></em> and <em><strong>The Mikado</strong></em>, 1983; <em><strong>Cats</strong></em>, 1984; and&nbsp;<em><strong>Aristocrats</strong></em>, 1985. Significant productions were original musicals like <em><strong>Batibot</strong></em>, 1979; <em><strong>Kapinangan</strong></em>, 1981; <em><strong>Gomburza</strong></em>, 1982; and <em><strong>Ewagan</strong></em>, 1984. These were dazzling and expensive productions that did not make money, and were deemed by anti-Marcos protesters as frivolous and insensitive to the plight of the majority who were hungry and oppressed, particularly since the Met is located in the heart of Manila amid the hurry and flurry of ordinary people who neither had time nor money to watch shows which generally offered &ldquo;extravaganzas&rdquo; with dancers, stars, and a full orchestra. After the Aquino assassination, the Met was perceived by the critical majority as a symbol of decadence amid the political upheaval. It was ironic that while expensive productions were being shown at the Met, rallies were being launched across the street at the Liwasang Bonifacio&mdash;one of the favorite converging grounds of demonstrators during the anti-Marcos protest movement after the 1983 Aquino assassination (Magno 2015; Quintos 2012; Philstar 2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater groups that were critical of martial law had to veil their dissent using historical characters, biblical stories, folklore, and allegory. Nationalistic theater organizations like the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) used theater and dance as an instrument of counterculture against martial law. Before martial law, the company produced plays critical of the Marcos administration, as exemplified by <em><strong>Ai&rsquo;dao</strong></em>, 1972, about Muslim Filipino characters who chose to rebel after experiencing terrible injustice. When PETA&rsquo;s founder, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2977\">Cecile Guidote</a>, left the country to elude arrest, PETA continued its mission to use theater to educate and to raise social awareness about the ills of society. However, due to the surveillance of military intelligence on groups and organizations, PETA had to conceal its critical messages. From 1973 to 1977, PETA employed dance, movement, and martial arts in the staging of its political plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s basic training on creative body movement was based on Rudolf Laban&rsquo;s Eight Basic Efforts. Additionally, PETA developed its own pool of martial artists who learned basic martial arts like kung fu, karate, and kuntaw. PETA&rsquo;s pool of martial artists included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5428\">Emman Lacaba</a>, Edipolo Erosido, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2831\">Katsch Catoy</a>, Laura Catoy, Robert Montalban, Jojo Purisima, Greg Sta. Inez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3368\">Jack Yabut</a>, George and Robert Atutubo. Cirilo Bawer introduced Kalinga dance movements and used these in <em><strong>Bodong</strong></em>, 1976. The members of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> from MSU-Marawi also shared their knowledge on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> dances and martial arts. Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa held pangalay dance workshops from 1977 to 1979, and thus infused the aesthetics of Philippine traditional dance in PETA plays. Pangalay postures and gestures became &ldquo;a major stream of dance theater language.&rdquo; Fernando Amilbangsa introduced the dance form as the choreographic tool for productions like <em><strong>Ang Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</strong></em>, 1977, an adaptation of <em><strong>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</strong></em>. The pangalay training prepared PETA artists for the mounting of historical dance dramas like <em><strong>Rajah Sulayman</strong></em> and <em><strong>Megat Salamat</strong></em>, 1978, and the major production, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/606\"><em><strong>May-i, May-i</strong></em></a>, 1979, about Manila under the reign of Muslim leader Raha Sulayman from a scenario written by Emman Lacaba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, PETA&rsquo;s youth arm known as the Metropolitan Teen Theater League (MTTL)&nbsp;was adept in using allegory and history in productions that were highly critical of martial law. MTTL members utilized song, dance, improvisation, and creative movements to create original plays critical of the regime and of society&rsquo;s basic ills. These plays were generally episodic and stylized, coming from the modes of expressionism and epic theater that used character types to represent sectors and classes in society. <em><strong>Kasi Babae Raw</strong></em> (Because She&#39;s a Woman), 1975, exposed the commercialization and oppression of women; <em><strong>Juanang Tamad</strong></em> (Lazy Juana), 1976, criticized militarization in the school campus; and <em><strong>Kuwentuhan Tatlo: Maria Makiling, Ibaloy, Busol</strong></em> (Three Stories: Maria Makiling, Ibaloy, Busol) used folktales and legends to oppose authoritarian rule. In 1978, MTTL produced <em><strong>Salaming Nahihibang at ang Epiko ng Punong Sinilya</strong></em> (Mad Mirror and the Epic of the Chaired Leader) and <em><strong>Sampung mga Daliri</strong></em> (Ten Fingers).The former was critical of how the government concealed Manila&rsquo;s poor population while spending billions on the construction of hotels and condominiums. The latter portrayed the historical role of the youth in spearheading change and toppling a repressive order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mime was introduced earlier to PETA by Rolf Scharre in 1970, followed by Jojo Purisima in 1980. Purisima&rsquo;s training produced <em><strong>Mima, Maskara, at Drama</strong></em> (Mime, Mask, and Drama) in 1981. Folk dance, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a>, modern dance, and ballet were used in PETA plays. Modern dance influence mainly came from the CCP modern dance training workshops under Alice Reyes. The dancers and movers trained in the foregoing dance forms include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2930\">Mary Joan Fajardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3048\">Maribel Legarda</a>, Jojo Atienza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3042\">Connie Lauigan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3227\">Ditchay Roxas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2840\">Apo Chua</a>, Mimi Villareal, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2748\">Gamay Arkoncel</a>. Maribel Legarda emerged as a choreographer for productions using an eclectic mix of dance forms from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/46\"><em>bodabil</em></a> and Hispanic, folk, and contemporary dance forms. Such eclecticism was characteristic of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/527\"><em><strong>Canuplin</strong></em></a>, 1980; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><em><strong>Pilipinas Circa 1907</strong></em></a> (Philippines Circa 1907), 1982; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/626\"><em><strong>Nukleyar I and II</strong></em></a> (Nuclear I and II), 1982/1985; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/628\"><em><strong>Oratoryo ng Bayan</strong></em></a> (People&rsquo;s Oratorio), 1983 (Samson et al 2008, 3, 47, 74, 90, 156-58, 189, 662-65).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PETA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/56/496\">training</a> arm, the Center for Integrated Theater Arts in Southeast Asia (CITASA), was instrumental in organizing theater groups in communities that exposed and opposed the military rule starting in 1976. Its outreach workshops were sponsored by the progressive Church sector in the provinces. The church-based performing groups used creative drama, music, and dance to create presentations aimed at raising awareness among the masses. For instance, PETA-CITASA&rsquo;s training in Negros was supported by the diocese through the initiative of Fr Alan Abadesco who spearheaded the formation of Teatro Pangkatilingban (Community Theater). Fr Abadesco later cofounded the Negros Theater Guild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Mindanao, &ldquo;theater of liberation&rdquo; materialized as early as 1969 through the efforts of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2953\">Fr Dong Galenzoga</a> in Lanao del Norte and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2961\">Karl Gaspar</a> in Davao del Sur. Both used dance theater to organize Basic Christian Communities. In particular, Galenzoga formed a group called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3025\">Kolambugan Dance Theater</a> based in Kolambugan town. The group drew its members from a mixed community of Christians and Muslims. It utilized Maranao folklore in their storytelling through dance drama. The group was invited to perform in various places in Visayas and Luzon in 1974-75 (Van Erven 1992, 76, 80-81).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1980s, especially after the Aquino assassination in 1983, theater groups became more overt and daring in their anti-dictatorship messages. UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3166\">Peryante</a> was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/478\">street theater</a> group which performed in tandem with a singing group called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4116\">Patatag</a>. Composed of students and young cultural activists, they popularized the &ldquo;song-and-movement&rdquo; street performance called <strong>kilos-awit</strong>. This form of creative protest action became popular during the street rallies after the 1983 Aquino assassination. Peryante and Patatag performed kilos-awit during the yellow confetti rallies held at the business district of Makati. It was also a favorite number in the more militant mobilizations at the steps of the national <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office</a> in Liwasang Bonifacio, or at Mendiola near Malaca&ntilde;an. The kilos-awit was performed to boost the morale of striking workers in picket lines, or to add color to long people&rsquo;s marches such as the Lakbayan organized against the Bataan nuclear power plant. It was a defiant form of protest and was part of mass rallies that were illegal at the time, unless protesters apply for a permit&mdash;which was almost always denied. The requirement for a permit did not stop protesters from holding rallies. Personalities like Sen Lorenzo Ta&ntilde;ada, human rights lawyer Rene Saguisag, socialite Tingting Cojuangco, businessman Butz Aquino (brother of Ninoy Aquino), and publisher Chino Roces were in the frontlines of demonstrations to negotiate with riot police armed with phalanxes, truncheons, guns, and water cannons. In such moments of high tension, the kilos-awit performances diffused anxiety (Quimpo 2012, 354-62).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979, a group of concerned artists called Tambisan sa Sining (Interaction in Arts) embarked on a mission to support workers on strike by serenading to raise funds. They also organized factory and service workers into cultural groups. Tambisan conducted training in music and theater, using body movement and gestures to amplify the meanings of cause-oriented songs. In 1982, the group mounted <em><strong>Awit, Tula, at Kasaysayan</strong></em> (Songs, Poems, and History) which was shown nationwide in factories, communities, and trade union meetings, as well as in key cities in Japan. Performers interpreted a wide selection of songs ranging from lively songs of The Beatles to the proletarian anthem known as &ldquo;Internasyunal,&rdquo; choreographed with the waving of red banners and flag of the Communist Party of the Philippines. In the same year, Tambisan produced <em><strong>Sigaw ng Bayan</strong></em> (Cry of the People) with an audience of 25,000 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a>. The performance utilized dance and body movements to dramatize the history of the Katipunan and the 1896 revolution. Other productions were <em><strong>Alay sa Manggagawa</strong></em> (An Offering to Workers), 1982, and <em><strong>Kara y Krus at Iba pang Kuwento</strong></em> (Heads and Crosses, and other Stories) that explained the need to boycott the 1984 presidential elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anti-dictatorship movement was a rainbow coalition of political forces ranging from radical to reformist groups. The broad alliance emboldened artists who mounted performances which openly militated against the regime. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>, PETA, and other artists&rsquo; organizations joined hands to convene MAKIISA, the First National Theater and People&rsquo;s Festival on Theater and Culture in December 1983 held at the Dulaang Rajah Sulayman in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, Intramuros, Manila. MAKIISA aimed to consolidate the various initiatives of artists and cultural groups against the repressive regime. It also sought to promote and broaden &ldquo;the cause for a nationalist and mass-oriented Philippine arts and culture.&rdquo; The five-day festival held workshops on various arts that include music, mime, and traditional dances. Tropang Bodabil&rsquo;s <em><strong>Dalawang Anino sa Liwanag</strong></em> (Two Shadows in the Light) portrayed how a young revolutionary was held and liquidated by the military. Also in the bodabil tradition was the Negros Theater League&rsquo;s <em><strong>Sakada</strong></em> (Seasonal Sugarcane Plantation Workers), which offered hilarious improvisations that depict the day-to-day struggles of sugar workers. <em><strong>Sakada</strong></em>&rsquo;s finale was a choreography in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mime</a> showing how a militant organizer decides to join the armed struggle. In Makiisa II, 1984, the Sining Malay Ensemble presented <em><strong>Lemlunay</strong></em>, an eclectic play that depicted the struggles of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> community against incursion of lowlanders and big logging companies (Van Erven 1992, 77-8, 84-5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, Philippine economy and politics remained highly vulnerable as institutional changes were in progress and political forces were realigning. Under the new administration, the Metropolitan Theater produced a musical titled <em><strong>EDSA</strong></em>. Cash-strapped by the end of the Marcos regime, the Met raised funds by serving as a venue for TV dance variety shows like <em><strong>Vilma!</strong></em> hosted by film star Vilma Santos which premiered over GMA network in 1986. Meanwhile, the CCP opened its doors to groups that were anathema to its elitist programs under the previous regime. With a new leadership, the CCP gave space to militant presentations such as Tambisan&rsquo;s <em><strong>Mayo Uno ng Ating Paglaya</strong></em> (May First of Our Freedom) which was performed to an audience of workers (Tambisan sa Sining 2015). PETA&rsquo;s <em><strong>Panata sa Kalayaan</strong></em> (Oath to Freedom), a product of MAKIISA, was also staged at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP Main Theater</a> to celebrate the victories of the 1986 EDSA Revolt. <em><strong>Panata</strong></em> summarized two decades of cultural work to topple the totalitarian regime (Samson et al 2008, 3, 47, 74, 90, 156-58, 189, 266-69). However, the euphoria from the victory of EDSA Revolt dwindled just months after February, especially in the rural areas where the new dispensation barely made an impact on the lives of the masses. By September 1986, the Negros Theater League produced an original play titled <em><strong>Negros After February &rsquo;86</strong></em>, which portrayed how militarization and poverty still continued after the EDSA Revolt (Magno 2015; Quintos 2012; <em><strong>Philstar</strong></em> 2008; Van Erven 1992, 79).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The martial law era was a momentous historical period that engendered the development of Philippine dance. The polarized forces in Philippine society became the catalysts for the growth of existing and new dance forms; and the development of dancers, choreographers, researchers, and dance organizations all over the country. In retrospect, the short span of 14 years under dictatorial rule produced a rich harvest of new works and dance forms that were superior in form and/or content. Ironically, the dark and repressive years deepened awareness of how Philippine dance forms could be used to express ideas about socio-economic and political conditions. Martial law sharpened the need to reassess Philippine history, to rediscover traditional culture, and to redefine nationalism and the Filipino identity.&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3090\">Rosalie S.

				"value": "Three years before the declaration of martial law, the State already prepared its art and culture institutions that could complement and lend an amiable face to an authoritarian rule. In 1969, amid mounting political unrest and criticism against the Marcos administration, the <a href=\"/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> was built to focus on the performing arts such as <a href=\"/6/46/37\">ballets</a>, <a href=\"/5/35/786\">operas</a>, and <a href=\"/5/36/802\">orchestra</a> concerts. The CCP was part of the strategy of then First Lady Imelda Marcos to gain international recognition for the Philippines. The CCP also fitted the plan to make the country a hub for international events and a haven for tourists. During its inauguration, the CCP commissioned the creation of <a href=\"/6/49/168\"><strong><em><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></em></strong></a>, 1969, by several <a href=\"/6/47/27\">dance companies</a> led by <a href=\"/6/6/2444\">Dance Theater Philippines</a>. <strong><em>Mir-i-nisa</em></strong> was a grand ballet production based on <a href=\"/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&#x2019;s love story involving Muslim Filipino characters. The CCP also became the home base of <a href=\"/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a> who created <a href=\"/6/46/74\">modern dance</a> <a href=\"/6/47/26\">choreography</a> in 1970 starting with the <strong><em>First Modern Dance Concert</em></strong> and followed by <a href=\"/6/49/152\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Itim</strong> Asu</strong></em></strong></a> (Onyx Wolf) based on <a href=\"/9/9/5522\">Virgie Moreno</a>&#x2019;s provocative play that fuses historical facts with fiction. Despite the encouragement to use native themes with western art forms, the State&#x2019;s culture and arts program was labelled as elitist and colonial by Marcos&#x2019;s political rivals and by militant youth activists who were then relentlessly staging huge political rallies that often ended up in violent dispersals."

				"value": "Dance and <a href=\"/7/55/449\">drama</a> were used as effective tools of protest in the big rallies led by student activists in Manila during the eve of martial law. The battle cry of youth activists then was to resolve the fundamental problems of the Filipino people, namely, American &#x201C;imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism&#x201D; (Guerrero 1970, 40-68). Red Banner dances, an influence from the art forms of Mao Tse Tung&#x2019;s Chinese Cultural Revolution, were the usual <a href=\"/6/47/26\">choreography</a> that complemented marching <a href=\"/5/35/791\">protest songs</a>. One of the most daring face-offs between the State and the student demonstrators happened right at the corridor of CCP. The Konsehong Tagapag-ugnay ng Rebolusyonaryong Sining led militant cultural groups such as <a href=\"/7/7/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>, Sining Bayan, Kamanyang, <a href=\"/7/7/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, and <a href=\"/7/7/3150\">Panday Sining</a> to mount a show titled <strong><em>Pest of Badway</em></strong>, a parody of the CPP presentation at the time, <strong><em>The Best of Broadway</em></strong>. <a href=\"/7/7/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a> and <a href=\"/7/7/3212\">Leo Rimando</a> directed the production consisting of farcical vignettes from Broadway musicals. The cultural activists daringly performed near the famous CCP fountain on the gala premiere to mock what they considered as another elitist production supported by the State and the ruling class (Tiongson 2015; Quimpo 2012, 193). Such song-and-dance performances were effective tools of entertainment and education during the pickets and rallies that stormed the national capital region of the country. But the huge youth demonstrations were silenced by a single declaration from Marcos."

Critics of the government&#x2014;politicians, members of the press, student activists, or mass leaders&#x2014;were arrested and imprisoned. Those who eluded arrest went into hiding, sought political asylum abroad, or joined the underground movement. There were virtually no opponents left to challenge the regime except for the insurgencies led by the Communist Party of the Philippines, the National Democratic Front, and the New People&#x2019;s Army on one hand; and the Moro National Liberation Front and the Bangsa Moro Army on the other."

Before the deadline, 400 rebels in Marawi City defeated government troops. In reprisal, whole divisions of armed forces were deployed to Southern Philippines. By the end of 1972, the fighting escalated into a gory and bitter war that killed an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 civilians and rendered about one million people homeless and poor. At least 200,000 refugees fled to other parts of the Philippines and to Sabah. Contrary to the notion that a military rule was imposed because of Muslim insurgency, it was militarization under martial law that fueled the armed rebellion led by Nur Misuari (Mackenna 1998; Rasul 2015; Buendia 2006)."

First Lady Imelda Marcos took the lead in the realm of art and culture. She immediately implemented projects that utilized art and culture to exemplify the good intentions and programs of the New Society. This was carried out through the construction of cultural institutions and edifices, and through the use of ethnic and folk icons for the goals of the regime. In 1973, the National Arts Center (NAC) was built on top of the legendary Mt Makiling, an active volcano. The unique arts center is an ivory tower set amidst an idyllic forest. Imelda Marcos in her speech during the NAC groundbreaking rites said that its establishment is the beginning of the &#x201C;rebirth&#x201D; of Filipino culture. The NAC in 1977 was expanded with the inauguration of the Philippine High School for the Arts that offered a dance program on western <a href=\"/6/46/37\">ballet</a> and <a href=\"/6/46/56\">folk dance</a>, along with programs in the other arts."

During the inauguration of the FAT, deemed to be the venue for arts catering to the masses, a grand street parade titled <strong><em>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</em></strong> (History of the Race) was mounted. It was designed to be the biggest national parade with over 20,000 participants that included performing artists, members of ethnic communities, local officials from all over the archipelago, and the contestants of the 1974 Miss Universe beauty pageant. <strong><em>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</em></strong> essayed the history of the Filipino race from prehistory to the New Society. The spectacle attracted thousands of spectators along Roxas Boulevard and was broadcast live on nationwide TV (Jarales 2013, 5; Namiki 2007, 45). The FAT was the venue of the 1974 Miss Universe Pageant, a major cultural project of the regime to prettify the image of martial law, especially to foreign media. The first to be held in Asia, the 1974 Miss Universe pageant was aired live via satellite all over the world on 19 Jul 1974 from the FAT, with the Philippines&#x2019; Margarita Moran as the outgoing Miss Universe. To soften the image of military rule, the pageant opened with the Philippine Military Academy&#x2019;s honor guards marching gallantly with sashaying contestants. The crisscrossing guards and beauty queens were choreographed to create a kaleidoscope of masculine and feminine bodies. The pageant also featured a production number by the beauty contestants clad in Filipina costume, executing simple footwork and singing <a href=\"/5/40/970\">&#x201C;Pamulinawen,&#x201D;</a> the favorite <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <a href=\"/9/73/1553\">folk song</a> of Pres Ferdinand Marcos (Miss Universe Beauty Pageant 1974; Romulo 1987, 98)."

Eight months from the imposition of martial law, the Department of Tourism was established in May 1973, headed by Jose Aspiras who was a former congressman and an avid follower of Imelda Marcos. The Philippines was promoted as a peaceful country and an ideal place for international events and conferences. One huge promotional project was the hosting of the IMF-World Bank Conference in 1976, slated at the newly-built Philippine International Convention Center within the <a href=\"/2/8/289\">CCP Complex</a>. The preparation for the International Monetary Fund-World Bank Conference remains in history as one of the classic examples of incredible tourism development. The grand project resulted in the frenzied establishment of luxury hotels using government funds and taxpayers money, amounting to billions of pesos. In a few months, the rise of many five-star hotels changed the bay side landscape of Roxas Boulevard. These hotels and international venues needed theatrical performances with dance as major component. Meanwhile, tourism promotion in the provinces led to the development of <a href=\"/6/46/99\">street dancing</a> with touristic intentions (Apostolopoulos et al, 2013, 236-38)."

Unemployment rose and the economy had a big deficit in the balance of payments. An oil crisis in 1973 worsened the internal problems of the country. This explosive situation that could escalate into social unrest had to be diffused. Overseas employment was the answer. Labor employment abroad was a policy of martial law under the 1974 Labor Code of the Philippines. It is not surprising that from 36,035 overseas contracts in 1975, the number of overseas Filipino contracts rose to 434,207 in 1983. Among these OFWs were the cultural dancers who worked as entertainers abroad. There is no doubt about the contribution of the overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to save the ailing economy: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) statistics show that remittances rose from $103 million in 1975 to $944.45 million in 1983 (Asis 2006)."

Marcos signed Presidential Decree 1177 in 1977 to ensure automatic payment of public debts. This was enforced to affirm the good standing of the New Society to foreign creditors. Thus, the dictatorship succeeded in increasing Philippine foreign debt from only $360 million in 1962 to $27 billion by the end of the regime. The decree guaranteed automatic debt service payment even for loans that did not benefit the people, such as borrowings used for the stalled Bataan Nuclear Power Plant and the suspended Chico River Dam (Almario 2011 and 2013)."

This was the Chico River Basin Hydroelectric Dam Project whose operation would submerge the ancestral lands of the <a href=\"/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> and the <a href=\"/1/2/2337\">Bontoc</a>. To consolidate themselves, the two ethnic groups formed the Kalinga-Bontoc Peace Pact Holders Association (KBPPHA) which propelled the anti-Chico Dam campaign. The KBPPHA grew and gained local and international support despite military efforts to suppress it. On 24 Apr 1980, government troops killed Macliing Dulag in Bugnay village, Tinglayan, Kalinga. Dulag, who was vocal about his opposition to the Chico Dam, was a respected leader of the Butbut group of the Kalinga. His assassination led to the groundswell of support for the anti-Chico Dam struggle from all over the country and from the international community. Dulag&#x2019;s martyrdom led to the unity of many villages and groups against the Chico Dam. The triumphs of anti-Chico Dam movement was followed by the successful protest of the <a href=\"/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> against Cellophil Resources Corporation (CRC). The CRC was owned by Herminio Disini, a Marcos crony who was given jurisdiction in 1973 to operate a logging and paper-pulp company covering 200,000 has in Abra. These struggles of the Cordillera peoples led to a strong united opposition against the Marcos dictatorship under the Cordillera Peoples&#x2019; Alliance. The struggles of the Cordillera peoples were expressed through their indigenous dances (Bolinget 2004)."

The pressures on the regime from the international press and the worldwide human rights movement increased. The catalyst to the sociopolitical upheaval was the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr who returned to the Philippines after three years of exile in the US. Aquino was shot on the tarmac of the Manila International Airport immediately after he alighted from his airplane on 21 Aug 1983. His assassination further intensified the growing opposition against the Marcos dictatorship. These mass rallies and protest actions utilized theatrical performances using dance and creative body movements to educate and entertain the people. Even the apathetic sectors and members of the elite joined the surge of protests which led to the EDSA Revolt in February 1986."

Imelda Marcos was the patron and chair of BP whose success with local and international audiences presented a good image of martial law. However, ballet was not the First Lady&#x2019;s &#x201C;favorite&#x201D; art form, giving BP relative autonomy in creating its own form and content.

The sponsored shows were meant to bring western classical dance forms like ballet to the masses.

The ROFG was born on the very day martial law was declared when the national emergency disrupted the job of <a href=\"/6/6/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a> as artistic director of the official dance group of the Bureau of Customs. On that fateful day, Obusan decided to seriously continue his aesthetic and intellectual pursuits in dance in his own house in Pasay City. The Bicol-born Obusan was a fisheries graduate of the University of the Philippines, Diliman who taught at the Aklan Polytechnic Institute after graduation. In Aklan, he had the opportunity to observe local customs and traditional practices. His propensity for anthropology led him to enrol at the UP Diliman under <a href=\"/9/9/5493\">Dr Espiridion Arsenio Manuel</a>. He then joined the Bayanihan as instrumentalist and dancer in the 1960s. However, Obusan disapproved of how the Bayanihan staged Philippine folk dances with its highly stylized movements with emphasis on glamorized images of dancers donned in glittery <a href=\"/6/47/29\">costumes</a>. Soon, Obusan formed his own informal folk dance group so that he could mount dances gathered from his cultural researches, naming it Ramon Obusan Folkdance Group. Then he changed &#x201C;folk dance&#x201D; to &#x201C;folkloric&#x201D; in the late 1970s to signify the &#x201C;authenticity&#x201D; of the group&#x2019;s performances."

She exported talents to the United States, Europe, and Asia. When Japan became a major destination for cultural performers, Dimayuga founded Bellestar Promotions to respond to the demand for entertainers in Japan. Dubbed as &#x201C;Bellestar dancers,&#x201D; her performers underwent months of training with a fixed curriculum of dancing and value formation aimed at preparing amateur talents to become migrant workers in Japan (UNTV 2014). These positive efforts did not offset the huge negative connotation of being a &#x201C;Japayuki.&#x201D; Notwithstanding the negative aspects of cultural dancing like vulnerability to sexual exploitation, the fact remains that the dollars brought in by these girls and women helped the Philippine economy."

Manila Sound produced music for social dancing, particularly for disco, swing, rock and roll, and Latin pop dances. Manila Sound defined the 1970s, typified by songs such as &#x201C;Aawitin Mo, Isasayaw Ko&#x201D; (Sing It and I will Dance It), &#x201C;Magsayawan&#x201D; (Let&#x2019;s Dance), &#x201C;Disco Fever,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Swing it, Baby&#x201D; by <a href=\"/5/5/4231\">VST &amp; Company</a>; &#x201C;Manila, Manila,&#x201D; &#x201C;Bongga Ka &#x2019;Day&#x201D; (You&#x2019;re Fabulous, Girl), &#x201C;Annie Batungbakal&#x201D; by the <a href=\"/5/5/4012\">Hotdog</a>; &#x201C;Ang Boyfriend Kong Baduy&#x201D; by Cinderella; and &#x201C;No Touch&#x201D; by <a href=\"/5/5/4025\">Juan de la Cruz Band</a>.

Ironically, the dark and repressive years deepened awareness of how Philippine dance forms could be used to express ideas about socio-economic and political conditions.

He was fleeing, driven to exile by a people&rsquo;s uprising against his 21 years of authoritarian rule that saw the suppression of civil liberties, the torture and killing of thousands of political activists, and massive corruption that pushed the country further into debt. The 1983 assassination of Sen Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino and the subsequent 1986 EDSA Revolt paved the way for a new administration that was infused with new hope and faith in the restoration of freedoms in the country. After the EDSA Revolt, the concept &ldquo;democratic space&rdquo; became popular in the Philippines and was associated with the freedoms the new government by Corazon Aquino vowed to restore (Javate de Dios, Daroy, Kalaw-Tirol 1988, 234).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sense of accommodation by the new national order was also felt in the cultural scene. In 1987, Ma. Teresa &ldquo;Bing&rdquo; Roxas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>, and Florendo Garcia began the change in the orientation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, a major institution that was associated with the deposed First Lady of the Philippines, Imelda Marcos. Five essential thrusts were introduced: Filipinization, which aimed to produce &ldquo;original Filipino works rooted in the country&rsquo;s traditions&rdquo; (Tiongson 2009, 31-33); democratization, which opened CCP venues to more <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">dance companies</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">audiences</a>; decentralization, which encouraged the participation of the regions in the creation of a national culture; the promotion of artistic excellence, which recognized the pluralism of aesthetic excellence; and reorientation of international exchanges which emphasized the participation of Filipino artists in international events. These five thrusts would guide the productions and programs of the institution in the years to come. CCP&rsquo;s new leadership created and implemented programs in consultation with stakeholders outside the institution&mdash;artists, dancers, musicians, film artists, cultural workers, and members of academe and media.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the performing arts, CCP increased the number of its resident companies to include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre (PBT)</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a>, and the University of Santo Tomas Symphony Orchestra, in addition to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines (BP)</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. CCP launched workshops, productions, events, and awards contributing to the envisioned &ldquo;national culture evolving with and for all Filipinos&rdquo; (Tiongson 2009, 31-33). Priority was given to the development of Filipino artists and their works, resulting in productions such as <em><strong>Dating Gawi, Bagong Anyo</strong></em> (Old Ways, New Image) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2545\">Douglas Nierras</a> and <em><strong>Unang Hakbang</strong></em> (First Step) by the Chameleon Dance Company, both in 1991. CCP opened its doors to competent dance companies outside its network through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">venue</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/25\">grants</a> and the <em><strong>Pang-alay</strong></em> (Offering) series. In dance, BP II launched <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">dance workshops</a> outside Metro Manila such as Davao and Iligan. To develop new linkages on the national and local level among dancers, choreographers, enthusiasts, and scholars, CCP hosted the first CCP National Dance Festival and Conference in Iloilo City in 1989. On the international level, CCP organized the first International Dance Conference and Festival of Dance Academies in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, and in response to the proposal made by the Alliance of Artists for a Ministry of Culture (AAMC), Pres Aquino established the Philippine Commission for Cultural Arts (PCCA) in 1987, encompassing &ldquo;the arts, cultural heritage, and cultural dissemination.&rdquo; The PCCA became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> in 1992 (Tiongson 2009, 30). In dance, the NCCA gave subsidies to four dance companies: BP, PBT, Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, and the ROFG. It also provided grants to the priority projects of the National Committee on Dance (NCD). Over the years the NCD has extended financial support to arts councils, foundations, local government units, public schools, community-based performing groups/organizations, schools of dance/companies, dancers, choreographers, trainers, and teachers. Some of the NCD&rsquo;s grants are the Resource Material Development in Dance grant, Dance Production/Collaboration grant, Dance Competition grant, and the NCCA Dance Season grant, all of which allow grantees to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">research</a>, perform, compete, and to create and produce dance works or shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, cultural changes were significant not just in institutions tasked to minister to Philippine culture but also in the country&rsquo;s general cultural landscape. The turn of the 21st century was marked not just by the visibility of artists working outside major establishments but also by the pronounced presence of popular culture on a global scale. New technologies paved the way for the circulation of literature, music, dance, performances, and all kinds of art forms beyond national borders. There was definitely a new energy felt in the realm of cultural production. The end of the Marcos era did not automatically result in the vigorous production of dance in the country. Although there was more freedom to explore the possibilities of dance, support for this ephemeral form was still an issue. Still, as an art that draws its form and energy from the human body, dance found novel ways of expressing itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"Ballet\" name=\"Ballet\"></a>Ballet</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The state of Philippine art changed as the political atmosphere in the country shifted from a dictatorship to a new democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various dance groups outside the CCP demanded equal subsidy for their companies. These were the independent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>/dance companies composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2444\">Dance Theater Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2486\">Hariraya Ballet Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2440\">Dance Concert Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2528\">Manila Metropolis Ballet</a>, Dance Arts Philippines, and the Gener Caringal Dance Repertory Company; and two schools, namely, the Ben-Lor Academy and the Academie of Performing Arts. They petitioned for their inclusion in the national center, the right to use its performance and rehearsal venues, and for stable and regular financial support. But the CCP could only subsidize one ballet company. Therefore, the aforementioned groups banded together to form the Philippine Ballet Theatre (PBT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subsidy given to the PBT was partial and it was understood that the company would also look for other resources. The company was granted the use of performance venues for its season performances. It had a glorious premiere performance and rose to the standard set by BP. Soon, two ballet companies held regular performance seasons at the CCP: BP known for its experimentation in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\">modern dance</a>, and PBT, for its preservation of classical ballet forms. Both companies aimed to preserve a distinctly Filipino identity in their repertoire, despite arguments that ballet and modern dance were foreign to our culture. The CCP&rsquo;s Coordinating Center for Dance, headed by former BP dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2495\">Nestor Jardin</a>, was tasked to coordinate the four resident companies of the CCP&mdash;BP, PBT, ROFG, the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company&mdash;and other groups, schools, and artists in the country. There were programs for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">dance education</a> and performance. The former included workshops from visiting foreign dance groups and choreographers; outreach workshops conducted by local teachers in the provinces and rural areas; and the annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> workshop. Performance programs included the Dance Venue Grant, which was awarded to individual choreographers and artists to enable them to present concerts at the CCP and the hosting of local and international dance festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in this spirit of democracy that the annual <em><strong>Balletfest</strong></em> festival was launched in 1987. It gathered over 20 dance companies and schools from all over the country. Both BP and PBT, as well as the six independent companies and two schools that comprised PBT, participated in the annual festival. It nurtured ballet schools by providing opportunities for them to showcase their students and encouraged a friendly competition among schools resulting in the improvement of dance training and the quality of dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2523\">Lisa Macuja</a> returned to the Philippines as an artist-in-residence with the CCP in 1986, she danced in the classical productions of BP. Winning the silver medal at the 1987 Asia Pacific Ballet Competition in Tokyo, Macuja was immediately ranked <em>prima ballerina</em> of the new PBT, holding this high position by herself for several years and dancing all the principal roles in PBT productions during her entire stay. She subsequently formed her own company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2405\">Ballet Manila (BM)</a>, produced full-length classical ballets in the Russian tradition, and successfully presented these to more people than any company had ever done in Philippine ballet history. Macuja also regularly invited her former St Petersburg mentors, People&rsquo;s Artist of Russia Sergei Vilulov and his wife Tatiana Udalenkova, and guest ballet master Viktor Saveliev of Moscow (Villaruz 2012, 64), to administer master classes in the Vaganova method for her company. With former PBT artistic council member <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2432\">Eric Cruz</a> as coartistic director, Macuja established BM as a touring company, with performances in the Philippines and later in Russia and the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Macuja&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ballet for the People&rdquo; fulfilled BM&rsquo;s mission to perform the classics before an audience of Filipino masses, not the regular ballet attendees. Soon, the company took residence in the Aliw and Star Theaters built right beside the CCP, as adjunct cultural <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4895\">Manila Broadcasting Company</a> and the year-round carnival, Star City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three big ballet companies coexisted, alongside another smaller performing group, BP II, established in 1990 under the helm of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a>. It was a junior company separate from BP, to further train the apprentices and scholars for performance and to develop new <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreographies</a> and revive pieces that were no longer being performed. The apprentices and scholars trained more intensively in the modern form even if they still performed one or two full-length ballets each season. With CCP&rsquo;s grants for residency programs, BP II and Locsin conducted workshops in Davao and Iligan in 1991 (Tiongson 2009, 33).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BP was known for its innovative &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; modern pieces, PBT for its classical and contemporary repertoire, and BM for its strictly classical ballet repertoire. All three companies, however, prematurely lost their principal dancers due to foreign job opportunities. A phenomenon that affected the dance companies was the recruitment of dancers for Hong Kong Disneyland. Disney might have given lucrative jobs to Filipino musicians, theater actors, and dancers, but in the first half of the 21st century, it also took a few dancers from BM and half the male soloists of PBT. In 2005, BP lost most of its soloists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competition from more popular forms of entertainment in Manila forced the marketing arms of the ballet companies to continue their reliable promotional scheme: they resorted to selling the classical ballets to schools. Aside from this strategy, BM produced <em><strong>Ballet and Ballads</strong></em>, which featured the company dancing with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop</a> divas, such as Lani Misalucha, and this became a regular series very much like a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1372\">TV variety show</a>. Because the Aliw and Star Theaters are situated in the Star City compound, the ballets would find their way to the amusement park as an added attraction. BM bundled the ballet tickets with tickets for amusement park rides and other freebies, and with the <em><strong>Circus D&rsquo; Ballet</strong></em>. The circus as well as the different marketing gimmicks featured by the tie-up with Star City did promote the company to a bigger audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company mounted several mixed-bill productions including the series titled <em><strong>The World Stars of Ballet</strong></em>, the most noteworthy of which was <em><strong>Stars of Philippine Ballet</strong></em>, 2013, which featured a homecoming of Filipino dancers abroad. More choreographers such as former BP artistic directors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2521\">Max Luna III</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2437\">Augustus Damian</a> were invited to create works for BM from 2009 to 2013. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2581\">Hazel Sabas</a> was also commissioned to do a full-length ballet, <em><strong>Sinderela</strong></em>, 2012, the modern day Filipino version of the popular fairy tale character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BP also found new ways to market its productions and make ballet appealing to a more general audience. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>&rsquo;s coup was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/135\"><em><strong>Darna</strong></em></a>, 2003, featuring the beloved Pinoy female superhero. <em><strong>Playing Maestro Ryan</strong></em>, 2005, showcased familiar and favorite pieces by popular composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>. In the succeeding years, BP mounted works characterized by a wider range of aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While heavily involved with the Contemporary Dance Network Philippines (later renamed to Contemporary Dance Network Manila), BP invited <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2541\">Paul Morales</a> to lead the company as artistic director in 2008. With the revival of BP II in 2009, there were more choreographic opportunities for the younger members and aspirants of the company. While including contemporary dance processes and aesthetics in the repertoire and practice of the company, Morales also resurrected forgotten gems from BP&rsquo;s over 40-year-old repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Younger members of BP created distinct works such as <em><strong>Rey-sing</strong></em> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2386\">Carissa Adea</a>,&nbsp;<em><strong>Two of You</strong></em> by Ea Torrado, and <em><strong>You, Me, Us</strong></em> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2626\">Ronelson Yadao</a>, all in 2009. In the same year, BP launched the <em><strong>BP Choreographers Cup</strong></em>, a dance competition on neo-classical choreography. Among the choreographers invited by the company was Hong Kong-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2551\">Carlo Pacis</a> who created the memorable <em><strong>Shifting Wait</strong></em>, 2010. Contemporary dance choreographers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2507\">Elena Laniog</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2619\">Ava Maureen Villanueva</a> also mounted works for BP. Morales created <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/132\"><em><strong>Crisostomo Ibarra</strong></em></a>, 2010, <em><strong>Rock Supremo</strong></em>, 2013, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/598\"><em><strong>Manhid</strong></em></a> (Numb), 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2001 to 2003, PBT staged more mixed-bill productions with dazzling showcase pieces such as the <em><strong>Great Classics</strong></em> and <em><strong>Tribute to Maestro Lucio San Pedro</strong></em>, both in 2001, <em><strong>Curtain Call</strong></em>, 2002, and <em><strong>Serenade and Other Ballets</strong></em>, 2002 to 2003. The idea behind this was that shorter programs full of bravura dancing might excite audiences more than full-length ballets would. After 2003, PBT again mounted the full-length ballets it was known for, some of which were Tom Pazik&rsquo;s <em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em>, <em><strong>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</strong></em> and <em><strong>La Bayadere</strong></em>. Past favorites were revised: Pazik&rsquo;s <em><strong>Scherzo</strong></em> and <em><strong>Tzigane</strong></em>, Balanchine&rsquo;s <em><strong>Serenade</strong></em>, and Campos-Cantero&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/130\"><em><strong>Carmina Burana</strong></em></a>. In 2004, <em><strong>Carmina Burana</strong></em> accompanied a short full-length ballet, titled <em><strong>Isang Bagong Bituin</strong></em> (A New Star), patterned after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1355\">telenovelas</a> that became popular in recent years. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2422\">Gener Caringal</a> choreographed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3947\">Willy Cruz</a>&rsquo;s pop songs, including <em><strong>Pangarap na Bituin</strong></em> (A Dream Star), <em><strong>Bituing Walang Ningning</strong></em> (Star Without Sparkle), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/996\"><em><strong>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</strong></em></a> (May It Never End). While some thought the use of Pinoy pop songs was a&nbsp;<em>bakya&nbsp;</em>(cheap) concept, its performance at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP Main Theater</a> lent an air of class to the music that was so enjoyed by lovers of karaoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, when each group performed in both local and international tours, their repertoire was generally Filipino. BP constantly performed Damian&rsquo;s pieces from the Cayabyab suite. PBT&rsquo;s regular tour and outreach show repertoire included Caringal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/202\"><em><strong>Vinta</strong></em></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2462\">Fabella</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/123\"><em><strong>Beautiful Girls</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<em><strong>Marcha at Sayaw</strong></em> (March and Dance) or <em><strong>Fiesta</strong></em> (Festival), and the short version of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/158\"><em><strong>Kundiman, Noon at Ngayon</strong></em></a> (Love Songs, Past and Present). BM staged full lengths and circus acts in the theater, but on tour, they regularly performed Agnes Locsin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Arachnida</strong></em> and <em><strong>Aguila</strong></em> (Eagle), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2519\">Jojo Lucila</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong>Sari&rsquo;t Bahag</strong></em> (Tubular Skirt and G-String), and Fabella&rsquo;s <em><strong>Dalagang Filipina</strong></em> (Filipina Maiden).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The years after martial law proved to be challenging for Philippine ballet which found itself looking for artistic and financial stability. Political changes also meant realignments in cultural priorities and ballet was not exempted from these vicissitudes. But the spirit of democracy encouraged more explorations in ballet which had generally been considered &ldquo;classical&rdquo; and for the middle class and the elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the three major dance companies, ballet schools and performing groups thrived. In 1993, the Association of Ballet Academies, Philippines (ABAP) was organized and then formally launched the following year. With founding members <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2439\">Vella Damian</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2485\">Shirley Halili-Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2414\">Ida Beltran-Lucila</a>, Nina Anonas, Liza de la Fuente, Amelia Yulo, Nida Onglengco-Pangan, Araceli Root, Cherry Velarde-Mactal and honorary members/advisers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa Goquingco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Corazon I&ntilde;igo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Esteban Villaruz</a>, the organization, together with its affiliate members, has worked to improve classical ballet education in the Philippines by holding workshops, performances, and tours. It was one of the important federation of dance companies in the Philippines (Beltran 2015) and has had around thirty members using a range of ballet syllabi, some of which were the Ballet Syllabus of the Commonwealth Society of Teachers of Dancing (CSTD) based in Singapore and Australia, the American Academy of Ballet Syllabus based in New York, the Philippine National Ballet Syllabus, the Cecchetti Ballet Syllabus, National Dance Syllabus, the Royal Academy of Dance Syllabus, the Australian Conservatoire of Ballet Syllabus, and the Vaganova method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past 30 years, many schools have emerged not just in the Metropolis but also in the regions. Schools in Metro Manila are Vella Damian&rsquo;s Vella C. Damian School of Classical Ballet, Shirley Halili&rsquo;s Halili-Cruz School of Ballet (HCSB), Liza de la Fuente-Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s Ridgepointe Ballet Center for Dance Education, Ianne Damian and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2543\">Melanie Motus</a>&rsquo;s IDMM Ballet School, all in Quezon City; Araceli Valera Root&rsquo;s Pink Toes in Antipolo City; Ana Emata&rsquo;s Ana Emata School of Classical Ballet in Marikina; Amelia Garcia Yulo&rsquo;s Ballet Repertory Philippines in San Juan; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2544\">Effie Na&ntilde;as</a>&rsquo;s Effie Na&ntilde;as School of Dance in Mandaluyong; Desiree Peralejo-Medina&rsquo;s DBC-ISAS Conservatory in Pasig; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2627\">Sofia Zobel-Elizalde</a>&rsquo;s Steps Dance Studio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2578\">Maritoni Rufino-Tordesillas</a>&rsquo;s Danspace, Brezhnev Larlar and Pamela Ortiz-Bondoc&rsquo;s Dance Theater Arts, and Perry Sevidal&rsquo;s Perry Sevidal Ballet, all in Makati; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2482\">Toni Lopez-Gonzalez</a>&rsquo;s Toni Lopez-Gonzalez School of Ballet in Ortigas; Noemi Onglengco Silangcruz&rsquo;s Ballet and Arts Center in Taguig; Nida Onglengco-Pangan&rsquo;s Ballet Dance Academy in Cavite; Marlinda Claravall&rsquo;s Claravall School of Dance and Cherish Garcia&rsquo;s Academi One, both in Para&ntilde;aque; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2490\">Eli Jacinto</a>&rsquo;s Theatrical Ensemble and Artistic Movement (TEAM) and its sister school Hampton Court Ballet, both in Las Pi&ntilde;as.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many schools offering classical ballet outside the Metro have become more visible. There is Ava Villanueva&rsquo;s studio in Los Ba&ntilde;os; Jackie and Joanne Go&rsquo;s Le Conservatoire de Danse de Ballet in Baguio City; Sol Fernandez&rsquo;s SF School of Dance, Nila Claravall-Gonzales&rsquo;s Claravall-Gonzales School of Classical Ballet, and Annie Divinagracia Sartorio&rsquo;s School of Performing Arts in Iloilo; Jeanette Garcia Sanchez&rsquo;s Garcia-Sanchez School of Dance and Lydia M. Gaston School of Dance under its current artistic director Aliana &ldquo;Cheenee&rdquo; Alicia Rose Marie Limuaco, both in Bacolod; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2584\">Fe Sala-Villarica</a>&rsquo;s Ballet Center, now run by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2550\">Nicolas Paca&ntilde;a</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2381\">Gregory Aaron</a> in Cebu; Faith Javellana&rsquo;s School for Theater Art &lsquo;N&rsquo; Dance in Cagayan de Oro City (formerly the Faith Dance &amp; Art Center in Iloilo City); and Girlie Royeca&rsquo;s Ballet and Performing Arts School and Agnes Locsin&rsquo;s Locsin Dance Workshop, both in Davao City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These schools all over the Philippines contribute to the still-growing professional practice of ballet, aided by competitions such as the ABAP Dance Cup, and the junior and senior ballet categories at the National Music Competition for Young Artists, which ran until 2013. It was replaced in 2014 by the National Ballet Competition hosted by the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-EDSA period was characterized by the ubiquity of popular culture and various forms of amusement spurred by developments in technology. Yet, although ballet had always been associated with elite culture and dance performances were deemed unappealing to the millennial youth, this genre not only survived but also managed to reinvent itself in various ways. Because there was no lack of exceptional talent and kinesthetic intelligence, ballet in the years after EDSA reworked itself and found specific niches where it could further grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"moderndance\" name=\"moderndance\"></a>Modern Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The warm reception to modern dance in the Philippines when it was introduced by famous choreographers such as Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn in 1926 and Viennese Kaethe Hauser and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2453\">Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</a> in the 1930s was sustained by Filipino dancers and choreographers in the succeeding years. Former student of Hauser, Spanish modern dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2576\">Manolo Rosado</a> returned to Manila in 1958 after studying in the US with Shawn, Martha Graham, and Jose Limon. Also inspired by her mentors Hauser and Dubsky-Zipper, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a> took an MA in modern dance in the US in the late 1960s and eventually returned to the Philippines and directed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2466\">FEU Modern Experimental Dance Group</a>. Teachers who promoted modern dance in the country were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Corazon Generoso</a> (later, I&ntilde;igo) who also trained under Dubsky-Zipper, and Carmen Adevoso who for a brief period, taught modern dance in public schools before leaving for the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company</a> at the CCP further strengthened the presence of modern dance in the Philippines. But even before this, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2510\">Luis Layag</a> already explored new ventures in dance which he pursued into the 1970s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio</a> earlier attempted the same at the Central Philippine University in Iloilo from 1964 to 1965. Basilio continued creating works using the vocabulary of modern dance all the way to his later works in the 1980s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2462\">Tony Fabella</a> likewise contributed to the growth of modern dance from the 1970s to the 1980s as manager and resident choreographer of the Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of modern dance in the country, however, shows how most Filipino choreographers do not strictly conform to rigid dance forms. Their works may cross over from one genre to another as they use technical and stylistic resources of their training background. Yet, although the post-EDSA Revolt period witnessed such cross-overs, there are works that may be considered more distinctly modern dance. The period saw a surge of creations integrating indigenous movements into modern dance pieces. One of the most controversial pieces perhaps was Agnes Locsin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><em><strong>Igorot</strong></em></a>, 1987, which had the top half of the dancers&rsquo; bodies emulating Igorot dancing movement and gestures, while the lower half performing ballet steps, slightly reoriented in opposition to classical ballet impulses and accents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Locsin choreographed <em><strong>Igorot</strong></em>, the CCP and BP were already 18 years in the dance scene. BP had by then amassed several modern pieces with Philippine themes in its repertoire, the most popular being Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><em><strong>Amada</strong></em></a>, 1970, Gener Caringal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><em><strong>Ang Sultan</strong></em></a> (The Sultan), 1973, and Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/144\"><em><strong>For the Gods</strong></em></a>, 1985.&nbsp;<em><strong>Amada</strong></em>, which was based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a>, &ldquo;Summer Solstice,&rdquo; rendered rural Filipino culture in modern dance and was commended by a critic as having translated the Graham modern style into a more oriental form to accommodate the telling of a Filipino story (Fernau Hall, 1972). Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>For the Gods</strong></em>, on the other hand, is based on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/54\"><strong>dugso</strong></a>, a traditional thanksgiving dance from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> people of Bukidnon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using modern dance, many Filipino choreographers Filipinized ballet because it was a style in which they could creatively explore their own rich traditions. They developed their own choreographies, with Filipino themes, to Filipino stories, using Filipino music, and even borrowing from Philippine dances. Most of the early Philippine-themed works were neo-classic ballets or modern dance works that used a rural or precolonial royal backdrop to appear Filipino. Some were also based on stories written by Filipino writers, myths handed down through generations, or historical themes paralleled with religious motifs. Examples are Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/187\"><em><strong>Siete Dolores</strong></em></a> (Seven Sorrows), 1988, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/136\"><em><strong>Diablos</strong></em></a> (Demons), 1989; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2617\">Edna Vida</a>&rsquo;s full-length <em><strong>Ibong Adarna</strong></em> (The Adarna Bird), 1990; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2505\">Enrico Labayen</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/198\"><em><strong>The Dupe of Time</strong></em></a>, 1991. Eli Jacinto drew on his folk dance experience in his Filipino-themed modern works such as the Igorot-inspired <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/186\"><em><strong>Sa Panimula ng Buhay</strong></em></a> (At the Beginning of Life), 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reyes&rsquo;s &quot;Neo-Filipino&quot; dance series sustained the production of works revolving around Philippine culture. Conceived when she was in New York at a time when funding for the arts had become meager, Neo-Filipino was a call to Filipino artists to work together. Carried over to the CCP, the Neo-Filipino program pursued the vision of artists working together, innovating, and exploring movement (Carabeo 2014/15, 34). The Neo-Filipino dance series featured works characterized by a range of movement vocabularies and techniques.

Her other neo-ethnic and modern choreographies include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/133\"><em><strong>Dabaw</strong></em></a>, 1988; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><em><strong>Bagobo</strong></em></a>, 1990; <em><strong>Moslem</strong></em>, 1990; <em><strong>Moriones</strong></em> (Morion Soldiers), 1991; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/121\"><em><strong>Babalyan</strong></em></a> (Priestess), 1993; and <em><strong>Taong Talangka</strong></em> (Man-Crab). Elements of this genre are likewise seen in <em><strong>Elias</strong></em>, 1995, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/160\"><em><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></em></a> (The Philippine Revolution), 1996, <em><strong>Hinilawod</strong></em>, 1997, and in her later independent works, <em><strong>Sayaw Ang Kiukok</strong></em> (Dance Like an Ang Kiukok Painting), 2005, and the <em><strong>Alay sa Puno</strong></em> (Offering to the Trees) series, 2010-13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of modern dances with Filipino themes later dwindled in number as the style became more associated with Locsin, and choreographers opted to find their own choreographic voice. Upon the advent of contemporary dance in the 1990s, young choreographers found a new direction for dance, and the themes of their works were the concerns of the millennials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"contemporarydance\" name=\"contemporarydance\"></a>Contemporary Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1997, dance in the Philippines saw the emergence of a genre called <strong>contemporary dance</strong>. The usage has a history rooted in particular geographical contexts and practices in the United States and Europe. Contemporary dance practice was adapted from the propositions into the nature of dance by European practitioners, propositions which consist of rereadings of innovations first initiated in the US. Thus, although the usage of &ldquo;contemporary dance&rdquo; has a European inflection (Lepecki 2004, 170-81), its emergence in other cultures did not necessarily take the form of direct translations of the European practice. In the US, the term more often used is &ldquo;postmodern dance&rdquo; which generally refers to a specific period and movement in dance in New York City between the 1960s and the 1970s. Downtown New York during this decade saw many activities of choreographers, known as the Judson Church Movement which rebelled against modern dance exemplified by prominent figures like Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey. Whereas the term &ldquo;modern dance&rdquo; had been generally defined according to a codified technique such as the Martha Graham technique, contemporary dance&rsquo;s &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; precisely consisted in liberating dance from any codification and insisting on being defined according to its context. The Judson Church artists disdained virtuosity, reduced dance to its essential elements devoid of scenic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">props and design</a>, and borrowed and experimented with the compositional techniques of other art forms to answer their inquiry into the nature of dance. They also performed in alternative <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">spaces</a> other than the formal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theater</a> with its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">proscenium</a> stage (Foster 1986, 169).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary dance in the Philippines has come to refer not to a genre per se but to a process and critical perspective which gave birth to more or less an identifiable aesthetics shared by a number of practitioners. What has come to be considered &ldquo;contemporary dance&rdquo; works are those characterized by a certain mode of production and a certain way of approaching and conceptualizing dance. Contemporary dance has generally been informed by particular ways of creating works outside mainstream cultural institutions. In tracing the &ldquo;emergence&rdquo; of contemporary dance practice in the Philippines, critic, professor, choreographer, and dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio Villaruz</a> highlights particular developments in dance during certain decades: the 1950s saw Philippine folk dance achieving world-wide recognition; the 1960s&nbsp;brought the professionalization in dance through the establishment of dance companies like the Pamana Ballet, Hariraya Ballet Company, and Dance Theater Philippines; and, the 1970s to the mid-1990s saw BP, which was housed in the CCP as a dominant force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creative output of BP was in the modern dance style exemplified by the works of the company&rsquo;s founder Alice Reyes who mined indigenous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> and cultural practices and rendered them in modern dance forms. Like the modernist period of the West which was highly influenced by indigenous cultures of the non-West, the same was apparent in the modern dance repertoire of BP. The latter complemented the vision of the modern nation-state because it embodied the image of modernity inflected by a Filipino sensibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the modernist style, Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s works questioned the notion of a singular Filipino identity and probed into the national identity&rsquo;s contradictions and paradoxes. These were seen in her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/175\"><em><strong>One Ton Pinay</strong></em></a>, 1979; <em><strong>Made in the Philippines</strong></em>, 1984; <em><strong>Balimbingan</strong></em> and <em><strong>Cock vs. Cock</strong></em>, 1987; and <em><strong>Asong Ulol</strong></em>, 1991. In her artistic direction of this series, in the eclectic approach and treatment of her own works, and in her more collaborative process, all of which were departures from the controlled forms and processes of the modern style, the younger Reyes&rsquo;s body of works ushered in the postmodern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is the observation that a new phase began in the late 1990s when artists were free to explore new themes, concepts, and world views within and outside of CCP. But while there were new points of view, these did not in themselves constitute a new movement in dance. In this instance, there was a break from previous practices and there were common concerns among artists working outside CCP and other mainstream institutions that merited calling their collective practice a new movement in art. This is the genre and the practice now recognized as contemporary dance in the Philippines which foregrounds the materiality of dance, emphasizing that its &ldquo;form&rdquo; is a result of minimal, or even lack of resources. Contemporary dance distinguishes itself from the modern from the way it conceptualizes and renders dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a moment could at all be identified as the beginning of the practice of contemporary dance, it would be when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2415\">Myra Beltran</a> opened her studio as a performing space in 1997, with her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2442\">Dance Forum</a> (founded earlier in 1995), independently producing her own works. While blurring the boundaries of producer and artist and determining the means of its production independently, she also paved the way for the creation of a community of like-minded practitioners by producing the works of other independent choreographers, some of them previously connected with mainstream dance companies. All of these artists eventually formed the core of the independent contemporary dance community. The aesthetics which resulted from inquiry and exploration of creative processes were applied by other choreographers in their work, although in varying degrees and with different perspectives. It was in 2004 when this &ldquo;new breed&rdquo; of choreographers came to be visible as a community producing what came to be called independent contemporary dance in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating for alternative spaces implied questioning the concepts of dance accepted as the norm for the formal theater&rsquo;s proscenium stage such as notions of beauty and excellence in dance. <em><strong>Truth.con Furia</strong></em>, 2004, a collaborative work between Beltran&rsquo;s Dance Forum and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2433\">Jose Jay Cruz</a>&rsquo;s Dancing Wounded Contemporary Dance Commune, challenged the audience to reassess their attitudes towards the body and ideas of perfection. The second concern is the insistence that each work of contemporary dance had to be read as developing its own particular aesthetics borne of specific material conditions, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2389\">Airdance</a>&rsquo;s launching production titled <em><strong>R-18</strong></em>, 2004, under the direction of Paul Morales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third concern of contemporary dance choreographers working often in intimate spaces is the dancer&rsquo;s relationship with the audience. The art gallery&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3572\">Green Papaya Art Projects</a> called attention to this in <em><strong>Anatomy of Love and Desire</strong></em>, 2004, curated by Donna Miranda. In other articulations of the same concerns, Jojo Lucila and his Chameleon Dance Company (later named the Chameleon Dance Theater under the direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2392\">Raul Alcoseba</a>), developed a repertoire informed by aesthetics of the urban poor and grassroots sensibilities. For the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2613\">UP Dance Company</a>&rsquo;s conceptually-trained dancers, ballet, together with its aesthetics of space, is no longer the default dance form. The contemporary choreographic styles of Elena Laniog, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2395\">Herbert Alvarez</a>, and Ava Maureen Villanueva have influenced the work of other younger dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fourth concern among contemporary dancers is the idea of the personal being both political and social. Beltran&rsquo;s solo repertoire shows how doing away with the hierarchical structure of theater and expensive productions leaves the audience only with the dancer&rsquo;s body, a lone body on stage which also happens to be that of the choreographer&rsquo;s. As producer, choreographer, and dancer, contemporary dance artists blur the lines between these roles and claim ownership of the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary dances have a more intimate feeling. To be &ldquo;expressive&rdquo; and beautiful in dance, the dancer need not conquer or defy space as is the practice in performances for the proscenium stage. Rather, the emphasis is on what occurs in-between or in the interstices of each movement, in the suspension of each breath, in the creation and resolution of momentum, and in the physics of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While contemporary dance&rsquo;s &ldquo;style&rdquo; has been disseminated across the dance landscape in the Philippines, it first evolved from dancers who, while having had previous relationships with mainstream cultural institutions, eventually created their works as independent artists. The <em><strong>Contemporary Dance Map Series</strong></em> initiated under the Choreographers&rsquo; Network of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2624\">World Dance Alliance-Philippines</a> in 2005&nbsp;had independent artists celebrating International Dance Day with a performance-tour of alternative spaces for dance in a span of two weeks. Yet, contemporary dance practitioners have had collaborative projects with the CCP, one of which was the <em><strong>Wifi Body Festival</strong></em>. This first contemporary dance festival in the Philippines used the template of the earlier performance tour in mounting a similar one within the confines of CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Wifi Body</strong></em>&rsquo;s second year introduced the choreographers&rsquo; competition for the solo-duet form that paved the way for a stronger presence of Philippine contemporary dance in Asia, particularly in Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore. The young winners who pursued contemporary dance were Ava Villanueva, who eventually became the director of Airdance, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2560\">Rhosam Prudenciado Jr</a> whose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/204\"><em><strong>Which Way?</strong></em></a> won second place in the competition in 2008 and was awarded the Grand Prize at the 2009 Yokohama Dance Collection Ex for the same work. Others who first choreographed for the competition and continued their explorations of contemporary dance were Zyda Marie Baaya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2471\">Gerardo Francisco</a> (who would continue to create for Ballet Manila), Mia Cabalfin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2396\">Jed Amihan</a>, Alfred Mercado, Frederick Fernandez, Ea Torrado, Al Bernard Garcia, Sarah Marie Samaniego, Japhet Mari Cabling, and Razielle Ann Mitchao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Contemporary Dance Network Philippines, which became the official network of practitioners of contemporary dance in 2009, decided to change its name to Contemporary Dance Network Manila in 2011 as most of them were based in the Metropolis which inevitably gave their works a more &ldquo;urban aesthetic.&rdquo; Its succeeding projects were <em><strong>Moving Dance @ LRT Dance Express</strong></em>, 2010, <em><strong>Underground</strong></em> and <em><strong>Hijack Dance</strong></em>, both in 2011, and <em><strong>RE: Rosas ng Maynila @ BGC</strong></em>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 2014 marked the last of the Wifi Body Festival which aptly culminated with works of choreographers who, looking back at their years of producing contemporary dance, created new works placing their practice not just in the context of Philippine dance but in the much bigger context of Philippine society. Even without the festival, CCP continues the competition to cover emerging choreographers and developing artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As proven by the increase in the number of contemporary works and choreographers in the country after the 1990s, contemporary dance is a dynamic and critical practice. Thus, in the future, practitioners might evolve other ways of characterizing its contours and aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"indigenousdance\" name=\"indigenousdance\"></a>Indigenous Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The decades after martial rule saw folk dance or <em>katutubong sayaw</em>, initially rooted in communal life, thrive in a time of uprootedness. Dancers left their ancestral lands to work in urban jungles or in foreign lands. Most merely knew the moves but not the why&rsquo;s behind the shuffling of feet or the outstretched arms or the syncopated beats. Audiences fell under the spell of western pop culture and demanded drama and extravaganza instead of simpler dance forms. But folk dance did adapt. Some were performed as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">street dances</a> or in mass demonstrations. Others were staged for local and regional cultural events and incorporated the influences of dance troupes based in Metro Manila and changes in technology (Namiki 2014, 74). In various ways and forms, folk dance during the post-EDSA Revolt thrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the increase in cross-cultural contacts, diffusion of Western and Asian pop culture to the Philippines, and the intensification of technology&rsquo;s influence on the lives of the Filipinos resulting in the disappearance of many traditional cultural practices and rituals, some folk dances continued to be integral to communal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalingas</a>, the <em>bodong</em> peace pact rite with its indigenous ceremonial dance has continued up to the 21st century. The establishment of a bodong between Kalinga groups is marked by prolonged feasting, the playing of musical instruments, singing, and dancing. There is also dancing in the <em>galigad</em> ceremony where a peace-pact holder turns over a bodong to someone else, usually his son. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/42\"><strong>bendiyan</strong></a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, which originated in Kabayan, Benguet as a dance celebrating a successful headhunt or the tribe&rsquo;s victory against its enemies, continued in the 21st century as a dance honoring Kabunian, the supreme being of the Benguet or Ibaloy or as a thanksgiving dance for a bountiful harvest. In the Sulu archipelago, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dances</a> to drive away spirits that cause illness are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Badjao</a> <strong>pagjinn</strong>, the <strong>magjuwata</strong> from South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi, the <strong>magpugot</strong> from Musu, and the <strong>magsalba</strong> from Bulikulul, the last two, in Siasi. Aside from propitiating the spirits called <em>apo-jin</em>, the dance is likewise done for a good catch, trouble-free childbirth, long life, peaceful death, or a smooth journey to heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very apparent was how folk dance continued to be one of the most popular forms of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/50\">cultural dancing</a> after the 1986 EDSA Revolt. As the nation rebuilt its image through tourism after the fall of Marcos, folk dance was a regular in hotels, restaurants, casinos, cruise ships, tourist sites, and various events aimed to attract both local and foreign tourists. In 2002, of the total 667,226 OFWs deployed by the Philippines, around 77,870 OFWs went to Japan (POEA 2003) and many of these were cultural performers dancing the country&rsquo;s most popular folk dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As guest entertainers in Japan, the dancers had booking contracts with their agents and club managers and were required to show their artist&rsquo;s certification and other &ldquo;documentary credentials&rdquo; from the Philippines. But even if these cultural dancers were accredited under the Artist Record Book System by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority after undergoing basic training in dancing, singing, and other performing arts, they were not spared from employment abuse. A number had no choice but provide other forms of entertainment, including prostitution. Unfortunately, as &ldquo;professional guest performing artists&rdquo; and not &ldquo;workers,&rdquo; the labor law in Japan did not apply to them (Matsuda 2003, 3). Beginning in 2004, there was a decline in the number of Filipino cultural performers going to Japan because its government was forced to impose stringent requirements for entertainers entering the country (Sun Star Manila 2011).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the 21st century, folk dance performances were seen in almost all popular travel destinations in the Philippines such as Villa Escudero in San Pablo City and Tam-Awan Village in Baguio. Other areas were Boracay, Cebu, Davao, and Bohol which is famous for its Loboc river cruise dancers. The <em><strong>Amazing Show</strong></em> in Manila and Cebu is perhaps one of the biggest productions of cultural dancing featuring gays and transgenders performing indigenous ethnic dances from the northern and southern parts of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the martial law era, there was more room for the &ldquo;folk&rdquo; in CCP after the 1986 EDSA Revolt. Before the revolt, reaching out to the regions &ldquo;usually meant transporting performances created by Manila artists to the provinces, which tended to reduce regional artists and audiences to the status of passive observers or receptors of &ldquo;high art&rdquo; from the &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; center to the &ldquo;deprived peripheries&rdquo; (Tiongson 2006, 35). But this all changed in 1986 as a wave of nationalism&mdash;a Filipino First mentality&mdash;swept the nation. CCP&rsquo;s newly appointed administrators fought for more exposure for Filipino artists and the accessibility of art to all socio-economic classes. It included another folkloric dance troupe, the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG), in its roster of beneficiaries. Through CCP grants or in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society</a>, the ROFG conducted dance workshops for school teachers, held lecture-demonstrations for children, and provided lectures on Philippine folk dance and traditions (Namiki 2014, 50). The ROFG launched various programs aimed to expand the body of knowledge on Philippine folk dance. Its <em><strong>Unpublished Dances of the Philippines</strong></em> series presented dances and rituals that have never been included in dance books or integrated in the repertoires of performing groups in Metro Manila (Namiki 2014, 46).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bayanihan was declared the National Folk Dance Company of the Philippines in 1998, the year the country celebrated its centennial as a Republic. The two state-supported folk dance companies not only differed in their styles of folk dance but also in how they addressed the different needs of the State. The ROFG&rsquo;s folkloric performance attempted to hew closely to the &ldquo;original&rdquo; folk dance forms (i.e., dances as &ldquo;practiced or performed by native dancers of cultural/ethnic communities&rdquo;) while the Bayanihan rendered folk dances in a more theatrical manner (Namiki 2014, 60). The Bayanihan was more visible in government-sponsored international events in the Philippines and in international tours as a representative of the country, while the ROFG&rsquo;s overseas engagements were more dedicated to local audiences, focusing on productions to educate the Filipinos. To a large extent, the two companies complemented each other&rsquo;s contribution in creating a sense of nationhood. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Obusan</a> was proclaimed National Artist for dance in 2006, almost 20 years after the last National Artist Award for dance was given to the first director of Bayanihan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2571\">Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</a>, in 1988 (Namiki 2014, 80-81).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were two folk dance festivals CCP supported after EDSA 1: the <em><strong>Pang-alay: A Festival of Philippine Folk Dances</strong></em> and the <em><strong>Sari-Saring Sayaw, Sama-Samang Galaw: Mga Tradisyon at Interpretasyon</strong></em> (Different Dances, Unified Movements: Traditions and Interpretations), both held during the Philippine Arts Month in February. These festivals brought together folk dance groups from all over the country. Some of these were the Araullo University Dance Group, Bayanihan, Bungkos Palay Dance Ensemble of Science City of Munoz, Centro Escolar University Dance Troupe, Kaamulan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3109\">Kabpapagariya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2502\">Kaloob&nbsp;Philippine Music and Dance Ministry</a>, Kalilayan Folkloric Group-MESUF, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2506\">Lahing Batangan Dance Troupe</a>, Lahing Kayumanggi Dance Ensemble of Laguna, Nagalas Chi Kalinga, Nayong Pilipino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Philippine Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a>, ROFG, Sandiwang Kayumanggi Folk Dance Troupe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2594\">Silliman University Kahayag Dance Troupe</a>, Sindaw Philippines Performing Arts Guild, Sining Bulakenyo ng Malolos, Sining Kalinangan Mapua Tech Dance Company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2595\">Sining Kumintang ng Batangas</a>, Sining Lahi Folk Dance Troupe, St Anne Theater Dance Company of Taguig, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2612\">University of the East Dance Troupe</a>, and the UPLB Filipiniana Dance Troupe. Over the years, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2488\">Hwa Yi Ethnic Dance Center</a>, a group of young performers of indigenous Chinese dance, has regularly joined the festivals, promoting cultural understanding between Filipinos and Chinese. The support given by CCP to these events was a way of reaching out to dance groups in other regions and tapping them to help create a common national heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another space that has served as a comfortable home for folk dance is the university. At the Palawan State University, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2596\">Sining Palawan Dance Troupe</a> concentrates on promoting the province&rsquo;s indigenous dances as well as the dances from southern Philippines. At the University of Santo Tomas, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2611\">Salinggawi Dance Troupe</a> continues to perform popular folk dances such as the <strong>maglalatik</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/94\"><strong>sayaw sa bangko</strong></a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2420\">Bulacan State University&rsquo;s Lahing Kayumanggi Dance Troupe</a> has its own offerings, too&mdash;a wide variety of traditional Philippine dances that includes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2\">occupational</a> and festival dances, and even war dances. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Philippine Normal College Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a> continues to perform both the country&rsquo;s katutubong sayaw and native songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country&rsquo;s premiere university, the University of the Philippines (UP), is home to one of the most acclaimed folk dance troupes in the country. The UP Filipiniana Dance Company, founded in 1935 as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2615\">UP Folk Song and Dance Club</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a>, has, for 80 years, served as training ground for future torchbearers of Philippine cultural dances. It has provided young dancers rigorous cross-training in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> and contemporary dance, and has cultivated their passion for research in the area of folk dance. The UP Filipiniana was known for its Cordillera region and Muslim Mindanao dance repertoires. It represented the country in international festivals, the most recent one being Pyesta Kolon Datal held in Aug 2015, organized by the Conseil International des Organisations de Festival de Folklor et d&rsquo;arts Traditionnels (CIOFF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other school-based dance groups include the Centro Escolar University Dance Troupe, Far Eastern University Folk Dance Group, Ingat Kapandayan Cultural Dancers of the Notre Dame of Jolo College, Sandiwang Kayumanggi Folk Dance Troupe of the Carlos P. Garcia High School in Manila, Silliman University Kahayag Dance Troupe, Sining Kalinangan Mapua Tech Dance Company, Sining Lahi Folk Dance Troupe of the Lakandula High School in Manila, Sining Kumintang ng Batangas of the Bauan High School, Lahing Batangan Dance Troupe of the Lyceum of the Philippines University in Batangas, and the St Louis University Dance Troupe. All these have performed and won recognitions&nbsp;both in the Philippines and abroad. Other active groups are the Marikina Dance Guild, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2513\">Leyte Dance Theater</a>, Mga Anak ng Inang Daigdig, and Fiesta Filipino Dance Troupe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond academe, various community- and provincial-based groups that promote indigenous dances continue to flourish. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2470\">Francisca Reyes Aquino Memorial Foundation (FRAMF)</a>, for example, has been conducting folk dance workshops and seminars in schools and communities across the archipelago since 1991. With the guidance of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2394\">AlunAlun Dance Circle</a>, on the other hand, has focused on preserving and promoting the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong>/<strong>igal</strong>/<strong>pansak</strong></a>, the indigenous dance among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Samal</a>, Badjao/<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> peoples of the Sulu Archipelago, through both traditional and nontraditional choreographies. In 2015, Fernando Amilbangsa was conferred the Ramon Magsaysay Award for her &ldquo;single-minded crusade in preserving the endangered artistic heritage of southern Philippines, and in creatively propagating a dance form that celebrates and deepens the sense of shared cultural identity among Asians&rdquo; (Ramon Magsaysay 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post&ndash;EDSA Revolt period also witnessed the popularization of regional folk dance festivities such as the Kaamulan (to gather) Festival in Cotabato joined in by indigenous groups in Bukidnon. From mid-February to the first week of March, these groups participate in numerous events, one of which is the performance of their rituals and dances such as the monkey and frog dances. The Kaamulan also features groups playing their indigenous instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Panagbenga (Blooming of Flowers) or Flower Festival in Baguio, a month-long celebration that begins in February and extends to the first week of March, spotlights gangsa music and Cordillera dances such as the Ibaloy&rsquo;s <strong>bendiyan</strong>. Among the numerous events are the Grand Street Dancing Parade followed by a field demonstration of dances based on folklore and rituals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agal-Agal (Seaweed) Festival, a five-day celebration participated in by 11 municipalities honoring the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, Badjao, Jama Mapun, and Tausug of southern Philippines, is held every September in Tawi-Tawi. The much-awaited dance performances of the different groups revolve around the seaweed harvest, pangalay dancing, and other aspects of the people&rsquo;s every day life. Tourists are treated to music from the <em>kulintangan</em> ensemble that serve as accompaniment to performances of the pangalay/igal, <strong>kuntao</strong>, <strong>silat</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/69\"><strong>lunsay</strong></a> which are dances unique to the indigenous peoples of Tawi-Tawi. The colorful attires of the performers are trimmed with seaweeds and various marine products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Older festivals that began before or during the martial law period as part of tourism continued after the EDSA Revolt. Most, if not all, of these festive forms were magnified in terms of length of celebration, financial investment, and cultural articulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aklan&rsquo;s Kalibo, Ibajay, Batan, Makato, and Altavas witnessed their Ati-Atihan Festival in honor of the Child Jesus or Santo Ni&ntilde;o evolve into a more colorful and upbeat event which would run for a month, culminating on the 3rd Sunday of January (Reyes-Tinagan 2001, 47-8). The <em>budyong</em>, <em>agong</em> or <em>bagtoe</em> sounds, shouts and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chants</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Ati</a>, songs of the Maraynon, and the <strong>inano</strong> (monkey dance), <strong>inagong</strong> (Maraynon war dance), and <strong>langagaran</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a>) dances gave way to innovations (Reyes-Tinagan 2001, 104). It was after the EDSA Revolt when the celebration intensified, with snare <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a> and lyres and even <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">bands</a> becoming more regular musical accompaniments. Revelers in Kalibo came in character costumes like Michael Jackson or as show girls in the famous Parisian music hall Folies Bergere, dancing like the King of Pop or a cabaret performer (Alcedo 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cebu, the Ati-Atihan-inspired Sinulog, which began in 1980, evolved into one of the country&rsquo;s biggest festivals. Celebrated on the third Sunday of January to honor the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, the festivity has several groups of participants in flamboyant costumes weaving through the streets while dancing the <strong>sinulog</strong>. To the beat of the drums, participants take two steps forward, one step back, a combination quite different from that of Kalibo&rsquo;s Ati-Atihan. As a way of keeping the integrity of the sinulog in the wake of various choreographic innovations, dance workshops and demonstrations were sponsored by the CCP, together with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, and the Philippine Folk Dance Society. Physical Education teacher and choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2601\">Dolores Suzara</a> was a key figure in the efforts to impart to the participants the significance of the festival. The Sinulog is also celebrated in other provinces in the Visayas: in Kabankalan, Negros Oriental, Digos, Davao del Sur, and in Jimalalud, Negros Oriental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dinagyang of Iloilo, which was inspired by the popularity of Kalibo&rsquo;s Ati-Atihan and the religious component of Cebu&rsquo;s Sinulog, became more magnified from the late 1990s onwards. The simple linear formation and basic &ldquo;step right, step left, step right, raise left&rdquo; footwork, which was close to that of Kalibo&rsquo;s footwork in the 1970s, transformed into criss-crossing formations in the 1980s. As much as there was a strong presence of popular culture in the dances, the distinct movement vocabulary of indigenous groups in the Southern Philippines also found its way to the choreographies (Buensuceso 2014, 2015). And with choreographers attending dance workshops in Manila, the modern and contemporary dance vocabularies have been woven into the ethnic or so-called tribal movements of the dances (Flogen 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Street dancing is also integral to several festivals rejoicing the defeat of Lucifer by Saint Michael the Archangel. In Iligan City, street dancing, which has become the main event of the Kasadya (Merriment) Festival, is enriched by different local dances such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/53\"><strong>diyandi</strong></a> (dance in honor of Saint Michael), <strong>eskrima</strong> (war dance), Higaonon dances, and the <strong>yawa-yawa</strong> (devil-devil) (Alejandro 2008, 74-5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Tinagba Festival in Iriga City, Camarines Sur, farmers express their gratitude to Our Lady of Lourdes by &ldquo;symbolically offer[ing] their first crop&rdquo; to her. A major part of the celebration is the Agta Tabangon or Itum (black) group performing a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">dance mimicking</a> their way of life in the mountains (Alejandro 2008, 101).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as if the grand festivals are not enough to boast each region&rsquo;s faith, history, tradition, cultural dances, and agricultural produce, the annual Aliwan Fiesta or the so-called Mother of All Fiestas was organized by the Manila Broadcasting Company in 2003. The Cultural Street Dance Competition is considered the highlight of the gathering of the best cultural performances of the country. The competing contingents perform folk dances combined with popular western dances as they parade from the Quirino Grand Stand to the Aliw Theater, in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP Complex</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These celebrations continue to draw huge audiences, both local and foreign tourists attending not so much as to see the choreographies of local dance groups but to soak in the carnivalesque atmosphere, and with all senses heightened, gyrate like everyone else to the deafening sound of the drums and feel a sense of oneness with the crowd. Because all these festivals are crucial to their regions&rsquo; tourism program, it is inevitable that they become more commercially appealing every year. Yet, the danger of forgetting the significance of the festivals has been counterbalanced by efforts of the organizing committees to keep the performances in line with the supposed meaning of the celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The festivals may have placed folk dances in a context that forced them to relentlessly innovate, resulting in modified movement vocabulary and tempo, but the very same context has also provided these dances a space for their visibility. In the 21st century, most of these dances have been taken out of their original settings. They are danced on stage, instead of being embedded in the daily activities of indigenous communities. We see performances of folk dances aboard cruise ships, in barangay basketball courts, in variety shows on television, and in restaurants, bars, and hotel lobbies in the Philippines and abroad. Folk dance, according to critics, has become purely for commercial purposes, and caters to western theater aesthetics to meet the demands of an audience that only seeks to be entertained by something new and exotic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paradigm shifts, however, have allowed a more liberal, yet still critical approach to folk dances. To say that the dances lost their cultural mooring when they were staged by universities, integrated into commercial festivals, or performed in various venues both in the Philippines and abroad, is to assume that they no longer embody the &ldquo;folk&rdquo; or the people&rsquo;s beliefs, practices, and aspirations. But the history of Philippine dance has proven that it will always be a dynamic form&mdash;a corporeal, religious/spiritual, historical, and material practice expressing the people&rsquo;s hopes and dreams. An embodiment of both sacred and secular investments, the folk dances of the 21st century continue to express not only the body&rsquo;s constant response to cultural and economic changes but also to the spiritual needs of every performer and the collective impulse of a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"socialdance\" name=\"socialdance\"></a>Social Dances</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The landscape of dance in the Philippines during the post-EDSA Revolt was also marked by the rise in number of clubs, fitness centers, and ballroom studios that became the hub of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social dancing</a> enthusiasts. The dance fusions found in these places could be traced to the popularity of dancing in Philippine TV beginning in the 1980s. As variety shows became a household phenomenon, there was likewise an increase in demand for dancers who became mainstays of shows like <em><strong>Vilma!</strong></em> later retitled <em><strong>Vilma In Person</strong></em>, 1986-95; <em><strong>Superstar</strong></em>, 1972-89; <em><strong>Maria! Maria!</strong></em>, later retitled <em><strong>Maricel Live!</strong></em>, 1986-89; <em><strong>The Other Side of Alma</strong></em>, 1981-83 and <em><strong>Loveliness</strong></em>, 1987-88; <em><strong>Manilyn Live!</strong></em>, 1986-88; <em><strong>Lotlot and Friends</strong></em>, 1985-88; <em><strong>Tonight with Dick and Carmi</strong></em>, 1988-91; <em><strong>POPS!</strong></em>, 1992-96; <em><strong>Vina</strong></em>, 1993-94; and <em><strong>The Sharon Cuneta Show</strong></em>, 1986-88 in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4851\">IBC 13</a> and 1988-97 in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4749\">ABS-CBN 2</a>. Television viewers would look forward to the impressive opening numbers of their favorite stars who hired choreographers and rehearsed for hours to impress the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/65/1376\">audience</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choreographers behind these shows, in particular Geleen Eugenio and Miles Obra, invented the &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; move where the female star was lifted and twirled overhead by her male partner. They also introduced the &ldquo;<em>buhat-tapon</em>&rdquo; (lift and throw) combination where the female superstar was lifted by three male dancers, thrown into space, and then caught by six other male dancers at the other end of the dance floor (Ramos 2013, 134).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the popularity of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/109\">TV dancing</a>, a number of independent groups danced their way to commercial television. Some of these were the VIP Dancers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2559\">Powerdance</a>, Hotlegs, Adrenaline, Whiplash, Solid Gold, Discorama Dancers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2498\">Dance Arts</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2536\">Veda Ba&ntilde;ez Metropolitan Dancers</a>. The VIP Dancers was one of the most famous groups showcasing a range of dance styles: <strong>commercial pop</strong>, <strong>street dance</strong>, <strong>ballet</strong>, <strong>jazz</strong>, <strong>gymnastics</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\"><strong>hip-hop</strong></a>, <strong>ballroom</strong>, <strong>folk</strong>, <strong>funk</strong>, <strong>broadway</strong>, <strong>theatrics</strong> or <strong>theatrical</strong>, and athletic dance steps. <strong>Ballroom fusion</strong> was associated with this group and the combination of styles inspired more dance fusions on TV dancing which continued until the first decade of the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also regularly seen on TV in the 1980s were dance groups that promoted record companies: the Vicor Dancers, Blackgold Dancers, WEA Dancers, Dyna Dancers, and the WEA Twins. A number of dance contests became much-awaited segments of daily TV shows which popularized the <strong>Spanish hustle</strong>, <strong>salsa</strong>, <strong>LA walk</strong>, <strong>swing</strong>, <strong>the bop-bop girl</strong>, and <strong>cycling punk</strong>. There were likewise a number of all-boy dance groups that usually guested in TV shows: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4213\">Gary Valenciano</a>&rsquo;s Maneuvers, the Streetboys, and the Universal Motion Dancers (Ramos 2010, 134).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1990s, a group of alluring dancers became a hit. Initially a group of back-up dancers for the &ldquo;Laban o Bawi&rdquo; (Fight or Retreat) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1358\">game show</a> of the noontime TV show <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><em><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></em></a> (Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!), the Sex Bomb Dancers were known for their flexibility and ability to &ldquo;contort their bodies like invertebrates&rdquo; (Ramos 2013, 135). Their hit song and dance &ldquo;Spageti Pababa&rdquo; (Spaghetti Going Down) was phenomenal and in 2010, their music video &ldquo;Bilog na Hugis Itlog&rdquo; (Round-shaped Egg) was used to teach viewers the newly implemented elections procedure. After its stint with <em><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></em>, the group joined the show <em><strong>Happy Truck ng Bayan</strong></em> (Happy Truck of the Community) of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4975\">TV5</a>. Later, the group&rsquo;s members became freelance dancers and appeared in several shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1990s saw another generation of celebrity dancers which was also backed up by the VIP Dancers. Binibining Pilipinas-Universe Charlene Gonzales and 1993 Miss Universe Dayanara Torres, together with Troy Montero and Franco Laurel, impressed viewers in their show titled <em><strong>Eezy Dancing</strong></em> on TV5, 1995-98, which was later retitled <em><strong>Keep On Dancing</strong></em> on ABS-CBN 2, 1998-2001. The warm reception to ballroom dancing on Philippine TV carried over to clubs, afternoon discos, and bars in urban centers especially Metro Manila as more enthusiasts not only frequented these places but also hired dance instructors to teach them the moves. As ballroom dancing became more sensational, it morphed into another social but extremely competitive dance, known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/51\"><strong>dancesport</strong></a>. Like the earlier ballroom dances that were featured in TV variety shows, dancesport had its own share of television exposure: Lucy Torres-Gomez&rsquo;s <em><strong>Shall We Dance?</strong></em> on TV5, 2005-10, which eventually became <em><strong>Celebrity Dance Battle</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancesport in the Philippines was characterized by athleticism and became a &ldquo;higher level of ballroom&rdquo; (Samson 2014). Noticing that the Philippines had no dancesport organization, Blackpool Modern Standard champion (senior level)&nbsp;Paul Bishop connected the World Dance and Dancesport Council with the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) which was interested in participating in the World Ballroom Championship and in the Olympics. Through the efforts of the PSC and the newly formed Dancesport Council of the Philippines, Inc. (DSCPI), dancesport took off in the country. The DSCPI sponsored the first dance congress at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in 1997, an event which introduced the competitive style of ballroom dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local scene has provided encouragement to dance enthusiasts who could join a number of competitions all-year round. For example, the DSCPI holds amateur rankings three times a year. Cebu City hosts the <em><strong>Dancesport sa Sugbu</strong></em> while the annual <em><strong>Philippine Summer Ball</strong></em> is held in different regions of the country. Schools and universities have also provided a regular venue for students interested in dancesport. Almost every month of the first half of the year has competitions joined in by around 80 to 150 pairs (Samson, 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the exposure of the youth to dancesport in local competitions, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of children going into dancesport. In many competitions, majority of the contestants come from the youth sector&mdash;&ldquo;the Youth, Junior, and Juvenile athletes&rdquo;&mdash;and each event sees close to thirty couples vying for trophies and cash prizes (Samson, 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the international scene, Filipinos have also been winning in dancesport competitions: Michael Mendoza won in the South East Asian games dancesport category, Alberto Dimarucut and Deborah Civardi were the first Filipino professionals representing the country in Blackpool, England in 2000, and Edna Ledesma was the first Filipina to win a gold medal (Latin senior division) in the prestigious Blackpool Competition in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pres Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&rsquo;s Proclamation 203 in 2002 set Nov 4 to 10 as National Dancesport Week. Since then, dancesport competitions have become more popular in schools and universities around the country. Sports associations like the State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association, the Private Schools Athletic Association, and the Association of Local Colleges and Universities have included this category in their competitions. At the 2013 DSCPI National Championship, a new category of dancesport was introduced: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/51\">wheelchair dancing</a>. The new form was envisioned to encourage differently-abled people to explore their kinesthetic talents. After participating in workshops, not only were the dancers able to join both local and international competitions. They were also invited to perform in shows and TV contests (Samson 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practitioners have been training teachers and coaches all around the country. A number of local coaches, on the other hand, have not only offered free workshops to their students but also sponsored their training under foreign coaches. Professional dancesport organizations like the Philippine Dance Teacher Association, the Philippine Professional Dance Sport Association, and the DSCPI-Professional Division hold conferences, seminars, and workshops to further strengthen dancesport in the country. Dancesport Team Cebu, in collaboration with Cebu&rsquo;s local government, has offered free workshops to children coming from different parts of the province, enabling them to join national competitions (Samson 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From social clubs to ballroom studios, to fitness centers, and to basketball courts. Social dancing is no longer just a hobby or a leisure activity among Filipinos who get together for various reasons. Upon migrating to other venues or spaces, including television, social dance has gained unprecedented popularity over the years. No longer is social dance generally associated with the older generation as more young girls and boys have fearlessly executed dance routines with grace and energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"hiphop\" name=\"hiphop\"></a>Hip-hop, Cheerdance, and Flash Mob Dance</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From the late 1980s onward, the Philippines, like most, if not&nbsp;all, countries in the world, experienced the intensification of the effects of new media on almost all aspects of society. The digital age inevitably informed the ways by which Filipinos looked at their identity and created communities which were no longer confined to the national borders. Social networking redefined or even reconfigured the ways by which Filipinos experienced politics, religion, and culture. It is in the context of the drastic changes in technology which in turn accelerated the pace of globalization that dance in the Philippines saw itself moving towards different directions in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Two significant dance phenomena that caught the country&rsquo;s attention were hip-hop and the dance flash mob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand hip-hop in the Philippines is to view it as pulses in the country&rsquo;s cultural histories. Hip-hop is alive, especially in the underground scene, and like a pulse, it has distinct beats corresponding to specific historical landmarks and encounters with mainstream media as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its emergence in the South Bronx of the US in the 1960s, hip-hop has always been an inter- and trans-disciplinary cultural phenomenon, an amalgam of art forms, or in hip-hop language, the &ldquo;elements.&rdquo; <em>Turntablism</em> is closely linked to music, graffiti to the visual arts, rap to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, and <strong>breaking</strong> to dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the Filipino-American <em>balikbayan</em> (Filipinos visiting from abroad) brought with them the music and movies featuring the hip-hop culture phenomenon in the West. Also in the 1980s, mainstream media, specifically dance shows, highlighted new trends in fashion and dance from the US. It was the dance-everything decade inundated by dance contests, dance movies, and dance clubs. Television became one, if not the primary, avenue by which hip-hop dancing was seen and learned by viewers almost round the clock; there were the evening dance variety shows, <em><strong>Loveliness</strong></em> and <em><strong>Vilma</strong></em>, and noontime shows <em><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></em> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><em><strong>Student Canteen</strong></em></a> with dance contests. Perhaps the most important dance contest of this era was <em><strong>Dance 10</strong></em>, featuring pioneer <strong>poppers</strong>, <strong>lockers</strong>, and <strong>breakers</strong> such as Darwin Tuason, Jerry Dignum, and The Eclipse Breakers&rsquo; Francis Magalona. While these programs may not have exactly promoted hip-hop culture and its elements, it was through them that some careers of mainstream hip-hop icons took off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1984, three major dance-themed films featuring hip-hop dancing were released: <em><strong>Hot Shots</strong></em>, with Gary Valenciano showing off his <strong>strutting</strong>, <strong>popping</strong> and <strong>locking</strong>; <em><strong>Campus Beat</strong></em>, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4563\">Aga Muhlach</a> dancing the Michael Jackson style of popping, locking, and <strong>shuffling</strong>; and <em><strong>Bagets 2</strong></em>, with Francis Magalona executing strut, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\">breakdance</a>, and some power moves. The music industry&rsquo;s WEA Dancers, Knap Sax, Funk System Dancers, Octo Full Force, Vicor Dancers, Octo Mechanics, and (Octo) Maneuvers became major players in promoting hip-hop dance and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/778\">music</a> all over the country. They became inspirations of a number of hip-hop <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\">b-boy</a> crews</strong> that crossed into the mainstream like the Street Boys, which became popular for their power moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous dance clubs and discotheques were places for producers and choreographers to scout fresh talents who could be developed as pop stars specializing in rapping and dancing. Some of these dancers&rsquo; hangouts were Faces, Kudos, Jealousy, and Mars in Makati, and Heartbeat in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also happening simultaneously with the popularity of hip-hop films was the immediate formation of hip-hop crews, most of them b-boy crews. The new hip-hop culture that embodied youth rage, dissatisfaction, unrest and at the same time, a sense of brotherhood and camaraderie amongst crew members, fit perfectly into the brewing unrest in the country that eventually erupted into People Power or EDSA Revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the early hip-hop crews that were formed in the Philippines were in fact breakers or b-boy crews like the pioneering Info-Clash Breakers whose members included the hip-hop icon Andrew E., Ground Control, Whooze Co., and The Eclipse Breakers, crew of the &ldquo;Master Rapper&rdquo; Francis Magalona (Junaini 2015). These groups would meet up in empty parking spaces around the Metro and other nearby towns surrounding the Greater Manila Area. Frequented places were Quad and Glorietta in Makati, Ali Mall in Cubao, and places near the US bases in Angeles City, Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greatly influenced by hip-hop culture in America, these hip-hop crews or clans were usually composed of groups that specialized in the four elements of hip-hop&mdash;rap, breaking, turntablism, and graffiti. Some of the famous and pioneer hip-hop crews and/or clan affiliations were Rock All Parties Crew, the early crew of Andrew E., Mastaplann, True Asiatik Tribe, the Battle Krew with J-Mastah and B-boy Artstrong as head b-boys, and 4EastFlava with its affiliated breaker crew Funkadellic Posse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the mid-1980s, a paradigm shift in cultural practices was felt with the fall of the Marcoses. The state&rsquo;s privileging of the fine arts or <em>beaux arts</em> over <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">popular music</a> and songs and disco dancing gave way to the resurfacing of many artists and artistic productions previously snubbed by the dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular musicians were very active during the three-day EDSA Revolt and even created an &ldquo;anthem&rdquo; for the uprising&mdash;the composition <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/897\">&ldquo;Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo&rdquo;</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4113\">Jim Paredes</a> and sung by a number of established pop singers at the time. These artists who formed the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit or OPM were later at the forefront of the struggle against the dictatorship. They also became the voices and faces of the new Aquino regime (Valdes 2013) which supported them by promoting and patronizing popular music and establishing new cultural and artistic institutions that would promote &ldquo;true/ly&rdquo; Filipino arts and culture through the NCCA&nbsp;and setting up policies to promote original Filipino music. In the years that came after, cultural productions centered on the theme of &ldquo;national pride and identity&rdquo; through various experimentations in indigenization by using Filipino and other local languages in popular music, interweaving indigenous visual motifs with new fashion, and merging indigenous rhythm and beat with popular tunes and compositions. This trend was picked up by the growing hip-hop community in the country. While the theme of national pride and identity was close to the roots of hip-hop culture in America where productions mostly revolved around racial pride and identity, Filipino hip-hop pioneers used &ldquo;indigenization&rdquo; as a way to truly create and represent a Filipino hip-hop culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 1990s, there were three spaces for hip-hop dancing: mainstream media, or television shows and movies; dance clubs and discotheques; and underground hip-hop meeting points which were mostly parking lots used as battle grounds for breakers and rappers. Most of these spaces, in one way or another, influenced the development of, paved the way for, and or simply intersected with many of the hip-hop icons and game changers in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1990, Francis M or the Man from Manila and his crew&nbsp;The Eclipse (b-boy crew)&nbsp;and Spindicate Posse (DJ crew), which included pioneer turntablist Dj Master of Disaster or Dj MOD, released the song <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/946\">&ldquo;Mga Kababayan Ko&rdquo;</a> with its indigenous instrumentations and mixes. Rapping in sarong accentuated by accessories with indigenous motifs, their song and fashion statement truly represented the post-EDSA Revolt mood and the new cultural agenda of the Aquino regime centered on nationalism, Filipino identity, and pride. This became the mark of the so-called Golden Age of hip-hop in the country which was characterized by numerous fissures in hip-hop practices and politics, including debates in language and the rise of femmecees, old and new school hip-hop, novelty and authentic hip-hop, and even studio and street hip-hop dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Golden Age of hip-hop which lasted until the mid-1990s, there was still a steady stream of so-called manufactured rappers with dancers such as Lady Diane, MC Lara, and even <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4905\">Michael V.</a> as part of their acts. But underground hip-hop culture whose practitioners were schooled and rooted in the hip-hop communities in the US came to dominate the hip-hop scene both under and above ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mastaplann was a game changer in this new hip-hop culture in the Philippines. The group included <em>balikbayans</em> MCs Johnny &ldquo;Type&rdquo; Luna and Butch &ldquo;Tracer&rdquo; Velez and affiliated with the turntablist group The Megateam composed of DJ Sonny, DJ Ouch, and DJ MOD, and the b-boy crew and Battle Krew with members like J-mastah, B-boy Artstrong, and MC Type&rsquo;s brother Mark Luna. Mastaplann introduced to the mainstream dance scene a kind of hip-hop fashion characterized by oversized jerseys and extremely low-waist baggy pants and jamming or freestyle dancing associated with the streets. It was also one of the first groups that produced a music video featuring the four elements of hip-hop, exploiting the new MTV Asia hype when it aired in 1992 in order to disseminate &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; hip-hop culture in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1990s, Andrew E.&rsquo;s pioneering Rock All Parties Crew of the early 1980s continued to make waves in the hip-hop scene with Espiritu&rsquo;s continuing DJ stints in various discotheques around the Metro as well as his hosting of rap contests on television and radio shows. The winners of these competitions became the first artists that Andrew E. developed and produced under what is considered to be the first hip-hop <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/38/843\">recording company</a> in the Philippines, the Dongalo Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disco Mix Club or DMC Philippines, headed by former radio Dj Jessie Cambosa, was the main platform that allowed all elements of hip-hop to flourish in mainstream media. DMC did not only manage hip-hop crews composed of MCs but also developed DJ and b-boy crews, so much so that in 1993 the First Asian Dance Music Convention was held at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC). The convention pulled together b-boys, hip-hop crews, and enthusiasts from all over the Philippines and around the globe, and hosted DJ workshops and seminars on hip-hop culture, as well as the First Asian Dj Mixing Championship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following years, hip-hop dance occupied a relatively smaller space in the hip-hop culture as hip-hop music became the focus of most crews. This was music that particularly veered away from the party, dance, and club type, and focused more on either&nbsp;<em>gangsta</em> (slang for gangster) or socially conscious rap with heavy themes accompanied by heavier mixes that were not as dance-able as the earlier ones. But hip-hop dancing found new venues: the studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 21st century, the most popular hip-hop dance groups have been found in studios, some of them&nbsp;with almost no affiliation with other hip-hop crews. This has sparked debates on the issue of &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; and the difference between street dancers and studio dancers. But hip-hop dance crews produced by and hosted in studios were primarily responsible for the resurgence of hip-hop dance in the country, whether this was &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; hip-hop or not. They have created a steady stream of hip-hop dancers and enthusiasts through their classes and performances, respectively, engendering a new generation of performers and audiences for hip-hop. These dance crews have also provided a clearing for Filipino hip-hop dancers all over the world by joining and winning in worldwide hip-hop dance competitions. The Philippine All-Stars and the UP Street Dance Club are among the pioneers of hip-hop dance produced in studios. In recent years, film picked up on the resurgence of hip-hop culture. <em><strong>Pintakasi</strong></em>, 2012, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4302\">Lee Meily</a>, featured the first batch of Philippine All-Stars in its opening breaking credits. The hip-hop dance movie inspired by Francis M&rsquo;s song of the same title,&nbsp;<em><strong>Kaleidoscope World</strong></em>, released in 2013 and directed by Eliza Cornejo, is considered to be the first hip-hop dance movie in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Pinoy hip-hop is still largely concentrated in the Greater Manila Area, its energy in various urban centers across the country is undeniable. Cebu has one of the largest concentration of hip-hop practitioners in the Visayas while Zambaoanga released its own brand of Chabacano rap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also gaining a following beginning 2000s is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/48\"><strong>cheerdance</strong></a>, which has been the source of pride of the country&rsquo;s major universities, thus attracting more dancers from the student body. It gained public interest when the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) launched its cheerdance competition in the mid-1990s. Since then, cheerdance has become not just a much-awaited segment of every UAAP opening but has acquired its own identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheerdance in the Philippines might have its roots in the American sport of cheerleading which incorporates dance, gymnastics, cheer, group stunts, and pyramids (American Sport Education Program 2009), but it has evolved its own particular characteristics such as having a specific theme and being longer in routine. Examples of themes adopted by the competing cheerdance teams in the 2013 UAAP cheerdance competition are the party theme (UP Pep Squad), Egyptian theme (UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe), Arabian theme (NU Pep Squad), military theme (Animo Pep Squad of DLSU), sports theme (ADMU Blue Babble Batallion), and fire theme (UE Red Squad) (Gangalani 2014). From the mid-1990s onwards, melding folk dance, hip-hop, martial arts, gymnastics, and even yoga movements in well-conceptualized choreographies has become a common cheerdance practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, two universities with strong dance groups have been neck and neck in the competitions&mdash;the University of the Philippines Varsity Pep Squad (UP Pep Squad) and the University of Santo Tomas Salinggawi Dance Troupe (UST Salinggawi). In the early years of the competition, UP sent its UP Filipiniana Dance Troupe but from 1998 onwards, the UP Varsity Pep Squad competed for the university. Other groups such as the Far Eastern University&rsquo;s Cheering Squad and the Ateneo de Manila&rsquo;s Ateneo Blue Babble Battalion challenged UP and UST beginning 2010. In 2013 and 2014, the National University&rsquo;s Pep Squad dominated the competition with their nearly perfect execution of stunts and dance moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippines holds four major competitions in cheerdance. Aside from the UAAP Cheer Dance Competition, there are three other local competitions: the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Cheer Dance Competition, the National Cheerleading Championships (NCC), and the Philippine National Games (PNG). The NCC&nbsp;has been active in promoting cheerleading and has an annual search for the best groups in the Philippines. Around 250 schools with 5,000 athletes have participated in the competition. Stressing the distinct form of cheerleading, NCC&rsquo;s efforts have been geared towards making the public realize that cheerleading is not just a form of entertainment but a sport in itself (Fernandez 2015). The Philippines&rsquo; 27-all-girls team, Team Pilipinas, won gold medals in the South East Asian Cheerleading Open from 2011 to 2013, and competed in Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore (Fernandez 2014; Dreschler 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Undoubtedly, both cheerdance and cheerleading have drawn the interest of the Filipinos. While the former is considered more artistic and the latter&nbsp;more athletic and thus considered a sport, both have become very popular in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the 21st century, television and movies seemed to have been overtaken by other forms of media in influencing dance. Digital technology and social media affected social dancing in tantalizing ways&nbsp;and gave birth to various art performances, foremost of which is the dance flash mob. The term refers to people mobilized through e-mail, cellular phones, and social media to do an unusual and entertaining activity in a designated place or places. It originated in New York City in 2003 when culture writer Bill Wasik astonished the world with extraordinary and quick performances by people who filled the city streets. The media called these surprising performances &ldquo;flash mobs&rdquo; (Walker 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>dance flash mob</strong> is utilized by One Billion Rising (OBR), the global campaign targeting the participation of one billion people to end violence against girls and women. Conceptualized by Eve Ensler, author of <em><strong>Vagina Monologues</strong></em>, the campaign seeks to mobilize girls, women, men, and the LGBT (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgenders) sector to gather in specific places in over 200 countries to express their protest against gender-based violence, oppression, and inequality. Through a choreography inspired by the theme song, the throngs who are mobilized feel a sense of community and solidarity. In the Philippines, simultaneous activities happen in many locations every year to celebrate OBR, a campaign that started in 2012 when a crowd led by women and girls from all social classes converged at the Liwasang Bonifacio, Manila on Bonifacio Day, Nov 30. They danced and sang &ldquo;One Billion Rising Philippines.&rdquo; The first dance flash mob of OBR led by the women&rsquo;s group&nbsp;Gabriela, OBR coordinator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3366\">Monique Wilson</a>, and feminist nun&nbsp;Sr Mary John Mananzan&nbsp;opened a whole day program on the 149th birthday of hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> (Guda 2012; Acayan 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, OBR campaigners like the Gabriela women&rsquo;s party utilized YouTube and social networking sites to disseminate the choreography for the theme song &ldquo;Isang Bilyong Babae ang Babangon&rdquo; (One Billion Women Will Rise). The pop choreography is composed of marching steps, side steps, and stomping of the feet followed by the raising of the right arm extended forward with the index finger pointing upward. The latter is the signature OBR movement symbolizing the act of rising. Other gestures and moves include clenched fists being raised overhead, clapping and waving of arms and hands, and blocking techniques from martial arts. The gestures of the choreography are named thematically such as &ldquo;March,&rdquo; &ldquo;One Billion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Resist and Shout,&rdquo; &ldquo;Defend,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fight Back,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Unite.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, principal spokesperson of OBR in the Philippines, Monique Wilson, led 5,000 people, including organizations such as the Gabriela Women&rsquo;s Party, Gabriela, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3119\">New Voice Company</a>, and the Quezon City Government in Tomas Morato, Quezon City to &ldquo;strike, dance, and rise&rdquo; on 17 Feb. Valentine&rsquo;s Day was renamed &ldquo;V-Day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Violence Against Women Day&rdquo; (Oliveros 2013). Mobilization through digital media resulted in the motley turn-out of &ldquo;risers&rdquo;&mdash;students in uniform, nuns, children, teachers, police, members of the entertainment business, and veiled Muslim women. There were dance numbers from the Maharlika Dance Group of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines and a poetry interpretation by members of Gabriela and the LGBT community of &ldquo;Still I Rise,&rdquo; a poem by Maya Angelou (Ranada 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simultaneous performance events of the 2014 &ldquo;rising for justice&rdquo; OBR gained the support of a greater number of people in the light of the alleged corruption and plunder cases committed by elected officials in the wake of natural and man-made calamities. The events called for action against many issues such as power hike, commercialized education, modern day slavery, and various forms of violence against women and children. There were gatherings in Metro Manila&mdash;at the University of the Philippines (UP), Diliman campus, with the UP PEP Squad impressing the crowd with their cheerdancing stunts and human pyramids; the Payatas dumpsite; Taguig City Hall; Maybunga Elementary School in Pasig City; Tondo, Manila; Mehan Garden, Manila; and the Japanese Embassy. Farmers and fisherfolk danced to protest against mining and unfair wages in Calatagan, Batangas and at Hacienda Luisita, Tarlac, respectively. Davao City had women leaders dancing by the beach while city folks participated in the dance flash mob at Rizal Park. Filipina migrant workers in Hongkong were among 10,000 people at Victoria Park calling for the abolition of modern slavery and seeking justice for Indonesian domestic worker, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, who was tortured by her employers (New Voice Company 2014; HK Pinoy TV 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBR&rsquo;s 2015 call was &ldquo;rise for revolution.&rdquo; The dance performances called for truth and government responsibility in the wake of the carnage at Mamasapano, Maguindanao with casualties among soldiers and civilians. The 2015 performances were participated in by women and men from indigenous groups all over the country: at the Bonifacio Shrine in Manila, the multisectoral crowd grooved to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a> group Talahib&rsquo;s interpretation of &ldquo;On Potok,&rdquo; a song about the dispossession of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2328\">Agta</a> people, and danced to the cheery and militant theme song &ldquo;Babangon na sa Rebolusyon&rdquo; (Rising to Revolution). One of the more memorable performances was the dance flash mob at the quadrangle of St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, Manila where 4,000 uniformed school children, teachers, and nuns danced to the 2015 theme song. Meanwhile at UP Baguio and at the People&rsquo;s Park, Cordillera, women performed their folk dances to the rhythm of native <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> (UPB Obra 2015). In Davao City, indigenous groups dressed in their colorful native costumes performed their ethnic dances accompanied by traditional instruments while the main flash mob at Rizal Park had thousands from all sectors and ages, majority of whom were women and girls. On Chater Road, Hongkong, Filipina migrant workers danced to the beat of the OBR theme songs &ldquo;Isang Bilyong Babae ang Babangon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Break the Chain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babangon na sa Rebolusyon&rdquo; (Lau and Chan 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OBR is a unique global campaign that relates the issue of women to bigger social problems. It locates domestic issues of each country in the international arena, generates international awareness about local problems, and builds solidarity across sectors, classes, and borders. The use of the dance flash mob gives the protest event a celebratory character that attracts the participation of thousands of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For almost 30 years after the 1986 EDSA Revolt, dance in the Philippines proved to be as dynamic and vibrant as ever. The end of the martial rule did not exactly result in overwhelming state support for the arts, let alone dance. But dance found a way of reinventing itself. Folk dance, ballet, contemporary dance, and many other popular forms such as hip-hop, cheerdance, and dance flash mob were able to locate themselves in a period characterized by unrelentless shifts in political alliances, economic instability, and heightened media influence on people&rsquo;s lives. The post-EDSA Revolt period may have seen and felt the effects of the global dance market on Philippine dance but it also saw the creative transformation of the country&rsquo;s dances. Compelled to face the cultural realities of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, dance in the Philippines raised a number of provocative inquiries regarding its very nature, form, and function in society. Both veteran and new choreographers, dancers, scholars and critics continued to enrich Philippine dance. Different choreographic visions emerged as a number of dance practitioners decided to create works on their own, with only minimal or even no assistance from government institutions. A plurality of styles became a mark of the post-EDSA Revolt era as the various dance genres responded to aesthetic, political, economic, and cultural issues. In an era of visual consumption, Philippine dance managed to have various trajectories and refused to be constrained by financial limitations. Space was no longer an issue as dance was seen on stage, on the streets, and other public places. <em>Through</em> dance and <em>in</em> dance, the Filipinos &ldquo;lived&rdquo; their negotiated identities in a period of so many possibilities. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Myra Beltran, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2491\">Joelle Jacinto</a>, Sarah Lumba, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3090\">Rosalie S.

He was fleeing, driven to exile by a people&#x2019;s uprising against his 21 years of authoritarian rule that saw the suppression of civil liberties, the torture and killing of thousands of political activists, and massive corruption that pushed the country further into debt. The 1983 assassination of Sen Benigno &#x201C;Ninoy&#x201D; Aquino and the subsequent 1986 EDSA Revolt paved the way for a new administration that was infused with new hope and faith in the restoration of freedoms in the country. After the EDSA Revolt, the concept &#x201C;democratic space&#x201D; became popular in the Philippines and was associated with the freedoms the new government by Corazon Aquino vowed to restore (Javate de Dios, Daroy, Kalaw-Tirol 1988, 234)."

Five essential thrusts were introduced: Filipinization, which aimed to produce &#x201C;original Filipino works rooted in the country&#x2019;s traditions&#x201D; (Tiongson 2009, 31-33); democratization, which opened CCP venues to more <a href=\"/6/47/27\">dance companies</a> and <a href=\"/6/47/24\">audiences</a>; decentralization, which encouraged the participation of the regions in the creation of a national culture; the promotion of artistic excellence, which recognized the pluralism of aesthetic excellence; and reorientation of international exchanges which emphasized the participation of Filipino artists in international events. These five thrusts would guide the productions and programs of the institution in the years to come. CCP&#x2019;s new leadership created and implemented programs in consultation with stakeholders outside the institution&#x2014;artists, dancers, musicians, film artists, cultural workers, and members of academe and media."

CCP opened its doors to competent dance companies outside its network through <a href=\"/6/47/24\">venue</a> <a href=\"/6/47/25\">grants</a> and the <em><strong>Pang-alay</strong></em> (Offering) series. In dance, BP II launched <a href=\"/6/47/30\">dance workshops</a> outside Metro Manila such as Davao and Iligan. To develop new linkages on the national and local level among dancers, choreographers, enthusiasts, and scholars, CCP hosted the first CCP National Dance Festival and Conference in Iloilo City in 1989.

The turn of the 21st century was marked not just by the visibility of artists working outside major establishments but also by the pronounced presence of popular culture on a global scale. New technologies paved the way for the circulation of literature, music, dance, performances, and all kinds of art forms beyond national borders. There was definitely a new energy felt in the realm of cultural production. The end of the Marcos era did not automatically result in the vigorous production of dance in the country. Although there was more freedom to explore the possibilities of dance, support for this ephemeral form was still an issue. Still, as an art that draws its form and energy from the human body, dance found novel ways of expressing itself."

Both companies aimed to preserve a distinctly Filipino identity in their repertoire, despite arguments that ballet and modern dance were foreign to our culture. The CCP&#x2019;s Coordinating Center for Dance, headed by former BP dancer <a href=\"/6/6/2495\">Nestor Jardin</a>, was tasked to coordinate the four resident companies of the CCP&#x2014;BP, PBT, ROFG, the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company&#x2014;and other groups, schools, and artists in the country. There were programs for <a href=\"/6/47/30\">dance education</a> and performance. The former included workshops from visiting foreign dance groups and choreographers; outreach workshops conducted by local teachers in the provinces and rural areas; and the annual <a href=\"/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> workshop.

A phenomenon that affected the dance companies was the recruitment of dancers for Hong Kong Disneyland.

The usage has a history rooted in particular geographical contexts and practices in the United States and Europe.

Thus, although the usage of &#x201C;contemporary dance&#x201D; has a European inflection (Lepecki 2004, 170-81), its emergence in other cultures did not necessarily take the form of direct translations of the European practice.

Downtown New York during this decade saw many activities of choreographers, known as the Judson Church Movement which rebelled against modern dance exemplified by prominent figures like Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey. Whereas the term &#x201C;modern dance&#x201D; had been generally defined according to a codified technique such as the Martha Graham technique, contemporary dance&#x2019;s &#x201C;revolution&#x201D; precisely consisted in liberating dance from any codification and insisting on being defined according to its context. The Judson Church artists disdained virtuosity, reduced dance to its essential elements devoid of scenic <a href=\"/6/47/29\">props and design</a>, and borrowed and experimented with the compositional techniques of other art forms to answer their inquiry into the nature of dance.

The aesthetics which resulted from inquiry and exploration of creative processes were applied by other choreographers in their work, although in varying degrees and with different perspectives.

The events called for action against many issues such as power hike, commercialized education, modern day slavery, and various forms of violence against women and children. There were gatherings in Metro Manila&#x2014;at the University of the Philippines (UP), Diliman campus, with the UP PEP Squad impressing the crowd with their cheerdancing stunts and human pyramids; the Payatas dumpsite; Taguig City Hall; Maybunga Elementary School in Pasig City; Tondo, Manila; Mehan Garden, Manila; and the Japanese Embassy. Farmers and fisherfolk danced to protest against mining and unfair wages in Calatagan, Batangas and at Hacienda Luisita, Tarlac, respectively. Davao City had women leaders dancing by the beach while city folks participated in the dance flash mob at Rizal Park. Filipina migrant workers in Hongkong were among 10,000 people at Victoria Park calling for the abolition of modern slavery and seeking justice for Indonesian domestic worker, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, who was tortured by her employers (New Voice Company 2014; HK Pinoy TV 2014)."

The 2015 performances were participated in by women and men from indigenous groups all over the country: at the Bonifacio Shrine in Manila, the multisectoral crowd grooved to the <a href=\"/5/35/793\">rock</a> group Talahib&#x2019;s interpretation of &#x201C;On Potok,&#x201D; a song about the dispossession of the <a href=\"/1/2/2328\">Agta</a> people, and danced to the cheery and militant theme song &#x201C;Babangon na sa Rebolusyon&#x201D; (Rising to Revolution). One of the more memorable performances was the dance flash mob at the quadrangle of St. Scholastica&#x2019;s College, Manila where 4,000 uniformed school children, teachers, and nuns danced to the 2015 theme song. Meanwhile at UP Baguio and at the People&#x2019;s Park, Cordillera, women performed their folk dances to the rhythm of native <a href=\"/5/37/810\">gongs</a> (UPB Obra 2015). In Davao City, indigenous groups dressed in their colorful native costumes performed their ethnic dances accompanied by traditional instruments while the main flash mob at Rizal Park had thousands from all sectors and ages, majority of whom were women and girls. On Chater Road, Hongkong, Filipina migrant workers danced to the beat of the OBR theme songs &#x201C;Isang Bilyong Babae ang Babangon,&#x201D; &#x201C;Break the Chain&#x201D; and &#x201C;Babangon na sa Rebolusyon&#x201D; (Lau and Chan 2015)."

				"value": "For almost 30 years after the 1986 EDSA Revolt, dance in the Philippines proved to be as dynamic and vibrant as ever. The end of the martial rule did not exactly result in overwhelming state support for the arts, let alone dance. But dance found a way of reinventing itself. Folk dance, ballet, contemporary dance, and many other popular forms such as hip-hop, cheerdance, and dance flash mob were able to locate themselves in a period characterized by unrelentless shifts in political alliances, economic instability, and heightened media influence on people&#x2019;s lives. The post-EDSA Revolt period may have seen and felt the effects of the global dance market on Philippine dance but it also saw the creative transformation of the country&#x2019;s dances. Compelled to face the cultural realities of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, dance in the Philippines raised a number of provocative inquiries regarding its very nature, form, and function in society. Both veteran and new choreographers, dancers, scholars and critics continued to enrich Philippine dance. Different choreographic visions emerged as a number of dance practitioners decided to create works on their own, with only minimal or even no assistance from government institutions. A plurality of styles became a mark of the post-EDSA Revolt era as the various dance genres responded to aesthetic, political, economic, and cultural issues. In an era of visual consumption, Philippine dance managed to have various trajectories and refused to be constrained by financial limitations. Space was no longer an issue as dance was seen on stage, on the streets, and other public places. <em>Through</em> dance and <em>in</em> dance, the Filipinos &#x201C;lived&#x201D; their negotiated identities in a period of so many possibilities. <strong><span class>&#xA0;</span></strong>"

Also among the earlier Filipino dancers in Europe were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2382\">Maribel Aboitiz</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2511\">Felicitas Layag-Radaic</a>, and Exequiel Banzali.

Cely Carrillo also worked on Broadway, while her daughter Cynthia Onrubia danced for Jerome Robbins and later helped stage the revival of his dances for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>. Then there were the cultural dancers who used to do mostly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a>, but who are now doing popular entertainment numbers in hotels and clubs. Over time, more and more Filipino dancers have gone abroad for various reasons, as more and more multicultural platforms for dance in international <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">spaces</a> have opened up. Many have been guests or members of foreign companies, dancing as soloists in international dance productions or being invited to perform with particular companies for longer periods of time. A number of Filipino dancers have also gone as students, having been offered dance scholarships in programs hosted by dance companies or housed in university arts programs. These have allowed many young Filipino dancers to develop and learn under the tutelage of various international institutions. Other dancers become dance teachers in universities, researchers, or establish their own companies or dance groups. Still, others make their name abroad by dancing professionally in international dance competitions, gaining renown as performers as well as athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the growth and vibrancy of Filipino dance communities in the international scene, the categories of Filipino dancers abroad have become wide-ranging and far-reaching: those who travel abroad to dance for only short periods of time; those who stay for long-term engagements; those who migrate to or settle in particular countries where they have stayed to dance professionally or competitively; and those born abroad to Filipino parents, such as the Filipino-American dancers who have gained prominence in the United States for their performances and other dance initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many leading Filipino dancers have performed as guests of foreign companies, for example the Hong Kong Ballet (HKB), Singapore Dance Theater, Royal New Zealand Ballet, and Ballet Company of Hawaii. Victor Madrona, who was with HKB, guested in Paris at a gala arranged by Anton Dolin. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2523\">Lisa Macuja</a>, now Lisa Macuja-Elizalde, has danced in over 90 cities around the world, in Japan, Cuba, and New Zealand among others. On the other hand, choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2462\">Tony Fabella</a> did a piece for the HKB, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2422\">Gener Caringal</a> has done the same for the Singapore Dance Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipinos who have joined the HKB at various times were Benjie Toledo, Tadeo Bernales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2454\">Conrad Dy-Liacco</a>, Nicole Gaston, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2522\">Jun Mabaquiao</a>; and with City Contemporary Dance Company, Tina Fargas. Hong Kong also became home to many Filipino dancers when the Disneyland there opened in 2005. Scores of Filipino dancers auditioned for a spot in the daily shows or the parade and decimated the rosters of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> companies. More than a hundred of the best dancers of the Philippines left to dance in Hong Kong at the time (Mijares 2015, 79). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines (BP)</a> lost all its principal dancers and soloists. After the exodus, dancers continued to leave for Hong Kong, but in more manageable numbers. Among those who joined the ranks were Jethro Pioquinto, Irish Abejero, Gisele Guarin-Abejero, Johnny Amar, and Ria Victorino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1990s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2551\">Carlo Pacis</a>, Carlos Garcia, and Oliver Palad were awarded scholarships to the Hong Kong Academy of the Performing Arts (HKAPA). Pacis joined the HKB, now teaches with the HKAPA, and choreographs for BP every now and then. Garcia later joined the famous Lesfamous Les Ballets Trocadero du Monte Carlo as a lead ballerina. In 2012, after winning the gold medal at the 7th Helsinki International Ballet Competition, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2385\">Candice Adea</a> accepted a contract to dance with HKB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Singapore, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2460\">Mario Esperanza</a>, Ric Culalic, Donato Ferrer, and Paul Ocampo danced with the Singapore Dance Theater. Like Hong Kong Disneyland, the Universal Studios in Singapore has also become a lucrative option. This is also true for performing groups on cruise ships. For half a year, dancer and choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2507\">Elena Laniog</a> works with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2613\">UP Dance Company</a> in between cruises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other parts of Asia and the Pacific, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2478\">Biag Gaongen</a> performed with Taiwan&rsquo;s famous Cloud Gate Dance Theater from 2009 to 2011 before he moved to Austria. His former BP codancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2626\">Ronelson Yadao</a> later joined Cloud Gate Dance Theater 2. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2456\">Ricardo Ella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2537\">Brando Miranda</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2585\">Vivencio Samblace&ntilde;o</a> were principal dancers of the Royal New Zealand Ballet, while Sophia Radaic was a member. Ella went on to join the Australian Ballet, doing solo parts. Lucy Patrimonio-Jumawan, former director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2594\">Silliman University Dance Troupe</a>, also danced and taught in Australia. Noel Dumlao later formed his own dance company there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, the biggest number of Filipino dancers is in New York, where they work in ballet or modern companies, musicals or Philippine folkloric groups. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2556\">Philippine Dance Company of New York</a> was founded by Bruna Seril in 1943. The Reynaldo Alejandro Dance Theater premiered a number of Rizalian dances in New York. For a period of time, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2429\">Joy Coronel</a>, together with Ching Valdes, danced for the company, and was also with the All Nations Dance Company. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2494\">Kristin Jackson</a>, and Miguel Braganza presented their original works in New York. Jackson became a member of the Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians and teaches and choreographs in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2410\">Maniya Barredo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2590\">Tina Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2505\">Enrico Labayen</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2579\">Odon Sabarre</a> all used to dance in New York. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2577\">Elizabeth Roxas</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2521\">Maxie Luna III</a>, a nephew of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, are members of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and were earlier with the Joyce Trisler Company. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2525\">Mercedes Ma&ntilde;ago</a> is with Ballet Hispanico. Cristina Escoda, who danced for years with American Ballet Theater, is now its artistic administrator. Lydlyd Gaston, Cecile Santos, Kristin Jackson, and Joy Coronel, on the other hand, have appeared in Broadway musical productions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2527\">Tiffany Mangulabnan</a> danced with Ballet Next in New York. Mica Bernas worked with the Carolyn Dorfman Dance Company and later began to teach in the music and arts program of BIMA, originally Berkshire Institute for Music and Arts, in Brandeis University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American-born Filipino dancers have also made their careers in New York, such as Anthony Huxley and Georgina Pazcoguin, both of whom dance with the New York City Ballet. In 2015, Stella Abrera became the first Filipino-American principal dancer of American Ballet Theater (del Mundo 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Ballet in Georgia has had Maniya Barredo as <em>prima ballerina</em>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2530\">Maiqui Ma&ntilde;osa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2550\">Nicolas Paca&ntilde;a</a> (formerly from Dance Spectrum in San Francisco, Hawaii Ballet, and the Boston Ballet), Mia Monica, and Jorge Laico who later danced with Oakland Ballet together with Cristina Buencamino before joining several other companies around the US. He eventually became the director of Wilmington Ballet Academy in 2009. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2605\">Faye Abigail Tan</a> and Jared Tan also danced with Atlanta Ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In San Francisco, California, Carlos Carvajal of the famous theatrical family choreographed for the San Francisco Ballet and his own group, Dance Spectrum. Also dancing in San Francisco were Angela del Pilar and Eloisa Enerio. The latter, who used to be with the Ontario Ballet Theater in Canada and Pacifica Ballet in California in the 1980s, eventually joined the dance faculty of the Young Americans College of Performing Arts in Corona, California in 2014. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2493\">Quincy Jacinto</a> danced with Ballet Pacifica in California. Also in California is Ruby Buted with the Contemporary Dance Company in Los Angeles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many other dancers have joined companies across the United States. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2482\">Toni Lopez-Gonzalez</a> danced with the Washington Ballet for a number of years. Rebecca Rodriguez was with the Cincinnati Ballet in Ohio, the Dallas Ballet in Texas, and moved to Ballet Met in the same state where she is the ballet mistress. Maricar Drilon was with the Utah Ballet before becoming artistic director of Northwest Classical Ballet. Christine Rocas is with Joffrey Ballet in Chicago, and her brother Derek Rocas is with Alabama Ballet. Melissa Greco is with Princeton Ballet and Angelo Soriano is with the Disney Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Filipinos and Filipino Americans have been in the United States as students, dance teachers, and researchers, among them, Ricardo Trimillos in Hawaii; Gregoria Baty-Smith in Guam; Mario Recto and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2534\">Cesar Mendoza</a> in Chicago; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2584\">Fe Sala-Villarica</a> in San Diego, California; Loulie Dalupan in San Francisco, California; Bing Locsin in Los Angeles, California; Ted Leyson at the Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow of Ted Shawn in Massachusetts; and Israel &ldquo;El Gabriel,&rdquo; former ballet master in an Israel ballet company and later with the University of California-Irvine; and Paul Ocampo&nbsp;in Southern Utah University, teaching modern dance, ballet, folk/<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/50\">cultural dance</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">movement</a> for actors, and composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also Filipino dance scholars in Canada such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2390\">Patrick Alcedo</a> who is the director of the MA and PhD programs in Dance and Dance Studies in York, where he also teaches folk dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipinos have become popular not only in the United States but also around the world as winners in different competitions. Michaela &ldquo;Pinky&rdquo; Puno gained renown as a dancer through competitive ballroom dancing all over the US. Young figure ice skater Michael Martinez impressed the audience at the Lake Placid, New York, and at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. He has also competed in Estonia and Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2393\">Reynaldo Alejandro</a>&rsquo;s book <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/16\"><em><strong>Philippine Dance</strong></em></a> lists numerous Philippine folkloric groups in the United States, from Alaska to Wisconsin. Alleluia Panis is theater director, choreographer, and the inspiration behind Kularts, a group featuring contemporary and indigenous Philippine arts, and the Alleluia Panis Dance Theater (APDT) in San Francisco. There were also groups directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2598\">Jovita Sison-Friese</a>&nbsp;and Christine Javier. Many of them are in New York&nbsp;where they were formed by former members of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, Folklorico Filipino, and other companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dance was introduced as early as the 1950s in Stockton, California through Carmen G. Tomek&rsquo;s Sampaguita Dance Troupe in Little Manila. Here, Brian Anthony Batugo, a Filipino-American born in the United States, established The Little Manila Dance Collective through the CrowdRise fundraising campaign. The project is meant to rejuvenate and sustain the presence of Filipino folk dance among Filipino communities in Stockton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several studios established and run by Filipino dancers in the US. Setting up a studio geared toward teaching dance to Filipino-American children&nbsp;after years of popularizing dance in media and television in the Philippines were the Aldeguer sisters, Terri and Lally, who opened the Aldeguer Sisters Performing Arts Center in Los Angeles, California in 2000. Quincy Jacinto eventually established the Riverside Dance Academy + Performing Arts in Riverside, California in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Washington opened the DanceChance program, a full scholarship targeted to young, potential dancers who demonstrate aptitude for ballet in elementary schools, with priority given to minority populations and low-income students. One of its products is Eric Hipolito Jr, a first-generation Filipino-American who was the first DanceChance student to become a full member of the Pacific Northwest Ballet. His brother, Enrico Hipolito, followed in his steps and completed the same program (Duff 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Canada, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2436\">Yvonne Cutaran</a>, who is now with L&rsquo;&Eacute;cole des Ax&eacute;es Danse, was a principal dancer with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens which also hosted Barredo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2451\">Rey Dizon</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2539\">Manuel Molina</a> was with Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal, Harkness Ballet, and Ballet Nuevo Mundo de Caracas (with Gloria Tobilla de la Casa). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2414\">Ida Beltran</a>, who was with the Shumka Dance Company, also taught at the Edmonton School of Ballet and the Victoria School for the Performing Arts in Canada. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2519\">Jojo Lucila</a>, with whom Beltran formed the company Chameleon Dance Edmonton, choreographed for the Edmonton Festival Ballet, Edmonton Contemporary Dance Centre, Dance Unlimited, and MOD Contemporary Dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United Kingdom has had its population of Filipino dancers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2425\">Mitto Castillo</a>, considered to be the first Filipino to join a British ballet company, became principal dancer of Northern Ballet Theater in 1982. Nelly Ledesma studied in the Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipino dancers were also in Europe. Lisa Macuja studied ballet on a scholarship <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/25\">grant</a> at the Leningrad Choreographic Institute in Russia and was the first foreign ballerina to be invited as a soloist in the Kirov Ballet in 1984. A special issue of <em><strong>Dance Magazine</strong></em> on dance in Yugoslavia mentions a number of unnamed Filipinos. Contemporary dancer and choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2415\">Myra Beltran</a> was a member of the Ballet of the Theatre Prishtina, Yugoslavia, and Ballet of Oldenburg, Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancing in France and Switzerland were Ronnie Leonardo, Gina Mariano, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2437\">Augustus Damian</a> who was a principal dancer with Maurice Bejart&rsquo;s Ballet of the 20th Century. Damian moved on to dance in Berne, Switzerland. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2526\">Ernest Mandap</a> was a member of BP II when he was invited to join Jeune Ballet du France in 1991. He spent the rest of his career in France, coming back sporadically to the Philippines to dance with BP and to choreograph works for the company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2405\">Ballet Manila</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2389\">Airdance</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany has been the most hospitable of the European countries. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2510\">Luis Layag</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2416\">Franklin Bobadilla</a> danced in Heidelberg; Layag was also with Pina Bausch&rsquo;s Wuppertal Dance Company. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2618\">Anna Villadolid</a> was a dance scholar in Munich before joining the National Ballet&nbsp;and eventually marrying the company&rsquo;s ballet master, Tomas Mayr. Javier Picardo in Freiburg and Munster, Mary Anne Santamaria in Kassel, Robert Medina, and Nina Anonas have performed in Frankfurt. Augustus Damian first danced in Munich&rsquo;s Ballet am Gartnerplatz, later joined the Bejart Ballet, and then moved to another German company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others who have danced in Germany are William Miller, Bettina Esca&ntilde;o, Mitto Castillo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2582\">Irene Sabas</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2476\">Unita Gaye Galiluyo</a>, who moved to Switzerland in 1998, has since been performing there and in Germany. In the same year, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2517\">Sonny Locsin</a> joined Jeune Ballet de France then moved to Italy, then Germany, shortly after. Anna Villadolid who often guested with the Birmingham Royal Ballet is now in Munich and conducts dance-specific Pilates group classes at the BallettSchule Benedict-Manniegel. Armand Angeles is dancing and teaching in Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2586\">Georgette Sanchez</a>, Ardee Dionisio, PJ Rebullida, Biag Gaongen, Marcelino Libao Jr, and Elmer Domdom have danced in Germany and France. Irene Sabas herself later moved to the Royal Ballet of Flanders in Antwerp, Belgium. With her husband, dancer David Campos Cantero, she heads a dance company called the Ballet David Campos in Barcelona. Her sister <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2581\">Hazel Sabas-Gower</a> used to choreograph and teach in the company, which later employed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2438\">Elline Christine Damian</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2477\">Aileen Gallinera</a>, Lea Baduria, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2458\">Eduardo Espejo Jr</a> in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franklin Bobadilla, formerly with the Heidelberg Ballet, became a soloist with the Scapino Ballet in Amsterdam, Holland, while Paul Ocampo was with the National Ballet in Amsterdam. Don Marasigan taught and danced in Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the presence of Filipinos and Filipino-Americans have always been felt since our first performing groups impressed their international audiences, there has been not just an increase in the number of Filipinos performing abroad over the decades but also a remarkable visibility of Filipino-Americans establishing their niches in the world of dance. Many of them have made a mark as performers, choreographers, teachers, and researchers. A number of Filipinos who have become members of companies around the world&nbsp;have come home for brief periods of time to choreograph for local companies. The decades to come will definitely have more Filipinos crossing national borders and establishing careers in different countries. But with the ease in travelling afforded by the 21st century global networks, the Philippines will most probably have more of these Filipinos abroad as visiting performers, choreographers, and scholars, making the field of dance in the country more vibrant and exciting. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

A number of Filipinos who have become members of companies around the world&#xA0;have come home for brief periods of time to choreograph for local companies. The decades to come will definitely have more Filipinos crossing national borders and establishing careers in different countries.

Other compositions of the romantic period stirred Fabella in his <em><strong>Glazunov Variations</strong></em>, 1984; <em><strong>A Dance Offering</strong></em>, 1986; <em><strong>Dancing to Donizetti</strong></em>, 1987; and <em><strong>The Company</strong></em>, 1991; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2581\">Sabas</a> in her <em><strong>Six to Borodin</strong></em>, 1988; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2516\">Locsin</a> in her <em><strong>Four Last Songs</strong></em>, 1998, to Richard Strauss&rsquo;s composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Western neo-classical music ignited the imagination of many choreographers. Remedios &ldquo;Totoy&rdquo; de Oteyza did her ballet to one of Cesar Franck&rsquo;s notable works, <em><strong>Variations symphoniques</strong></em> (Symphonic Variations). In 1970, Tony Fabella mounted <em><strong>La Verite</strong></em> (The Truth) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a> created <em><strong>If Somebody Steps on Your Toe on the Fifth Beat of the Polka, Don&rsquo;t Say Ouch, Polka Back, Or ...</strong></em> using the works of Dmitri Shostakovich. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2567\">Denise Garcia</a> created <em><strong>The Last Flower</strong></em>, 1974, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2422\">Gener Caringal</a> completed <em><strong>The Rite of Spring</strong></em>, 1978, both to the music of Igor Stravinsky. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2544\">Effie Na&ntilde;as</a> choreographed <em><strong>Variations D&rsquo;Amour</strong></em>, 1975, to the modern composition of Jean Fran&ccedil;aix. De Oteyza had a number of pieces spurred by contemporary compositions like George Gershwin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Rhapsody in Blue</strong></em>, Sergei Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s <em><strong>Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</strong></em>, Aram Il&rsquo;yich Khatchaturian&rsquo;s <em><strong>Masquerade Suite</strong></em>, Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <em><strong>Capriccio Espagnol</strong></em>, and Maurice Ravel&rsquo;s <em><strong>Bolero</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular pieces have set several dance works into the groove. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2418\">Julie</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a>, Lally and Terry Aldeguer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2545\">Douglas Nierras</a>, and other dancers worked in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a>, used popular songs, blues, and New Wave music. They have done much of the choreography for both local musicals and Broadway adaptations. BP also mounted <em><strong>All That Jazz</strong></em>, 2006, featuring works such as Gil Khan Ravago&rsquo;s <em><strong>Miedo 5.6</strong></em> and James Laforteza&rsquo;s <em><strong>How &rsquo;Bout A Gershwin</strong></em>, both to the rhythm of jazz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Integrating Eastern and Western traditions, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a> uses <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> movement vocabulary to choreograph Western classical compositions. The integrative experiment was employed in the following works: &ldquo;Canon in D Major&rdquo; by Johann Pachelbel performed in 2000, 2002, 2006, and 2011; &ldquo;Waltz of the Flowers&rdquo; by Tchaikovsky in 2003, rendition by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a>; &ldquo;Air on G String&rdquo; by Johann Sebastian Bach in 2009; and &ldquo;Piano Sonata in C Major&rdquo; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart premiered in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some works, though, it is the life of a composer which propels the choreography. The life of ballet&rsquo;s greatest composer Tchaikovsky was encapsulated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio</a> in his <strong>pas de trois</strong>, <em><strong>Perjured Hearts</strong></em>, 1972, and later in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/195\"><em><strong>Tchaikovsky Fantasy</strong></em></a>, 1982. African water drumming exemplified in <em><strong>Water Drums 1</strong></em> by Baka Forest People of Southeast Cameroon inspired Amilbangsa to create&nbsp;<em>Water&nbsp;</em>using the fluid movements of <strong>pangalay</strong> in 2001. Similarly, the drone-like rhythm of Ravi Shankar&rsquo;s sitar music complemented Amilbangsa&rsquo;s pangalay choreography utilizing multiple masks covering all angles of the head, also in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipino classical composers stimulated many choreographers to produce original works in dance. Elejar created <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/154\"><em><strong>Juru-Pakal</strong></em></a> (The Enchanted Kris) in 1971 to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4056\">Jose Maceda</a>&rsquo;s original music. De Oteyza choreographed <em><strong>Spectrum</strong></em> in 1972 to the composition of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3942\">Rodolfo Cornejo</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2467\">Joji Felix-Velarde</a> choreographed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong>Kulas na Batugan</strong></em> (Lazy Kulas) in 1973. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Cora G. I&ntilde;igo</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong>Baile de Ayer</strong></em> (Dance of Yesteryears), 1974, was created to the music of Rodolfo Cornejo and an original scenario by National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>. Fabella worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4165\">Ramon Santos</a> to produce <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1003\"><em><strong>Siklo</strong></em></a> (Cycle) in 1977. Caringal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3964\">Bayani de Leon</a> produced <em><strong>Atlantis</strong></em> in 1978. Basilio worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1007\"><em><strong>Sinfonietta for Strings</strong></em></a> in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/140\"><em><strong>Exultations</strong></em></a>, 1984, and to the same composer&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/876\"><em><strong>Cavatina</strong></em></a> in his <em><strong>Cavatina</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local compositions have moved Filipino choreographers to create memorable dances in various forms and genres such as pangalay, <strong>ballet</strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>modern dance</strong></a>. One favorite composition is the lullabye <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/994\">&ldquo;Sa Ugoy ng Duyan&rdquo;</a> (As the Cradle Rocks), with music and lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4162\">Lucio San Pedro</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3934\">Levi Celerio</a>. The melodious and melancholic song has inspired many choreographers such as Basilio, Amilbangsa, and Denisa Reyes to create their own interpretation of the child&rsquo;s longing for a mother&rsquo;s affection. Patriotic&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">kundiman</a>&nbsp;</em>such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo;</a> (My Country), composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3958\">Constancio de Guzman</a> and with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>, fired up the imagination of many dancers and choreographers through turbulent times in Philippine history. Examples are Basilio&rsquo;s <em><strong>Isang Lakbay, Isang Hantungan</strong></em> (One Journey, One Destination), 1983, and Fabella&rsquo;s <em><strong>Four Songs</strong></em>, 1987. Filipino love songs alluding to the nation accompanied ballets such as Elejar&rsquo;s and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2617\">Vida</a>&rsquo;s respective productions of <em><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong></em> (Muse of Pasig), 1980 and 1983, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre</a>&rsquo;s regular staging of Fabella&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/158\"><em><strong>Kundiman, Noon at Ngayon</strong></em></a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4221\">Manuel Velez</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/992\">&ldquo;Sa Kabukiran&rdquo;</a> (In the Countryside) inspired Amilbangsa to create a playful pangalay choreography using fans and traditional hats, which premiered in 2000. Filipino folk songs prompted the creation of original choreography for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2394\">AlunAlun Dance Circle</a> utilizing folk songs such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\">&ldquo;Paruparong Bukid,&rdquo;</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/970\">&ldquo;Pamulinawen,&rdquo;</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1008\">&ldquo;Sitsiritsit Alibangbang.&rdquo;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many songs that have touched the hearts of Filipinos have also roused choreographers. Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/126\"><em><strong>Bungkos Suite</strong></em></a>, 1972, had pieces to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4217\">Miguel Velarde</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/884\">&ldquo;Dahil Sa Iyo,&rdquo;</a> while Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Mga Babae</strong></em> (Women), 1987, was done to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4016\">Inang Laya</a>&rsquo;s music. Basilio created several pieces to popular tunes: <em><strong>Alaala</strong></em> (Memories) and <em><strong>Take Me Back</strong></em>, 1983, to music by Debuque-Consunji, <em><strong>A Scrapbook</strong></em>, 1986, and <em><strong>Mga Awit ni Basil</strong></em> (Basil&rsquo;s Songs) <em><strong>I</strong></em>, 1987, and <em><strong>II</strong></em>, 1989. In 1989 and 1990, Fabella created <em><strong>Pinoy Talaga</strong></em> (Genuine Filipino) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/123\"><em><strong>Beautiful Girls</strong></em></a>, respectively, both to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3937\">Jose Mari Chan</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>&rsquo;s album titled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><em><strong>One</strong></em></a> inspired Fabella&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/162\"><em><strong>Limang Dipa</strong></em></a> (Five Armstretches), 1981, and Vida&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/139\"><em><strong>Ensalada</strong></em></a> (Salad), 1981 while his other popular songs were the material for <em><strong>Playing Maestro Ryan</strong></em>, 2005, comprised of pieces by Fabella, Lugnasin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/5802\">Christine Crame</a>, Irish Abejero, Novey Bereber, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2437\">Augustus Damian</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">Pop</a> divas&nbsp;such as Lani Misalucha enlivened the productions of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2405\">Ballet Manila&rsquo;s (BM)</a> annual <em><strong>Ballet and Ballads</strong></em> which showcased the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">company</a> dancing with sought-after singers. BP&rsquo;s Damian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2541\">Morales</a>, Lugnasin, and Mark Rosolini choreographed to new, old, local, and foreign songs in <em><strong>Songs</strong></em> in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adaptations of foreign pop songs became popular in the 1970s and were revived by literary writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a> in the 2000s. Amilbangsa was inspired to create original pangalay choreography for pop songs in <em><strong>Pangalay ng Bayan: Konsiyerto ng Tula, Salinawit, at Musika</strong></em> (Pangalay of the Nation: Concert of Poetry, Song-Translations, and Music), 2011, featuring choreographies for songs adapted and translated by Jose F.

Early works of this kind are&nbsp;<em><strong>Tomaneg at Aniway</strong></em> (Tomaneg and Aniway), 1975, and <em><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></em>, for the 1985 Singapore Arts Festival. In 1997, the same episode about the Panayanon epic hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\">Labaw Donggon</a> was used by Locsin for a production at the Philippine High School for the Arts. With Edwin Duero, she also reworked the Sulod epic <em><strong>Hinilawod</strong></em> into a dance drama for the Dagyaw Theater and Dance Company. Another tale about the brothers Indarapatra and Sulayman was turned into <em><strong>Katakata Sin Rajah Indarapatra</strong></em> (Stories of Rajah Indarapatra), 1968, and <em><strong>Juru-Pakal</strong></em> (The Enchanted Kris), 1971, both by Elejar. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2541\">Paul Alexander Morales</a>&rsquo;s rock-ballet-musical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/598\"><em><strong>Manhid</strong></em></a> (Numb), 2015, was about Philippine epic heroes come to life for the youth of contemporary times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fanciful world of children&rsquo;s literature and fairy tales provide the narratives for Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes</strong></em>, 1970, and <em><strong>Cinderella</strong></em>, 1981, 1984, 1989, 2002, and 2014; Vida&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Little Tailor</strong></em>, 1980, <em><strong>Peter Pan</strong></em>, 1983, and <em><strong>Alice in Wonderland</strong></em>, 1985; Na&ntilde;as&rsquo;s <em><strong>Snow White</strong></em>, 1988; and Lugnasin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Peter Pan&rsquo;s Neverneverland</strong></em>, 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novels</a> have made quite an impact on ballet and contemporary dance.

Basilio was inspired by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> in <em><strong>Ode to Boticelli</strong></em>, 1981&nbsp;and <strong><em>Crystal Concerto and Canto to Canaletto</em></strong>, 1983. The kinetic energy of Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/171\"><em><strong>Muybridge Frames</strong></em></a>, 1983, was prompted by the studies of photographer Eadweard Muybridge whose stop-action <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">pictures</a> paved the way for more studies on human and animal movement. She worked with sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3411\">Agnes Arellano</a> in <em><strong>Balimbingan</strong></em> (Opportunism), 1987, using the latter&rsquo;s <em><strong>Bosch and the Hollow Men</strong></em>. In the 2000s, Locsin had two major works based on paintings&mdash;<em><strong>Sayaw Ang Kiukok</strong></em> (Dancing Ang Kiukok), 2005, and <em><strong>Sayaw, Sabel</strong></em> (Dance, Sabel), 2010, inspired by visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3443\">BenCab</a>&rsquo;s iconic &ldquo;<em>Sabel</em>,&rdquo; which is a reimagining of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><em><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></em></a>&rsquo;s Sisa. Fernando Amilbangsa choreographed a four-dimensional interpretation of a ground painting in <em><strong>Pangalay and the Pavement Painting of Sining Obando Artists</strong></em> at the north park grounds of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in celebration of Philippine Independence in 2000. The pangalay suite <em><strong>Bangko ni Billy</strong></em> (Billy&rsquo;s Bench), premiered in 2002, was created for the functional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a> to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/785\">novelty songs</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4224\">Yoyoy Villame</a> to illustrate everyday scenes in a park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"history\" name=\"history\"></a>History</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical events and the lives of historical personalities have become the compelling force behind numerous choreographies. Locsin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/160\"><em><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></em></a> (The Philippine Revolution), 1996, was a contemporary ballet on the nation&rsquo;s struggle against Spanish colonial rule. Fernando Amilbangsa&rsquo;s <em><strong>Abduction of Napsa</strong></em>, 1992, was a pangalay choreography based on a historical account about Sultan Mawalil Wasit&rsquo;s pursuit and capture of a pangalay dancer named Napsa from Simunul Island, Tawi-Tawi. A full-length historical dance drama in pangalay by Fernando Amilbangsa was <em><strong>Tawag sa Bantawan</strong></em> (Cry of the Watch Tower), 2008, performed by community artists of Maribojoc, Bohol, under the direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>. The dance drama essays the history of the Punta Cruz watch tower during the Spanish colonial era when the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2336\">Boholano</a> were prey to slave traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forceful figures in history are at the center of Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Rajah Sulayman</strong></em> and Generoso-I&ntilde;igo&rsquo;s <em><strong>Gabriela</strong></em>, both in 1978; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2561\">Lulu Puertollano</a>&rsquo;s dance in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3914\">Alfredo S. Buenaventura</a>&rsquo;s opera <em><strong>Diego Silang</strong></em>; Basilio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/159\"><em><strong>La Lampara</strong></em></a> (The Lamp), 1980; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2575\">Dwight Rodrigazo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/150\"><em><strong>Indios Bravos</strong></em></a> (Brave Natives), 2004; and Lugnasin&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Rizal Revisited&nbsp;</strong></em>/&nbsp;<em><strong>Double Takes</strong></em>, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz choreographed a work featuring the characters Spartacus and Phrygia, and later turned them into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> and Gregoria de Jesus in his <em><strong>Ang Katipunero</strong></em> (The Revolutionary) pas de deux. The revolutionary leader is also the subject of Caringal&rsquo;s contemporary ballet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/114\"><em><strong>Andres KKK</strong></em></a>, 1996, Rodrigazo&rsquo;s <em><strong>Itak ni Andres</strong></em> (Bolo of Andres), and Lugnasin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Balintawak</strong></em>, both in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical fiction has been worked into a modern dance piece by Alice Reyes in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/152\"><em><strong>Itim Asu</strong></em></a> (Onyx Wolf), 1970, and into contemporary dance by Myra Beltran in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/151\"><em><strong>Itim Asu: 1719-2009</strong></em></a>, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"religiousrituals\" name=\"religiousrituals\"></a>Religious Rituals and Works</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The rituals of Philippine ethnic groups for a good harvest, to ward off evil, and to cure illnesses have been the center of dance and drama renditions. Alice Reyes produced many works inspired by traditional rituals: <strong><em>At a Maranaw Gathering</em></strong>, 1970, depicted a ceremony in the Southern Philippines; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/137\"><strong><em>Dugso</em></strong></a>, 1972, portrayed a&nbsp;<em>babaylan</em>&rsquo;s ritual over a young man&rsquo;s rite of passage; and <em><strong>Anting-Anting</strong></em>, 1973, delved into the Filipino belief in the power of&nbsp;<em>anting-anting&nbsp;</em>or amulets. The Higaonon&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/54\">dugso</a>&nbsp;</em>was made contemporary in Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/144\"><em><strong>For the Gods</strong></em></a>, 1985. Rituals are periodically reenacted by the folk themselves, or staged by folk dance troupes. A common figure is the shaman who engages in possession or ecstatic dancing that transports him or her into a trance, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3516\">Edward Defensor</a>&rsquo;s restaging of the ritual in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/115\"><em><strong>Ang Babaylan</strong></em></a>&nbsp;(The Shaman), 1988. Choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a> also has his reenactment of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> cleansing or anointing ritual in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/177\"><em><strong>Pamalugu</strong></em></a> (Cleansing), 1989, in the four-day&nbsp;<em>gin-um&nbsp;</em>celebration. Agnes Locsin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Bagobo</strong></em>, 1990, on the other hand, focuses on the once-observed ritual for human sacrifice of Davao&rsquo;s Bagobo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian rituals, rites, and prayers have been used to frame numerous dance pieces: Elejar&rsquo;s <em><strong>Misang Pilipino</strong></em> (Filipino Mass), 1974; Basilio&rsquo;s <em><strong>Dark Night of the Soul</strong></em>, 1964, <em><strong>Doxology</strong></em>, 1970, <em><strong>Divine Anthology</strong></em>, 1982, <em><strong>Panalangin</strong></em> (Prayer) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/169\"><em><strong>Misa Filipina</strong></em></a> (Filipino Mass), both in 1984; Vida&rsquo;s <em><strong>Pagsamba</strong></em> (Worship), 1976; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2537\">Brando Miranda</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong>Ang Misa</strong></em> (The Mass), 1985; and dances in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4030\">Kasilag</a>&rsquo;s operatorio, <em><strong>Spiritual Canticles</strong></em>, 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Religious narratives have provided the structure for several dance works. In 1964, Alice Reyes sketched the Christianization of the Philippines in <em><strong>400 Years in 40 Minutes</strong></em> for the Eucharistic Congress in Bombay. Biblical stories have also been danced, as in Anita Kane&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Parable of the Foolish Virgins</strong></em>; Basilio&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Resurrection of Lazarus</strong></em> and <em><strong>The Rebels</strong></em>, 1971; and Vida&rsquo;s <em><strong>Isaiah</strong></em>, 1982. Stories of saints and devotional literature have inspired several works: Kane&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Life of St. Agnes</strong></em>; Felix Padilla&rsquo;s <em><strong>Viaticum</strong></em>, 1970; Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Santo Ni&ntilde;o</strong></em> and <em><strong>Chichester Psalms</strong></em>, 1973; and Cruz&rsquo;s <em><strong>Interior Castle</strong></em>, 1982, to the music of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4072\">Fr Manuel Maramba</a> for the Dance Concert Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"socialissues\" name=\"socialissues\"></a>Social Issues</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From rituals to religious texts, Filipino choreographers have likewise turned to Philippine realities for contemporary issues as reflected in Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/187\"><em><strong>Siete Dolores</strong></em></a> (Seven Sorrows), with libretto by Nicanor Tiongson, and Basilio&rsquo;s <em><strong>Muling Pagsilang</strong></em> (The Rebirth), 1986, prompted by a renewed faith in the nation after the fall of the Marcoses. A heartrending piece is Ma. Elena Laniog&rsquo;s <em><strong>On the Wings of 44</strong></em>, 2015, which was choreographed almost immediately after the Mamasapano massacre in Maguindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2000s, a range of social issues became the subject matter of choreographic works. Beltran&rsquo;s <em><strong>Payatas: point counterpoint</strong></em>, 2001, was on domestic violence, sexual exploitation by the church, and political opportunism while Rodrigazo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/156\"><em><strong>Karga Tapas</strong></em></a> (Cut and Load), 2008, zeroed in on the miserable lives of the&nbsp;<em>sacadas&nbsp;</em>(seasonal plantation workers) in the haciendas of Negros Occidental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gender-related concerns have served as themes of numerous choreographies over the decades: Basilio&rsquo;s <em><strong>Sweet Warfare</strong></em>, 1982; Jackson&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/176\"><em><strong>Pakiusap: A Mail-Order Bride Story</strong></em></a> (A Plea: A Mail-Order Bride Story), 1991; Alice Reyes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Mga Babae</strong></em>, 1987; Denisa Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/191\"><em><strong>Suwana: A Reconstruction of a Myth</strong></em></a>, 1994; Beltran&rsquo;s <em><strong>Unbearable Lightness</strong></em>, 2000; BP&rsquo;s <em><strong>Men and Women</strong></em>, 2005, featuring Labayen&rsquo;s <em><strong>Stringed, Strung, Stranged</strong></em>, Damian&rsquo;s <em><strong>After Whom</strong></em>,&nbsp;<em><strong>&rsquo;L,&rsquo;</strong></em> and <em><strong>Anecdotes of Hate</strong></em>, and Lugnasin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Bound</strong></em>. Airdance&rsquo;s <em><strong>Body Politics Season</strong></em>, 2006, which included <em><strong>Malakas@Maganda</strong></em> (Malakas and Maganda) and <em><strong>Deus ex Machina</strong></em>, was a series of shows focusing on &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; and feeling bodies and on bodies as sites of contestations for power. Fernando Amilbangsa&rsquo;s pangalay dances in celebration of International Women&rsquo;s Day, <em><strong>Alay sa Kababaihan</strong></em> (Offering to Women), 2012, were created to renditions of women singers such as Inang Laya, Susan Fernandez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>. The dance flash mob global campaign to combat violence against women and children in the Philippines began in 2012. Henceforth, the campaign has been held annually and marked by the singing and dancing to the theme song, &ldquo;One Billion Rising Philippines.&rdquo; Child rights is one issue that became a nationwide advocacy in the 1990s following the international recognition of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Fernando Amilbangsa created a full dance ritual with the AlunAlun Dance Circle titled <em><strong>Sunset Ceremony</strong></em> in 2000 to ignite the international campaign to end child prostitution, child pornography, and child trafficking on the occasion of the ECPAT International Conference on Young People&rsquo;s Participation Against Sexual Exploitation of Children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moved to recognize the effects of long-ignored social issues, choreographers of the late 20th and early 21st century rechanneled these harsh realities into their works. Disturbed by the effects of irresponsible logging of the Philippine forests, Locsin launched her <em><strong>Alay sa Puno</strong></em> (Offering to the Trees) series, 2010-13, dealing with environmental degradation. The work&rsquo;s solos and duets embodied the different parts of a tree&mdash;&ldquo;Ugat&rdquo; (Root), &ldquo;Dahon&rdquo; (Leaf), &ldquo;Puno&rdquo; (Trunk),&nbsp;&ldquo;Sanga&rdquo; (Branch), and &ldquo;Bulak&rdquo; (Flower).&nbsp;Climate change brought extreme weather disturbances such as Typhoon Ondoy that inundated Metro Manila. These natural disasters urged Fernando Amilbangsa, with the AlunAlun Dance Circle, to create a full-length dance concert on Earth Day titled <em><strong>Alay sa Kalikasan</strong></em> (Offering to Nature), 2012, advocating environmental protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a daring project dwelling on a generally unacknowledged reality in the country, Michael Barry Que and Gebbvelle Ray Selga staged their work titled <em><strong>Pavillion 4</strong></em>, 2014, on the painful complexities of mental health problems besetting many Filipinos. Labayen likewise joined BP&rsquo;s <em><strong>Body Positive+</strong></em>, a dance concert to raise awareness for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with his &ldquo;swan song&rdquo; <em><strong>Will You Still Be The</strong></em><em><strong>re</strong></em>, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"theoriesandotherthemes\" name=\"theoriesandotherthemes\"></a>Theories and Other Themes</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting influence on dance from the 1990s onward was literary theory, in particular, poststructuralism. Such crossing of influence and fields have resulted in provoking pieces. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2613\">UPDC</a> had a number of deconstructed dance classics, like <em><strong>Cinderella</strong></em> into <em><strong>Mariang Sinderela, ang Bagong Bayani</strong></em> (Maria Cinderella, The New Heroine),&nbsp;1996 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2491\">Joelle Jacinto</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2509\">Angela Lawenko Baguilat</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><em><strong>The Nutcracker</strong></em></a> into <em><strong>Cracked Nut, Maria Clara&rsquo;s Colonial Dream</strong></em>, 1997 by Veronique Duma Berdin, Desiree Peralejo Medina, and Jesusa Noveno Noel; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><em><strong>Giselle</strong></em></a> into <em><strong>Ang Higanti</strong></em> (The Revenge),&nbsp;2003 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2619\">Ava Maureen Ong</a> and Joyce Comia Banal; <em><strong>Petroushka</strong></em> into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/179\"><em><strong>Pedro Kusinero</strong></em></a> (Peter the Cook),&nbsp;2003 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2395\">Herbert Alvarez</a> and Ma. Elena Laniog; <em><strong>Swan Lake</strong></em> into <em><strong>Sa Itim, Sa Puti</strong></em> (The Black Swan and the White Swan),&nbsp;2009 by Yasnina Jumalon and Gianella Reyes; and <em><strong>La Sylphide</strong></em> into <em><strong>Sylvia Ligaya</strong></em> (Sylvia Joy), 2014&nbsp;by Jeiel Hernandez. Beltran&rsquo;s <em><strong>Trace of a Trace</strong></em>, 2003, picked up Jacques Derrida&rsquo;s notions of constant deferral of meanings, traces, presences, and absences, and articulates these ideas in dance as text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"teachersandmentors\" name=\"teachersandmentors\"></a>Teachers and Mentors</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong influences on dance also came from teachers who helped shape the careers of students and dancers: Norman Walker, Pauline Koner, Alice Reyes, Denisa Reyes, Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, Fabella, Basilio, and Locsin. Orosa-Goquingco&rsquo;s pioneering work in folkloric stylization influenced many, including Reynaldo Alejandro. De Oteyza and Kane pursued classicism in their themes and teaching. Layag-Radaic followed in Kane&rsquo;s footsteps as a teacher. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2424\">Ricardo and Roberta Cassell</a> exemplified choreographic range and practical professionalism in the crucial years of Philippine ballet. From her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">research</a> on the dances of the Sulu Archipelago, Fernando Amilbangsa started the use of indigenous dances related to a classical tradition as a rich tool for choreography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The numerous sources and influences that have become the inspiration of dance could only lead to the cultivation of its lush landscape in the Philippines. The various kinds of works, many of which defy clean categorizations, attest to the Filipino choreographers&rsquo; artistic sensibilities and efforts to continuously enrich their choreographic languages. In the bodies of the country&rsquo;s dance practitioners, materials for choreographies do not only become themes or subject matter but, more importantly, serve as ways of pursuing movement. With a deep understanding of movement and propelled by a wealth of cultural texts, practices, and issues, Filipino choreographers have always worked with, around, and even against existing dance forms, creating compelling works of diverse idioms.&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

The various kinds of works, many of which defy clean categorizations, attest to the Filipino choreographers&#x2019; artistic sensibilities and efforts to continuously enrich their choreographic languages. In the bodies of the country&#x2019;s dance practitioners, materials for choreographies do not only become themes or subject matter but, more importantly, serve as ways of pursuing movement. With a deep understanding of movement and propelled by a wealth of cultural texts, practices, and issues, Filipino choreographers have always worked with, around, and even against existing dance forms, creating compelling works of diverse idioms.&#xA0;<strong><span class>&#xA0;</span></strong>"
