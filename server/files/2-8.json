Location: Calle Aduana (renamed Andres Soriano Jr Ave in 1985), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, Manila. Built 1823-29, reconstructed 1874-77. Architect: Tomas Cortes; reconstruction plans by Luis Rom; modified by Luis Cespedes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila&rsquo;s first customs house or Aduana was the Alcaiceria de San Fernando, an octagonal two-story trading building of stone and wood that also housed Chinese traders. It was constructed from 1752 to 1758 on the northern banks of the Pasig, within range of the guns of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>. In 1796 a set of instructions regarding the fortification of Manila specified that the Aduana be relocated to Intramuros. This would be an incentive for the merchants to remain within the walled city rather than outside it, as was becoming the trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The walls behind <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo church</a> were demolished by the architect Ildefonso de Aragon to create a space for the new Aduana, which became the terminus for the street named after it. With plans by Tomas Cortes, who succeeded Aragon as chief engineer, construction lasted from 1823 to 1829. Notwithstanding objections that the building was inadequate for the burgeoning international port of Manila, mainly because it was too far from the port and offered too little space for warehousing, the building was considered a beautiful piece of classical architecture. Contemporary writers appreciated its good proportions and monumental appearance&nbsp;<em>a la Europa</em>. Its four corners and central facade were characterized by <strong>pabellones</strong> (pavilions), where the walls slightly jutted out from the rest of the building. The handsome building of cut stone had three principal entrances which led to two courtyards separated by two principal staircases. The roof was renovated by the firm of Manuel Perez in 1861, following the plans of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>. Despite this, the heavy tile roof seriously damaged the building during the earthquake of 1863. The abandoned ruin deteriorated rapidly, especially after the earthquakes of 1869 and 1872.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1866 two plans for the reconstruction were submitted to the consultative body of the Obras Publicas, one by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>&nbsp;and another by an anonymous architect, later identified as Juan Rom. The latter&rsquo;s plans were followed as the Roxas plans were considerably deficient. Rom&rsquo;s plan as further improved by Obras Publicas hewed closely to the older <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> lines. In 1871, galvanized iron sheets were proposed instead of tiles, and wooden facade details were replaced with brick ones. Luis Cespedes, who succeeded Rom, was supervising architect. Cespedes extended Cortes&rsquo;s <strong>almohadillado</strong> (rustication) throughout the building&rsquo;s exterior, which had been suppressed by Rom. He also expanded the <strong>entresuelo </strong> (mezzanine) for more office space. Implementation of the project was contracted to Luis Perez Yap-Sionjue who, working from 1874 to 1877, also obtained all discarded masonry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renovated building housed the central treasury (hacienda) and its archives, as well as the Bank of Isabel II. Hardly damaged by the 1880 earthquake, it provided temporary headquarters for the Intendencia, the tax office. The present historical marker thus inaccurately names the building the Intendencia, and Cespedes its builder. The functions of the Aduana had returned to the site of the old Alcaiceria since 1872.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it housed the Treasury, the Aduana Building was destroyed by Japanese bombing in late Dec 1941. It was restored after World War II as the Central Bank of the Philippines; a reinforced cement vault was built in the atrium. After a fire in 1979, it was abandoned. In 1998 work began towards converting the Aduana into the Spanish section of the National Archives.

Built late 19th century to probably turn of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Situated on the southern tip of the island of Panay called Naso Point, the town of Anini-y became an independent parish in 1861. It was previously a <strong>visita</strong> (mission chapel) of the neighboring towns of Dao (now Tobias Fornier) and Hamtic. In 1840, Cagayancillo was annexed to Anini-y but eventually became a separate parish in 1895. Anini-y town got its name from the local word&nbsp;<em>anini&nbsp;</em>which means a place of small rivers. It was settled by people from a village of Hamtic called Asluman around 1600 to 1630 and immigrants from Cagayancillo who settled the town in the early 18th century. The residents supported themselves through fishing and farming. The town is also known for its sulphuric springs at a place called Sira-an.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously administered by secular priests, the town was taken over by the Augustinians in 1875 and administered as a parish by them probably until the late 1890s. The church and the convent were vacant when the Aglipayans seized both in 1902. In 1906, the Mill Hill Fathers from England arrived and were assigned to the province of Antique, including Anini-y. Fr John Sweere was named the first parish priest of the town in 1928. The Mill Hill Fathers still administer the parish up to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The town&rsquo;s first church was possibly built by Fr Hipolito Casiano around 1630 and 1638. It measured 33 m long by 13 m wide. The town&rsquo;s second church was constructed near the old one in 1845. It was longer than the older church, measuring 44 m by 12.50 m. In 1879, the construction of the <strong>convento</strong> was completed by Fr Jeronimo Vaquerin. Fr Vaquerin replaced the second church with a new structure made of masonry. There is no exact date as to when the present coral stone church was started but by 1894 it was already roofed and in 1898 almost completed. This edifice measures 65 m long and 16 m wide. Parts of the town&rsquo;s second church are still visible today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church survived the powerful Lady Caycay earthquake of 1948 but was damaged by a typhoon in 1973. The roof was blown off and the back wall collapsed. The church was subsequently restored by Fr William Erinkweld. The ruins of an old convento are found behind the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical revivalist</a> style with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> embellishments, popular during the 19th century. It has a rectangular facade capped by a triangular pediment with a niche at its center, flanked by two blind occuli. The two-story facade, unlike the baroque style of the 18th century, is demarcated by a line separating the first from the second story. Four shallow pilasters, terminating in composite capitals, run the height of the first story and divide it vertically into three parts. At the center is the arched entrance to the church, flanked at the sides by niches above which are occuli larger than those of the second story. The baroque touch of this otherwise classical facade are the rosettes and acanthus leaves embellishing the niches, the arched entrance, and the base of the pediment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attached to the facade is a three-story domed bell tower. The top two registers are octagonal and the base is a quadrilateral in plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has altars in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style.

The baptistry niche is decorated in the baroque manner, crowned by a semicircular pediment that can be interpreted as either a sunburst or an anahaw leaf. It has an image of the Baptism of Jesus.

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Inmaculada Concepcion. Location: Antipolo, Rizal. Built 1630-53, renovated after 1863. Architects: Fr Juan de Salazar,&nbsp;SJ and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>. Destroyed in 1945. Replaced by a modern church designed by Jose L. de Ocampo in 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1578 the Franciscans established the Antipolo mission; then in 1591, while still a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of Taytay, Antipolo was ceded to the Jesuits. According to local tradition, the old town site of Antipolo was about one kilometer east from its present location. By 1596 the Antipolo parish had three barrios, each with its own chapel. In 1603, under the direction of the Fr Diego Garcia, SJ a wooden church was built in Antipolo at the cost of 1,500 pesos. In 1626 Gov-Gen Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora brought a dark image of the Inmaculada Concepcion from Acapulco to the Philippines and entrusted it to the Jesuits in 1632.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, from 1630 to 1653, Juan de Salazar built a stone church in Antipolo. Tabora was one of its principal donors. According to local tradition, the Virgin herself chose the church site, as the dark image enshrined in the earlier church had a habit of disappearing and being found at the top of the&nbsp;<em>tipolo&nbsp;</em>tree after which the town was named; hence Ang Tipolo, the popular name of the image of the Virgen de Antipolo. Not after the townspeople had carved a base from the tree for the image did the mysterious disappearances of the Virgin cease.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Before 1639, the image was solemnly enthroned in the church Salazar had built. In 1639 and 1640 Chinese rebels destroyed the church interior and desecrated the statue of the Virgin and a crucifix. To prevent its further destruction, the image was hidden by the townspeople in the forest of Guinapo. Later it was transferred to Cavite and designated patroness of the galleon for many decades. In 1645 an earthquake damaged the church fabric although not seriously enough to warrant its demolition. As a safety precaution three courses of stone were removed from the nave, the height of the church tower reduced, the pediment removed and a new one constructed. In 1684 the image was moved from a side altar to a renovated main altar. By this year six reliefs depicting the history of the Virgen de Antipolo had been completed. The church underwent another major renovation in 1726. Tuscan columns replaced Doric columns, and the <strong>convento</strong> was expanded.

In 1645 an earthquake damaged the church fabric although not seriously enough to warrant its demolition. As a safety precaution three courses of stone were removed from the nave, the height of the church tower reduced, the pediment removed and a new one constructed. In 1684 the image was moved from a side altar to a renovated main altar. By this year six reliefs depicting the history of the Virgen de Antipolo had been completed.

Built ca 1788-1830.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coastal town of Argao, 66 km south of Cebu City, was established in 1608. Having separated from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/416\">Carcar</a>, it became a parish church in 1734 with Fr Ignacio de Olalde as first parish priest. Argao&rsquo;s first patron was San Miguel Arcangel. The parish also has a devotion to Santo Tomas de Villanueva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present church was started in 1788 and completed in the 1830s during the incumbency of Fr Mateo Perez, 1801&ndash;36. Fr Perez also built the present <strong>convento</strong>. Both church and convento were used as refuge in times of crisis. Classes of the Colegio Seminario de San Carlos were temporarily held in the convento after World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church was built using cut stone (corals), known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>piedra de Visayas</strong></a>, bricks, and hardwood. The roof, formerly of locally made tiles, was later replaced with galvanized iron. The original rafters of hardwood and the walls of massive cut stones are preserved. The atrium and the northern side of the church are paved with bricks. The damaged portions have been recently <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A low wall of cut stone encloses the three sides of the quadrangular patio. The outer side of the wall is decorated with husk garlands, fruits, and festoons. Four corners of the patio have <strong>capillas&nbsp;</strong><strong>posas</strong> (small outdoor oratories), a unique feature among Cebu&rsquo;s colonial churches. This wall has abstract and symbolic depictions of the Way of the Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is a simple rectangular building. Its cruciform plan is formed by a single nave from which extends a short transept. Its three-story belfry, designed by Bp Santos Gomez Mara&ntilde;on of Cebu, is attached to the main structure of the church by what was once a <strong>camarin de los campaneros</strong> (bell ringer&rsquo;s quarters), now a baptistry housing a stone baptismal font. The bell tower has arched windows with balustrades and is crowned by a dome. Like the first organ of the church that still exists, five of the bell tower&rsquo;s original eight bells are well preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade has three levels formed from two lines of cornices and three segments formed from five sets of decorative Corinthian columns, four of which are paired. The third level, a large triangular pediment, is highlighted by the sculpture of San Miguel at the center. On the second or choir loft level are two semi-rounded windows at either side and a rectangular window at the center. On the first or ground level is the main door, arched and topped by a carved eagle. The facade walls are decorated with various reliefs including the Augustinian coat of arms, floral motifs, and angels. The nave and transept doors are similarly adorned, e.g., the wooden transept door, dated 1788, features a sculpted floral centerpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church interior is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> blended with folk <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a>. Well-appointed fenestrations include splayed doors and windows, and variations in interior space such as arches and tunnels of increasing height. An old choir loft, supported by a stone arch ornately designed with lattice railings and flame-like cartouche pinnacles, is flanked by twin <strong>tribunas</strong> (balconies). The wooden vaulted ceiling has colorful murals of biblical scenes from the entrance to the intersection of the nave and transept, with a 1930 painting of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3426\">Canuto Avila</a> portraying the temptation of Adam and Eve. Even the cornice and the beams are painted, leaving little bare space on the ceiling. The main two-story rococo&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">retablo</a>&nbsp;</strong>of San Miguel, a carved pulpit, and side altars covered with gold leaf further adorn the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento is made of stone and wood. The ground floor was built of mortar and lime or rubblework. Compact earth paved the ground floor of the <strong>bodega</strong> (warehouse). The upper level is of a variety of hardwood, such as apitong, molave, and ipil. Dividing walls are of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>tabique pampango</strong></a> (wattle and daub construction). The roof is also of galvanized iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento adjoins the church from the north side. An L-shaped two-story structure, facing west, it encloses the west orchard and the side doors of the church leading to the west gate. Its ground floor is an old bodega of disposed church properties. Upstairs are a spacious veranda, a sala, and large rooms. A passage from the veranda leads directly to the choir loft of the church. The entire tail end of the convento accommodates the dining and kitchen areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remnants of a fortified perimeter, enclosing church, convento, and patio remain standing. The perimeter gate facing the sea stands directly in front of the church.

Architects: Eduardo Lopez Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although popularly known as Ayuntamiento (from Spanish &ldquo;ayuntamiento&rdquo;, meaning city corporation or ruling body), a more accurate name for this building is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa de ayuntamiento</strong></a> (house of the city corporation); or <strong>casas consistoriales</strong> (meeting house), roughly equivalent to city hall. The hall housed the <strong>cabildo</strong> or city chapter, composed of the offices of the&nbsp;<em>alcalde&nbsp;</em>and his&nbsp;<em>regidores&nbsp;</em>or the city mayor and councilors, the city jail, and other offices including that of the governor-general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirty days after the official foundation of the City of Manila, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi mapped out the site for the future casas consistoriales, henceforth to be referred to as Ayuntamiento. However, for lack of funds, not even a structure of wood and nipa was raised, and thus for some years the city chapter meetings were held where convenient. The building of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">Intramuros walls</a> occasioned such a delay. Not until the incumbency of Gov-Gen Francisco Tello did work begin on a permanent home for the Ayuntamiento ca 1599. Morga, ca 1607, described this building as made of cut stones, monumental and pleasing to behold; its first floor housed the courts of first instance presided by the mayors and judges, and the municipal jail. The second story may have housed the meeting hall, the customary chapel, the administrative offices, and the archives. The building may have been just one wing, as later reports describe the old hall as unfinished. The effects of the earthquakes of 1645 and 1658 on the structure are inadequately documented, but a document of 1684 pleaded for funds to restore the structure ruined by so many quakes. The Ayuntamiento at this time held its sessions in a house rented from the Jesuit College of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On 31 Jan 1735, during the incumbency of Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes y Tamon, the cornerstone for the second Ayuntamiento was laid. The year given for its completion, 1738, is highly doubtful since the chronicles of the Franciscan Francisco de San Antonio state that as of this year the building was still being constructed. The building survived well into the 19th century when the earthquake of 3 Jun 1863 heavily damaged the structure so that it had to be rebuilt. The chief engineer of the islands Eduardo Lopez Navarro was commissioned to draw up plans for the reconstruction, since the city architect failed to deliver them after almost a decade since the quake. The construction of the new Ayuntamiento was scheduled to begin on 29 Apr 1879, but work had to stop a few months later because of an earthquake in 1880. The structural soundness of Navarro&rsquo;s plans had to be studied and necessary revisions made, after which work continued on 4 Apr 1881. Another work stoppage occurred on 21 Mar 1885.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The completed building served at one time as the office of the American governor-general. In 1907 the first National Assembly of the Philippines held its sessions here. This third building of the Ayuntamiento was ruined during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As planned by Navarro, the Ayuntamiento was a quadrilateral structure built around an atrium. It had two floors made of cut stone. Presenting a facade in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style, it was severe, well proportioned, and with quadrilateral windows and arched entrances arranged in a balanced manner. To relieve the simplicity of the quadrilateral plan, the main entrance at the center of the building and the corners of the building projected outwards, and its upper stories sported balconies, flushed to the walls, in contrast to the main halls, which had floor- to-ceiling windows. Gone were the bulbous wrought-iron balconies of the Ayuntamiento of 1735, as well as the arcaded walk and the clock tower, which gave the older building its characteristic facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three arched doorways led to the interior, which Juan Hervas renovated at the turn of the 19th century. He was responsible for renovating the building&rsquo;s vestibule, its imperial stairway, and the ballroom or &ldquo;Marble Hall.&rdquo; The vestibule had a harlequin floor of black and white marble and sculpted lions decorating the stairway that led to the second story. The stairway had a wrought-iron balustrade decorated by vine-like motifs. All the second-floor rooms opened to a corridor, which in turn opened into the atrium planted with a variety of tropical plants. Tall <strong>persiana</strong> or louver doors along the corridor could be closed so that the glare and heat from the atrium would not enter the upper story. The corridor was often used for receptions and meals. In this building was the mayor&rsquo;s office&mdash;a room sparsely decorated with a desk and a high-back chair, some Vienna chairs, and paintings by Filipino masters and European artists. There were separate waiting rooms for men and for women who had business to transact with the city government. These were provided with furniture and bric-a-brac from Europe, giving them an overstuffed Victorian air. The session hall of the city chapter had a number of tall and large doors that led into it. Its ceiling was painted with allegorical scenes, and from it hung glass chandeliers from Europe. The &ldquo;Marble Hall&rdquo; was rectangular in shape with numerous doors leading into it. A coffered ceiling and chandeliers of brass and glass made this an elegant hall for soirees and social functions of the Manila elite. So popular was this room that the whole Ayuntamiento was also called the Marble Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ayuntamiento stood majestic beside the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> and facing the Plaza Mayor until it was ruined during World War II. The interior was gutted, the roof was gone, and only the outer walls remained. A ruin for more than six decades, the gutted interior was once used as a parking lot. Plans to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">rebuild</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restore</a> were discussed but nothing substantial materialized until 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Treasury, which holds office in the restored Ayuntamiento, entered into a contract with DDT Konstract Inc on 19 Oct 2009. In 2010, archaeological investigation, as mandated by a law on all heritage sites, was done under the supervision of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>. Rebuilding and restoration was scheduled to be completed by 2011. By 31 Dec 2012, the Commission on Audit reported that the project of reconstruction had been delayed for one year, one month, and 23 days as of 31 Dec 2012 and the original budget of PHP1.181 billion had incurred an extra PHP195.5 million, in excess of the allowable 10 percent variation or PHP118.2 million because of change order and design modification during the course of construction. The rebuilt and reconstructed Ayuntamiento was finally inaugurated in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restored according to the neoclassical plan of Navarro, the restored Ayuntamiento brings closer to completion the restoration of the area surrounding Casa Manila. The restoration is more sensitive to historic architecture and contrasts sharply with the overbuilt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">Palacio del Gobernador</a>, which beyond its first two floors is a design fantasy with no basis in historic architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whitewashed exterior of the Ayuntamiento, its shuttered French windows leading to balconies evoke pictures of the building during the early 20th century. The interior is a pleasant surprise. The foyer shows knowledge of historic Philippine architecture. The black and white harlequin floor has been restored; the coffered ceiling and the Imperial staircase, flanked by lions at the base and a statue of Sebastian El Cano at the landing show care in being true to the original building being replaced. The grand hall has a ceiling painted with murals to capture the spirit of the 19th century building, which has been reconstructed. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The building of the <a href=\"/2/8/310\">Intramuros walls</a> occasioned such a delay. Not until the incumbency of Gov-Gen Francisco Tello did work begin on a permanent home for the Ayuntamiento ca 1599. Morga, ca 1607, described this building as made of cut stones, monumental and pleasing to behold; its first floor housed the courts of first instance presided by the mayors and judges, and the municipal jail. The second story may have housed the meeting hall, the customary chapel, the administrative offices, and the archives. The building may have been just one wing, as later reports describe the old hall as unfinished. The effects of the earthquakes of 1645 and 1658 on the structure are inadequately documented, but a document of 1684 pleaded for funds to restore the structure ruined by so many quakes. The Ayuntamiento at this time held its sessions in a house rented from the Jesuit College of Manila."

The building survived well into the 19th century when the earthquake of 3 Jun 1863 heavily damaged the structure so that it had to be rebuilt. The chief engineer of the islands Eduardo Lopez Navarro was commissioned to draw up plans for the reconstruction, since the city architect failed to deliver them after almost a decade since the quake. The construction of the new Ayuntamiento was scheduled to begin on 29 Apr 1879, but work had to stop a few months later because of an earthquake in 1880. The structural soundness of Navarro&#x2019;s plans had to be studied and necessary revisions made, after which work continued on 4 Apr 1881. Another work stoppage occurred on 21 Mar 1885."

To relieve the simplicity of the quadrilateral plan, the main entrance at the center of the building and the corners of the building projected outwards, and its upper stories sported balconies, flushed to the walls, in contrast to the main halls, which had floor- to-ceiling windows. Gone were the bulbous wrought-iron balconies of the Ayuntamiento of 1735, as well as the arcaded walk and the clock tower, which gave the older building its characteristic facade."

The stairway had a wrought-iron balustrade decorated by vine-like motifs. All the second-floor rooms opened to a corridor, which in turn opened into the atrium planted with a variety of tropical plants. Tall <strong>persiana</strong> or louver doors along the corridor could be closed so that the glare and heat from the atrium would not enter the upper story. The corridor was often used for receptions and meals. In this building was the mayor&#x2019;s office&#x2014;a room sparsely decorated with a desk and a high-back chair, some Vienna chairs, and paintings by Filipino masters and European artists. There were separate waiting rooms for men and for women who had business to transact with the city government. These were provided with furniture and bric-a-brac from Europe, giving them an overstuffed Victorian air. The session hall of the city chapter had a number of tall and large doors that led into it. Its ceiling was painted with allegorical scenes, and from it hung glass chandeliers from Europe. The &#x201C;Marble Hall&#x201D; was rectangular in shape with numerous doors leading into it. A coffered ceiling and chandeliers of brass and glass made this an elegant hall for soirees and social functions of the Manila elite.

It was still known by that name when the first Spaniards arrived in 1572. Its present name is said to derive from&nbsp;<em>bacar</em>, a large local basket for harvested rice, or&nbsp;<em>bacbacarra</em>, a fish common along the coast. The Augustinians founded the mission of Bacarra around 1590. It was nestled between two rivers that linked it with the sea and the mountains. From here Christian centers were established in Vintar, Pasuquin, Banguisan (now Bangui), Bambang (now Taguipuro, a barrio of Bangui), Bangbanglo (the earlier site of Burgos), Adang (Adams), and Vera (location unknown). Thus, Bacarra is the mother parish of the northern half of today&rsquo;s Ilocos Norte. The town was not exempt from slave raids, as evidenced by a watchtower in barrio Natba.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">Atypically, the administrative seat was not in the center of the town&rsquo;s elongated grid plan. The church was the first building encountered from the river.

An early church may have been destroyed during the Almazan Revolt of 1661. A single-naved brick church was raised from 1700 to 1706, but most of its walls except the apse cracked in the 1707 earthquake. A new brick church and <strong>convento</strong> built in the 1830s were renovated in 1868. Both buildings were damaged again by an earthquake in 1880, entailing a new floor and tile roof for the church, and more buttresses for the convento in 1889. These were further repaired in the 1890s. Further earthquakes in 1931, 1944, 1981, and especially 1983 resulted in the drastic alteration of the church complex.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The pre-1981 earthquake facade consisted of two levels and a pediment. The ground level was a massive wall, its single entrance flanked by imposing pairs of twin columns. The squat second level and pediment do not continue the majestic proportions of the first level, and may have replaced their damaged counterparts. A step buttress supports the left church wall. Rare bas-reliefs of Augustinian symbols in stone crown the side entrances. The pre-1981 central retablo was also of brick with a smooth plaster finish, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> in its columns but with echoes of baroque vines running down the sides. The expansive L-shaped convento is brick in both levels, with a sweeping <strong>azotea</strong> and matching stairway at the back. Several steps lead down to a brick-lined well in the courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iconic, massive bell tower stands some distance from the church. A 50-meter tall masterpiece in brick, it was built under the direction of Fr Pedro Berger, parish priest in 1828-48. Its unique cupola shaped like a&nbsp;<em>pilon&nbsp;</em>or sugar loaf came crashing down along with major sections of the walls in the 1980s earthquakes.

Built 1795 by secular clergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Balayan traces its beginnings to the friars, the present church is among the handful that is the work of the secular or diocesan clergy. In 1575, the Augustinians opened Balayan as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of Bonbon, the ancient name of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>. Balayan&rsquo;s boundaries were quite extensive, including in its territory the towns of Nasugbu, Lian, Calatagan, Tuy, and Calaca. It was effectively the visita and later the parish of the southern coast of Batangas. When they arrived in 1578, the Franciscans were given charge of Balayan by the Augustinians. Fr Francisco de Santa Maria, OFM built a provisional church in 1579. The Franciscans ministered at Balayan for more than a decade, when in 1591, the Franciscans, represented by Fr Juan de Oliver, OFM, a noted expert in Tagalog and preacher, turned over Balayan to the Jesuits under Pedro Chirino. This is recorded in Chirino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Relacion de las islas Filipinas</em></strong> (Accounts on the Philippine Islands). Chirino who was chronicler of the Jesuit missions in the Philippines and trusted assistant of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Fr Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a>, the mission superior, built a church in Balayan. The Jesuits left Balayan, most likely after 1600, when Fr Diego Garcia, SJ, invoking his authority as visitor, told the Jesuits to consolidate their missions into a few strategic ones since their manpower was overstretched, especially with the opening of the Visayan missions in 1595.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stone church was reportedly built in 1749. It is unclear by whom because the seculars did not take charge of Balayan until 1753.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balayan was under the seculars until 1876, when it was turned over to the Recollects. Because Balayan was a coastal town, with an opening to Balayan Bay, and vulnerable to sea-faring raiders, its parish priests built a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortification</a> or stone <strong>kuta</strong> or fort, after a raid in 1754. They also built a watchtower on a nearby hill. The fortification surrounded the church and <strong>convento</strong> but the fortification was torn down most likely in the 1840s, when similar fortifications in Bauan and Batangas were taken down. A low row of stones, serving as a perimeter wall, is all that remains of the Balayan fortification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church, attributed to the initiative and effort of the seculars, was completed and blessed in 1795 and dedicated to the patroness, Inmaculada Concepcion. It is uncertain if the previous churches of Balayan, until that of 1749, were made of stone or were provisional churches of wood, bamboo and thatch. Most likely Chirino&rsquo;s 1591 church was provisional as was the church of 1579.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1857, a new convent was completed. The old convent, which was located across the patio was demolished but its tiles were used for an <strong>ermita</strong> or chapel being built for the cemetery. Additions to the church complex did not cease. In 1870, the second and third levels of the bell tower were added. Repair work had to be done on the convento and church, which had been damaged by earthquake. The second floor of the convento had to be taken down and rebuilt and a temporary chapel raised while repair on the church was being made. It was most likely the earthquake of 1863 that damaged the church and convento. The sanctuary of Balayan was refurbished in the 1870s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1875, the archbishop of Manila, under whom all of Batangas fell, authorized the purchase of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo mayor</strong></a>, pulpit and other appurtenances for the church. To pave the floor, narra planks were used for the nave and <strong>azulejos</strong> (tiles) for the sanctuary. An additional bay was added behind the sanctuary as an <strong>antesacristia</strong> (anteroom) for the sacristy, in 1878. Decorative grilles were installed around the atrium in 1887 and the bell tower was repaired in 1892 using bricks rather than stone. Two intense earthquakes hit Luzon in 1880 and in 1884 in the vicinity of Quezon, then known as Tayabas. It seems that the Balayan bell tower, which was reported as built of stone in 1870, survived the 1880 earthquake but not the one four years later, whose epicenter was closer to Batangas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1857, the construction of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a> using material from the demolished convento began. Work on the cemetery continued and rows of niches were built in 1887. In 1896, the work had to be stabilized because of erosion on the hillside. By this time the Recollects were already administering Balayan and the seculars were demoted to assistants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Batangas was not originally Recollect territory, it was given to the Recollects, along with other parishes in Cavite and Batangas to compensate for their loss of parishes in Mindanao, which had been given to the returning Jesuits. Expelled from the Philippines in 1768 and returning in 1859, the Jesuits were assigned to all of Mindanao. The stipulation of their assignment indicated that as soon as a Recollect parish in Mindanao was vacant due to the death, illness or resignation of the parish priest, the Jesuits would take over administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Recollects were replaced by Filipino seculars after the Revolution of 1896. Seculars who had occupied Balayan were driven out by American soldiers, who commandeered the church complex in 1900 to serve as quarters. They remained in the complex for about a year. In 1908, Balayan was given to the seculars of the Archdiocese of Manila. When the Diocese of Lipa was established in 1910, Balayan was placed under it. In 1972, Lipa would be raised to an archdiocese with the suffragan dioceses of Lucena, Gumaca, and Boac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exteriorly Balayan church is typical of colonial churches, using a facade plan composed of two stories, crowned by a triangular pediment. The horizontals are defined by projecting rows of stones and the verticals by pilasters and engaged columns at the first floor. The whole facade is flanked by thick pillars capped with a vase finial. Arched openings define the windows and the main entrance found at the center. This is flanked by niches for statues, separated from the main door by flanking engaged columns. Above the niches are arched windows and between them another niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bell tower is also typical. It begins with a quadrilateral base on which three octagonal stories of diminishing sizes are raised. Unlike the church, which is made of stone, this tower is built of bricks. Its uppermost floor was destroyed and for a long time, it was covered with a floor and dome of white metal sheets. That temporary structure, still up until 2003, has been taken down and the upper story of the bell tower restored using bricks. The plaster layer of the church, visible in early 20th century photographs, has not been restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The addition of a stone portico in front of the historic building mars the line of the original design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church interior has remained largely unchanged except for the refurbishing of the altar in gold leaf and brown wood stain. The pulpit has likewise been refurbished. The nave and sanctuary walls are not embellished so that the stone used for construction are visible. The nave&rsquo;s ceiling, a flat vault that curves to the side to meet pairs of <strong>zapata</strong> or corbel along the wall, is painted with a geometric pattern of chamfered boxes. The section where there are zapatas is defined by a brown ladderlike structure that runs from one pair of zapata to those at the opposite wall. This ceiling design is repeated in the transept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the transept crossing is a shallow dome supported by pendentives in which the images of the four evangelists are painted as customary. The dome is divided into triangular segments by lines and by clouds that form a frame. The Trinity is depicted in the segment nearest the apse, with the Father on the throne of heaven, holding up the crucified Christ while the Spirit hovers above. Biblical scenes fill the other segments, like the visit of the three angels to Abraham, the Baptism of Jesus, the Commissioning of St Peter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The adjoining convento, painted in white and blue, is Immaculate Conception College.

In 1575, the Augustinians opened Balayan as a <a href=\"/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of Bonbon, the ancient name of <a href=\"/2/10/426\">Taal</a>. Balayan&#x2019;s boundaries were quite extensive, including in its territory the towns of Nasugbu, Lian, Calatagan, Tuy, and Calaca. It was effectively the visita and later the parish of the southern coast of Batangas. When they arrived in 1578, the Franciscans were given charge of Balayan by the Augustinians. Fr Francisco de Santa Maria, OFM built a provisional church in 1579. The Franciscans ministered at Balayan for more than a decade, when in 1591, the Franciscans, represented by Fr Juan de Oliver, OFM, a noted expert in Tagalog and preacher, turned over Balayan to the Jesuits under Pedro Chirino. This is recorded in Chirino&#x2019;s <strong><em>Relacion de las islas Filipinas</em></strong> (Accounts on the Philippine Islands). Chirino who was chronicler of the Jesuit missions in the Philippines and trusted assistant of <a href=\"/2/2/2700\">Fr Antonio Sede&#xF1;o</a>, the mission superior, built a church in Balayan. The Jesuits left Balayan, most likely after 1600, when Fr Diego Garcia, SJ, invoking his authority as visitor, told the Jesuits to consolidate their missions into a few strategic ones since their manpower was overstretched, especially with the opening of the Visayan missions in 1595."

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of the Inmaculada Concepcion. Location: Boac, Marinduque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franciscans were the first to evangelize Marinduque Island, formerly Malindig. The first permanent Franciscan missionary to Boac, Fr Esteban Ortiz, OFM, arrived in 1579. The following year, he founded the town of Boac and named it Montserrat de Marinduque. Fr Alonso Ba&ntilde;ol, OFM became the first resident parish priest in 1584. In 1609, Santa Cruz de Napo and Gasan were separated from Boac and the first parish priests were Fr Juan Rosendo, OFM and Fr Pedro de Talavera, OFM respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1613, for lack of personnel, the Franciscans returned Marinduque to the Archbishop of Manila. The archbishop appointed a cathedral canon as the proprietary priest of Boac. When the canon died, the archbishop requested the Jesuits to take charge of the island. The Jesuits initially sent men on an extended tour from their Silang residence. They then assigned a resident missionary between 1621 and 1622. They also reestablished the abandoned parishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lying south of Batangas and west of the Bicol Peninsula and Mindoro, the island of Marinduque was strategically important for the defense of Manila. The island was along the pathway of both the galleons and southern raiders. In inclement weather the galleons would take shelter in its harbor at Balanacan as they would in neighboring Puerto Galera in Mindoro Island. Because of its importance, Marinduque&rsquo;s coasts were lined with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortresses</a> and watchtowers, usually built on hills or promontories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fortress church of Boac has a two-story facade with a triangular pediment and heavy buttresses for its single nave, a style common to churches in less war-prone areas. It is strategically located on top of a hill and surrounded by a wall. In case of an attack the church would become the second line of defense. Boac&rsquo;s defensive walls were probably built sometime in the latter part of the 18th century when raids were frequent. The walls, then as high as 3 m although degraded now, crown the top of the hill, now called Mataas na Bayan (higher town). There are six sides to the walls, each side of unequal length. At every corner are bulwarks with openings for artillery. A sixth bulwark doubles as a sacristy. Two gates pierce the wall; one at the northern side facing the river, and the other at the southern side facing the hills. By 1939, a third breach was cut into the walls, by demolishing the eastern bulwark, building an archway, and laying a road for cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>convento</strong> behind the church opens to a vista of the Boac River and distant Laylay, where at a river mouth delta stands the ruins of an old watchtower. This unusual placement of the convento and its multiple passages may have been designed for defense; thus one can go from church to convento without being exposed. The convento itself is defensive. Instead of the regular plan using a wooden second floor, both floors are of stone and brick. A veranda surrounds the convento on two sides, perhaps as a passageway for lookouts. Below the convento is an empty hall identified by tradition as a <strong>cuadra</strong> or stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1953, Saint Mary&rsquo;s Academy opened in Boac. The Religious of the Virgin Mary, RVM, who run the school, were given use of the convento. Meanwhile a new convento was built within the fortification in front and to the right of the church, near the north gate and the shrine to the Inmaculada known as &ldquo;Biglang Awa,&rdquo; because of her defense of the people from slave raiders. On 2 Apr 1977, the diocese of Boac was created and on 10 May 1978 canonically erected. The church was elevated to a cathedral and the new convento used as the bishop&rsquo;s residence.

The following year, he founded the town of Boac and named it Montserrat de Marinduque. Fr Alonso Ba&#xF1;ol, OFM became the first resident parish priest in 1584. In 1609, Santa Cruz de Napo and Gasan were separated from Boac and the first parish priests were Fr Juan Rosendo, OFM and Fr Pedro de Talavera, OFM respectively."

When the canon died, the archbishop requested the Jesuits to take charge of the island. The Jesuits initially sent men on an extended tour from their Silang residence. They then assigned a resident missionary between 1621 and 1622. They also reestablished the abandoned parishes."

				"value": "Lying south of Batangas and west of the Bicol Peninsula and Mindoro, the island of Marinduque was strategically important for the defense of Manila. The island was along the pathway of both the galleons and southern raiders. In inclement weather the galleons would take shelter in its harbor at Balanacan as they would in neighboring Puerto Galera in Mindoro Island. Because of its importance, Marinduque&#x2019;s coasts were lined with <a href=\"/2/5/232\">fortresses</a> and watchtowers, usually built on hills or promontories."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The fortress church of Boac has a two-story facade with a triangular pediment and heavy buttresses for its single nave, a style common to churches in less war-prone areas. It is strategically located on top of a hill and surrounded by a wall. In case of an attack the church would become the second line of defense. Boac&#x2019;s defensive walls were probably built sometime in the latter part of the 18th century when raids were frequent. The walls, then as high as 3 m although degraded now, crown the top of the hill, now called Mataas na Bayan (higher town). There are six sides to the walls, each side of unequal length. At every corner are bulwarks with openings for artillery. A sixth bulwark doubles as a sacristy. Two gates pierce the wall; one at the northern side facing the river, and the other at the southern side facing the hills. By 1939, a third breach was cut into the walls, by demolishing the eastern bulwark, building an archway, and laying a road for cars."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The <strong>convento</strong> behind the church opens to a vista of the Boac River and distant Laylay, where at a river mouth delta stands the ruins of an old watchtower. This unusual placement of the convento and its multiple passages may have been designed for defense; thus one can go from church to convento without being exposed. The convento itself is defensive. Instead of the regular plan using a wooden second floor, both floors are of stone and brick. A veranda surrounds the convento on two sides, perhaps as a passageway for lookouts. Below the convento is an empty hall identified by tradition as a <strong>cuadra</strong> or stable."

Meanwhile a new convento was built within the fortification in front and to the right of the church, near the north gate and the shrine to the Inmaculada known as &#x201C;Biglang Awa,&#x201D; because of her defense of the people from slave raiders. On 2 Apr 1977, the diocese of Boac was created and on 10 May 1978 canonically erected. The church was elevated to a cathedral and the new convento used as the bishop&#x2019;s residence. In the 1990s, the RVM school, now a college, constructed new buildings in the outlying areas of Boac and abandoned the convento for the new buildings. The old convento was repaired and refurbished."

A pioneer missionary, G.C. Bartter of the Foreign Bible Society, came to Cebu in 1900 to sell Spanish Bibles and tracts of Mark&rsquo;s Gospel in the vernacular. But when Dr and Mrs Graham acquired a piece of land belonging to the Banilad Estate, formerly owned by the Augustinians, the Presbyterians settled permanently in Cebu and symbolized this by building a church, Fuente Osme&ntilde;a Evangelical Church, forerunner of Bradford. After the establishment of the Cebu Presbytery in 1908, churches in Opon, Compostela, Dumanjug, and three other municipalities were established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1912, with donations from generous benefactors, three structures were built in Cebu City: a boys&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo;s dormitory, Sneed and Emerson respectively, and a third structure, the Bradford Memorial Church. This last was named after Matilda L. Bradford, the mother of Dorothy H. Day, its donor. Although it had been used since Apr 1913 after its completion, the church was not formally dedicated until 26 Oct of that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1971 a growing congregation had outstripped the capacity of the 1913 church and a new church was constructed. The old church was used as a schoolroom. Plans to demolish the old church were halted when, through the initiative of members of the church council, old Bradford was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Institute in 1984, being the oldest Protestant church in Cebu. In 2013, the church underwent a thorough <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">conservation</a> and restoration in time for the 31 May cultural event,&nbsp;<em>Gabi-i sa Kabilin&nbsp;</em>(An Evening of Heritage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church follows a cruciform plan with an external and open vestibule that serves as a portico. The church&rsquo;s windows and openings use <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> lancet windows, following a style common to early 20th century Protestant churches.

But when Dr and Mrs Graham acquired a piece of land belonging to the Banilad Estate, formerly owned by the Augustinians, the Presbyterians settled permanently in Cebu and symbolized this by building a church, Fuente Osme&#xF1;a Evangelical Church, forerunner of Bradford.

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of San Ignacio de Loyola. Location: Capul, Northern Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capul is the name of an island in the middle of the San Bernardino Strait, the body of water which separates Luzon from Samar. The Strait used to be known as the Embocadero, through which the Manila-Acapulco galleons carefully made their way. In earlier times the island was called Abac: hence the inhabitants&rsquo; name, Abaknon, and their language, Inabaknon. Linguists classify Inabaknon among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) languages; it is in fact most closely related to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a>, spoken in Basilan. Interestingly, Inabaknon is the only Sama language without Arabic influence; its speakers had separated from their Sama linguistic cousins as early as 800 years ago. According to Capul oral tradition, the ancestors of the Abaknon, unwilling to embrace Islam, fled from Balabac (whence the name &ldquo;Abac&rdquo;) and eventually settled where they are now. Early historians such as Alzina link the Abaknon to the&nbsp;<em>camu&ccedil;ones</em>, a collective name for the Tidung of northeastern Borneo and the nomadic Sama Dilaut of the Sulu archipelago. Both animist groups were mobilized by the Brunei sultanate to raid Sulu, Mindanao, and other islands in the 17th century for slaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesuit evangelization began shortly before 1600, when Capul was one of 10 villages ministered from the central residence at Tinago (now Dapdap, Tarangnan) on Samar. Various attempts to resettle the Abaknon on the mainland failed. Despite many attempts to capture the strategic island, the people stood their ground. Its church is said to have been razed in 1615, 1642&mdash;when the aroma of the burning pillars revealed that the church was built of sandalwood&mdash;1650, 1663, 1763, and 1768. In this year, the surviving structure of stone was turned over to the Franciscans, who replaced the Jesuits. By then it was the seat of a parish that even incorporated a large section of northwestern Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church was surrounded by a quadrangular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortification</a> attributed to the first Franciscans assigned to Capul in the early 1770s; this coincides with the peak years of pirate expeditions in Samar waters. The stone church in Capul was repaired in 1781 by Fr Mariano Valero, OFM, who also built the belltower. Worsening slave raids, a declining population, and insufficient missionaries (the Franciscans were sometimes substituted by secular priests) led to Capul&rsquo;s attachment as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) to Calbayog. Capul only regained its parish status 80 years later, by diocesan decree on 18 Nov 1869.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church, dedicated to the founder of the Jesuits, San Ignacio de Loyola, has a stark facade articulated only with an entrance crowned with a rudimentary &ldquo;broken&rdquo; pediment and three rectangular windows corresponding to the choir loft. The entrance to the church is also the entrance to the fort, a symbolic configuration found also in Cuyo and Calapan. A succession of typhoons, especially those in 1947, 1967, 1981, and 1988, have left the interior quite bare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the western side (inland) of the church are the remains of what seem to be an old <strong>convento</strong>. A newer convento was built on the eastern side (facing the sea); a gateway leading to this convento was opened from the seaside wall of the fort in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two bastions of the fort facing inland are shaped like expanded aces of spades, while the two facing the sea are circular. The crenellations that crown the fortress walls, unusually resembling a medieval fortress, are unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a promontory not far away from town and facing the sea across the Samar mainland are the ruins of a watchtower. Nearby is a stream of fresh water that could have supported a populace waiting out an enemy siege. On the opposite end of town, about a couple of blocks north of the church facade, is another thick-walled ruin, possibly a blockhouse that served as one more line of defense against invaders trying to enter the church. The church, bell tower, fortification, watchtower, and &ldquo;block house&rdquo; are all of mixed coral stone and river stone, very roughly hewn into brick-like shapes of varying sizes. A number of walls have preserved their layers of protective <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> (plaster). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Alzina, Francisco Ignacio, SJ.

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jail was designed in 1869 by government architect Domingo de Escondrillas. He was the lone architect in Cebu and Bohol, where he designed the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/356\">Pardo</a> and Dumanjug, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/323\">Loon</a> and Talibon respectively. As planned, the jail would be the Carcel del Distrito, or the jail for the District of the Visayas, hence, the building&rsquo;s capacious size. After securing permission from Manila, the project was started ca 1871.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction may have proceeded over a number of years. If the oral tradition that the stone blocks from the Parian Church demolished in 1878-1879 were used for this construction is true, then parts of the Carcel were not completed until after 1879. After two decades, in 1892, the jail was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">renovated</a> and two buildings were added behind the main structure. Later, probably during the American era, a second story was added to the main building. The buildings survived World War II and from the 1950s to 1976 served both as Cebu City&rsquo;s jail and the provincial jail. The buildings constructed in 1892 were turned over to the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American Era</a> and the post-World War II period, the jail was called Cebu Provincial Jail, later changed in the 1980s to Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only criminals were incarcerated in the jail&rsquo;s 135-year history.&nbsp;<em>Katipunero&nbsp;</em>were detained here before execution in the Carreta Cemetery a few blocks away. The jail was also used as horse stables for the&nbsp;<em>hip&oacute;</em><em>dromo&nbsp;</em>or racetrack nearby, introduced by the Americans. During the Japanese Occupation, after torture by the Japanese Kempei-Tei or secret police, guerrillas were thrown into its cells. In the postwar trials of war criminals, Filipino collaborators in Cebu were imprisoned in the jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As designed by Escondrillas, the carcel was a long single-story building surrounded by a tall wall on four sides. The main carcel building was the entrance to the jail. From its sides run tall walls, which made a sharp 90-degree turn following the perimeter. Behind this wall were low buildings, whose roofs could barely be seen from outside the front perimeter wall. In time more buildings were added: two parallel wings running perpendicular to the main building, three buildings and a second floor to the main building. In the post-World War II era more buildings were added to the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Escondrillas design was severe and straightforward, adhering to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> idiom. The buildings inside were functional box-like structures with rectangular windows piercing the walls. This was a jail so there was no need for ornament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Dec 2004 Cebu governor Gwendolyn Garcia authorized the conversion of Carcel de Cebu into Museo Sugbo as a repository of Cebuano heritage. Work on repair, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a>, and retrofitting was undertaken so that the Museo&rsquo;s first four galleries were inaugurated on 5 Aug 2008. On 13 Aug the following year, a marker from the National Historical Institute was unveiled at Museo Sugbo. Also inaugurated were the Visayas Branch of the Museum of Philippine Political History and National Museum Cebu Branch Galleries. Both galleries were housed in independent structures built parallel to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the archaeological inventory that accompanied the restoration, a Spanish era well was unearthed behind the buildings of the carcel. This was baptized the Well of Good Fortune and Happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2009, with the addition of four galleries, the Museo had 10 galleries in all. Two more galleries were added in 2010, a Provincial Art Gallery and the Cebu Media Gallery.

There was no Casa Tribunal when Tayabas&rsquo;s first town head, Don Lucas Plata, was appointed in 1620. The Hall of Justice was initially in a private house and customarily in the house of the&nbsp;<em>gobernadorcillo&nbsp;</em>(town mayor). The official Tayabas Casa Tribunal was first built by Don Ignacio Trinidad in 1773 and was finished in 1776 during the time of Don Francisco Lopez using makeshift materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spaces of a typical Casa Tribunal then would include the following: office of the gobernadorcillo, detention cells,<em>archivo&nbsp;</em>(archives), storage room for weapons, other rooms for guests, and the much larger&nbsp;<em>s</em><em>ala de j</em><em>usticia&nbsp;</em>(hall of justice).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1786, under Gobernadorcillo Don Salvador Flores de San Francisco, the structure was made into stone. By 1810, with Don Lorenzo de los Reyes as gobernadorcillo, cement was used for its repair. An attempt was made in 1820 to replace the stone walls of Casa Tribunal but this was not pursued. An 1831 marker on its keystone reveals that the Tribunal was made into a grand edifice by Gobernadorcillo Don Diego Enriquez. This was officially inaugurated in 1835 and was named Casa de Comunidad. This time, the structure was intended as a guesthouse for visiting Spanish dignitaries. The gobernadorcillo also became the hotel manager for the Casa Tribunal where he had to furnish guests with culinary utensils and other household articles. The building was repainted in 1837 in time for the arrival of Abp Jose Segui of Manila with the archbishop of Nueva Caceres who were to administer the sacrament of confirmation to around 1,000 natives. The following year (1838), the gobernadorcillo resumed residency at the Casa de Comunidad. The building was eventually used as the site of the trial of hero Apolinario de la Cruz in 1841, after which he was eventually shot in the adjacent plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guesthouse, Alcalde Mayor Jose Maria de La&rsquo;O&nbsp;refurbished Casa de Comunidad with magnificent decor and costly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> in 1855. By 1870s, the edifice was undisputedly considered as one of the best government structures in the Philippines. However, bandits set the&nbsp;<em>cabecera&nbsp;</em>(capital) on fire destroying the Casa in 1877 along with other structures such as the archives and the telegraph station. Alcalde Mayor Miguel Rosello reported in 1886 that with the frequent clashes between the government and bandits, the casa was destroyed several times not only in Tayabas but also in Mauban, Sariaya, Tiaong, Candelaria, Gumaca, and Lucena. The casa was then rebuilt on a less grand scale and was already functional in 1890. A special banquet was held on 24 Jan 1893 inside the Casa de Comunidad and Casa Real to celebrate the assumption of duty by the Duke of Seville, Don Enrique Castellvi, as Alcalde Mayor de Tayabas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casa de Comunidad, still considered the biggest building in Tayabas, was used as the headquarters of the Spanish Armed Forces in 1898. With the arrival of the Americans and the eventual transfer of the provincial capital from Tayabas to Lucena in 1901, Casa de Comunidad functioned as a mere central school. A secondary school was also initially housed here in the 1930s. With the outbreak of World War II, Casa de Comunidad was converted into a provincial hospital on 15 Dec 1941. The Japanese Army also used this as their headquarters, making it a target of two successive bombings by the Americans on 15 and 22 Mar 1945 before the liberation of Tayabas. In 1950, through the Philippine War Damage Commission, a small emergency schoolhouse was built and was used as Central School Building No 2 until the late 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By early 1980s, the Tayabas-Manila Association with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> spearheaded the restoration of the building. The classrooms were eventually dismantled and the main staircase was also removed to make way for a patio. In 1988, the NHI declared the Casa de Comunidad as a National Historical Landmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Casa de Comunidad today is Tayabas&rsquo;s principal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). The ground floor houses the public library while the supposed storage rooms and detention cells were converted into exhibit rooms showing the former mayors of Tayabas and other items. The upper hall was reserved for big events with some smaller rooms serving as offices.

		"text": "<p>Location: Hernan Cortes (now Lopez Jaena) St, Parian District, Cebu City. Built ca mid-19th century. Architect: Alejandro Reynes (born ca 1820).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gorordo family, with which the house is associated, is an ethnically mixed family founded by Juan Isidro de Gorordo (died ca 1870), a Spaniard from Vizcaya, Spain, who came to Cebu in the early 19th century and established himself as a city merchant. His wife Telesfora Garces (1830-1899) was of an old mestizo sangley family of Parian, Cebu. They had six children, the best-known being Juan Gorordo (1862-1934), the first Filipino bishop of Cebu, 1910-32. The house was bought by Juan Isidro de Gorordo in 1863 from it previous owner, Alejandro Reynes y Rosales.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The residence was acquired from the Gorordo Family by the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc. (RAFI) in 1980, and from 1981 to 1982, the house was restored and outfitted as a house museum that showcases the elegant lifestyle at the turn of the century. This lifestyle museum opened in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house is typical of Cebu City&rsquo;s moderately affluent residence of the period. The original house had a rectangular ground plan and occupied roughly a fourth of the 1,410-square-meter lot. There were subsequent additions and modifications. The lower part of the house or <strong>zaguan</strong> &mdash;a dungeon-type ground level floored with cut stone and originally used for storage purposes&mdash;is walled in by <strong>bituka tinabliya</strong> (stone blocks). The wooden upper frame of the house is supported by posts of roughly hewn logs. The house has a sloping roof of locally manufactured red clay tiles. The residence has the familiar features of the Spanish-era <strong>balay nga bato</strong> (stone house)&mdash;a large <strong>azotea</strong> and garden at the side of the house; a second level divided into such units as a <strong>caida</strong> (anteroom), <strong>sala</strong> (parlor), <strong>comedor</strong> (dining hall), and bedrooms; and a kitchen complex.

Renovation Architects: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2708\">Jose Zaragoza</a>, Maxwell Espina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cebu is considered the cradle of Christianity in the Philippines since the first Christian settlement was established here by the Spanish colonizers in 1565. San Vidal is the patron of the city. In 1578, seven years after Manila was declared a capital of the colony, Pope Gregory XIII created the Diocese of Manila, which encompassed the entire archipelago. On 14 Aug 1595 Manila was raised to an archdiocese and three dioceses were created as its suffragans: the Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in Cebu, Nueva Segovia in Lal-lo, Cagayan Valley, transferred to Vigan in the 18th century, and Nueva Caceres in Naga. Until 1865 the Diocese of Cebu included all the Visayan islands, Mindanao, and the Marianas. In 1934 Cebu was elevated to an archdiocese with the dioceses of Calbayog, Jaro, Zamboanga, Bacolod, and Cagayan as its suffragans. The Cebu Archdiocese is dedicated to the Santos Angeles de la Guardia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the cathedral was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">reconstructed</a> after World War II, its facade and walls go back to the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of the first church began on 10 Aug 1595. Originally made of wood, bamboo, and nipa, it was later provided with stone walls. Bishop Juan Lopez&rsquo;s report to the King of Spain in 1665 described the sorry state of the cathedral because its roof was made of nipa. The bishop appealed to the king for assistance and on 28 Oct 1670, the request was granted. The king assigned 10,000 pesos for the cathedral given in tranches over ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1689 Bp Diego de Aguilar began the construction of a larger building, but the project was discontinued for lack of funds. His successor Bp Miguel Bayot began an entirely new structure, but again this did not go far beyond the initial stage. In 1699, government architects were assigned to assess the cost of a new cathedral with master mason Juan de Ayco as head and assisted by master carpenters Jeronimo Quibon and Jacinto Caba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describing the building under construction as nothing but a barn, and finding it too small, the new bishop Sebastian de Foronda discontinued the project. In 1719 new plans were prepared by the military engineer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan de Ciscara</a> who had been summoned from Manila. Ciscara designed a large church with a wide nave and ample lateral aisles, a truncated transept, the main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a> at the transept, an <strong>altar de perdon</strong> (altar of pardon) behind the main altar, and a <strong>coro baxo</strong> or <strong>bajo</strong> (choir stalls) at the center of the nave. Two bell towers flanked the facade. While 40,000 coral blocks had been hewn and 10,000 sacks of lime prepared for the new cathedral, the project was stopped because the building was sitting on soft and wet soil. Furthermore, work on the project was suspended when funds had to be diverted to military campaigns against the Moros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction began in 1734 but was interrupted four years later. In 1741 the new bishop Protasio Cabezas ordered resumption of the work. Later Bp Lino de Espeleta appealed to the king saying that 90,000 pesos was needed to finish the cathedral. He reminded the king of the promise of previous monarchs to fund the construction. Lack of resources and labor stopped the project. It would begin again in 1784. The facade was completed in 1786. Ready for occupancy by 1811, the cathedral was consecrated. The finished building was a departure from the Ciscara plan. Major renovations were undertaken in 1829, as portions had to be demolished because it posed danger to people. In 1836 Bp Santos Gomez Mara&ntilde;on designed and built the bell tower. By 1863 repairs became necessary but were not immediately undertaken because of the government&rsquo;s unsympathetic response to the project, but two years later, the government sent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a> of the Public Works Office to draw up plans for repair and for widening the cathedral. The government allotted a sum of 66,546 escudos on 10 Dec 1865. Records indicate that the cathedral had been improved by 1886.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last Spanish bishop of Cebu, Martin Garcia Alcocer, wanted to demolish the old cathedral and build an entirely new one but the plan was overtaken by the Philippine Revolution of 1896-1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1910 to 1934, during Bp Juan Gorordo&rsquo;s administration, further improvements were made. Under his term, the cathedral was finally completed. In 1939 Cebu&rsquo;s first archbishop Gabriel Reyes initiated major renovations, among them the enlargement of windows, the installation of stained glass, and the marble finishing of the altar. The project was undertaken by Engr Gavino Unchuan and his team of architects. In 1940, the cathedral was reconsecrated by Abp Reyes on the eve of World War II. By 8 Dec 1941, the Philippines was plunged into war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1945, in the last days of World War II, the cathedral was destroyed by American bombs. Only the walls and facade survived. Architect Jose Zaragoza was commissioned to rebuild the cathedral. The reconstruction was completed in 1959 under Abp Julio Rosales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral was then renovated during the term of archbishop later cardinal Ricardo Vidal (1982-2010) by the addition of galleries along the nave to allow for more space for churchgoers. Also renovated was the sanctuary, dominated by the monogram of Jesus&rsquo;s name. A closed circuit TV system was installed for the sake of churchgoers who because of the crowd could not see the sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparation for the Diamond Jubilee of the Archdiocese of Cebu in 2009, Msgr Roberto F. Alesna and his team of six assistants went on a campaign to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restore</a> the cathedral. This involved upgrading and rewiring the electricals, replacing the termite infested wooden trusses of the roof with a steel structure and clearing the plaza of obstructions and redesigning it. The cathedral walls were cleaned and made ready for a new coat of <strong>palitada</strong> (primer). The cathedral was given a new coat of paint, new <strong>retablos</strong> based on the designs of the early 1900s. A 12-bell modern digital carillon was imported from Singapore and incorporated with older bells to make a 15-bell chime. The outer perimeter of the cathedral was enclosed in a wrought iron fence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many churches in Visayan coastal towns, the Cebu Cathedral is made of blocks of coral stone. The building is 74 m long and 18 m wide. The walls are 12.35 m high and 1.5-2.5 m thick. The facade is 21.36 m high. The two-story facade is crowned by a pediment that has been described as a trefoil. Its outline suggests rather a truncated triangular pediment with curved ends, and a central section rising and swelling into a semicircle. The focal points in the pediment are the IHS in bas-relief, and below it, an oculus or eyelike window, which is flanked by blind circular openings. The surface is richly embellished with bas-reliefs that include floral forms and a pair of Chinese griffins or&nbsp;<em>kylin</em>. The two-story portion of the facade is divided into three vertical sections. The central section is flanked by coupled columns of tall bases. Above the arched portal is a rectangular window.

On 14 Aug 1595 Manila was raised to an archdiocese and three dioceses were created as its suffragans: the Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in Cebu, Nueva Segovia in Lal-lo, Cagayan Valley, transferred to Vigan in the 18th century, and Nueva Caceres in Naga. Until 1865 the Diocese of Cebu included all the Visayan islands, Mindanao, and the Marianas.

While 40,000 coral blocks had been hewn and 10,000 sacks of lime prepared for the new cathedral, the project was stopped because the building was sitting on soft and wet soil.

Lack of resources and labor stopped the project. It would begin again in 1784. The facade was completed in 1786. Ready for occupancy by 1811, the cathedral was consecrated. The finished building was a departure from the Ciscara plan. Major renovations were undertaken in 1829, as portions had to be demolished because it posed danger to people. In 1836 Bp Santos Gomez Mara&#xF1;on designed and built the bell tower. By 1863 repairs became necessary but were not immediately undertaken because of the government&#x2019;s unsympathetic response to the project, but two years later, the government sent <a href=\"/2/2/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a> of the Public Works Office to draw up plans for repair and for widening the cathedral.

Its ornamentation was conceived mainly along the art deco style fashionable since 1925, but it was even more boldly futuristic. It was reflective of the highly cosmopolitan temperament of its architect in its use of a solid-looking, boldly sweeping curving wall in the third story that ended in a curve at the corner which concealed the flat roof. The pronounced symmetry of the widely sprawling horizontal facade, however, gave it a conservative appearance. This symmetry was the result of a heavily decorated main entrance flanked by sparely geometric, Bauhaus-style three-story office buildings that were accented by narrow art deco framing bays at the corners. The main entrance featured a three-paneled stained-glass wall, bordered by a granite frame designed along art deco lines, and flanked by another three narrow vertical bands of deep sculptural friezes that reached up to the corners of the three-story office areas. The Crystal Arcade derived its name from the famous London exhibition hall, Crystal Palace, and from the fact that it made use of wide glass panels that served as viewing windows of the stores on the first floor. It was the first shopping mall that featured a walkway leading to the glass-walled shops on the first floor. For added glitter, it was ornamented with mosaics and colored Italian marble, while granite facing gave it a sleek modern look. The Crystal Arcade was destroyed in World War II. Its site was later occupied by the Philippine National Bank. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of San Agustin. Location: Cuyo, Palawan. Built 1683, renovated 1827. Builder: Juan de Severo, OAR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1622 the parish of Cuyo was founded by the Augustinian Recollects on the island of the same name. It was their first landfall in the island district that was then known as Calamianes, and now as the province of Palawan. Sent by the Dominican Pedro Arce, bishop of Cebu, were the Recollects Francisco de San Nicolas, Diego de Santa Ana, Juan de Santo Tomas, and a lay brother Francisco de la Madre de Dios. The first church to be built in the province was that of Cuyo. Other churches were later built in towns organized by the friars: Agutaya, 1622; Taytay (on Paragua, now Palawan, island), 1622, with a fort built in 1626; Balabac, 1861; Parawan, Dumaran, and Linapacan, 1861; and Busuanga, 1868.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuyo served as the first capital of the district. A stepping stone linking the Calamianes Islands with the Visayas and Luzon, its strategic position within a transportation and trade route made it imperative that it be fortified.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1752, the Recollect provincial wrote a memorandum to the king of Spain informing him of the various hardships suffered by the missions because of slave-raiding attacks within his jurisdiction. In 1751 and 1752, pirates killed 489 Christians and ravaged the towns of Catalan, Palawan; Sabili in Maestre de Campo Island; Caolo, Sapao, and Cabonto in Siargao Island; and Bongabon, Dongon, and Basig in Mindoro. Attacks by slave-raiding bands beginning the previous century&mdash;in 1602, 1626, 1632, 1636, 1638, 1640, 1645, 1646, 1650, 1652, 1658, 1666, 1667&mdash;convinced the Recollects that it was necessary to build <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortresses</a> at the expense of their order, without any financial aid from the government. The Recollects built eight stone fortresses equipped with arms, bullets, and gunpowder in Cuyo, Agutaya, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/302\">Taytay</a>, Culion, and Linapacan in Palawan province; in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/298\">Romblon</a> and Banton islands; and in Mobo, Masbate. <strong>Maestros de campo</strong> or field chiefs, captains, lieutenants, and other officials drawn from the native population were all appointed by the crown but supervised by the parish priest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1683, the fortified church of San Agustin in Cuyo is the work of the Augustinian Recollect Juan de Severo. He was also responsible for the fortifications and churches on the islands of Agutaya and Culion, also in 1683. The next major renovation to the Cuyo fortification was in 1827 when a bell tower was built on top of one of the fort&rsquo;s bastions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cuyo fort has been variously described as quadrilateral with bastions at the corner, a stone church with stone fort and a <strong>baluarte</strong>, or a <strong>fortaleza</strong>. The plans in Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes y Tamon&rsquo;s 1738 report present the fort as a quadrilateral; most likely this is the plan as projected but not the plan as built. In fact, the fort is an irregular pentagon. Because of its military nature, the church formed one side of the fort and the <strong>convento</strong>, parallel to the church, another. Curtain walls connect these two structures. The fort&rsquo;s main entrance is through the church door, placed slightly off center of the nave&rsquo;s centerline. Atypically, the front curtain wall does not describe a straight line but comes to an apex, where there is a secondary entrance to the fort. This entrance does not lead directly into the fort but into a blind enclosure, apparently a type of trap to catch invaders off guard. A ravelin with two gates used to stand guard before the main entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bastions are found at four corners of the pentagon. The landward bastion at the gospel side of the church forms the base of a bell tower built in 1827. The remaining three bastions have <strong>garitas</strong> (guardhouses). During pirate attacks, the townspeople, who lived outside, rushed to the fort and from there waged their defense. Many dwellings were also found within the fortification walls, which have recently been <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old photographs show the convento built parallel to the nave. Records have it that the convento was renovated from 1918 to 1920. Most likely this is the present convento at the rear running perpendicular to the church. The 1922 convento was repaired and renovated in 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Lucbuan on the eastern shore of Cuyo, there is another quadrilateral fortification. Details about its construction are unknown, though it may date from the 1890s. The fort is greatly degraded and its walls are much reduced in height. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

A list that goes back to 1582 mentions Dalaguete as one of the encomiendas of Cebu. A 1599 document declares it a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/416\">Carcar</a>. The town is said to have been founded in 1711. Other sources state that it was founded in 1690 as a visita of Carcar, and elevated to a parish in 1711, with San Guillermo el Ermitano as its patron. Because of hostile attacks on the coastal towns of Cebu, the construction of watchtowers was given priority in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three watchtowers were built in Dalaguete.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A chapel of light materials must have been built when the visita was established. The construction of the present church began in 1802 under the direction of Fr Juan Chacel. A bell cast in 1805 was probably hung in a temporary bell tower. Although Fr Chacel was assigned elsewhere for two years, he returned to Dalaguete in 1818 and continued working on the church. The church was completed in Jul 1825, three months before Fr Chacel died.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>convento</strong> was built from 1832 to 1842. The belfry was constructed from 1854 to 1860. In 1860 the altar was finished with marble and the floor with tiles. Structural repairs were undertaken starting in 1868. In 1905 a silver frontal was installed at the main altar. In 1931 the roof tiles were replaced with galvanized iron sheets. In 1935, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3426\">Canuto Avila</a> of the San Nicolas district of Cebu City was commissioned to decorate the ceiling with paintings while Fr Ruperto Sarmiento was parish priest. Avila, assisted by his sons, worked on the painting for six months, from 1 Jul to 16 Dec 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is 60 m long, 18 m wide and 11 m high. The belfry is 9 m wide and about 13 m high. A one-story building connects the belfry to the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade is divided by cornices into three horizontal sections, and by thin pilasters into three vertical sections. At the apex and ends of the raking cornice are finials. The pediment is a triangle with truncated side corners. At the central section, resting on the cornice, is a decorated niche over which floats a small round window. The walls of the side sections of the pediment are unadorned. The central section of the second level of the facade has a small niche, resting on the lower cornice. On both side sections are relatively large arched windows that rest on the lower cornice. The central section of the first level of the facade is almost wholly occupied by the arched portal, which nearly touches the cornice above it. On the side sections of the first level are niches that appear to hang from the cornice above them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-story bell tower is octagonal, with arched openings and a domed roof surrounded by a balustrade. Like the bell tower of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a>, it has a mechanical clock. It has at present 10 bells, all functioning.

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Porteria. Location: Daraga, Albay. Started 1772.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daraga was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of the town of Cagsaua, which was evangelized by the Franciscan San Pedro Bautista, 1543-97, who was&nbsp;<em>custos&nbsp;</em>or provincial superior of the Franciscans in the Philippines, 1546, and later martyred in Japan with other Franciscans. In 1595 the Cagsaua settlement was established by Fr Domingo Santiago, OFM, and placed under the jurisdiction of Camalig. In 1605 Cagsaua was established as a separate town with Fr Alonso de Jadarque, OFM, as first resident minister. The town church was dedicated to Santiago Apostol. In 1636 the town was attacked by the Dutch while the townspeople were celebrating the town fiesta. The attack ruined the church, and a new wooden church was built not long afterwards. Fr Acacia de la Concepcion, OFM, built a church of stone ca 1675. In 1724 this church was demolished by Fr Francisco Blanco, OFM, who constructed a newer and bigger church with a convento adjacent to it. Threatened by their close proximity to Mayan Volcano, the Cagsawe&ntilde;os petitioned the superior government to transfer their town site. In 1771 the majority voted to transfer to Daraga rather than to Culiat, another visita of Cagsaua, because Daraga was on high ground, the farmlands of many Cagsawe&ntilde;os were near Daraga, and many had built their homes there. The petition for transfer was approved in 1772.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction of Daraga&rsquo;s church of volcanic stone began right after the request to transfer was granted. Toward this end the Cagsawe&ntilde;os, on 29 Mar 1772, requested permission to gather coral in the littoral of Albay for making lime. A year later, work on the church slackened as the mayor Fermin Zaldivar freed Budiao inhabitants from working on Daraga so they could work in Budiao where Zaldivar wanted the Cagsawe&ntilde;os to transfer. Work on the Daraga Church seems to have been sporadic as shown by the negative reaction to the project site in a report addressed to Fr Domingo Collantes, OP, bishop of Nueva Caceres (Naga), on 23 Mar 1801. Then, Fr Padre Licup, OFM tasked with heading a commission to investigate the transfer of the town site, reported that priests found the site of the church complex on a hill inconvenient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicking prevented the effective transfer of Cagsaua. By 1801 very few had transferred to Daraga. An earthquake in 1805 induced the Cagsawe&ntilde;os to move. Then, on 31 Jan 1814, tremors shook Cagsaua and surrounding towns. The following day, at 8:30 am, Mayon Volcano erupted, burying Cagsaua town and its church. Nearby Budiao was also devastated by the eruption. Eventually, the survivors of the Cagsaua and Budiao catastrophe transferred to Daraga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Daraga church and <strong>convento</strong> were completed after 1814. In 1851 the church, which had a nipa roof, was given a tile roof by Fr Vicente Lillo, OFM. He also added a story to the bell tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church apse and transept were badly damaged during World War II. The interior of Daraga has been totally renovated. Its exterior, however, is a good example of the decorated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> style favored by the Franciscans and in vogue in the Philippines from the late 18th century when church construction began, to the early 19th century. The church facade&rsquo;s vertical sweep is defined by two-story high Solomonic columns, embellished by medallions at the division between stories, and decorating the entire face of the facade. In these medallions are found reliefs of the evangelists: San Mateo, San Marcos, San Lucas, and San Juan. The bases of these salomonic columns are adorned with reliefs of cherub faces. Twin salomonic columns and niches housing santos, a number of whom are Franciscan saints, decorate the triangular pediment. Three arched entrances lead into the church; the main entrance is surmounted by a relief of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salvacion. Covered with alcoves, niches, statuary, cartouches, foliage, and bas-reliefs of cherubs, the facade is typical of the retablo facade found in other Franciscan churches. The bell tower, built at the epistle flank of the facade, is a sharp contrast in its simplicity. However, a band containing reliefs of apostles and patriarchs girding the bell tower continue the thematic decoration of the church. The church&rsquo;s right lateral portal, decorated like the facade, is flanked with salomonic columns. One has a medallion bearing the image of San Pedro and another of San Pablo. Above the entrance is a relief of the Lamb, symbolic of Christ. The decorations of the facade were also carried into the interior. However, except for two salomonic columns with medallions and an image of the Trinity, the interior is a new construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> recognized the importance of Daraga church, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">renovation</a> on the church began. By 2010 the facade was being cleaned and prepared for replastering. By 2014, the facade, the nave, and the bell tower had been <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a>. The dark lava stones, which marked out the church, were replastered with lime stucco, just as it was in the colonial era. Although those who had known Daraga as a dark black church were surprised to find a white church, restorers had all the historical warrant for their intervention. The work was not just cosmetic; it helped to prevent moisture from entering the church while bringing to sharper relief the embellishments on the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior, which had been damaged by war, was returned to its original longitudinal orientation, after the sanctuary had been transferred from its original position at the apse to the side of the nave by the early 1990s. The interior is rather plain and terminates in a new retablo that borrows decorative elements from the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elevated location of the Daraga church gives it a grandeur unsurpassed by other churches in Albay. The Mayon Volcano, in the distance, gives the church a distinctive vista. Daraga church has been given the status Level II-with Marker by the NHI on 16 Oct 2008. Five decades earlier, ruins of the Cagsaua church, from where inhabitants of Daraga were evacuated, had been given the status House of Worship Level II-with Marker by the NHI 1954. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

In 1724 this church was demolished by Fr Francisco Blanco, OFM, who constructed a newer and bigger church with a convento adjacent to it. Threatened by their close proximity to Mayan Volcano, the Cagsawe&#xF1;os petitioned the superior government to transfer their town site. In 1771 the majority voted to transfer to Daraga rather than to Culiat, another visita of Cagsaua, because Daraga was on high ground, the farmlands of many Cagsawe&#xF1;os were near Daraga, and many had built their homes there. The petition for transfer was approved in 1772."

A year later, work on the church slackened as the mayor Fermin Zaldivar freed Budiao inhabitants from working on Daraga so they could work in Budiao where Zaldivar wanted the Cagsawe&#xF1;os to transfer. Work on the Daraga Church seems to have been sporadic as shown by the negative reaction to the project site in a report addressed to Fr Domingo Collantes, OP, bishop of Nueva Caceres (Naga), on 23 Mar 1801. Then, Fr Padre Licup, OFM tasked with heading a commission to investigate the transfer of the town site, reported that priests found the site of the church complex on a hill inconvenient."

Its exterior, however, is a good example of the decorated <a href=\"/2/4/217\">baroque</a> style favored by the Franciscans and in vogue in the Philippines from the late 18th century when church construction began, to the early 19th century. The church facade&#x2019;s vertical sweep is defined by two-story high Solomonic columns, embellished by medallions at the division between stories, and decorating the entire face of the facade. In these medallions are found reliefs of the evangelists: San Mateo, San Marcos, San Lucas, and San Juan. The bases of these salomonic columns are adorned with reliefs of cherub faces. Twin salomonic columns and niches housing santos, a number of whom are Franciscan saints, decorate the triangular pediment. Three arched entrances lead into the church; the main entrance is surmounted by a relief of the Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de Salvacion. Covered with alcoves, niches, statuary, cartouches, foliage, and bas-reliefs of cherubs, the facade is typical of the retablo facade found in other Franciscan churches. The bell tower, built at the epistle flank of the facade, is a sharp contrast in its simplicity. However, a band containing reliefs of apostles and patriarchs girding the bell tower continue the thematic decoration of the church. The church&#x2019;s right lateral portal, decorated like the facade, is flanked with salomonic columns. One has a medallion bearing the image of San Pedro and another of San Pablo. Above the entrance is a relief of the Lamb, symbolic of Christ. The decorations of the facade were also carried into the interior. However, except for two salomonic columns with medallions and an image of the Trinity, the interior is a new construction."

The dark lava stones, which marked out the church, were replastered with lime stucco, just as it was in the colonial era. Although those who had known Daraga as a dark black church were surprised to find a white church, restorers had all the historical warrant for their intervention. The work was not just cosmetic; it helped to prevent moisture from entering the church while bringing to sharper relief the embellishments on the church."

Repaired in 1990 and after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dupax was organized in 1727 as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> or mission chapel of Bujay, under the patronage of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Socorro (Our Lady of Succor). Bujay was the center of a mission territory called Ituy, roughly the southern part of what is now the province of Nueva Vizcaya. Ituy had been evangelized by the Augustinians since 1717, although earlier attempts had been made by the Franciscans and Dominicans in the early 1600s. The dwellers of Ituy were known by various names. Their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> neighbors in Paniqui (northern Nueva Vizcaya, not the town in Tarlac) called them Malaat. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a> further south knew them as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2350\">Isinay</a>. But they called themselves Immeas or Inmeas. A shy people, they remember stories by their ancestors of how they were pushed from lands further north by more aggressive communities. The name Dupax is said to have been taken from the word&nbsp;<em>dopaj</em>, with the archaic Spanish &ldquo;x&rdquo; corresponding to the &ldquo;h&rdquo; of the local language, which meant &ldquo;lying down in rest, with face up and legs extended.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The region was turned over in 1740 to the Dominicans, who accepted the four missions of Bujay (now Aritao), Dupax, Bambang, and Bayombong. The first three quasi-towns comprised the Ituy Mission; the last constituted the center of the Paniqui Mission. By this time the people of Dupax were living in 150 nipa houses, surrounded by fruit trees and irrigated rice fields. The chapel of wood and light materials was repaired and improved with hardwood posts and boards. The Dominican saint Vicente Ferrer was made the new patron of Dupax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wooden chapel burned down in 1755 and again in 1766. The extant Book of Baptisms thus begins in 1767. The town was briefly linked to the national destiny as a result of the British Invasion of Manila in 1762. To prevent the silver subsidy from Acapulco from falling into enemy hands, the precious cargo was smuggled from its landing in Batangas to the mountains of Tayabas and then to Dupax before it finally reached the headquarters of the government-in-exile of Simon de Anda in Bacolor, Pampanga. Despite the two fires, the surreptitious relay of treasure, and an epidemic besides, Fr Cristobal Rodriguez OP, 1753-69, the parish priest during these stressful times, also introduced the cultivation of cacao. This brought so much income to the town that the Isinay could now pay taxes in silver where before they would offer an animal. In fact, the earnings from cacao helped raise the church and decorate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Masons and workers from Tuguegarao, whose grand church was raised in 1766, began the construction of the present church in 1774. It certainly helped that Tuguegarao&rsquo;s builder, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2669\">Fr Antonio Lobato, OP</a>, had ministered in Bujay in his younger years, 1755-59, and thus was sympathetic to the project. Brick and lime were produced locally. Work proceeded so smoothly that the church could be used in two years&rsquo; time. A brick inset over the central doorway is marked &ldquo;1776.&rdquo; Work on the church building was completed in 1782. Brick insets on the four levels of the bell tower trace its construction: 1775, 1776, 1786, and 1788.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first masonry church in the entire Ituy-Paniqui region was followed by similar ones in Aritao (begun 1780); Bambang (begun 1782, with the tower finished 1791); and Bayombong (church built ca 1773-92, with the tower completed around 1800). With Dupax, these three churches bear the obvious influence of Tuguegarao in the gracefully catenated silhouette of the pediment and in the brick insets adorning the walls, doors, and windows. A Dominican in the 1780s noted that this &ldquo;construction boom&rdquo; also inspired the building of churches in the Franciscan towns of Carranglan and Pantabangan in adjoining Nueva Ecija province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is decorated with a number of unique artworks. A baked clay statuette of San Vicente Ferrer used to grace a niche on the bell tower&rsquo;s ground level. Its head bore a strong affinity with the neolithic &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; jars found in Maitum, Saranggani Province in Mindanao. Sadly, this unique piece was stolen in 2006. Upon entering the church, one is confronted with a massive pair of carved sandstone pillars supporting the choir loft. Each pillar has a height of 13.3 ft, and a circumference of 10 ft. The carved decoration consists of clams, leaves, and vines, interspersed with tilted waffle-like medallions common in late 18th century Philippine art. To the left is the baptistry, wondrously filled with similar carving squeezed into a room measuring only 3.60 x 4.20 m. Instead of the standard <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> scene featuring St. John baptizing Christ, there is a curious figure of Christ seemingly waving a welcome to the baptismal party. The vaulted ceiling represents the Holy Spirit surrounded by rays of light, stars, and flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central and two side retablos seem to have been refashioned from surviving pieces with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> elements. Other movable art pieces are safeguarded in the <strong>convento</strong>. Among these is an indigo blanket said to be of the type traded with the Ifugao for use as funeral shrouds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento is said to have been finished in 1778. A <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>tambobo</strong></a> or rice granary of stone was added to the convento in the first decades of the 19th century, while a reception hall protruding from the front of the convento went up in 1846. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>tribunal</strong></a> (ancestor to today&rsquo;s municipal building), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>, and two <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> of brick and stone were also built by the Dominican missionaries. Fr. Antolin provided the populace with two orchards known as&nbsp;<em>comunes</em>, and is said to have introduced the cultivation of mongo, as evidenced by a patch which was called &ldquo;Antolin.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buildings were damaged by the earthquake of 1990, but were repaired under the administration of Fr Paul Bollen, CICM (1976-97). The oldest masonry church in Nueva Vizcaya, Dupax is also the most intact, with its bell tower, convento, churchyard, and incomparable Immeas stone carvings remarkably well preserved after more than two hundred years.

In the 18th century, the Sama were among the countless peoples slowly drawn into the complex economic web brought about by the British taste for Chinese tea. Very simply stated, slaves were needed for the rambling tea plantations in China, as well as for gathering seaweed and sea cucumber that could be traded with the Chinese. British merchants procured such slaves and goods through business agreements with the Sultan of Sulu, who in turn relied on his allies the Sama to supply him with these commodities. Slave raiding was more an economic than a religious activity, as clarified by Warren (2001, 24). The British even armed the slave raiders who attacked not only the Visayas, Mindanao, and other parts of the Philippines butmuch of insular Southeast Asia as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish reconnaissance reports in 1845 describe the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>kuta</strong></a> complex in Balangingi. There were four forts: Balangingi in the northern part of the island, and Sipac, Sungap, and Bucotingol in the south. All were well protected by impassable mangrove swamps and water too shallow for anything but canoes and vintas. Only insiders knew when to take advantage of the tides in navigating through the narrow canals, escaping from danger, or luring the enemy into a sudden water-swell.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort at Sipac, the largest, was typical. Two to three lines of tree trunks 1&frac12; to 2 ft in diameter were tightly lashed together to constitute meter-thick walls that in turn formed a roughly quadrangular palisaded fort. The spaces between the walls were filled with boulders, earth, and sand. The walls averaged 5 m in height. There were two levels for artillery. On the lower level, cannons peered out from truncated quadrangular pyramidal casemates, the smaller end facing the enemy. Emplaced on open-air batteries on the higher level were lighter arms such as lantaka (a type of culverin). Access to the kuta was impeded by small <strong>pozos de lobo</strong> (foxholes) and rows of finely sharpened bamboo sticks (Herbella 259-60). Inside the fort, women and children took shelter in trenches covered with mats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 13-25 Feb 1848 Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria himself led Spanish and Filipino forces in ending Balangingi slave-raiding. The four forts were burned to the ground, along with 8,000 coconut trees. Also, of the Balangingi, 450 were killed; 150 women and children were taken captive by the Spaniards; and 200 captive slaves from Indonesia and the Philippines were released. Hundreds of pieces of artillery were taken; among these, three fine lantaka and a flag from Sipac are now in the Army Museum in Toledo, Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the Balangingi captives were eventually shipped to forge new lives in tobacco plantations in faraway Isabela, Cagayan Valley. Many even assisted the local Yogad people in building the church in Camarag (now Echague). Stragglers in Balangingi reestablished themselves in Taluksangay, Zamboanga City, by the early 1900s.

Built 1635, rebuilt 1719. Architects: Melchor de Vera, SJ, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan de Ciscara</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fort Pilar was the southernmost <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> built by the Spaniards in the Philippines. The Jesuits, who had been actively evangelizing the Zamboanga coast from their residence in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/418\">Dapitan</a>, were convinced that the only way to stop marauding bands of slave raiders was to establish a military garrison on Mindanao&rsquo;s southern tip. So they prevailed upon acting Gov-Gen Juan Cerezo de Salamanca to create a presidio (garrison) of about 300 men composed of Spaniards and Pampango. In 1635 the Jesuit Melchor de Vera built a fort dedicated to San Jose. From this fortress the Jesuits went out to evangelize the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Lutao</a> (Badjao), a seafaring tribe who were vassals of the Jolo sultanate. In 1663, when Spanish troops were recalled to Manila to prepare for an impending attack by the Chinese corsair Koxinga, the Spaniards abandoned Zamboanga and the Jesuits left with them. The fort was ordered demolished to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. The Christianized Lutao were placed under the care of the Jesuits in Dapitan who came to visit them occasionally, while others left with the Jesuits and settled elsewhere in the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1666 the Jesuit Provincial Luis Pimentel began to appeal to the government to reopen the fort; it was not until 1715 that the Jesuits prevailed upon the government to reopen the Zamboanga garrison, against all the objections in Manila. From 1718 to 1768, the Jesuits returned and worked in Zamboanga. The fort was rebuilt in 1719 by Juan de Ciscara, probably hewing close to de Vera&rsquo;s plans. The fort was renamed in honor of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar de Zaragosa and its four bulwarks were named San Felipe, San Fernando, San Luis, and San Francisco Javier. In 1720 the rebuilt fort withstood Dulasi&rsquo;s attack. In 1794 Gov Juan de la Torre had a new gate built for the fort, and the image of the Virgen del Pilar was placed above the main entrance. Fort Pilar was renovated and improved during the late 19th century. New barracks, a kitchen, and a gunpowder room were added to the structure. The American General J. C. Bates, who was sent to Zamboanga, occupied the fort in 1899. It was seized by the Japanese during World War II in 1942.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort underwent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a> by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>. A restored building now houses a Marine Museum, opened in Oct 1987. The main gate over which is the image of the Virgin has been converted to a shrine for devotees of this reputedly miraculous image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is unknown if anything remains from de Vera&rsquo;s fort although <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5226\">de la Costa</a> (1961) asserts that the wall containing the venerated image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar goes back to the 17th century. The famous Philippine map of Murillo Velarde, 1734, shows, among its marginal vignettes, the location and shape of the 1719 fort&mdash;a quadrilateral structure with three quadrilateral bulwarks and a fourth one facing the sea in the shape of an ace of spades. Six of seven cannons are mounted on the bulwarks. Inside the fort are barracks, a warehouse, a well, and a chapel. Outside the fort&mdash;in another fortified area protected by a wall, palisade, and moat&mdash;are the Jesuit church and college, the residence of the governor, a hospital, and a number of houses. These structures appear to be covered with nipa. Outside the fort is the community of the Lutao. Nothing now remains of the structures outside Fort Pilar. Presumably these were perishable structures for the report of 1779 says that the church in Zamboanga was made of wood. Before World War II, this site outside was occupied by the Pettit Barracks, a camp for American soldiers. The area is known as Santa Barbara, the saint after whom a bastion at this site was named.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shrine to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar, consisting of the fort&rsquo;s former main gate and the area immediately outside the northeast walls and bastions of the fort, defined by Lustre and N.S. Valderosa Sts, was renovated recently to become more Catholic. Enclosed with a fence, statues of saints and Stations of the Cross were added. An elevated platform with cement altar was raised. In the past, the Shrine attracted Catholics, Chinese, and Muslims of various ethnicities. It was an opportunity for interreligious dialogue, which was lost with the new additions of Catholic saints. With the resurgence of Islam in southern Mindanao and the rise of Muslim groups that are more rigid, the presence of statuary (forbidden by the Bible&rsquo;s Old Testament and the Quran) is a deterrent to the Muslim visitors who used to come to this shrine of Mary, considered as saint and a religious figure in Islam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years the south and southwest flanks of the fort were derelict&mdash;a garbage dump. But with the construction of Paseo del Mar, a well-lighted and spacious public park, an unnamed perimeter road was built around the fort linking it to Lustre and N. S. Valderosa Sts. The grounds outside the wall have been cleaned and cleared of vegetation; the fort walls scrubbed clean and lighted monumentally. In the evenings, the walls of Fort Pilar have become a visual attraction best viewed from the Paseo del Mar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fort Pilar was recognized as a National Cultural Treasure through Presidential Decree No 260 of 1 Aug 1976. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

From 1718 to 1768, the Jesuits returned and worked in Zamboanga. The fort was rebuilt in 1719 by Juan de Ciscara, probably hewing close to de Vera&#x2019;s plans. The fort was renamed in honor of Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora del Pilar de Zaragosa and its four bulwarks were named San Felipe, San Fernando, San Luis, and San Francisco Javier. In 1720 the rebuilt fort withstood Dulasi&#x2019;s attack. In 1794 Gov Juan de la Torre had a new gate built for the fort, and the image of the Virgen del Pilar was placed above the main entrance. Fort Pilar was renovated and improved during the late 19th century. New barracks, a kitchen, and a gunpowder room were added to the structure. The American General J. C. Bates, who was sent to Zamboanga, occupied the fort in 1899. It was seized by the Japanese during World War II in 1942."

The famous Philippine map of Murillo Velarde, 1734, shows, among its marginal vignettes, the location and shape of the 1719 fort&#x2014;a quadrilateral structure with three quadrilateral bulwarks and a fourth one facing the sea in the shape of an ace of spades. Six of seven cannons are mounted on the bulwarks. Inside the fort are barracks, a warehouse, a well, and a chapel. Outside the fort&#x2014;in another fortified area protected by a wall, palisade, and moat&#x2014;are the Jesuit church and college, the residence of the governor, a hospital, and a number of houses. These structures appear to be covered with nipa. Outside the fort is the community of the Lutao. Nothing now remains of the structures outside Fort Pilar. Presumably these were perishable structures for the report of 1779 says that the church in Zamboanga was made of wood. Before World War II, this site outside was occupied by the Pettit Barracks, a camp for American soldiers. The area is known as Santa Barbara, the saint after whom a bastion at this site was named."

In the past, the Shrine attracted Catholics, Chinese, and Muslims of various ethnicities. It was an opportunity for interreligious dialogue, which was lost with the new additions of Catholic saints. With the resurgence of Islam in southern Mindanao and the rise of Muslim groups that are more rigid, the presence of statuary (forbidden by the Bible&#x2019;s Old Testament and the Quran) is a deterrent to the Muslim visitors who used to come to this shrine of Mary, considered as saint and a religious figure in Islam."

The location of these forts was due in part to the late arrival of the Recollects. By then the archipelago had been divided among the four orders that had come earlier, and the Recollects had to content themselves with areas neglected or on the fringe of the bigger provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1635, Romblon was turned over to the Recollects. The first missionary sent was Pedro de San Jose. That year, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was built. After a Moro raid, Fray Pedro sought assistance of &ldquo;El Padre Capit&aacute;n&rdquo; who was reported to have built two forts in Romblon. A legendary figure of this time, Fray Agustin was known for his military exploits, particularly in Mindanao where with the assistance of an army of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> warriors he kept the expansionist Maguindanao Sultanates at bay. He also built a fort in the hinterlands of Agusan, naming it San Jose.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1640 to 1650, El Padre Capit&aacute;n built forts San Andres and Santiago using coral, stone, and rubble. These forts were located on hills opposite each other flanking the poblacion. Their strategic location gave sentinels a panoramic view of the poblacion, laid out between the two hills and the bay between the hills, the only approach to Romblon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1738, the poblacion was fortified. Effectively it had three forts, which included the town&rsquo;s defensive wall, which had three bastions: the central which served as entrance and a pair of collateral bastions built against the base of the hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortifying the islands of Romblon was important, as the island proved to be a strategic point for guarding the Tablas Strait, then and even today, a passage from the south to Manila. This was a route the galleon would take when it traveled from the coast of Samar north toward Manila Bay. It was also used by slave raiders sailing north. So the defense of Romblon town and the strait was crucial for commerce and for the safety of the coastal area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fort San Andres is a quadrilateral fort with rounded bastions at the corners. Loopholes along the wall allow for the use of armament. For a long time it was in poor condition, the northern portion had collapsed and the walls were greatly degraded. Although some of the vegetation outside the curtain wall has been cleared, the structure in general is badly preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under provincial government, and presently the concern of tourism promotion, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) used the fort where its barometric and weather instruments, a generator room, and a metal electrical pole were currently built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort may have had a wooden superstructure in the center as suggested by two massive stone pillars. Within are ruined walls of quarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Access to the fort is easy because there is a road and a flight of stairs (Fort San Andres Stairway) leading to the top of the hill from the main street of the town at the foot of the hill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overlooking the poblacion, Fort Santiago located on Fort Santiago Mountain, west of San Andres, was in a more ruinous condition than Fort San Andres and overgrown with vegetation but has been cleared, even as late as 2012. Access to the fort is through Calvary Hill Road, which ends at an altar. About 25 meters from the altar are the ruins of Santiago, triangular in design, with two lower platforms at the base, which may have served as terracing for the fort. Unlike San Andres, Santiago has no evidence of any structures within the fortification, and may have served as a lookout with a rotating team of sentinels rather than as a refuge for soldiers. The site offers a clear view of Tablas Strait and two of the three entrances to Romblon Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provincial government has initiated clearing the site and removing vegetation that covers the fort from view. Built mostly of coral rubble with some cut stones, the structure may have had parapets, but in its advanced state of deterioration the structure&rsquo;s plan and elevation are difficult to visualize. It is possible that Santiago is not a fully developed fort but a gun emplacement and a lookout to complement Fort San Andres. From the ruins is a clear view of the church bell tower below, which suggests that the fort served as a warning system in conjunction with the tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> declared the forts Important Cultural Property and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a> tagged it a priority project for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

About 25 meters from the altar are the ruins of Santiago, triangular in design, with two lower platforms at the base, which may have served as terracing for the fort.

		"text": "<p>Location: Cavite City. Fuerza de San Felipe, 1609, expanded 1628, rebuilding and remodeling 1636, 1650, 18th century. Builder: Military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1591, Gov G&oacute;mez P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as recognized the strategic importance of Cavite as the entrance to the city and moved toward its fortification. It was, in fact, at this isthmus, two decades earlier, that Miguel Lopez de Legazpi hid his ships prior to the attack on Manila. The king ordered the construction of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> but, for lack of funds and personnel, it was planned on a small scale. Work began in 1609 and continued to the following year. Storerooms for artillery and fittings of the galleons were kept in the fort. In 1628, news of the impending attack by the Dutch compelled Gov-Gen Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora to call a council of war that decided to build a bigger fort with four cavaliers and embankments, enough for a contingent of 200. The fort was constructed of stone near the beach so that one side jutted out to the docks.On the opposite side, a redoubt was built, and connected to the fort by a palisade and a covered walkway to defend the landward side of the fort. Beside the redoubt, Gov-Gen de Tavora built an earth esplanade facing the entrance of the port and equipped it with cannons.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Then followed decades when improvements on Cavite&rsquo;s fortifications drained the royal coffers, as there was no one competent in military architecture. For instance, a bastion was built in 1636 but had to be reinforced in 1650 because it was badly made. Gov-Gen Diego Fajardo had to order the construction of a palisade surrounding the fort as it was in a bad state, but he could not commit funds for construction. In 1659, a royal decree ordered a full report on the fortification of Manila and Gov-Gen Sabiniano Manrique de Lara complied in a report of 19 Jun. This is the first documentary report, which gives a full description of the fortification. The report states that San Felipe was built between 1609-16, under Gov-Gen Juan de Silva. It was quadrilateral in form, with four corner bastions, and had a perimeter of 220 ft. It was built to face the Cavite port and Manila. Furthermore, a cube or platform named Santa Catalina Martyr, large enough for 10 cannons, was nearby. At the most narrow part of this isthmus was an 80-foot wide moat separating the burgeoning town of Cavite. Protecting the moat were two 30-foot round platforms with a diameter of 80 ft, connected by a curtain wall 30 ft high and 8 ft thick. Between the wall and the moat was a barbican 30 ft wide.The northern platform was named Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Concepci&oacute;n and the opposite Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario. From the Concepci&oacute;n ran a span of wall 247 ft long and one fathom tall and reached the church of the Jesuits. In between the Concepci&oacute;n and the church was another platform. Facing San Felipe were the ruins of the Casa Real which had another low platform for eight cannons. However, it was in a bad state and had to be repaired. The wall continued for a total of 4,230 ft, enclosing the town and the churches and convents of San Francisco, Santo Domingo, the Jesuit church of Loreto, and the Recollect church of San Nicolas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manrique de Lara&rsquo;s report was forwarded to Spain where the opinion of the Dutchman Ricardo Carr was sought. Although he was Spain&rsquo;s prisoner and incarcerated in Madrid, he was knowledgeable about Cavite. Carr&rsquo;s plans were scrutinized by others, namely, Juan de Somovilla, Fuentes Cortes, and Juan de Pere&ntilde;a. Neither the plans of Carr nor of Somovilla were fully implemented; rather, elements from the plans were realized as resources allowed. Manrique de Lara reported in Aug 1663 that a cavalier with a capacity of 10 canons was built above the gate of San Felipe. The platform of Santa Catalina was completed. Ninety-one feet from the Concepcion platform, another platform 40 ft in diameter, named San Sabiniano, had been constructed and between this and the Santa Catalina a wooden platform was raised completing the fortification of the northern flank. At the shore and 222 ft from San Felipe, another stone platform was completed, and still another one but of wood, named San Jose. The area was enclosed by a palisade, revellins, and covered walkways. A moat completed the defenses of Cavite Puerto and San Felipe. But all these works needed the demolition of four churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manrique de Lara&rsquo;s successor, Gabriel de Curuzelaegui, ordered an inspection of the fortifications and noted what needed to be repaired, in particular the ruined living quarters of San Felipe.&nbsp;Furthermore, the sea was advancing and flooding the port, making it necessary to build a breakwater of wooden trunks. The sea would always remain a problem for the next century to come. Cavite Puerto was built on a low sandbar, whose unstable substrate was subject to the action of wind and wave. Military engineers would have to contend with this environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 5 Oct 1687, an earthquake destroyed the royal warehouse, the docks, and the living quarters of San Felipe. When Gov-Gen Fausto Cruzat y G&oacute;ngora assumed office, he ordered the gathering of material for the necessary works in Cavite and further ordered in 1695 a report on the status of Cavite.The report emphasized the destructive nature of the sea and sought to contain it. In Cruzat y G&oacute;ngora&rsquo;s time, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granary</a> called <strong>tambobo de arroz</strong> had been raised in San Felipe, as well as a vaulted chamber for gunpowder. At the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, a new tower of stone and brick was built. Other works were done, but the governor-general emphasized the importance of finding more permanent and less costly solutions to contain the advance of the sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The encroaching sea remained a major problem.This was the period when the government could avail of the expertise of military engineers and architects who had come from Europe, namely <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan de Ciscara</a>, Miguel Antonio Gomez, T&oacute;mas de Castro y Andrade, and the Theatine priest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2654\">Juan de Uguccioni</a>, who had rebuilt the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila cathedral</a> in 1711. This was a period of rapid and effective construction. Ciscara completed his work in Cavite in 1710. During the interim in 1745 when, Francisco de la Arechederra, bishop of Vigan, assumed governorship, the threat of attack by the British was in the air, so the covered walkway between Puerta Vaga and the Baluarte de San Juan were repaired. The bishop also added another <strong>baluarte</strong> (fort).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British&rsquo;s successful possession of Manila from 1762 to 1764 called for better fortifications in Cavite. The sea continued its erosion of the sandbar. Castro was called to offer his expertise and, in 1765, made a report regarding the ruinous state of the northern flank of the port, and the poor condition of the antiquated fortification San Felipe. Under Gov-Gen Jose Razon, the engineer Feliciano Marquez made another set of recommendations and plans submitted in 1766. The Marquez plan involved the total demolition of San Felipe and the construction of an irregular-shaped bastioned fort at the tip of the peninsula separated from Puerto by a moat. The plan was never executed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Gov-Gen Jose Basco y Vargas assumed office, he had plans made by the engineer Tom&aacute;s Sanz, who submitted a report dated 16 Dec 1778. The report stated the danger posed by rising groundwater because of the close proximity of structures to the sea, as had been the problem for decades. It continued to show the most rapid deterioration of structures. Like previous plans, Sanz&rsquo;s recommendations, although thorough, were not fully implemented. To make matters worse, a typhoon hit Cavite, destroying practically all the wall surrounding the northern part of the fortification. All told, as the century dragged to a close, work on Cavite&rsquo;s fortifications was dismal. Lack of decision, lack of funds, compromise, and plain bureaucratic dillydallying resulted in an enormous waste of time making recommendations and proposing projects that, by and large, were not implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 19th century, Cavite lost its prominence with the demise of the galleon trade in 1815 and the cutting of economic ties with Mexico in 1819 when the last of the&nbsp;<em>situado&nbsp;</em>(silver subsidy) arrived from Mexico. In the 19th century, Spain built other ports of call, like San Esteban in the Ilocos, Sual in Pangasinan, Iloilo and Cebu in the Visayas, and Zamboanga in Mindanao. With the opening of trade to other nations in 1848, Spain set the Philippines on a new course of commerce. Trading houses opened in the Chinese enclave of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>. Here British and Americans established trading houses. Improvement in transportation also meant shorter travel time and heavier traffic in sea going vessels. The banks of the Pasig along Binondo developed as a docking area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1872, the workers in the naval base of Cavite rose up in revolt. The revolt was quickly quelled but blame was put on local leaders and the priests Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez, and Jacinto Zamora as the instigators of the uprising. Among those arrested, some were executed at Bagumbayan, while others who were judged to be less culpable were exiled. But the execution of the 13 martyrs of Cavite and of the three priests collectively known as Gomburza, who were perceived as innocent and whom the archbishop of Manila refused to defrock amidst all the pressure put on him, planted the seed of revolt which was to flower in the 1896 Revolution against Spain. Cavite province played a key role in the revolution because it was in Kawit, across the bay from Cavite Puerto, that Gen Emilio Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence on 12 Jun 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revolution against Spain was quickly aborted. Using the Spanish-American War as an excuse, the United States sent a flotilla of warships to Manila to besiege it. The defeat of the Spanish navy in Manila Bay proved to be the beginning of a new era of colonization. The United States laid claim on the Philippines by virtue of the Treaty of Paris (10 Dec 1898). Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States. But the Filipinos fought for their independence from 1899 to 1907. Assuming sovereignty over the Philippine Islands, the US military took over Fort San Felipe and the neighboring fortified town of Cavite Puerto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort was planned as an irregular quadrilateral and has four bastions with orillons at each corner. Various maps (e.g., 1639, 1738) represent the fort&rsquo;s bastions as having orillons; however, remaining physical evidence indicates that the fort&rsquo;s bastions were of the more advanced, straight-wall type rather than the more traditional ace-of-spades layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, only the facade and main entrance with flanking curtain walls and two bastions remain. The rest of the fort was demolished by the Americans during the early 20th century to make way for a naval station. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

This was a period of rapid and effective construction. Ciscara completed his work in Cavite in 1710. During the interim in 1745 when, Francisco de la Arechederra, bishop of Vigan, assumed governorship, the threat of attack by the British was in the air, so the covered walkway between Puerta Vaga and the Baluarte de San Juan were repaired.

Under Gov-Gen Jose Razon, the engineer Feliciano Marquez made another set of recommendations and plans submitted in 1766.

It continued to show the most rapid deterioration of structures. Like previous plans, Sanz&#x2019;s recommendations, although thorough, were not fully implemented. To make matters worse, a typhoon hit Cavite, destroying practically all the wall surrounding the northern part of the fortification. All told, as the century dragged to a close, work on Cavite&#x2019;s fortifications was dismal.

In the 19th century, Spain built other ports of call, like San Esteban in the Ilocos, Sual in Pangasinan, Iloilo and Cebu in the Visayas, and Zamboanga in Mindanao. With the opening of trade to other nations in 1848, Spain set the Philippines on a new course of commerce. Trading houses opened in the Chinese enclave of <a href=\"/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>.

But the execution of the 13 martyrs of Cavite and of the three priests collectively known as Gomburza, who were perceived as innocent and whom the archbishop of Manila refused to defrock amidst all the pressure put on him, planted the seed of revolt which was to flower in the 1896 Revolution against Spain.

Construction said to have begun in 1626, under Fray Agustin de San Pedro; reinforced ca 1717-19 by Fernando V&eacute;lez de Arce and ca 1738.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Augustinian Recollects established a mission in Taytay, an enclave along the coast of northern Palawan, in 1623. A <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> was first built here three years after, in 1626, by Fray Agustin de San Pedro, OAR. However, the friar&rsquo;s fortification was apparently a palisade, and it is uncertain whether a more permanent structure was built. Whatever the case, by the first quarter of the 18th century Fray Agustin&rsquo;s fort was in a bad state and had been abandoned. Taytay&rsquo;s close proximity to Borneo, being in the track of both merchant ships under other Europeans and the vessels of seafaring pirates, prompted Gov-Gen Fernando Manuel de Bustillos to rebuild the fort. Around the years 1713 to 1719, Fernando V&eacute;lez de Arce was appointed as the castle chief because of his expertise in building fortifications gained at the public academy of Barcelona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1725, the Marques de Torrecampo, the successor of Bustillos, reported that Taytay was fortified by a palisade and recommended that a stone structure be built in response to the request of the&nbsp;<em>alcalde mayor&nbsp;</em>(provincial governor) of Calamianes (ancestor of today&rsquo;s Palawan province) who had called together a council of war. In Oct 1726, work had progressed to the point that the wall facing the town was completed. The castle master Juan Antonio de la Torre suggested the demolition of the redoubt called &ldquo;La Retirada&rdquo; and suggested the building of a <strong>garita</strong> (guard house) at the shore as a guide and protection for ships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years later, the new alcalde mayor Benito Llanes y Cienfuegos reported that the fortification was on a rock but was indefensible as it was of poor quality material. He suggested that the fortification be built elsewhere rather than waste resources on repairs, and that the demolished redoubt La Retirada be rebuilt. The central government sent the engineer Tom&aacute;s de Castro to survey the area and submit his recommendations. De Castro wrote that building a new fort of a much better and more adequate design was the preferred option. However, he was instructed to do some repairs on the fort before such an undertaking (Diaz-Trechuelo 1959, 375-78).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, in the fort&rsquo;s plan included in the 1738 Valdes y Tamon report, sections were indicated as already being made of stone, others of timber, while still others were being planned. It seems that de Castro&rsquo;s recommendation to build a completely new structure was not followed or rather that he was ordered to continue the reconstruction because a memorial stone on the inner side of the curtain wall indicates that de Castro was responsible for rebuilding the Taytay fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Described as a <strong>fuerza</strong>, Santa Isabel is built on a rocky islet a few hundred meters from the shore beside the sea. Planned as an irregular quadrilateral, whose perimeter followed the contour of the rock on which it is built, the fort has a seaward side curtain wall that is curved rather than straight. Bastions are found at each corner of the irregular plan, named, Santo Torribio, San Miguel, San Juan, and Santa Isabel. Garitas are strategically located.A ruined chapel is in the center of the plan. Some structures below ground are visible but their functions are uncertain. They may be the structures described in the 1738 report as storehouses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being well built, the fort was vulnerable to an attack from a hill on the shore which afforded an unobstructed view of it, and it was indeed attacked from this direction in 1734. The hill was subsequently ordered to be leveled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort&rsquo;s 1738 plan indicates barracks for the soldiers, a storehouse for supplies, a storehouse for gunpowder and weapons, and a common kitchen, but does not indicate where the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> and <strong>convento</strong> were located. The last two were probably in the poblacion on the shore across the fort. A 650-foot causeway linked the mainland and the fortified rock. At high tide, this path was submerged and the fort was isolated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Landor (1904, 111-12) describes Taytay and identifies the underground structures as &ldquo;dungeons,&rdquo; although he may have been mistaken. Landor writes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fort, which could accommodate six or seven hundred soldiers, was constructed on a high rock projecting into the sea and connected with the land by an artificial causeway. There was a passage with steps, and an incline by which the summit of the church could be reached some 35 or 40 ft above the sea level. By the side of this incline were two dungeons, now roofless. In former times these dungeons had only one small aperture to give light and air to both chambers. On the opposite (east) side of the entrance-gate was a large cistern with a fountain at the lower portion. The fort was one of the finest on Palawan Island, and had four bastions, those overlooking the sea to the north being semicircular, whereas the other two were angular. For its day it possessed some powerful iron artillery, such as one long five-inch piece dated 1812, and two four-inch (1823) cannons. A great number of one-pound bullets were used as&nbsp;<em>mitraille&nbsp;</em>in the big guns; possibly smaller guns were in those times mounted upon the wall; or maybe it was ammunition fired at the fort by the Moro&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">lantacas</a>&nbsp;</em>(brass cannon) in some attacks. The inside of the fort was at a slope, the north part being filled up to within five feet of the top of the wall. The two east turrets were reached by an incline, and a path was built all around the top of the castellated wall. The actual stone outer wall was no more than thirty inches wide, but it was filled with earth and thus made of great strength. The only building inside, which was formerly a chapel with two bamboo annexes, is now used as barracks for the constabulary force of seventeen men. The fort measures some forty paces square, and its walls was were about forty-two feet high and vertical, except corner bastions at a slant, with a&nbsp;<em>cornichon&nbsp;</em>twenty feet above the ground all round.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort was partially <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> by the local government, its environs <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscaped</a>, and then used as a park. The chapel in the middle of the fort was cleaned and consolidated and roofed with a temporary structure of metal and PVC roofing. As of 2016, the Taytay fort is being considered for declaration by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> as an Important Cultural Property and has been placed under the supervision of the National Museum. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

There was a passage with steps, and an incline by which the summit of the church could be reached some 35 or 40 ft above the sea level. By the side of this incline were two dungeons, now roofless. In former times these dungeons had only one small aperture to give light and air to both chambers. On the opposite (east) side of the entrance-gate was a large cistern with a fountain at the lower portion. The fort was one of the finest on Palawan Island, and had four bastions, those overlooking the sea to the north being semicircular, whereas the other two were angular. For its day it possessed some powerful iron artillery, such as one long five-inch piece dated 1812, and two four-inch (1823) cannons. A great number of one-pound bullets were used as&#xA0;<em>mitraille&#xA0;</em>in the big guns; possibly smaller guns were in those times mounted upon the wall; or maybe it was ammunition fired at the fort by the Moro&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/3/15/2107\">lantacas</a>&#xA0;</em>(brass cannon) in some attacks. The inside of the fort was at a slope, the north part being filled up to within five feet of the top of the wall. The two east turrets were reached by an incline, and a path was built all around the top of the castellated wall. The actual stone outer wall was no more than thirty inches wide, but it was filled with earth and thus made of great strength. The only building inside, which was formerly a chapel with two bamboo annexes, is now used as barracks for the constabulary force of seventeen men. The fort measures some forty paces square, and its walls was were about forty-two feet high and vertical, except corner bastions at a slant, with a&#xA0;<em>cornichon&#xA0;</em>twenty feet above the ground all round.&#x201D;"

Begun 1591.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built on the site of Raja Sulayman&rsquo;s old palisade, the earliest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> built here in 1571 by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi was one of wood. For many years thereafter, this fort and one of stone, called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, built to its south between 1585 and 1587, constituted the two strongholds of the City of Manila. Gov-Gen Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, who began constructing the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">walls of Manila</a>, ordered the demolition of the wooden fort and the construction of one in stone. Work began in 1591.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort was improved during the incumbency of Gov-Gen Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, as part of the preparations for the expected attack of the Chinese pirate Koxinga. The flanks of the bulwarks were strengthened with new masonry, platforms and earthwork tiled, the fort&rsquo;s walls repaired, and parapets added. A platform, the San Miguel, on which cannons were mounted, was constructed at the fort&rsquo;s apex facing the sea and commanding the river mouth. The platform was protected by a wall. A passage through the platform afforded a view of the sea and served as a good place for target practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1685, Gov-Gen Gabriel de Curuzelaegui ordered the reconstruction of two bulwarks: San Juan Crisostomo, which commanded the river, and San Gregorio, which commanded the sea. Both had been ordered demolished by Gov-Gen Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, 1635-44. He also ordered the construction of a moat to separate the fort from the rest of the city, and a drawbridge with a protecting ravelin. During his term as interim governor, Alonso de Abella Fuentes secured permission to transfer the Royal storehouse elsewhere. Under Gov-Gen Fausto Cruzat y Gongora, new barracks were constructed, as the quarters built by his predecessors were inadequate. He also had the bulwarks and curtain walls tiled and improved the moat, which was inundated when the tides were high but was otherwise dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first quarter of the 18th century, the barracks constructed by Abella Fuentes were in disrepair. Plans for a new barracks, with a flat roof to serve as platforms for soldiers, were proposed in 1713; nothing was done until 1716. Quarters for the commander of the fort and the chaplain were also constructed. A sketch done in 1714 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan de Ciscara</a> illustrates the fort during this time. A semicircular platform (now renamed San Jose) was the same one constructed by Manrique de Lara. Behind it were the bulwark of Santa Barbara and its ramps, the storehouse for munitions, a small garden, the house of the fort commander&rsquo;s house, and barracks. The moat separating the fort from the city stands before the bulwarks of San Miguel (formerly San Gregorio) and San Francisco (formerly San Juan Crisostomo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the Spanish period, the fort achieved notoriety as a place of imprisonment and torture for &ldquo;enemies of the state.&rdquo; Most prominent of the Filipinos imprisoned in Fort Santiago was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, who upon his arrest in 1896 was shipped back to Manila and imprisoned in one of the cells of the Fort. It was here where he wrote his <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\">&ldquo;Mi Ultimo Adios&rdquo;</a> (My Last Farewell) and from here that he walked to his execution in nearby Bagumbayan (now Luneta) in the early morning of 30 Dec 1896. During the Pacific War, the Japanese used the Fort as their jail and torture chambers. Hundreds of Filipinos, including Josefa Llanes Escoda and her husband Antonio Escoda, are believed to have been executed in the Fort. Bombed and partly destroyed by Americans in 1945, the Fort was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> in stages, first the walls and dungeons, then offices and barracks. The gate destroyed during the war was restored, the bas-relief of Santiago on a horse was recreated by Paete artists. In the course of archaeological excavations in the area and in Plaza Moriones, once used for military drills, an old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridge</a> located slightly to the west of the entrance was discovered. It was then decided to revive the moat that once separated Fort Santiago from the rest of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In time for the centennial of Jose Rizal&rsquo;s birth, a building beside the western wall was restored and made into a shrine-museum to honor Rizal. Here Rizal memorabilia, paintings, and a life-size diorama were assembled. This building was chosen for restoration because it was the least damaged from the war. Visitors often misidentified this building as the site of Rizal&rsquo;s incarceration. He was jailed in the building across the shrine, near the Pasig. That building was left partially ruined. Another building adjoining Rizal&rsquo;s place of incarceration was made an open-air theater named Dulaang Raha Sulayman. It became the home for almost four decades of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, founded in 1967 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2977\">Cecile Guidote-Alvarez</a>. Its unique T-shaped stage influenced the aesthetics of PETA. To this theater many fans and followers went to watch performances of PETA until 2006 when it moved to a new home, the PETA Theater Center in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plaza Moriones, the area immediately south of Fort Santiago, has often been mistakenly associated by visitors with the fort because an antique wrought iron gate, originally from the Madrigal residence, was set up as a perimeter along Santa Lucia St, together with a ticketed entrance booth for tourists. In colonial times, the plaza had an auxiliary building for the fort. Here the Artilleria de Maestranza, the fort&rsquo;s foundry and successor of the Fundici&oacute;n, an earlier foundry beside Bastion San Diego, was built to one side of the plaza. The area was an open archaeological site until it was converted into a bamboo garden. Adjoining this site was where the Royal Chapel of the Incarnation used to stand; its space is now occupied by offices and toilets. The ruined building of the Reales Almacenes, the warehouse for goods to be shipped to Acapulco, beside the Pasig, was converted into a venue for cultural and social events and exhibitions. The Intramuros Visitors&rsquo; Center was built in the section of the wall beside the Baluartillo de San Francisco Javier. Immediately outside the Baluartillo was the Reducto de San Francisco, now converted to a shrine to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guadalupe, patroness of Mexico and the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work on maintaining, repairing, and restoring the Fort Santiago and its environs continues.

The facade has 10 bays, each consisting of an arch on the ground floor, and a window set between wooden panels on the second floor. The wooden second floor extends beyond the stone walls of the first floor to form a U-shaped porch on the first floor. The projecting second floor is supported by slender steel columns with cusped arches, which form the boundary of the porch. A cusped arch has curved or leaf-like ornaments at regular intervals on its inner side, making it appear like a multi-foil arch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two central bays of both the second floor and the first floor porch project slightly beyond the facade to form a sheltered entrance. The gable and a flat overhang over this section resemble a pediment. Behind this focal point of the facade is a small third-story tower, providing vertical emphasis. The windows, each with a <strong>ventanilla</strong> or window shutters, are separated from each other by wooden panels. The front wall of the ground floor has three doors evenly spaced. The steel columns and arches were made in Belgium. The ground floor porch and interior have a floor of black and white tiles in chessboard pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The cusped arches of the porch are repeated in wood in the interior, in the ground floor and second floor hallways, and in the <strong>volada</strong> (gallery) of the sala on the second floor. A wide corridor connects the entrance to a grand stairway set deep in the interior. The stairway is of the imperial type&mdash;a wide single flight rising to a landing, then splitting into two flights that make a 180-degree turn at the landing as they continue to the second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long sala with its volada along the front and side windows, and the staircase, with its surrounding arcade, are elegant examples of space surrounded by space.

The facade has 10 bays, each consisting of an arch on the ground floor, and a window set between wooden panels on the second floor. The wooden second floor extends beyond the stone walls of the first floor to form a U-shaped porch on the first floor. The projecting second floor is supported by slender steel columns with cusped arches, which form the boundary of the porch. A cusped arch has curved or leaf-like ornaments at regular intervals on its inner side, making it appear like a multi-foil arch."

The gable and a flat overhang over this section resemble a pediment. Behind this focal point of the facade is a small third-story tower, providing vertical emphasis. The windows, each with a <strong>ventanilla</strong> or window shutters, are separated from each other by wooden panels. The front wall of the ground floor has three doors evenly spaced. The steel columns and arches were made in Belgium. The ground floor porch and interior have a floor of black and white tiles in chessboard pattern."

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish of Inmaculada Concepcion. Location: Guiuan, Eastern Samar. Built most likely 1718, repaired and renovated 1844, also 1935. Ruined 7 Nov 2013 by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Augustinians may have visited Guiuan and preached Christianity in 1585, 10 years before the Jesuits took charge of Samar, following the decree of 1595 demarcating mission areas and designating specific religious orders to each. The arrival of the Jesuits is also mentioned in Huerta&rsquo;s catalogue of Franciscan parishes in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Samar, the Jesuits made their first landfall in Tinagon, present-day Barangay Dap-dap in Taragnan and from there spread throughout the island. Guiuan, on Samar&rsquo;s southern coast, however, was easier to reach through Leyte so at one time it fell under Leyte, although by 1768 it was administratively under the Palapag residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Guiuan was developed as an important way point in the galleon&rsquo;s route; it was an emergency docking area and a provisioning point before the galleon set across the Pacific or as a rest area after the long crossing from Mexico. By the mid&ndash;1600s, the church was fortified. The Jesuit Jose Delgado (1697-1755) describes the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortification</a> walls as quadrilateral with bastions at the corners and considered the fort the second best south of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1700s, Guiuan had a considerable Chinese community, proof of its active engagement in trade. It may have had a stone church by then or at least a church of wood and tiles. In 1718, Murillo Velarde says, a more permanent structure was built. But that church burned down later. However, in 1740, Delgado describes the church as single-naved and reports that it was in good condition, indicating the church must have been repaired after the fire mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1768, Guiuan and other southern Samar missions were turned over to the Augustinians who were given spiritual charge of Leyte. In 1795, unable to meet the demands for personnel, the Augustinians ceded Guiuan to the Franciscans. But, for nine years, the Franciscans could not supply any resident pastor. Then, in 1804, the first Franciscan missionary Fray Miguel P&eacute;rez arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1844 and following, the church was renovated, and the roof covered with tiles at the initiative of Frays Manuel Valverde and Pedro Monasterio. Fray Monasterio, parish priest in 1844-45 and 1853-59, added the transepts to the church transforming it to a cruciform. Huerta describes the parochial house as made of stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it was no longer functional for defense, the fortification&rsquo;s southern bastion became the site of a bell tower in 1854. The Jesuits had not built a bell tower but rather kept the bell within the fortification where it served liturgical functions and doubled as a warning device to warn of sea-borne attacks. The Jesuits had a modest <strong>convento</strong>, built behind the church sanctuary, an extension of the sacristy. In 1872, Franciscan Fray Arsenio Figueroa built another convento for which he demolished part of the western curtain wall. After 1886, Fray Fernando Esteban (parish priest 1888-97) replaced the church&rsquo;s tile roof with zinc sheets. He also built two schools. In 1935, Guiuan church was refurbished while Msgr Donato Guimbaolibot was pastor. Guimbaolibot was parish priest of Balangiga when the American soldiers were attacked by Katipunero. Although the monsignor was not involved in the plot, he was arrested and severely tortured. In 1903, he was assigned to Guiuan, his hometown, and remained parish priest there until he died in 1949.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1987, the church sanctuary was renovated. On 7 Nov 2014, Guiuan suffered major destruction when super typhoon Yolanda blew off its roof, toppled half of its facade, and damaged the main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> of the church. The restoration of the church was completed in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guiuan fort is partially preserved.

The Jesuits had not built a bell tower but rather kept the bell within the fortification where it served liturgical functions and doubled as a warning device to warn of sea-borne attacks. The Jesuits had a modest <strong>convento</strong>, built behind the church sanctuary, an extension of the sacristy. In 1872, Franciscan Fray Arsenio Figueroa built another convento for which he demolished part of the western curtain wall. After 1886, Fray Fernando Esteban (parish priest 1888-97) replaced the church&#x2019;s tile roof with zinc sheets. He also built two schools. In 1935, Guiuan church was refurbished while Msgr Donato Guimbaolibot was pastor. Guimbaolibot was parish priest of Balangiga when the American soldiers were attacked by Katipunero. Although the monsignor was not involved in the plot, he was arrested and severely tortured. In 1903, he was assigned to Guiuan, his hometown, and remained parish priest there until he died in 1949."

Established as a Casa de Clerigos in the 18th century by the bank of the Naga River, presently, Calle Caceres, the building was transformed into a seminary by Fr Antonio de Orbigo y Gallego, OFM, bishop of Naga in 1778-88, who was moved to Manila in 1788. Responsible for the seminary&rsquo;s construction, he built a 27-varas-long quadrilateral structure whose facade, first story, and arched supports of the second story were completed in Apr 1783. A few months later, he reported that the seminary was partially covered with a tile roof. Bricks were used in the construction since no suitable stones were available. With the buildings complete, the seminary was officially established in 1797.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The seminary&rsquo;s site by the banks of the river was a problem. Annually, the river would rise and the seminary would flood. The cathedral near it was likewise subject to annual flooding. Fr Bernardo de la Concepcion, bishop of Naga from 1816 to 1829, decided to move the seminary and cathedral to their present site. He commenced building a new seminary, expanding its original plan by adding a wing. He rebuilt the seminary using cut stones, the same material he used for the cathedral and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">episcopal palace</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typhoon in 1856 and a fire in 1860 damaged the seminary building and this was subsequently repaired. However, Bp Francisco Gainza (1818&ndash;1879), bishop from 1862 to 1879, considered the damage severe and decided to construct another building, the present one beside the cathedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the invitation of Gainza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5587\">Mariano Perfecto</a> (1853&ndash;1913) established a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1564\">press</a> within the seminary.

He became governor of Camarines Norte and Sur, 1910-12. Named Libreria y Imprenta Mariana, this press was to publish many works in Bicol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1865, at the invitation of Gainza, the Padres Paules or Vincentian Fathers took charge of the seminary. Founded by St Vincent de Paul in France, the Vincentians spread to Spain. In 1862 they were sent to the Philippines to work for the formation of the clergy. The Vicentians immediately went to work to repair and expand the seminary buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, the seminary was renamed Seminario del Santisimo Rosario. Spared during World War II from destruction, the seminary reopened after the war. In 1964, the seminary was renamed Holy Rosary Minor Seminary. In 1997, it celebrated the bicentennial of its canonical establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present the seminary is an L-shaped structure to which new wings have been added. The pleasing arches of the first floor form a portico in front of the rooms. The main entrance, placed at the center of this structure, leads to a foyer paved with&nbsp;<em>azulejos&nbsp;</em>(glazed tiles). The second floor rooms are accessible through a flight of stairs, decorated with old paintings. The wing that projects from the main structure has classrooms on the first floor and residences on the second. The seminary building is the only surviving one of its kind, as the Seminario de San Carlos in Cebu; the Seminario de Vigan; and the old seminaries in Manila, San Jose and San Clemente, no longer stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Museo Arqueologico and the Museo Ecclesiastico have been established on the ground floor of the seminary. The archaeological section displays artifacts excavated in Bicol from the Ermelo M.

The rest of the seminary has been restored. A chapel for seminarians on the upper story of the main wing has been refurbished and renovated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seminary was an influential institution in southern Luzon as it was the only institution of learning south of Manila until 1872, when the Colegio de Santa Isabel, established earlier by Bp Gainza as an exclusive girls&rsquo; school, was made a training school for teachers.

Built 1591-1862.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important historical landmark of Manila, the walls of Intramuros, are located on the southern bank of the Pasig, near its mouth. Laid out as an irregular pentagon and 3.7 km long, they enclose the five square kilometers of Spanish colonial Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area around present-day <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> was the first to be fortified. On this site stood Raja Soliman&rsquo;s palisade, which Miguel Lopez de Legazpi occupied in 1571, after Soliman fled before the Spaniard&rsquo;s superior arms. Under Legazpi&rsquo;s successor Guido de Lavezaris, Manila prepared for an attack by the Chinese pirate Limahong. In Sep 1574 a makeshift wall of wood, stakes, and boxes and barrels packed with sand was laid, extending from Fort Santiago southward to roughly where the Bastion de San Diego would be built. After successfully repulsing the Chinese, Lavezaris began surrounding the city with a palisade, completed in 1577 by the new governor-general Francisco de Sande.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Gov-Gen Santiago de Vera, 1584-90, a stone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> designed by the Jesuit <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a> was built on the southern side of the city facing the hermitage of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia in Ermita, described by de Vera as a stone tower on the seashore. While under construction, however, the tower was ruined and had to be reinforced by culverins that served as buttresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov-Gen Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, 1590-93, did the most to fortify Manila, reducing the old fort to a more convenient shape and joining it to a curtain wall. Work on a wall of masonry began in 1590. During the terms of Gov-Gen Francisco Tello (1596-1602) and Pedro Bravo de Acu&ntilde;a (1602-06), the walls of the entire fort were raised and damages were repaired. The first Chinese invasion of 1603 proved that the city was not impregnable. Dutch threats around the same time prompted Gov-Gen Alfonso Fajardo de Tenza, 1618-24, to have moats dug along the eastern side of the walls. Later lengthened and deepened to about 60 m wide and 3 m deep, they were meant to serve as alternate waterways should enemy forces block the river mouth. The ditch dug earlier under de Vera, and never completed, is not to be confused with the moat.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov-Gen Hurtado de Corcuera, 1635-44, also had moats dug and bulwarks and covered walkways built. Gov-Gen Diego Fajardo, 1644-53, sensing that the city was most vulnerable from the land side, had the stretch of curtain wall from Bastion de San Diego to Bastion de San Nicol&aacute;s de Caranza (San Andr&eacute;s) broadened; however, as this left the bulwarks much recessed, he had them extended. Manila&rsquo;s walls crumbled during the earthquake of 1645. Fajardo&rsquo;s successor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, 1653-63, took 10 years to rebuild the ruined walls. He raised the height of the Bastion de San Diego to 7.5 m. Fearing an attack by the Chinese Koxinga in 1663, he worked to finish repairing and improving Manila&rsquo;s defenses. De Lara had the Puerta Real fortified and the bulwarks San Gabriel, San Nicolas, and San Francisco repaired. Along the seaside he reconstructed the old <strong>media-naranja</strong> (a half-moon shaped wall, the predecessor of the ravelin, <strong>revellin</strong> in Spanish) and named it San Lorenzo. Here he also built the pentagon-shaped stone fort San Jose and other forts&mdash;San Eugenio, San Pedro, and San Juan. At the postern gate of the old Palace he built the bulwark of San Francisco Xavier; the small fort, Almacenes, along the riverside wall; and a bulwark at the Santo Domingo gate. He also improved the moat by having it dug deeper and constructing <strong>falsabraga</strong> (low forewalls).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1663 to the end of the century, the walls underwent minor repairs, but their shape remained as de Lara had left them. The walls were a hodgepodge of projects because no professional military engineer had ever worked in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Reforms in Spain during the 18th century transformed government policies. The Bourbons sent a corps of military engineers across the empire. The first military engineer to be sent to Manila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan Ramirez de Ciscara</a>, arrived in 1705. The early 18th century, however, was relatively peaceful. In 1734, during the term of Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes y Tamon, 1729-39, the ravelin of Puerta Real was improved. The Puerta de Parian and the moat in front of it were repaired during the governorship of Fray Juan de Arechederra, 1745-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1762 to 1764, the British occupied Manila, proving the walls to be ineffective, as predicted by military engineers. The British damaged the walls of Baluarte de San Diego and ruined the bulwarks of San Andres, San Jose, and San Eugenio. The bulwarks and walls were repaired but the walls needed major renovation to withstand a similar attack. The walls were to be made to conform to a polygon; buildings exceeding a certain height and adjacent to the walls were to be demolished; Fort Santiago was to be renovated; and a low wall in front of the main defenses was to be constructed. The engineers proposed the demolition of stone structures outside Intramuros, which were near enough to threaten the fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dionisio O&rsquo;Kelly, who arrived in 1769, proposed deepening the moat fronting the sea and adding parapets to the walls. By 1772, the moat facing the sea and that facing Bagumbayan had been improved and deepened. A moat was built in front of Fort Santiago. Parapets were added to the ravelin of Bagumbayan and its walls faced with bricks. A ravelin was built facing Dilao (now Paco). Work on the walls temporarily slowed down from 1772 to 1776 because of government objections to the plans. In 1778 the newly arrived Gov-Gen Jose Vargas de Basco had work on Manila&rsquo;s defenses continued under the supervision of Tom&aacute;s Sanz. Sanz repaired the bulwarks San Diego and San Andres; placed the <strong>puerta</strong> (entrance) behind a ravelin; renovated the puertas of Santa Lucia, Parian, and Postigo; and enlarged the ravelin of the Parian gate. Improvements from 1781 to 1787 gave the walls its shape for coming decades. The moat and its forewalls were improved, the <strong>fortin</strong> (redoubts) of Santiago and San Pedro built, wooden drawbridges over the moat installed, parapets on the walls and bulwarks erected, and a road around the city laid out; these completed Manila&rsquo;s outer defenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of Spanish rule, the walls had eight main gates: Real, Santa Lucia, Almacenes, Aduana, Santo Domingo, Isabel II, Postigo, and Parian. Puerta Isabel II, completed in 1862, was the last to be built. With the construction of this new gate, the old Santo Domingo gate was closed. There were six bastions besides Fort Santiago: San Gabriel, Dilao, San Andr&eacute;s, San Diego, Santa Lucia, and Santo Domingo. There were two moats, an inner and an outer, and two gates with their ravelin, Parian and Real. A third ravelin, Recoletos, was approached through a narrow portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 19th century, the walls were no longer functional, and Intramuros slowly ceased to be the center of Manila. Commercial and social life became most active in the&nbsp;<em>arrabales&nbsp;</em>(outside towns) of Binondo, Santa Cruz, and Quiapo. Intramuros was left to the friars, students, and a few aristocratic families. A series of earthquakes in the late 19th century had scarred the city and its walls. During the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American period</a>, Intramuros decayed further, its tiled roofs replaced by rusting galvanized iron sheets. American architect and city planner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a> proposed preserving the walled city. The mosquito-infested moats were filled with earth to improve sanitation. A sunken garden, with a golf course and aquarium, was built. To allow easy access to vehicular traffic, walls were breached at the southern end of Calle Palacio (now Gen Luna St), on Victoria St near San Juan de Letran, and on Aduana St. The old Puerta Real, bricked up but still visible, was demolished after Puerta Real was moved west to its present position along Muralla. A stretch of wall from the Ravelin de Santo Domingo to the Maestranza was demolished to allow access to the wharfs along the Pasig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new port area was built on land reclaimed in front of the walls, shutting Intramuros off from the sea. Here would rise South Harbor, adjacent to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, inaugurated 1912. On 12 Nov 1936, Commonwealth Act No 171 was passed to conserve Intramuros as monument to the past. This was in response to moves to demolish the walls completely and open the old city for redevelopment.The law also promulgated that new constructions, repairs, and renovations keep to the Spanish colonial style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Japanese had bombed Intramuros on 26 and 27 Dec 1941, its damage was limited to the northeast sector. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a> and its adjoining <strong>convento</strong>, Santa Catalina, San Juan de Letran, Santo Tom&aacute;s University, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\">Intendencia</a> were damaged. Manila had been declared an open city on 26 Dec and on 2 Jan 1942, Japanese troops occupied the city. Despite the arrests and occasional harrassment, some semblance of city life returned until 21 Dec 1944 when the Japanese ordered the government under Pres Jose P. Laurel moved to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>. The final blow came in Feb 1945. On 8 and 9 Feb, the Japanese troops who were hemmed in by the Americans&mdash;who had already taken control of Sampaloc and Quiapo and who were also approaching from the south in a pincer operation&mdash;put the city to the torch. Aimed at flushing out Japanese troops, American artillery left the city, except for a few structures, in total ruin. Puerta Santa Lucia was in ruins. Fort Santiago&rsquo;s elaborate gate was blasted open by tanks sent in to rescue the prisoners that the Japanese incarcerated in Fort Santiago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, religious orders that had built their centers in Intramuros moved out, except for the Augustinians. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">cathedral</a> remained a ruin until 1954 when reconstruction began. Many families moved out of the bombed city, and the walls&mdash;damaged but not demolished by war&mdash;were left to deteriorate. The bombed-out buildings and walls of Intramuros became the refuge of many rendered homeless, jobless, and poor by the war. Intramuros became a squatter city. The stones of the wall were quarried for new constructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951, Republic Act No 597 declared Intramuros as a historical monument and Fort Santiago as a national shrine. The act set the policy of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoring</a>, rebuilding, and planning Intramuros. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> started working on restoring the walls with the help of civic groups and ad hoc committees; the most active were the Intramuros Restoration Committee of 1966 which repaired the gates and the Armed Forces Ladies&rsquo; Committee which restored Fort Santiago&rsquo;s moat and other structures like the Fort&iacute;n de San Francisco, and the Basti&oacute;n de Santa Lucia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work on the walls began, mainly cleaning the walls and removing vegetation. The periodic cleaning of the walls became a pet project of various civic groups and the City of Manila. National government stepped in when Diosdado Macapagal, president 1961-65, established the Emergency Employment Administration (EEA), which provided short-term jobs to the unemployed. Many worked on the maintenance, rehabilitation, and construction of infrastructure. EEA worked on the walls of Intramuros regularly and maintained it well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pres Ferdinand Marcos signed Presidential Decree No 1616 on 19 Apr 1979 creating Intramuros Administration (IA) to oversee Intramuros and supervise its rehabilitation. IA worked toward restoring the walls of Intramuros as a first step toward making Intramuros a unique historic site. IA studied historic documents, maps, illustrations, and photographs, and did archaeological surveys. Aided by foreign consultants, IA&rsquo;s early accomplishments included the rehabilitation of the ravelins, especially, Parian and Puerta Real, which could be used as a venue for cultural events and shows. Parian, which led to the row of colleges and universities along Muralla, became a park, where temporary stores operated. Students would frequent this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While doing the archaeological survey of Bastion de San Diego in 1979, a ring of cut stones was unearthed about two meters below the surface. Archival research identified the ring of cut stones as the remains of the circular tower built by Sede&ntilde;o, which Dasmari&ntilde;as had integrated into the walls of Intramuros. The tower was later remodeled to become a cistern that impounded rain and provided the city with water until the construction of the Carriedo Aguas Potables that brought water from San Juan to Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent repairs on the walls made the <strong>casamata</strong> (vaulted chambers) beneath the walls, used during the Spanish era as storage and as shelter for soldiers, serviceable. A portion near Puerta Isabel II was used as a museum of ecclesiastical art and artifacts, but that museum has been closed. Cafes and restaurants were allowed to operate in the area. At one point, to the dismay of heritage advocates, al fresco dining was built above the casamata and structures were built that marred the historic lines of the wall. These structures have been demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1961, the government began addressing the presence of informal settlers in Intramuros, long after the emergency created by war. The first government resettlement project, Sapang Palay Resettlement Area in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan was established. It covered 752 ha. People were moved from Manila&rsquo;s informal settlers colonies; this included inhabitants of Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IA continued to work on the walls of Intramuros. It built a vault over the breached portion of wall at the southern end of Calle Real del Palacio and an arch across the western end of Aduana (Andres Soriano St), which allowed vehicles to enter Intramuros, while linking the walls so that it was possible to do a walking tour of the walls from Aduana to the Puerta del Parian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, in cooperation with the Department of Tourism and with funds from Japanese government, IA worked on the reconstruction of the Maestranza and the Bastion de Herrerias that had been damaged by war. The Maestranza or armory, near Fort Santiago, was where the artillery and armaments used in Intramuros were manufactured and stored. Its vaulted chambers also served to store goods destined for the Port of Cavite for shipment to Mexico on board the galleon. The Maestranza was built during the 17th century but was closed at the end of the 19th century. The Americans used it as an arsenal and World War II destroyed it completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the reconstruction of the Maestranza and the adjoining bastion, Intramuros walls were almost complete. The partially completed wall was inaugurated in 2010. It has since been used for events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important development for the restoration of Intramuros and other colonial structures is the opening of Escuela Taller at the Revellin de los Recoletos. This independent and outer fortification, built outside the southeastern section of Intramuros, near the site of the Recoletos church, has been handed over to the school, which teaches a new generation of students the technique, skills and aesthetics of construction of the Spanish era. Similar schools have been established in areas once part of the Spanish empire. The school recruits students from Baseco and other urban poor areas. Funded by the Spanish government over a number of years, Escuela Taller brings together a faculty of Filipinos, Mexicans, and Spaniards. Completing a Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)-certified course in basic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction methods</a>&mdash; including carpentry, masonry, electrical&mdash;the students learn methods of preparing lime mortar, stone carving, and stone masonry, decorative painting, colonial construction among others. Graduates have been employed to maintain and repair buildings at Fort Santiago, Almacenes, and Barrio San Luis. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The first Chinese invasion of 1603 proved that the city was not impregnable. Dutch threats around the same time prompted Gov-Gen Alfonso Fajardo de Tenza, 1618-24, to have moats dug along the eastern side of the walls. Later lengthened and deepened to about 60 m wide and 3 m deep, they were meant to serve as alternate waterways should enemy forces block the river mouth. The ditch dug earlier under de Vera, and never completed, is not to be confused with the moat."

Gov-Gen Diego Fajardo, 1644-53, sensing that the city was most vulnerable from the land side, had the stretch of curtain wall from Bastion de San Diego to Bastion de San Nicol&#xE1;s de Caranza (San Andr&#xE9;s) broadened; however, as this left the bulwarks much recessed, he had them extended. Manila&#x2019;s walls crumbled during the earthquake of 1645. Fajardo&#x2019;s successor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, 1653-63, took 10 years to rebuild the ruined walls. He raised the height of the Bastion de San Diego to 7.5 m. Fearing an attack by the Chinese Koxinga in 1663, he worked to finish repairing and improving Manila&#x2019;s defenses. De Lara had the Puerta Real fortified and the bulwarks San Gabriel, San Nicolas, and San Francisco repaired. Along the seaside he reconstructed the old <strong>media-naranja</strong> (a half-moon shaped wall, the predecessor of the ravelin, <strong>revellin</strong> in Spanish) and named it San Lorenzo. Here he also built the pentagon-shaped stone fort San Jose and other forts&#x2014;San Eugenio, San Pedro, and San Juan. At the postern gate of the old Palace he built the bulwark of San Francisco Xavier; the small fort, Almacenes, along the riverside wall; and a bulwark at the Santo Domingo gate. He also improved the moat by having it dug deeper and constructing <strong>falsabraga</strong> (low forewalls)."

The bulwarks and walls were repaired but the walls needed major renovation to withstand a similar attack. The walls were to be made to conform to a polygon; buildings exceeding a certain height and adjacent to the walls were to be demolished; Fort Santiago was to be renovated; and a low wall in front of the main defenses was to be constructed.

Parapets were added to the ravelin of Bagumbayan and its walls faced with bricks. A ravelin was built facing Dilao (now Paco). Work on the walls temporarily slowed down from 1772 to 1776 because of government objections to the plans. In 1778 the newly arrived Gov-Gen Jose Vargas de Basco had work on Manila&#x2019;s defenses continued under the supervision of Tom&#xE1;s Sanz. Sanz repaired the bulwarks San Diego and San Andres; placed the <strong>puerta</strong> (entrance) behind a ravelin; renovated the puertas of Santa Lucia, Parian, and Postigo; and enlarged the ravelin of the Parian gate. Improvements from 1781 to 1787 gave the walls its shape for coming decades. The moat and its forewalls were improved, the <strong>fortin</strong> (redoubts) of Santiago and San Pedro built, wooden drawbridges over the moat installed, parapets on the walls and bulwarks erected, and a road around the city laid out; these completed Manila&#x2019;s outer defenses."

Intramuros was left to the friars, students, and a few aristocratic families. A series of earthquakes in the late 19th century had scarred the city and its walls. During the <a href=\"/2/4/210\">American period</a>, Intramuros decayed further, its tiled roofs replaced by rusting galvanized iron sheets. American architect and city planner <a href=\"/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a> proposed preserving the walled city. The mosquito-infested moats were filled with earth to improve sanitation. A sunken garden, with a golf course and aquarium, was built. To allow easy access to vehicular traffic, walls were breached at the southern end of Calle Palacio (now Gen Luna St), on Victoria St near San Juan de Letran, and on Aduana St. The old Puerta Real, bricked up but still visible, was demolished after Puerta Real was moved west to its present position along Muralla.

On 8 and 9 Feb, the Japanese troops who were hemmed in by the Americans&#x2014;who had already taken control of Sampaloc and Quiapo and who were also approaching from the south in a pincer operation&#x2014;put the city to the torch. Aimed at flushing out Japanese troops, American artillery left the city, except for a few structures, in total ruin. Puerta Santa Lucia was in ruins.

Six years later, Fr Juan Heras, who had been rector of the Ateneo Municip&aacute;l, while still resident of Balingasag, began work on the Jasaan church at its present site on a hill rather than along the shore.

The model showed construction details, which could be used to teach and direct the local carpenters who worked on the church, under the supervision of Tagalog master craftsmen. The scale model was still around at the start of the Pacific War. In 1895, Heras writing to Fr.

		"text": "<p>Present name: Jesuit House of 1730, Museo de Parian. Location: Parian district of Cebu City, between Zulueta and Binakayan Streets in the compound of Ho Tong Hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house was written about in 1938 by William Repetti, Jesuit scientist, historian and archivist of the Philippine mission, in <strong><em>Pictorial Records and Traces of the Society of Jesus in the Philippine Islands and Guam Prior to 1768</em></strong>. Repetti put together the book by gathering oral data and working closely with field researchers, like Fr Gissel, who took photographs for the book. In 1987, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; Javellana</a> published an article about the house in <strong><em>Philippine Studies</em></strong>. Except for these scholarly notes, the house has remained largely unknown because it is hidden inside the warehouse of Ho Tong Hardware, whose main office is a stone&rsquo;s throw away at Colon St, the oldest street in Cebu. The house came to public attention in 2010, when it was opened as Museo Parian.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The identity of this house goes back to the presence of the Jesuits in Cebu as early as the 16th century. In 1595, Jesuit superior, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a>, appointed vice-provincial that same year, sent Pedro Chirino from Leyte to Cebu to facilitate the establishment of a central house for the Jesuits missions of the Visayas. The Jesuits acquired a house through a donation by residents of Cebu. According to Chirino, this house was in a pleasant site near the sea. This first house may not have been in the Parian because a 1699 map of Cebu depicts Jesuit properties clustered around the site of the Colegio de San Ildefonso and lots between the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">Cebu cathedral</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Convento del Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a>, not in Cebu&rsquo;s Parian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1605, the Philippines was raised to the status of a province in the Society of Jesus. By the mid-1600s, a vice-provincial of the&nbsp;<em>Pintados&nbsp;</em>(the Visayans) was appointed to better supervise the missions. He lived in various provinces in the Visayas but Cebu was his customary place of residence. In Cebu, the vice-provincial lived in different houses but his customary residence was the College of Cebu. However, starting in 1654, the Jesuit catalogues of personnel no longer list the vice-provincial under the College of Cebu; presumably he had a residence of his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repetti states that around 1701, the Jesuits built a house in Cebu&rsquo;s Parian. In 1730, another house was built close to the site of the earlier house, between present-day Binakayan and Zulueta Sts, to replace the earlier house. The Binakayan house is what is called the Jesuit house of 1730. Most likely it was the residence of the vice-provincial of the Pintados. An annotated copy of Repetti&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pictorial Records</em></strong> in the Archives of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus has marginal notes from an unknown source doubting whether the ruins identified by Repetti were really of the earlier house of 1701.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1768, the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines. What happened to this house until the late 1800s, when the Alvarez family acquired it, is uncertain. When the Alvarezes owned the house, the family lived on the second floor of the house and part of the ground floor was used as horse stables, because the family was into transportation. In the 20th century, the stables would become garages for motor vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s, the house was rented to Sergio Osme&ntilde;a and became Club X, an exclusive club for Cebu&rsquo;s elite. Around 1964, the Sy family purchased the house from the Alvarezes and later converted it into a warehouse of Ho Tong Hardware. The Sys breached the perimeter wall on Zulueta St to make it possible for trucks to approach the warehouse but also added to the height of the original perimeter wall made of coral. The house was hidden and forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, the present owner Jimmy Sy, who inherited the house from his father, began <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a> of the old house and opened it to the public. The house is being restored as resources are available, the whole project funded privately by Mr. Sy. By 2010, the house was opened to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, the Jesuit attribution of the house has been questioned because a document from the 19th century indicates that the Villa family had made a house available to the Jesuits in Panting, defined in the Rivera y Mir map of Cebu as an area in the Parian bounded by Mabini and Zulueta Sts and the Estero del Parian. It has been suggested that the Villas owned the house identified as the Jesuit house. Jose S. Arcilla acknowledges that the Jesuits who returned to the Philippines in the 19th century used a house of the Villas. He writes: &ldquo;In 1878, they [the Jesuits] leased the house of the Villa family for 25 years, favoring its location for use as a procurement and rest house for the missionaries in Mindanao. But, in 1883, it was closed&rdquo; (Arcilla 2013, 12). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5517\">Mojares</a>, however, locates the two Villa houses on Mabini St, rather than on Zulueta and Binakayan, where the Jesuit Residence (8) is located, beside the Rodriguez residence (7) (Mojares 1983, 58).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As to whether the house is Jesuit or not, internal evidence indicates that it is. The house is significant architecturally because its date of construction is known, indicated by a plaque inside the house. This plaque has a crescent moon, beneath the year 1730. The moon motif has been used in Jesuit seals as representing the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house serves as benchmark for colonial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction</a>, whose dates are often unknown and established by educated conjecture through comparative studies. It is also significant because the house uses many elements that are clearly Chinese in origin. First, the house has a sweeping roof ridge, generally reserved for temples, palaces, and wealthy homes. Second, the sweeping curvature ends in a space for a&nbsp;<em>bagua.&nbsp;</em>This is a device representing the eight trigrams of Daoism and is attached to houses to ward off evil. In the absence of a proper bagua, a shiny porcelain plate was used in the Philippines. Third, the house uses the Chinese bracket system for the roof structure. In this system, lintel and post construction of ever-diminishing dimensions are placed on top of each other to create height. The bracketing system is visually appealing and becomes a decorative element in the construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is known as the Jesuit house are really two two-story limestone houses attached by a bridge. The first of the building, which has a two-story wall of limestone, which Javellana has labeled as House A, with the second house with a second story of wood as House B. The houses are enclosed by a limestone fence, whose entrance bears the monograms of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph at the lintel. The supporting columns of the cut coral perimeter wall also had emblems of the Society but these have been vandalized or degraded over time. The main door of the house, close to Binakayan St, also bears the monogram of Jesus and three crossed nails, the seal of the Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old maps of Cebu indicate that the original property attached to the house reached Estero del Parian but at present, that property ends abruptly a few meters from the gate at Binakayan, divided by a coral stone wall from other houses. This perimeter wall was probably built in the late 19th century when part of the original property was sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the restoration of the house beginning in 2008, the base of the tower indicated in the sketch in Repetti was discovered. It is the first floor of what now serves as a kitchen in House B. The kitchen was built by the Alvarezes. An earlier ceiling with degraded polychrome painting was also discovered with the cleaning and restoration of one of the bedrooms. The painting dates to the 18th century, another feature of the house that enhances its significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also discovered in the course of consolidating the foundations and post of the house&mdash;which has been subjected to rot because of a rising water table&mdash;are numerous shards of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>, local as well as Chinese, Japanese and Indo-Chinese trade ware. Remains of animals, like chicken and fish, have been found. A jawbone of a horse has also been recovered. Most important are two coins bearing the insignia of China&rsquo;s Wanli emperor (1563-1620), 13th emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The finds recovered through rescue archaeology suggest the site of the 1730 house is a rich archaeological site, probably inhabited as early as the 16th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lower story of House A has been converted to a museum with two galleries: the Sugbu gallery, which tells the history of the Parian; and the Pedro Chirino gallery, which is about the Jesuits in the Philippines, especially Cebu. Under House B, a third gallery on colonial construction is being prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The upper story shows the lifestyle of the Cebuano elite, exemplified by the Alvarezes, who donated old photographs that speak of an era&mdash;the late 19th and early 20th century. It houses Mr Sy&rsquo;s collection of colonial antiques. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ren&eacute; B.

Repetti put together the book by gathering oral data and working closely with field researchers, like Fr Gissel, who took photographs for the book. In 1987, <a href=\"/2/2/2663\">Ren&#xE9; Javellana</a> published an article about the house in <strong><em>Philippine Studies</em></strong>. Except for these scholarly notes, the house has remained largely unknown because it is hidden inside the warehouse of Ho Tong Hardware, whose main office is a stone&#x2019;s throw away at Colon St, the oldest street in Cebu. The house came to public attention in 2010, when it was opened as Museo Parian."

				"value": "The identity of this house goes back to the presence of the Jesuits in Cebu as early as the 16th century. In 1595, Jesuit superior, <a href=\"/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&#xF1;o</a>, appointed vice-provincial that same year, sent Pedro Chirino from Leyte to Cebu to facilitate the establishment of a central house for the Jesuits missions of the Visayas. The Jesuits acquired a house through a donation by residents of Cebu. According to Chirino, this house was in a pleasant site near the sea. This first house may not have been in the Parian because a 1699 map of Cebu depicts Jesuit properties clustered around the site of the Colegio de San Ildefonso and lots between the <a href=\"/2/8/286\">Cebu cathedral</a> and the <a href=\"/2/8/380\">Convento del Santo Ni&#xF1;o</a>, not in Cebu&#x2019;s Parian."

				"value": "In 1605, the Philippines was raised to the status of a province in the Society of Jesus. By the mid-1600s, a vice-provincial of the&#xA0;<em>Pintados&#xA0;</em>(the Visayans) was appointed to better supervise the missions. He lived in various provinces in the Visayas but Cebu was his customary place of residence. In Cebu, the vice-provincial lived in different houses but his customary residence was the College of Cebu. However, starting in 1654, the Jesuit catalogues of personnel no longer list the vice-provincial under the College of Cebu; presumably he had a residence of his own."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Repetti states that around 1701, the Jesuits built a house in Cebu&#x2019;s Parian. In 1730, another house was built close to the site of the earlier house, between present-day Binakayan and Zulueta Sts, to replace the earlier house. The Binakayan house is what is called the Jesuit house of 1730. Most likely it was the residence of the vice-provincial of the Pintados. An annotated copy of Repetti&#x2019;s <strong><em>Pictorial Records</em></strong> in the Archives of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus has marginal notes from an unknown source doubting whether the ruins identified by Repetti were really of the earlier house of 1701."
			},

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In 1768, the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines. What happened to this house until the late 1800s, when the Alvarez family acquired it, is uncertain. When the Alvarezes owned the house, the family lived on the second floor of the house and part of the ground floor was used as horse stables, because the family was into transportation. In the 20th century, the stables would become garages for motor vehicles."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In the 1950s, the house was rented to Sergio Osme&#xF1;a and became Club X, an exclusive club for Cebu&#x2019;s elite. Around 1964, the Sy family purchased the house from the Alvarezes and later converted it into a warehouse of Ho Tong Hardware. The Sys breached the perimeter wall on Zulueta St to make it possible for trucks to approach the warehouse but also added to the height of the original perimeter wall made of coral. The house was hidden and forgotten."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In 2008, the present owner Jimmy Sy, who inherited the house from his father, began <a href=\"/2/6/255\">restoration</a> of the old house and opened it to the public. The house is being restored as resources are available, the whole project funded privately by Mr. Sy. By 2010, the house was opened to the public."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Recently, the Jesuit attribution of the house has been questioned because a document from the 19th century indicates that the Villa family had made a house available to the Jesuits in Panting, defined in the Rivera y Mir map of Cebu as an area in the Parian bounded by Mabini and Zulueta Sts and the Estero del Parian. It has been suggested that the Villas owned the house identified as the Jesuit house. Jose S. Arcilla acknowledges that the Jesuits who returned to the Philippines in the 19th century used a house of the Villas. He writes: &#x201C;In 1878, they [the Jesuits] leased the house of the Villa family for 25 years, favoring its location for use as a procurement and rest house for the missionaries in Mindanao. But, in 1883, it was closed&#x201D; (Arcilla 2013, 12). <a href=\"/9/9/5517\">Mojares</a>, however, locates the two Villa houses on Mabini St, rather than on Zulueta and Binakayan, where the Jesuit Residence (8) is located, beside the Rodriguez residence (7) (Mojares 1983, 58)."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "As to whether the house is Jesuit or not, internal evidence indicates that it is. The house is significant architecturally because its date of construction is known, indicated by a plaque inside the house. This plaque has a crescent moon, beneath the year 1730. The moon motif has been used in Jesuit seals as representing the Virgin Mary."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The house serves as benchmark for colonial <a href=\"/2/6/253\">construction</a>, whose dates are often unknown and established by educated conjecture through comparative studies. It is also significant because the house uses many elements that are clearly Chinese in origin. First, the house has a sweeping roof ridge, generally reserved for temples, palaces, and wealthy homes. Second, the sweeping curvature ends in a space for a&#xA0;<em>bagua.&#xA0;</em>This is a device representing the eight trigrams of Daoism and is attached to houses to ward off evil. In the absence of a proper bagua, a shiny porcelain plate was used in the Philippines. Third, the house uses the Chinese bracket system for the roof structure. In this system, lintel and post construction of ever-diminishing dimensions are placed on top of each other to create height. The bracketing system is visually appealing and becomes a decorative element in the construction."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "What is known as the Jesuit house are really two two-story limestone houses attached by a bridge. The first of the building, which has a two-story wall of limestone, which Javellana has labeled as House A, with the second house with a second story of wood as House B. The houses are enclosed by a limestone fence, whose entrance bears the monograms of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph at the lintel. The supporting columns of the cut coral perimeter wall also had emblems of the Society but these have been vandalized or degraded over time. The main door of the house, close to Binakayan St, also bears the monogram of Jesus and three crossed nails, the seal of the Society."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Old maps of Cebu indicate that the original property attached to the house reached Estero del Parian but at present, that property ends abruptly a few meters from the gate at Binakayan, divided by a coral stone wall from other houses. This perimeter wall was probably built in the late 19th century when part of the original property was sold."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In the restoration of the house beginning in 2008, the base of the tower indicated in the sketch in Repetti was discovered. It is the first floor of what now serves as a kitchen in House B. The kitchen was built by the Alvarezes. An earlier ceiling with degraded polychrome painting was also discovered with the cleaning and restoration of one of the bedrooms. The painting dates to the 18th century, another feature of the house that enhances its significance."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Also discovered in the course of consolidating the foundations and post of the house&#x2014;which has been subjected to rot because of a rising water table&#x2014;are numerous shards of <a href=\"/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>, local as well as Chinese, Japanese and Indo-Chinese trade ware. Remains of animals, like chicken and fish, have been found. A jawbone of a horse has also been recovered. Most important are two coins bearing the insignia of China&#x2019;s Wanli emperor (1563-1620), 13th emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The finds recovered through rescue archaeology suggest the site of the 1730 house is a rich archaeological site, probably inhabited as early as the 16th century."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The lower story of House A has been converted to a museum with two galleries: the Sugbu gallery, which tells the history of the Parian; and the Pedro Chirino gallery, which is about the Jesuits in the Philippines, especially Cebu. Under House B, a third gallery on colonial construction is being prepared."

It is situated on a&nbsp;<em>loma</em>, Spanish for hill, at the northern end of Santa Cruz district, Manila; the northernmost sector now pertains to Caloocan City. The site began as a cemetery for the Chinese in the 1870s and was expanded in 1878. A Catholic chapel known as Chong Hong Tock was built here in the Chinese style, complete with sloping roof ridges. A massive cholera outbreak struck Manila on 22 Aug 1882, with reports of 2,000 casualties a month. The unparalleled death toll resulted in an ordinance prescribing burial in cemeteries proximate to Manila parishes instead of inside <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, in keeping with a promulgation issued by Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria in 1848 to construct cemeteries outside town centers. The new ordinance also pushed for the opening of the La Loma cemetery on 21 Sep 1882 to accommodate the burials of the cholera victims. The Dominican parish priest of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> and future bishop of Nueva Segovia, Fr Jose Hevia Campomanes, arranged for the purchase of the La Loma land and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction</a> of the cemetery.

The intricate wrought iron grille gates still provide access to the cemetery. The funerary chapel of adobe blocks is intact with its imposing dome. It is reached through flights of steps at both front and rear. Two stone lions guard the main entrance.

The unparalleled death toll resulted in an ordinance prescribing burial in cemeteries proximate to Manila parishes instead of inside <a href=\"/2/5/244\">churches</a>, in keeping with a promulgation issued by Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria in 1848 to construct cemeteries outside town centers. The new ordinance also pushed for the opening of the La Loma cemetery on 21 Sep 1882 to accommodate the burials of the cholera victims. The Dominican parish priest of <a href=\"/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> and future bishop of Nueva Segovia, Fr Jose Hevia Campomanes, arranged for the purchase of the La Loma land and the <a href=\"/2/6/253\">construction</a> of the cemetery. Although the chapel bears the year 1884 over its entrance, it was ceremonially blessed by the archbishop of Manila, Pedro Payo, on 20 Jan 1886."

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church (former Cathedral) of Santo Domingo de Guzman. Location: Lal-lo, Cagayan. Built ca 1600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area of Lal-lo was the first important Spanish settlement in the Cagayan Valley; it was visited as early as 1572 by Juan de Salcedo. Located on the banks of the great Cagayan River, it was near both the port of Camalaniugan further downriver and Aparri at the very mouth of the river, which gave access to the South China Sea. Oral tradition attributes the town&rsquo;s name to the whirlpools in the river. From the tone of contemporary documents, it is likely that the Spaniards founded their own city, named Nueva Segovia, in 1581, next to a settlement of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>, the original inhabitants of Lal-lo (spelled Lal-loc in the past). In 1595, a diocese was created whose territory comprised the entire northern half of Luzon, and its seat and cathedral were located in Nueva Segovia. This city at the beginning of the 17th century had 200 Spaniards and was guarded by the stone fort of San Francisco. In time, however, the earlier place name came to refer to both communities, and Nueva Segovia was retained only as the name of the diocese. This also seems to have been the case with other Spanish cities in the archipelago (e.g., Ciudad Fernandina was supplanted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, and Nueva Caceres became indistinguishable from Naga).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to some sources, there were three parishes in Lal-lo. The first, Nueva Segovia, was the cathedral&rsquo;s and was run by the secular clergy. The second was Tocolana, which had a hospital. Bagumbayan was the third. The latter two, administered by the Dominicans, may have constituted the original populace of Lal-lo. An 18th-century account, however, mentions that one of these two or the combined area of both (if the third parish had not yet been separated) was also run by the seculars. The cathedral of Lal-lo, Nueva Segovia still stands, but the identification of the two other churches has not yet been settled. Benito Legarda conjectures that the cemetery chapel just south of the poblacion may be Tacolana. Residents claim that a mound of ruins by the river in the Tabacalera property a few blocks north of the cathedral belonged to the &ldquo;first church of San Jose.&rdquo; The seat of the diocese of Nueva Segovia remained in Lal-lo until 1758, when it was formally transferred to Vigan on the opposite coast of Luzon. The vagaries of the river made it increasingly difficult to come to Lal-lo. Already in the 17th century many bishops preferred to hold office in Vigan rather than in Lal-lo. Today, half of the very plaza in front of the former cathedral has been washed away, leaving behind the ancient wooden cross standing precariously in what used to be the middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lal-lo Cathedral, now a parish church, is difficult to date. Fray Rodrigo de Cardenas, bishop from 1653 to 1661, ordered a structure built, the extant parts of which may be the bell tower and the nave. The quadrangular, two-story <strong>campanario</strong> (bell tower) is the most striking part of the edifice, and in shape is akin to the ruins of the towers of Tuao and Nassiping further south. The walls of the nave are thick, punctuated at intervals by triangular buttresses. The church follows the basilica plan except that two chapels protrude from the southern wall, flanking the side entrance. These are propped up by buttresses even squatter and larger in proportion to those of the nave. A tile roof is still extant over the chapel nearest the bell tower, which has also preserved its octagonal, pointed dome of masonry covered with floor tiles. Projecting from the southern side of the apse is a double row of niches which form part of the wall enclosing the churchyard. The facade was facelifted in the 19th century along <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Florentine Renaissance</a> lines, similar to that of Alcala further south. The paired columns of wood or masonry as well as the cornices and entablatures have long since disappeared. The church, bell tower, and <strong>convento</strong> ruins are almost wholly of brick. The facade is clearly old, but the other parts are difficult to date. A number of 19th century bricks bear the name &ldquo;Vigan,&rdquo; probably the source of the brick mould. Most of the plaster on the walls has eroded. What look like cut adobe stones form a sliver of a wall linking the bell tower to the rest of the church. For such a storied past, the interior of the church is disappointingly barren. Only a few flanges remain from the wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>, whose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> ornateness appears in old photographs. The wrought-iron pulpit is late 19th century, although the hidden ascent to it from a back door is earlier. This type of &ldquo;surprise entrance&rdquo; pulpit has its counterparts in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>, Rizal; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/347\">Nagcarlan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/352\">Pakil</a>, Laguna; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/381\">Sariaya</a>, Quezon; and Baybay, Leyte. Bells in the campanario dated 1694, 1790, and 1793 are further witnesses to Lal-lo&rsquo;s antiquity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its being a cathedral, the church never seems to have been improved, based on a number of accounts complaining about cracked walls, rotten trusses, and a roofless nave. Around 1721 the church was so dilapidated that a chapel of thatch had to be constructed inside the building. Such a situation prompted more clerics to move for the transfer of the diocesan seat to Vigan. This decrepit state of affairs has hardly improved at present, and can be symbolized by the presence of the historical markers for &ldquo;Lal-loc Nueva Segovia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lal-loc Tocolana&rdquo; on the facade, which in turn faces a cross on the edge of an eroding embankment. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Then too, nature also formed on one side of this rock something like a small cove with its little beach.&rdquo; As it is strategically located at the mouth of the Catubig River, the main lifeline of Northern Samare&ntilde;os, Laoang became a trading center for the Catubig Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1627, Jesuits established Laoang as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> or mission chapel of Palapag, and it remained so until the 18th century when it became an independent mission. It became a settlement in 1680, when the families of the three native principales moved to the area from nearby Palapag. By 1750, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was requested to be built in Laoang since the townspeople had to take long journeys to Palapag for their Sunday obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church, dedicated to the town&rsquo;s patron San Miguel Arcangel, and convent were built of rubblework in 1767 or 1768. The church was erected on a promontory overlooking the Laoang Bay, now known as Barangay Guilaoangi, which developed as the nucleus of the pueblo. Delgado writes that in the late 18th century, a fort was built in this area below the convent and church, but it is uncertain whether the structures were made of wood or stone, or if the church is the same one existing at present (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Javellana</a> 1991, 224).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Philippine Islands in 1768, the Franciscans took over the administration and established the parish with the same titular patron saint. Based on Redondo&rsquo;s analysis of the oldest parish records in 1886, the probable year of the foundation of the parish was 1733.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the church vicinity, a fort and protective wall were constructed in 1814 as part of the defensive plan ordered by the governor-general to prevent Moro pirates who were plundering the coastal towns of Samar then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr Jose Mata, parish priest of both Laoang and Palapag, was cited for being the first to have launched the construction of the <strong>muralla</strong> or wall made of cobblestones, at his own expense. The Almuraya Fort, which stood above the cliff west of the Church, was used as a watchtower by the natives to warn authorities of the coming Moro pirates. Both the fort, now in ruins, and the muralla defended the rear and flanks of the church from the Moro invasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of the Spanish regime, the town of Laoang grew rapidly and became a thriving port of commerce and trade, especially for hemp or abaca. Manila&rsquo;s most important commercial houses already conducted business in Samar, and one of the main hemp centers in the island was Laoang. The town boasted of four huge Chinese commercial houses and Oria Hermanos, which competed with other foreign commercial houses in the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1848 to 1852, the church and convent were rehabilitated after a major earthquake damaged the structures extensively during the term of Fr Manuel Lozano, OFM. His successor, Fr Sebastian Almonacid, OFM, undertook rehabilitation of the damaged structures, and had the roof of both structures renovated, although conservatively, to preserve the original fabric. The major renovations and additions were made on the church in ca 1855 during the term of Fr Angel Pulido, OFM. A baptistry was added to the nave, both church and baptistry were paved with <strong>azulejos</strong> (glazed blue tiles), the altars regilded, and the bell tower constructed. By 1900s, this bell tower would be ruined, and then repaired in 1926.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1982, during Christmas Day, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a>, which was as old as the church itself, was destroyed when a strong typhoon ravaged the town and unroofed the church. The reconstruction committee, headed by Fr Nicodemus Ricalde, was forced to sell the remaining pieces of the altar in order to fund the renovation of the church&rsquo;s roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the years, the renovations on the fabric became apparent: entrances to the transept were modified, and an independent structure parallel to the epistle side of the nave was demolished to make way for an expanded convent. The baptistry was demolished, and the walls of the old church were transfixed with new doors. The<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a><strong> </strong>would assist the parish in adding ambulatory annexes to accommodate the rapid growth of parishioners. The church has survived fires and earthquakes, and to this day there has been a constant restoration effort led by Msgr Balerite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church&rsquo;s walls are made of cobbled stones, two meters thick, with two side altars forming a cruciform with the baroque <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">retablo</a> at its head. The main facade is graced by the statues of San Pedro and San Pablo, and at the top is the statue of the patron saint of Laoang, San Miguel Arcangel. Above it rests the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the church was built by the Jesuits, then the facade presents a variation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio</a>-type facade. &ldquo;The divisions between horizontal are softened by the <strong>retablo</strong>-like structure that connects a central niche bearing the image of St Michael with the lower members. Scrollwork decorates the otherwise austere pediment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside the church, and between the two modern structures of the municipal hall and the Laoang police station, also lies another architecture of interest&mdash;the Pergola, a cobblestone arch built in 1894 as part of the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\">Casa Tribunal</a> (Justice Hall). Two Spanish-era cannons sit beside the arch. It is a cobblestone arch reminiscent of Spanish architecture. It was used as a passageway to the defunct Casa Tribunal replaced by a present day <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">municipal hall</a>, built in 1894 by then Gobernadorcillo Don Juan T. Mulleda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Church of Laoang was given a historical marker by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a> in 2009, and was classified as a local historical landmark because the external architecture of the structure was preserved, even if the original interior was altered.

Built ca 1882-94, under Fr Toribio Sanchez, OAR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The island of Siquijor was governed from Cebu until about 1854, then from Bohol until 1893, and from Negros Oriental until the end of the Spanish era. One of the barrios of the principal town, also called Siquijor, gained its political independence through a decree signed on 31 May 1854 by Gov-Gen Manuel Pavia y Lacy. The new town exchanged its original name Tigbauan for the maternal family name of its &ldquo;sponsor,&rdquo; as was quite common in the latter part of the 19th century. From the 1860s onwards the name&rsquo;s spelling varied from Lacy to Laci; today it is Lazi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provincial of the Augustinian Recollects (OAR), who spiritually administered Siquijor, Negros, and Bohol, succeeded in having Lacy erected by the Bishop of Cebu as a parish on 8 Aug 1857.

The San Isidro Labrador church is cruciform in plan. Its walls, like those of the <strong>convento</strong>, are of quadrangular cut coral-stone slabs, typical of the Visayas region, with very minimal articulation. The church&rsquo;s significance lies in the amount of wood used. The triangular pediment is of vertical planks painted red. The interior from the floor to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> to the ceiling is of excellent workmanship in wood. The floor is of alternating dark and light planks forming a &ldquo;fish-bone&rdquo; pattern. All this provides a rare example of how the earlier churches may have looked like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento across the street strikes one as disproportionately large for such a small town. It is said that it served as a restful way station for the missionaries in the islands nearby. The remarkably sprawling structure features an arcaded ground floor with a high-pitched roof of galvanized iron sheets. The sliding window panels utilize colored glass instead of <strong>lampirong</strong> shell panes. The interior walls are of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>tabique pampango</strong></a>, woven bamboo slats plastered with lime. The <strong>amakan</strong> ceiling, also of thin bamboo strips, has retained its original lime plaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lazi church complex was declared a National Cultural Treasure on 31 Jul 2001. The retablos were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">conserved</a> and restored by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>.

The church&#x2019;s significance lies in the amount of wood used. The triangular pediment is of vertical planks painted red. The interior from the floor to the <a href=\"/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> to the ceiling is of excellent workmanship in wood.

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of San Pedro. Location: Loboc, Bohol. Earlier church built by the Jesuits in the 1670s, possibly incorporated into the <strong>convento</strong>; present church completed 1734, also by the Jesuits. Bell tower built shortly after 1768, extension of the convento parallel to the nave from 1854, portico-facade built in 1863-66, hexagonal mortuary chapel in 1867-68, buttresses in 1891-93, and porticoes over the side entrances in 1895-96, by the Augustinian Recollects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loboc was founded in 1596 by the Jesuit Juan de Torres. By 1602, it may have been effectively a parish, as baptismal books dated to this year were recorded in a survey done in 1884. Perhaps a more permanent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> than the one raised by the Boholanos under Torres&rsquo;s influence was built this year. Only in 1633 were there indications that a more permanent church had been raised. Most likely the person behind this construction was the saintly Fr Alonso de Humanes, who spent his last years in Bohol after serving so many years as a missionary in the Visayas and as provincial of the Jesuits. He had a special affection for Bohol, for earlier in 1605 he had established a boarding school in Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr Jose Sanchez, who also built a modest church in Tagbilaran, built a church in Loboc after a fire in 1638. A stone church in the area was also reported to have been built in 1670. The present church was completed in 1734.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence indicates that the walls of the older stone church are still standing and have been incorporated into the fabric of Loboc&rsquo;s unusual convento. This L-shaped convento has two unequal wings. The wing that runs parallel to the nave follows the bipartite construction of most conventos, a lower floor of stone and a superior one of wood. But that which runs parallel to the transept is three-stories tall, and its walls are of stone both in the lower and upper members. Its unusual elevation, thickness, and material points to a different provenance from the bipartite wing. The wing parallel to the transept seems to be the walls of the 1670s church, and therefore this may arguably be the oldest church building in Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loboc was ceded to the Recollects on 1 Nov 1768. The first Recollect priest built an octagonal bell tower near the riverbank and some 34 m from the church facade. In the 1990s its imminent collapse due to the construction of a bridge and bypass nearby was halted by a national outcry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new convento wing (the one parallel to the nave) was added in 1854. A portico was added over the Jesuit facade between 1863 and 1866, and an octagonal mortuary chapel was built from 1867 to 1868. From 1891 to 1893, buttresses were added to reinforce the walls weakened by previous tremors. Devastating floods inundated the church in 1876, 1955, 1964, 1974, and 1984. In 1969, the church floor was raised by 0.80 m to solve the problem of flooding. In the 1970s, new doors were opened along the nave to give more light and air to the church. These renovations unfortunately ruin the lines of the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church follows a cruciform plan with a sacristy at the rear. Above the sacristy a large room, now a storeroom, which probably once served as the priest&rsquo;s residence because the sacristy itself has a grand entrance, almost a second facade, and the flight of stairs leading to the second floor is of finely cut stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sacristy facade has a wooden relief of San Ignacio holding a book, his right hand lifted in blessing. The relief is enclosed in a medallion or cartouche held by two women wearing flowing robes and feathered bonnets, in the manner of heraldic supporters. The women with bonnets are a common <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> allegory for the Americas. Why this motif was used in Loboc, when Loboc is in Asia, remains unanswered. Perhaps the builders based the relief on an imported engraving they had seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jesuit-built church facade is an example of plateresque, the Spanish version of the renaissance that resembled silverwork (<em>plata</em>). It is richly ornamented with scrolls, tendrils, niches, medallions, and pilasters. The facade is flanked by two low octagonal towers, which house stairwells. The fenestrations along the nave&rsquo;s exterior are decorated with cherubs wearing feathered bonnets and engaged pillars, supporting the church, with cartouches for displaying the Jesuit monogram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has five <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>. The main retablo is in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style of the 19th century. Two smaller retablos, each at the transept endings, are a mixture of styles. One has columns resembling pierced ivory pieces carved by Chinese artisans. These smaller retablos may have been pieced out of an older structure now demolished, probably from the old main altar. Part of what appears to have been a florid baroque retablo has been incorporated as the framework of the neoclassical altar. The church&rsquo;s ceiling is a burst of color and ornament, the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3426\">Canuto Avila</a>, his son Ricardo, and Raymundo Francia. These Cebuano painters, who signed their work in Loboc in 1926 and 1927, ornamented many churches of the Visayas in the 1930s. One panel commemorates the flood of 26 Nov 1876, when 400 persons were saved because they evacuated to the upper floors of the convento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of this wealth of art, heritage, and history came tumbling down on 15 Oct 2013 at 8:15 am, when a magnitude 7.2 earthquake hit Bohol and the neighboring islands, especially Cebu. The bell tower raised by the Recollects collapsed, leaving about a third standing. The church was damaged in three parts. The Recollect facade and part of the plateresque Jesuit facade collapsed. The wall at the transept crossing split so the wall between the nave and sanctuary was damaged. The upper floors of the three-story convento behind the church fell into the first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been theorized that damage was caused not only by the tremors associated with the earthquake but also by liquefaction because the church complex is sited beside the Loboc River. Water from the river would have mixed with the soil as often happens during an earthquake. This weakened the building&rsquo;s foundation. The deteriorated ground could also be attributed to the digging of the foundation for a new <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridge</a> in the 1990s. Ironically, the unfinished bridge stands today next to the ruins of the bell tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While its damage was immense, the earthquake also revealed a surprise.

Core of the church perhaps from ca 1640; <strong>convento</strong> renovated 1743, after the earthquake of that year; new facade 1748-68; third level of bell tower concluded after 1813. Allied bombing in 1945 reduced the church complex to a shell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on the lower slopes of Mt Banahaw, Lucban is best known for its Pahiyas fiesta, held annually on 15 May to honor San Isidro Labrador. Franciscans began their evangelization of the area in 1578, although a permanent minister was not assigned until 1595. The first wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> built at that time had deteriorated by 1629, when the town moved to another site. Foundations were laid for a church, tower, and convento in stone; the church was built 1630-40, while the convento was completed in 1650. The nipa roofs were replaced with tiles in 1683. A fire ravaged the complex in 1733, where only a ciborium and image of the Inmaculada Concepcion were saved. Within five years after that, the old walls were raised by about a meter. In the earthquake of 12 Jan 1743, the church facade, half of the tower, and the second floor of the convento collapsed, but the retablos were saved. A Royal Accord of 17 Sep 1743 allocated the tribute for three years toward the rebuilding of the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/328\">Majayjay</a>, Liliw, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/347\">Nagcarlan</a>, Santa Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">Tayabas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/381\">Sariaya</a>, and Lucban, and exempted the townspeople of these towns from cutting timber for the galleons for the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento was finished in 1743. In 1748 a new church facade was begun and completed 20 years later in 1768. A transept was added to the church under the direction of Capitan Santiago, a native of Atimonan. Work on the transept, its dome, and ceiling was completed in 1806. In 1812, Fr Ramon Sanchez lightened the color of the reliefs in the church to reduce their intensity. He also had the dome and other arches of the nave painted. An octagonal bell tower was built using material gathered since 1813. Fr Victorino del Moral repaired the church and added a stone staircase to the convento in 1855. On 9 Sep 1859, fire swept the town and burned the church&rsquo;s dome and the vault over the main altar. On the night of 20 Nov 1879, a typhoon destroyed part of the town. Five years later, in a letter of 8 Jul 1884, Fr Victor Lopez reported that he found both church and town in the most deplorable state. In 1893, Fr Garcia Clemente roofed the convento with galvanized iron. In 1945, American planes bombarded the church complex on the supposition that Japanese troops had taken position in it. The Lucban Church is a mere shell of its former self.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade is distinctive because of its repetitive use of arches for ornament. Even the pediment is not the customary triangle but a series of five arches. The pinnacle is an arch and a pair of arches descend from either side of the pinnacle. The lowest arches curve into volutes. Columns decorated with flowers and foliage divide the facade into three bays while twin decorative bands separate the stories. The main entrance and windows employ Roman arches decorated at the capstone with cartouches.

The first wooden <a href=\"/2/5/244\">church</a> built at that time had deteriorated by 1629, when the town moved to another site. Foundations were laid for a church, tower, and convento in stone; the church was built 1630-40, while the convento was completed in 1650. The nipa roofs were replaced with tiles in 1683. A fire ravaged the complex in 1733, where only a ciborium and image of the Inmaculada Concepcion were saved. Within five years after that, the old walls were raised by about a meter. In the earthquake of 12 Jan 1743, the church facade, half of the tower, and the second floor of the convento collapsed, but the retablos were saved. A Royal Accord of 17 Sep 1743 allocated the tribute for three years toward the rebuilding of the churches of <a href=\"/2/8/328\">Majayjay</a>, Liliw, <a href=\"/2/8/347\">Nagcarlan</a>, Santa Cruz, <a href=\"/2/8/388\">Tayabas</a>, <a href=\"/2/8/381\">Sariaya</a>, and Lucban, and exempted the townspeople of these towns from cutting timber for the galleons for the same period."

In 1812, Fr Ramon Sanchez lightened the color of the reliefs in the church to reduce their intensity. He also had the dome and other arches of the nave painted. An octagonal bell tower was built using material gathered since 1813. Fr Victorino del Moral repaired the church and added a stone staircase to the convento in 1855. On 9 Sep 1859, fire swept the town and burned the church&#x2019;s dome and the vault over the main altar. On the night of 20 Nov 1879, a typhoon destroyed part of the town. Five years later, in a letter of 8 Jul 1884, Fr Victor Lopez reported that he found both church and town in the most deplorable state. In 1893, Fr Garcia Clemente roofed the convento with galvanized iron. In 1945, American planes bombarded the church complex on the supposition that Japanese troops had taken position in it.

Its construction must have been arduous, as indicated in an order of 1621 requiring the absentee citizens of Majayjay to return and finish the church. The church and convento were up by 1649 when they were described in a document of that year. Both were burned along with the rest of the town in 1660. Since the walls were of stone, however, reconstruction work was not considerable. By 1707 the church was in danger of collapsing. The parish priest Jose de Puertollano conceived of sandwiching the extant walls in brick, an idea that took 20 years to complete, resulting in much disharmony between the parish and its parishioners. Considering the immensity of the church and the paucity of its population, residents continued to &ldquo;absent&rdquo; themselves from the town.

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malabon, formerly called Tambobong, was founded as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of Tondo by the Augustinian chapter of 21 May 1599. Ancient maps depict Tambobong as a settlement beside the sea, fronting present-day Dagat-dagatan and almost completely surrounded by esteros; thus the villages that comprised Malabon, namely Navotas and Maysilo, were then called islands. The chapter of 23 Oct 1607 confirmed Malabon&rsquo;s status as a visita and ordered the prior of Tondo to assign to it a priest when possible.

Built ca 1796.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malaca&ntilde;an Palace was the official residence of the Spanish governor-generals from 1863 to 1898, the American governor-generals from 1898 to 1935, and the Philippine presidents from 1935 to 1986. In 1986 it was declared a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1762, the Sitio de Malaca&ntilde;an (locality of Malaca&ntilde;an), then a Royal estate, was granted to Don Antonio Dias Conde as a reward for his service to the King. In 1796, Don Luis Rocha bought the auctioned property and made it a summer villa. The house was made of stone and set amid tropical gardens. Don Jose Miguel Fomento acquired the property in 1802 and made further improvements, including a pavilion and a pool. In 1825, Gov-Gen Juan Antonio Martinez bought the property to make it the governor&rsquo;s rest house. It was then called Campo de Malaca&ntilde;an (district of Malaca&ntilde;an). In 1847, the buildings were repaired under the supervision of architect Don Juan Mendoza y Grajals. Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria renamed the estate Posesion de Malaca&ntilde;an (Malaca&ntilde;an estate). For the next 15 years it was the governor&rsquo;s summer residence. A description of the house during this period mentions carved beams, doors from floor to ceiling, and walls decorated with mirrors and lamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">governor general&rsquo;s palace</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> was destroyed in 1863, Malaca&ntilde;an became the official residence. A wooden two-story building was constructed behind the original house. Staff quarters, stables, carriage sheds, and a boat landing were also built. In 1869, the residence was renovated in preparation for the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh, but an earthquake weakened the building, and the Duke had to stay elsewhere. From then on Malaca&ntilde;an became a victim of typhoons, earthquakes, and fires. Repairs were undertaken in 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, 1875 to 1879, and 1880.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improvements from 1875 to 1879 included <strong>azoteas</strong>, galleries, stairways, the relocation of the dining room, and the construction of a new wing. The house had to be repaired after the 1880 earthquake. The governor had to live in the riding school on the premises. In 1885, the house was renovated to prepare it for the visit of Prince Oscar of Sweden. In 1886, the azotea was rebuilt. In 1887, two chandeliers were installed in the grand salon.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Turn-of-the-century photographs show Malaca&ntilde;an as a large wooden two-story house with steep roofs, sliding <strong>capiz</strong> shutters, azoteas, and verandas. Rooms were provided with punkahs, large manually operated ceiling fans. From the balcony facing the Pasig River, the governor watched the boat races held on the king&rsquo;s birthday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further improvements were undertaken by the American governor-generals. In 1904, the grounds were raised by about 0.5 m, a new river wall was built, and new fountains were installed. The dining room was renovated during the term of Gov-Gen William Cameron Forbes. A major addition was the Executive Building, built in 1921, during the incumbency of Gov-Gen Leonard Wood, to house the governor&rsquo;s office. The governor had previously held office at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\">Ayuntamiento</a> (Governor-General&rsquo;s Building) in Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1929, Gov-Gen Dwight Davis commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> to redesign the interior and exterior of the palace without altering the original style and features. Davis, after whom the Davis Cup is named, also had a tennis court built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1930s, the magnificent crystal chandeliers made in Czechoslovakia were installed. The social hall and a chapel were constructed, and the development of Malaca&ntilde;an Park, across the Pasig River, was begun during the term of Pres Manuel L. Quezon, 1935-1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, during the term of Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, the second floor of the Executive Building was cleared of offices and converted into the Maharlika Hall. In 1975, a guesthouse was built at the south end of the premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1978, the residential wing of Malaca&ntilde;an was totally rebuilt. The exterior walls were moved forward. The building was reconstructed with steel and reinforced concrete, and was completely air-conditioned. Windows were covered with bulletproof glass. The old reception hall was completely altered. A large enclosed ceremonial hall was built on what used to be the verandas, azoteas, and the old ceremonial hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bedrooms of the President and the First Lady and the rest of the private quarters were enlarged. The major features of Malaca&ntilde;an are the Executive Building, the Heroes&rsquo; Hall (formerly Social Hall), the Grand Staircase, the Reception Hall, the Ceremonial Hall, the State Dining Room, the President&rsquo;s Study, and the Music Room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, and Macapagal presidencies, Malaca&ntilde;an underwent various uses. Corazon Aquino did not want to live in Malaca&ntilde;an because of its association with Marcos. She lived in a Malaca&ntilde;an guesthouse on Arlegui St, and renovated the former San Miguel Brewery, acquired during the Marcos era, to serve as the new Executive House. The 1991 Executive House was renamed Kalayaan Hall and Malaca&ntilde;an became a museum that exposed the excess of the Marcoses. Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino to the presidency, restored Malaca&ntilde;an to its former function by returning to Malaca&ntilde;an and using Marcos&rsquo;s office. He repaired the palace that had been damaged by typhoons that had caused the roof to leak. His successor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> decided to take residence at the Premier Guest House and improved it as a residence and office. The interior of Malaca&ntilde;an was refurbished. But Estrada&rsquo;s presidency proved short. On 20 Jan 2001, he was forced out of office and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took over as president. She renovated Malaca&ntilde;an, cleaning it of the personal effects of the Marcos family and turned these over to the Presidential Commission on Good Government. She had a Presidential Briefing Room similar to the White House Situation Room constructed. She recovered historic furniture, restored Kalayaan Hall, and spruced up the garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the Pasig is Malaca&ntilde;an Park and the headquarters of the Presidential Security Group (PSG). The park was built by Pres Quezon as a rest house and venue for informal activities. Juan Arellano designed the house in the 1930s but over time it underwent renovation. During the Macapagal presidency, First Lady Eva Macapagal refurbished the park and named the house Bahay Pangarap. Under Pres Ramos, Bahay Pangarap was transformed to a clubhouse of the Malaca&ntilde;an Golf Club. In 2008, under Arroyo, the house was demolished and replaced by a new one designed by Conrad Onglao. The Commonwealth era swimming pool was likewise replaced. When Pres Benigno Aquino III decided to reside in Bahay Pangarap, the one-bedroom house was renovated to a four-bedroom residence to accommodate a guest room, a room for the household staff, and one for the PSG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The works of art in Malaca&ntilde;an include <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2253\"><strong>El Pacto de Sangre</strong></a></strong></em></strong> (The Blood Compact) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2157\"><strong><em>La Bulaque&ntilde;a</em></strong></a> (A Lass from Bulacan, now in the National Museum) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2318\"><strong><em>El Violoncellista</em></strong></a> (The Cellist) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\">Miguel Zaragoza</a>; portraits of Columbus, Magellan, Cortes, and del Cano by unknown artists; <strong><em>Pista sa Nayon</em></strong> (Rural Fiesta) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>; a rural scene painted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>; and portraits of the Philippine Presidents since 1898. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

The 1991 Executive House was renamed Kalayaan Hall and Malaca&#xF1;an became a museum that exposed the excess of the Marcoses. Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino to the presidency, restored Malaca&#xF1;an to its former function by returning to Malaca&#xF1;an and using Marcos&#x2019;s office. He repaired the palace that had been damaged by typhoons that had caused the roof to leak. His successor <a href=\"/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> decided to take residence at the Premier Guest House and improved it as a residence and office. The interior of Malaca&#xF1;an was refurbished. But Estrada&#x2019;s presidency proved short. On 20 Jan 2001, he was forced out of office and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took over as president. She renovated Malaca&#xF1;an, cleaning it of the personal effects of the Marcos family and turned these over to the Presidential Commission on Good Government. She had a Presidential Briefing Room similar to the White House Situation Room constructed. She recovered historic furniture, restored Kalayaan Hall, and spruced up the garden."

During the Macapagal presidency, First Lady Eva Macapagal refurbished the park and named the house Bahay Pangarap. Under Pres Ramos, Bahay Pangarap was transformed to a clubhouse of the Malaca&#xF1;an Golf Club. In 2008, under Arroyo, the house was demolished and replaced by a new one designed by Conrad Onglao. The Commonwealth era swimming pool was likewise replaced. When Pres Benigno Aquino III decided to reside in Bahay Pangarap, the one-bedroom house was renovated to a four-bedroom residence to accommodate a guest room, a room for the household staff, and one for the PSG."

		"text": "<p>Also known as Rizal Church. Roman Catholic Parish Church of San Raymundo de Pe&ntilde;afort. Location: Malaueg, now Rizal, Cagayan. Begun 1617.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name Malaueg refers both to the original name of the present-day town of Rizal and to the language spoken by its inhabitants. Malaueg/Rizal is the southwesternmost town of Cagayan Province. It is only 8 km from the border of Apayao Province further west on the national road. The town stands above a curve of the Matalag River, whence its name, according to an old source: &ldquo;Matalag&rdquo; (name of the river) and &ldquo;ueg&rdquo; (local word for river). The Matalag River in turn links the highlands of Apayao with the Chico River, itself joined to the mighty Cagayan River at the junction of Nassiping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This town represents the largest concentration of speakers of Malaueg, an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>-related language. It is the largest Christian settlement in the greater Itawes/Apayao area. The area figures prominently in local oral lore. Just another river bend to the east is barrio Mauanan&mdash;the mountains on each side of the river were the lairs of Biuag and Malana, mythical atlases who hurled coconut trunks at each other across the ravine.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Attempts at Christianization began very early in the 17th century. A native named Pagulayan made repeated visits to Lal-lo, the seat of the Dominican enterprise in Cagayan, for missionaries. Pagulayan was baptized Luis in 1606, and the ministry of Malaueg was formally accepted by the Dominicans on 26 Apr 1608. The laying of the first stone for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> on 21 Nov 1617 was officiated by no less than the bishop of Nueva Segovia and the Dominican Provincial. A year later an earthquake cracked the walls, but, Pagulayan and his sister, who was baptized Luisa Balinan, raised support for the church&rsquo;s construction. A future saint visited Malaueg in the person of Francisco Fernandez de Capillas, who signed in the baptismal books in 1633 (this Dominican missionary was martyred in China in 1648 and canonized in 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fire ravaged the church and <strong>convento</strong> on 22 Jan 1641. Ten years later, on 12 Mar 1651, the renovated church was blessed. A new apse was built inside the old apse, indicating that this old apse&mdash;and virtually the rest of the church and convento, with their homogenous stonework&mdash;could be part of the structure begun in 1617. The insertion of a &ldquo;new&rdquo; apse inside the original fabric between 1641 and 1651 could imply a decrease in population&mdash;or that the pioneer missionaries had been overly optimistic. Nevertheless, the early 20th century historian Fr. Julian Malumbres named this church as the largest in Cagayan in its time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the church and convento were built of masonry using oblong or round river stones of various sizes. Intriguingly, the exterior of the southern wall of the nave (to the left as one faces the facade) has conserved its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> or protective lime covering to a great degree. In contrast, there is hardly any palitada left on the northern wall and the stones are exposed to the elements. As a testament to the masonry of the 17th century, the stonework has not eroded despite the exposure to the elements. By 1651, the technology of making bricks must have been introduced. Bricks bridge the gap between the old and new apses, and there are brick motifs on the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade was conceived on the simplest pattern: a quadrangular lower level topped by a triangular pediment. A stark cross on a triangular base flanked by two smaller triangles is the only decoration on the pediment. A pair of niches in brick flanks the doorway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baptistry&rsquo;s thin walls and unusual location, jutting out of the northern wall roughly at the midpoint of the nave, hint that it was built at a different time and for a different purpose. It may have been built as a temporary chapel while the rest of the church was being built. Its northernmost wall may have been left open such that the chapel faced the field (today&rsquo;s playground and garden) where the parishioners would congregate. If this is confirmed, it is linked to the famous Latin American <strong>capillas&nbsp;</strong><strong>abiertas</strong> which were open-air structures for large gatherings of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the right of the facade is the bell tower, which in its squatness and quadrangular plan resembles those in Tuao and Lalloc, which were also built in the 17th century. Left of the facade is an ancient convento, masked by a modern concrete school. Both levels are of stone; the absence of beam extensions on the upper floor indicates the absence of a <strong>volada</strong> or cantilevered gallery typical of later Fil-Hispanic conventos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> is a re-composition of the hardwood remnants of the original altarpiece. The presence of the <strong>estipite</strong>, a motif based on an inverted obelisk, dates this altarpiece to the middle or late 1700s. At about this time there was a renewed &ldquo;building boom&rdquo; throughout the Cagayan Valley. The largest bell in the church, dating from 1793, also points to a new wave of prosperity in Malaueg. The small collection of wooden religious images provides a tantalizing glimpse of Cagayan colonial statuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church complex of Malaueg survived into the 20th century, preserved from the bombings and earthquakes that devastated colonial churches and edifices throughout the Valley. It was roofless for an unknown length of time. A marker was installed by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">Philippines Historical Committee</a> in 1939. In 1951 administration of the parish was assigned to the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (CICM) and aid from Belgium helped <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restore</a> the church. Malaueg church is arguably the most intact early 17th-century monument outside Manila. It was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> on 31 Jul 2001. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Castillet, Ed. 1960. <i>Cagayan Province and Her People</i>.

				"value": "Most of the church and convento were built of masonry using oblong or round river stones of various sizes. Intriguingly, the exterior of the southern wall of the nave (to the left as one faces the facade) has conserved its <a href=\"/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> or protective lime covering to a great degree. In contrast, there is hardly any palitada left on the northern wall and the stones are exposed to the elements. As a testament to the masonry of the 17th century, the stonework has not eroded despite the exposure to the elements. By 1651, the technology of making bricks must have been introduced. Bricks bridge the gap between the old and new apses, and there are brick motifs on the facade."

				"value": "The baptistry&#x2019;s thin walls and unusual location, jutting out of the northern wall roughly at the midpoint of the nave, hint that it was built at a different time and for a different purpose. It may have been built as a temporary chapel while the rest of the church was being built. Its northernmost wall may have been left open such that the chapel faced the field (today&#x2019;s playground and garden) where the parishioners would congregate. If this is confirmed, it is linked to the famous Latin American <strong>capillas&#xA0;</strong><strong>abiertas</strong> which were open-air structures for large gatherings of people."

Left of the facade is an ancient convento, masked by a modern concrete school. Both levels are of stone; the absence of beam extensions on the upper floor indicates the absence of a <strong>volada</strong> or cantilevered gallery typical of later Fil-Hispanic conventos."

The presence of the <strong>estipite</strong>, a motif based on an inverted obelisk, dates this altarpiece to the middle or late 1700s. At about this time there was a renewed &#x201C;building boom&#x201D; throughout the Cagayan Valley. The largest bell in the church, dating from 1793, also points to a new wave of prosperity in Malaueg. The small collection of wooden religious images provides a tantalizing glimpse of Cagayan colonial statuary."

Location: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, Manila. Present cathedral built in 1954-58. Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\">Fernando Ocampo Sr<strong>.</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A royal decree of 13 May 1579 ordered that a cathedral of moderate cost be built in Manila where most convenient. Eight years earlier, on 24 Jan 1571, the feast of St John the Baptist, the conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi founded the city of Manila, formerly, the native settlement of Rajah Sulayman, which he had taken possession of on 19 May. Because it was the feast of Santa Potenciana, she was chosen patroness of the new settlement. When founding the city, Legazpi demarcated the city lots, setting aside a parcel of land for the church under the patronage of La Purisima Inmaculada Concepcion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan de Vivero, who baptized Rajah Matanda, arrived in 1566 as chaplain of the&nbsp;<em>nao&nbsp;</em><em>San Geronimo</em>, bringing colonists and troops to bolster Spanish presence. Given special faculties and privileges by the Archbishop of Mexico to establish the spiritual administration of the new Philippine colony, he prepared Manila for the appointment and arrival of its first bishop. Later, Vivero would be appointed as the first vicar-general and the first ecclesiastical judge of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivero had the Church of the Inmaculada built and from it the religious affairs of Manila were administered. Although the earliest structure was a construction of nipa and bamboo, in the manner of vernacular architecture, it became the parish church of Manila. The secular priest Juan de Villanueva was appointed as first parish priest. The other priests who served the parish were Juan de Vivaneta and Nicolas Riccio.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This church, and Manila with it, was threatened on 30 Nov 1574, the feast of St Andrew the Apostle, when the city was attacked by the Chinese Limahong. Fighting was intense during which Martin de Goiti was killed. The timely return of Juan Salcedo, who had been sent to establish settlements north of Manila, changed the tide of battle. The Spanish forces quelled Limahong&rsquo;s army. Limahong and his invading troops fled to Pangasinan, where they were pursued by Spanish troops but were able to escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila celebrated the victory with fireworks and a mass with sermon was held in the Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception in Manila. San Andres was named patron of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To prepare for the arrival of its first bishop, Vivero rebuilt the bamboo and nipa church, this time with timber and more durable material in compliance with a royal decree of 13 May 1579 that a cathedral of moderate cost be built in Manila when and where most convenient. The church was being prepared to receive the new bishop, Fray Domingo de Salazar, OP, whose appointment was issued in 1579, but it would take two years more for him to arrive in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sep 1581, Salazar, with a group of Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries and a host of other Spaniards, arrived at the Bicol peninsula. From there they decided to take a journey to Manila. It took the party a good month of travel to reach Manila. Arriving in Manila, Salazar saw the cathedral being finished. On 21 Dec 1581, he saw its completion. The first church was a modest construction of wood, bamboo, and nipa, which was given the titular Inmaculada Concepcion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This church was damaged in August 1583 when a fire swept through Manila. A temporary church of wood replaced the damaged structure until it was ruined by a typhoon on 15 Jun 1588. A royal decree of 20 Jan the previous year ordered Gov-Gen Santiago de Vera to commence construction of a new church, but nothing was done until the incumbency of Gov-Gen Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as. Antonio de Morga reports that a cathedral of masonry was built in 1591 by Dasmari&ntilde;as. However, a report of 1597 states that as of this year the cathedral had no bell tower, baptistery, chapter hall or cloister. The earthquakes of 1599 and 31 Dec 1600 ruined the church completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second cathedral was conceived during the reign of the third archbishop of Manila Fray Miguel Benavidez, who initiated the project upon his assumption of office in 1603. Work was suspended upon his death in 1605. In 1610 his successor Don Diego Vazques de Mercado ordered the resumption of work. The same bishop solemnly consecrated the cathedral on 5 Dec 1614. The cathedral of this era was made of stone. It had 3 naves, 7 chapels including the main one, and 10 altars. It lasted until 1 Aug 1621, when a strong earthquake fractured its walls and pillars and damaged its roof so that it was too dangerous even to enter the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task of reconstruction fell upon Don Pedro Flavia, appointed as interim governor of the archdiocese. On 30 Nov 1645 another earthquake damaged the structure beyond repair so that it was necessary to build a temporary structure of wood in the plaza fronting the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the reign of Abp Miguel de Poblete, the cornerstone for the third cathedral was laid on 20 Apr 1659. The structure was not completed within Poblete&rsquo;s lifetime, although he willed his estate toward the construction of the church. In 1671 the&nbsp;<em>capilla mayor&nbsp;</em>(larger or main chapel) was completed and dedicated, but the sacristy and other offices were still undergoing construction in 1676. Poblete&rsquo;s cathedral had three naves, which were separated by a row of six pairs of piers. These piers were not perfect squares but had set back corners in the manner of early <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Romanesque</a> architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the reign of Abp Don Diego Camacho y Avila, 1697-1706, the two sacristies, chapter hall, and other offices were completed. Work on the belfry had begun. The archbishop requested the king for funds to complete the structure. The six-story bell tower was constructed by a Chinese mason, Dionisio Saplan, in 1706. Further repairs were done on the complex as the annual rains caused the deterioration of the woodwork. The completed cathedral was simple. Eight chapels flanked the nave: four to the right and three to the left, and a larger chapel, the&nbsp;<em>sagrario&nbsp;</em>(sanctuary of the Blessed Sacrament), with its own sacristy. The church had no transept or apse, and the sacristy was located behind the altar area. Other rooms in the complex included rooms for the sacristans and storerooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1737, during Fr Juan Angel Rodriguez&rsquo;s reign, the cupola of the cathedral was torn down and replaced by one of bricks. The nave was also repaired at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the incumbency of Fr Pedro de Santo de la Santisima Trinidad, the cathedral was almost thoroughly rebuilt following the plans of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2654\">Juan de Uguccioni</a>, a Theatine priest architect. Uguccioni proposed an almost total renovation. His plan involved raising the floor level of the church for aesthetic and health reasons, demolishing the last two piers of the main nave and the rooms behind the altar to build an apse and transept. The architect built two piers at the transept to carry a semicircular dome. He demolished the upper portion of the nave wall to build a clerestory; both dome and clerestory allowed light into the church. He left two chapels of the total seven small ones and expanded the sagrario by eliminating the storerooms, rooms for the sacristans, and the patio in the old plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uguccioni gave the cathedral a facade similar in temper to the Il Gesu in Rome, without the outer bays. The execution of his plan was entrusted to Esteban Rojas y Melon, but upon the archbishop&rsquo;s death in 1755, work was suspended due to lack of funds. The cathedral was not entirely complete when it was dedicated on 8 Dec 1760 by Abp Manuel Antonio Rojo. It was completed in 1771, when the archbishop sent a report on the expenses incurred to the Crown. The cathedral collapsed during the earthquake of 3 Jun 1863.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fifth cathedral was not started until 1872, when the architects <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>, Vicente Serrano y Salaverri, and Eduardo Lopez Navarro began working on it, apparently in succession. The cathedral hewed closely to the Uguccioni plan, although the number of side chapels beginning right of the entrance was increased. The squarish capitals of the chapel were replaced by clusters of four columns. The plan of the church was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Byzantine</a>&mdash;its tall nave and clerestory were similar to those early Christian Byzantine basilicas. Its details combined elements from different styles (i.e., the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> dome, Romanesque tympanum and rose window, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> recessed portal). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> designed and executed the decorations on this elegant portal. The bell tower, a six-tiered polygon, was a detached structure connected by a corridor to the facade. The cathedral was blessed on 8 Dec 1879. An earthquake in Jul 1880 ruined the bell tower, which was later renovated as a four-story structure. The church was bombed by American planes during the Battle of Manila in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1954 to 1958, the sixth cathedral was built on the same site as the former one. Construction began under the incumbency of Abp Rufino Santos, later made first Cardinal of Manila, using funds from private donations and war reparation money. The new cathedral was designed by Fernando Ocampo Sr. The cruciform and triple nave plan already seen in Uguccioni&rsquo;s cathedral was retained. The tiered bell tower was replaced by a simple straight tower with a belfry. The church was vaulted and its interior faced with marble and travertine. The clerestory was replaced with stained glass depicting the history of Christianization in the Philippines, famous images of the Virgin, coats of arms of the state and prelates, and the works of mercy. Artist in residence <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a> designed the stained glass. Chapels tucked into the arcades along the lateral naves completed the nave. Each of these chapels was carefully decorated; one chapel, donated by Spain, had abstract windows of red stained glass and modern appurtenances of cast bronze. The facade, saved from the destruction of war, was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a>. Bronze doors cast in Italy depicted symbols of the Virgin Mary and the history of the cathedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Jubilee year 2000, a door of the Manila Cathedral was designated as the jubilee door. Beginning in 2002, in preparation for the golden jubilee of the Cathedral&rsquo;s restoration in 2008, major structural repairs and renovations were done on the church fabric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Dec 2003, some of the work done involved repairs on the water system of the cathedral, rehabilitation of its air-conditioning system, and the repair of the cathedral office. Some works involved face-lifting, such as installation of the Papal coat of arms at the facade and at the dome area of the Cathedral as befits a Basilica Minore, improved lighting, and improvement of the Episcopal throne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a new Cardinal, Luis Tagle, assumed office, a thorough review of the cathedral was made because despite the renovations done beginning in 2002, the cathedral showed signs of weakening. Fearing its destruction in case of an earthquake, a thorough retrofit of the cathedral was inaugurated. Part of the cause for the damage of the cathedral was its site near the sea, in Intramuros. The whole area of Intramuros is affected by a shallow water table, which during the rainy season gets even shallower and when saturated results in flooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, it was decided that the cathedral should be temporarily closed. Early in 2012, the cathedral was closed. From 7 Feb 2012 to 9 Ap 2014, the Parish Church of San Fernando de Dilao (Paco) was designated as provisional cathedral. Work began on reinforcing the cathedral&rsquo;s foundations and strengthening its pillars and column before working on its external finish and face-lift, which included installing a new and more efficient air-conditioning system and better lighting. The retrofit and repairs were completed in 2014. The cathedral reopened Apr 9 Wednesday, just before Holy Week. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

His plan involved raising the floor level of the church for aesthetic and health reasons, demolishing the last two piers of the main nave and the rooms behind the altar to build an apse and transept. The architect built two piers at the transept to carry a semicircular dome. He demolished the upper portion of the nave wall to build a clerestory; both dome and clerestory allowed light into the church.

Burnham</a>&rsquo;s plan for Manila allocated a lot, 152.40 m x 182.88 m along Manila Bay at the north end of the Luneta, as the site for a hotel that would serve the needs of Americans in the Philippines, particularly tourists. The building was officially inaugurated on 4 Jul 1912, although it had actually been in operation some time before that. Some rooms later served as residences for American government officials, among them Justice George Malcolm and Maj Dwight Eisenhower, the latter then in the staff of Gen Douglas MacArthur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The five-story building was H-shaped and originally had 149 guest rooms on the second up to the fifth floors. For purposes of ventilation, the rooms were on one side of a corridor and were provided with large windows. Some rooms opened out to balconies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the hotel&rsquo;s popularity, an annex with 80 rooms was subsequently built on the bay side.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The lobby was a hall about 8 m deep and 45 m wide, with an inner arcade composed of semicircular arches resting on coupled columns in the Tuscan or Roman Doric style. At the west end of the lobby was the dining room, surrounded by a veranda. Along the lobby towards the dining room were the ladies&rsquo; parlor and rest rooms. At the east end were the reading room, billiard room, bar, cigar counter, barbershop, and men&rsquo;s rest rooms. On the mezzanine were the music room, guests&rsquo; parlor, and children&rsquo;s dining room. One of the hotel&rsquo;s attractions was its roof garden. The Manila Hotel was the first hotel in Asia equipped with electric elevators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Burnham&rsquo;s recommendations, the building was of reinforced concrete, with flat unadorned exterior walls. While modern in appearance, it evoked the style of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial period</a>, with prominent hip roofs, wide overhangs, rectangular windows on the upper floors, and semicircular arches on the ground floor. Sliding window shutters with capiz panes gave the structure a distinctly Filipino character. The building then cost 1.4 million pesos or $700,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1934, a vast ballroom, the Fiesta Pavilion, was built on the bay side, extending from the dining room. It soon became the center of Manila&rsquo;s social life and also the venue of political gatherings. Heavily damaged during World War II, the hotel underwent repairs and resumed operations in late 1945. The repairs took two years to complete. In 1950 the hotel inaugurated the Winter Garden, an air-conditioned ballroom located at the rear and along the bay. Further improvements were made in 1954. The Fiesta Pavilion housed the 1971 Constitutional Convention. The dining room was later converted into a foyer for the pavilion, and was adorned with murals by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Francisco</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975, the hotel was renovated following plans prepared by Leandro Locsin. Since the original building could not house additional rooms, an 18-story tower was built behind the central section of the building. The hotel has at present 600 rooms and suites. The lobby was expanded and the original dining room was restored and refurbished. The old Fiesta Pavilion was demolished and a new pavilion built at the rear on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> side, provided with its own entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New function rooms were added. The firm of Dale Keller and Associates was engaged for the interior design. The exterior retained the original white-and-green color scheme of Parsons. A wrought-iron porte cochere was erected at the main entrance. In its refurbished form, the Manila Hotel became a felicitous combination of Parsons&rsquo;s austere proto-modern style and Locsin&rsquo;s elegant, romantic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) placed the property for sale. Under new ownership, Manila Hotel underwent renovation in 1997. Beginning in 2008, the hotel underwent even more renovations in preparation for its centennial in 2012. Room windows were enlarged, interiors were refurbished and equipped with new amenities. A health club was opened next to the hotel spa. On 17 Jan 2008, adjacent to the main building, was built Tent City, a performance and concert hall that can hold 2,500 guests. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

The dining room was later converted into a foyer for the pavilion, and was adorned with murals by <a href=\"/3/3/3550\">Carlos &#x201C;Botong&#x201D;<strong> </strong>Francisco</a>."

Since the original building could not house additional rooms, an 18-story tower was built behind the central section of the building. The hotel has at present 600 rooms and suites. The lobby was expanded and the original dining room was restored and refurbished. The old Fiesta Pavilion was demolished and a new pavilion built at the rear on the <a href=\"/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> side, provided with its own entrance."

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Asuncion. Location: Maragondon, Cavite. Begun around 1687, completed 1714 under the Jesuits; renovations under secular clergy, first half of 19th century, and under the Augustinian Recollects, 1880s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franciscans were the first evangelizers in the area around Maragondon, the most important community then in northwest Cavite. By 1611 Maragondon was under the Jesuits, separated as a town in this year from Silang by the Jesuit Angelo Armano. In 1630, a second <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> with more elaborate furnishings was completed. In 1633, a new and bigger church was built to replace the older and smaller one. The church was apparently of stone, for sometime between 1646 and 1649 the government ordered its demolition for fear that the Dutch, who were at war with Spain, would use it and other churches near Manila for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortification</a>. The orders were apparently implemented because, on 16 May 1650, a license was given to the Jesuits to build a house and church of wood in Maragondon to replace the one that had been demolished. Repairs were made on the <strong>convento</strong> between 1666 and 1672. In 1687, another church was begun although the construction was interrupted; only in 1714 was it completed. Most of the church, the entire bell tower, and the lower portion of the convento are all of chipped rubblework; the inside and outside walls are covered with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> (stucco).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church was repaired a number of times but data on the renovations are sketchy. At the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Philippines in 1768, Maragondon was turned over to the secular clergy. The secular priest Anastacio de los Reyes provided the church with new roof beams, emblazoning them with praises to the Virgin Mary and topping it off by having his name carved along with the date the work was inaugurated. This would correspond with the raising of the facade with cut stone, as revealed in a recent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a>. The Archbishop of Manila had to admonish Fr de los Reyes from spending too much on his church. A year after their return to the Philippines in 1859, the Jesuits were assigned the Recollect missions in Mindanao. To compensate the Recollects, they in turn were given the secular-administered churches around Manila. Maragondon was the last in Cavite to be relinquished, which in the 1880s had been more than a century under the seculars. After 1886 the Recollects added windows with colored glass panes, and set these in a wooden frame decorated with a partridge on a plate, the attribute of San Nicolas de Tolentino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade is chastely ornamented with tapering buttresses supporting it. In contrast is the door, divided into squares featuring carved floral designs of different shapes, ships, and castles, all probably references to the patroness of the church. To the facade&rsquo;s left is a tall bell tower which uniquely has no clear divisions between the stories. It is a single shaft tapering upwards, ending in finials at the corners, and surmounted by a rounded roof. The elevation of the facade is emphasized in the interior by the use of pilasters that taper upwards. This produces a dizzying effect, as the pillars appear to soar up and sway. The door leading from sanctuary to sacristy is also carved with flowers in squares. This design motif can also be found in the doors of the churches in Indang, Cavite and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, Bohol. Probably the doors came from the same atelier. The church has three <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>, all brightly polychromed. The main retablo has an image of the Virgin&rsquo;s assumption in the main niche. An image of a balding and somewhat rotund San Ignacio flanks it, and so does an image of San Luis Gonzaga. The whole retablo is decorated with salomonica or twisted columns, foliage, and angels with large bellies. The side retablos have lost their original statuary, and new ones have replaced what have been lost. The gospel-side retablo that used to house the Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Ternate might belong to the late 17th or early 18th century. An octagonal pulpit at the right side of the nave is polychromed in red, blue, gold, and green. Monograms of the names of Jesus and Mary decorate the pulpit panels. Salomonica columns flank the borders of each panel. The bottom of the pulpit is decorated with swirling foliage that end in an inverted pineapple. A crucifix dated 1712 is found near the church&rsquo;s main entrance. The lower part of the convento is older than the rest of the building, being made of rubble like the church and tower; the newer part is of cut stone and brick. The sacristy is a 19th century addition. There are remains of an old defensive wall and a blockhouse that surrounds the quadrangle formed by the church and convento. A rare vaulted cistern or bodega at one end of the convento still standing in the 1980s has since been demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has been renovated since 1991. Among the welcome changes when repainting the retablo was the decision to remove the embroidered dress imposed over the fully carved image in the round. On 31 Jul 2001, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> awarded Maragondon the title National Cultural Treasure. In 2012, the church&rsquo;s historic look was restored with the protective plastering of the walls.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Most of the church, the entire bell tower, and the lower portion of the convento are all of chipped rubblework; the inside and outside walls are covered with <a href=\"/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> (stucco)."

At the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Philippines in 1768, Maragondon was turned over to the secular clergy. The secular priest Anastacio de los Reyes provided the church with new roof beams, emblazoning them with praises to the Virgin Mary and topping it off by having his name carved along with the date the work was inaugurated. This would correspond with the raising of the facade with cut stone, as revealed in a recent <a href=\"/2/6/255\">restoration</a>. The Archbishop of Manila had to admonish Fr de los Reyes from spending too much on his church. A year after their return to the Philippines in 1859, the Jesuits were assigned the Recollect missions in Mindanao. To compensate the Recollects, they in turn were given the secular-administered churches around Manila. Maragondon was the last in Cavite to be relinquished, which in the 1880s had been more than a century under the seculars. After 1886 the Recollects added windows with colored glass panes, and set these in a wooden frame decorated with a partridge on a plate, the attribute of San Nicolas de Tolentino."

				"value": "The facade is chastely ornamented with tapering buttresses supporting it. In contrast is the door, divided into squares featuring carved floral designs of different shapes, ships, and castles, all probably references to the patroness of the church. To the facade&#x2019;s left is a tall bell tower which uniquely has no clear divisions between the stories. It is a single shaft tapering upwards, ending in finials at the corners, and surmounted by a rounded roof. The elevation of the facade is emphasized in the interior by the use of pilasters that taper upwards. This produces a dizzying effect, as the pillars appear to soar up and sway. The door leading from sanctuary to sacristy is also carved with flowers in squares. This design motif can also be found in the doors of the churches in Indang, Cavite and <a href=\"/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, Bohol. Probably the doors came from the same atelier. The church has three <a href=\"/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>, all brightly polychromed. The main retablo has an image of the Virgin&#x2019;s assumption in the main niche. An image of a balding and somewhat rotund San Ignacio flanks it, and so does an image of San Luis Gonzaga. The whole retablo is decorated with salomonica or twisted columns, foliage, and angels with large bellies. The side retablos have lost their original statuary, and new ones have replaced what have been lost. The gospel-side retablo that used to house the Santo Ni&#xF1;o de Ternate might belong to the late 17th or early 18th century. An octagonal pulpit at the right side of the nave is polychromed in red, blue, gold, and green. Monograms of the names of Jesus and Mary decorate the pulpit panels. Salomonica columns flank the borders of each panel. The bottom of the pulpit is decorated with swirling foliage that end in an inverted pineapple. A crucifix dated 1712 is found near the church&#x2019;s main entrance. The lower part of the convento is older than the rest of the building, being made of rubble like the church and tower; the newer part is of cut stone and brick. The sacristy is a 19th century addition. There are remains of an old defensive wall and a blockhouse that surrounds the quadrangle formed by the church and convento. A rare vaulted cistern or bodega at one end of the convento still standing in the 1980s has since been demolished."

Taking these details of the built structures and the natural location, one gets an impression that in fact Maribojoc was a well-fortified site. But who chose the site and when was its defensive position recognized?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 17th century, the Jesuits were already ministering in Maribojoc. Murillo Velarde, 1751-54, reports that the Austrian Jesuit, Jose Sanchez, 1616-92, had built part of the church and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> of Maribojoc.

But which church is Murillo Velarde referring to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation date of the parish is uncertain, although the years 1767 and 1768 are cited. Redondo&rsquo;s 1886 report states that the oldest extant parish books were dated 2 Jan 1788, during the Recollect era. Maribojoc is an important parish because from it the parishes of Cortes, 1793, and Antequera, 1880, were established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Recollect era records two churches one built from 1798 to 1816 and the other later. The present church, however, was begun in 1852 and completed in 1872 under the incumbency as parish priest of Manuel Plaza, OAR, 1843-59, and Fernando Rubio, OAR, 1861-75 and 1877-84. This church built of cut coral is simple in design: a two-story structure crowned with a triangular pediment. The facade is divided into three vertical sections by paired engaged columns. Rosettes define the boundary between the first and second story. To the right of the facade, separated by a connecting corridor stands the bell tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 15 Oct 1860, Maribojoc was raised to status of a municipality. In 1864, an elegant flight of steps from church to wharf was completed. The stairs are still there. The church was still being furnished and decorated in the early 20th century.

The bell tower was built in 1882-83.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name Masinloc is said to be derived from the name of a type of grass,&nbsp;<em>hinloc</em>. A barangay called Kasinlocan is located some two kilometers from the town center. During the Spanish colonial period, Zambales formed the western part of Pangasinan and had not yet been divided into the provinces of Bataan and Zambales. The area was inhabited by the Zambal or Sambal, known for being warlike and distrustful of intruders. In 1606, the Augustinian Recollects (OAR) were invited by the encomendero Hernando de Avalos to evangelize the area. The first friar sent to evangelize Bagac, Fr Miguel de la Madre de Dios, OAR, was martyred by stoning while he was preaching to the hostile Zambal. The future of the Recollect mission was uncertain. But, in 1607, Fr Rodrigo de San Miguel, OAR, who had successfully established a vicariate at Mariveles, sent Fr Andres de Espiritu Santo to Masinloc, now Zambales Province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expansion of the Recollect missions in Bataan and Zambales was turbulent. Because of native opposition, some missions were founded, then abandoned and refounded after a while. But the Recollects, by dint of single-minded hard work, were eventually able to establish a network of missions from Subic to Mariveles and throughout Zambales. The network reached as far north as Bolinao.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1607, Fr Andres directed the building of the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> of light materials at a site now identified as Barangay Bani and Tugui, south of the present town center. But this mission did not last long due to the hostility of neighboring groups. In Playa Honda (near today&rsquo;s Iba), a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> was built to discourage enemy raids. A more permanent church and convento were built at the present site in 1616,using stones left over from the fortification. In 1679, when the Recollects were sent to evangelize Mindoro, Masinloc was turned over to the Dominicans; but, in 1713, Masinloc was returned to the Recollects. Around 1745, work by the Recollects on the church is reported, with repairs in 1754, 1756, and 1798, the year it was supposedly destroyed by an earthquake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1814 to 1836, the whole of Zambales was ceded to the secular clergy due to lack of personnel. But in 1836, the Recollects returned to Masinloc, in the person of Fr Jose Aranguren, OAR, who arrived as the new parish priest on 13 Apr. This tireless priest was largely responsible for rebuilding the church. Fr Aranguren left in 1843. Two years later, he was made Archbishop of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work on Masinloc church was continued by Fr Modesto Sesma, OAR, who arrived in Jul 1844. He had the sacristy enclosed, and provided the niches at the facade with locally made images of San Agustin, San Andres, and San Nicolas de Tolentino.The following year, he raised the walls and installed the ceiling of <strong>batikulin</strong> wood. In 1851-52, the roof was covered with tiles. The platform of the church including the main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> was finished in 1853<em>.</em>Fr Agustin Perez, OAR (parish priest ca 1877-91) is credited with having completed the church: the roof tiles were replaced with zinc sheets, the marble baptismal font was bought, and the main altar was repaired. The epistle and gospel-side altars were donated by Don Jose Gloria and Don Agustin Medina respectively; the tabernacle of white marble was donated by Do&ntilde;a Manuela Segovia. The bell tower was partially built in 1882-83.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Columbans replaced the Recollects after 1898. Fr Dennis Egan built the present convent in 1955. Masinloc was ceded to the diocesan clergy in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the original interior of the church, including a noteworthy carved wooden statue of San Andres Apostol, has been lost through time. However, the portal that used to connect the choir loft with the old convent has retained its polychrome and is the most interesting and unique feature of the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The parish church of San Andres was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> on 31 Jul 2001.

During the Spanish colonial period, Zambales formed the western part of Pangasinan and had not yet been divided into the provinces of Bataan and Zambales. The area was inhabited by the Zambal or Sambal, known for being warlike and distrustful of intruders. In 1606, the Augustinian Recollects (OAR) were invited by the encomendero Hernando de Avalos to evangelize the area. The first friar sent to evangelize Bagac, Fr Miguel de la Madre de Dios, OAR, was martyred by stoning while he was preaching to the hostile Zambal. The future of the Recollect mission was uncertain. But, in 1607, Fr Rodrigo de San Miguel, OAR, who had successfully established a vicariate at Mariveles, sent Fr Andres de Espiritu Santo to Masinloc, now Zambales Province."

The network reached as far north as Bolinao."

In 1679, when the Recollects were sent to evangelize Mindoro, Masinloc was turned over to the Dominicans; but, in 1713, Masinloc was returned to the Recollects.

Built 1786-97.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mission station of Miag-ao was declared an independent parish in 1731, at the same time that a simple <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> and convent were constructed. The town possibly got its name from the plant called&nbsp;<em>miagos&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>mayagos&nbsp;</em>which used to be abundant in the place. Its residents supported themselves through fishing, agriculture, salt-making, cattle raising, copra-making, and especially weaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The town located on a plateau by the sea was burned along with its church by pirates in 1741. A second church was burned during another such raid, probably in 1754. These events led the authorities and the Augustinian parish priest to transfer the town site to the edge of a hill, named Tacas, overlooking the sea and the Miag-ao River. The church was planned as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortress</a> in which the populace could take refuge during succeeding raids. Construction of the present building began in 1786. The foreman of the construction, a native from the nearby town of Igbaras, is remembered only as Matias. Later recalled to his hometown to build a church there, Matias was replaced by a certain Aquino, a resident of Alimodian, another nearby town. A yellow-orange sandstone was the primary building material. The splendid church was completed in 1797 and has since then withstood all the earthquakes and typhoons that have ravaged Panay, including the calamitous earthquake of 1948 which ruined many of the island&rsquo;s finest churches. The interior was burned twice: in 1898 during the Philippine Revolution against Spain and again a few years later, during the Philippine-American War. A third story was added to the right tower in 1830, which still did not raise it to the level of the four-story left tower. There is logic in the left tower being taller since it commands a magnificent view of the sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The squatness of the church, the massive pair of bell towers flanking the facade and doubling as lookout posts, and the angled buttresses, all identify the structure as a redoubtable fortress. With its sumptuously worked facade, carved tassel decorations on the cornices of the bell towers, and rocaille-festooned window frames, Miag-ao is the best example of a type of church known as &ldquo;fortress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>.&rdquo; Moreover, its facade sums up the Filipino&rsquo;s transformation of Western decorative ideas. The pediment features San Cristobal clad like a farmer with rolled-up trousers, carrying the Santo Ni&ntilde;o on his back and holding on to a lush coconut tree for support. They are flanked by guava and papaya trees, and ornamental urns adopted from <strong>vi&ntilde;etas</strong>, decorative cliches in engraved books. The cornice separating the pediment and the lower facade is interrupted by two windows and the central niche containing the patron saint. This niche, framed by fern-like C-scrolls, also bisects the Doric frieze which surprisingly appears in this <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a>-like arrangement&mdash;Doric motifs were rarely used in Philippine colonial churches. The frieze supports a blind balustrade, but the frieze is not supported by a logical system of pilasters. Moreover, it does not extend along the entire width of the pediment. Swaying secondary cornices over the two tower niches give the illusion that the facade projects in an undulating manner. Rocaille decorations flank the central portion of the facade and are intimated on other details.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">Restoration</a> work was undertaken in 1959 and in the late 1970s. However, the crenellations above the traceries marking the tiers of the towers were overlooked in these restorations. Some windows were also converted into side entrances to facilitate passage in and out the church. In recent years, a new and quasi-baroque <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> was installed. The Marillac Academy to the right of the church has taken up some of what was originally part of the church plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marker was installed in 1963 by the then <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">Philippine Historical Committee</a> and the church declared a National Historical Landmark in 1973. In 1993, the UNESCO inscribed Miag-ao Church in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">World Heritage List</a> together with three other Philippine baroque churches. Following a detailed engineering study in 2003, the church underwent cleaning and repair in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the church, Miag-ao has two other notable Spanish-era structures&mdash;the bridge called Taytay Boni and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taytay Boni was constructed in 1854. Located about a kilometer east of the poblacion, it was named after its construction foreman. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridge</a>, of stone similar to that of the church, has newel-posts topped by cone-shaped finials. With no more river running below it, the bridge has been converted into a promenade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cemetery was transferred to its present site in Cota Baybay in 1857. Commissioned by Fr Maximo Gonzales, its octagonal chapel and perimeter walls are of bricks and coral stone.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong>, with notes from Edgar Allan M.

The church was planned as a <a href=\"/2/5/232\">fortress</a> in which the populace could take refuge during succeeding raids. Construction of the present building began in 1786. The foreman of the construction, a native from the nearby town of Igbaras, is remembered only as Matias. Later recalled to his hometown to build a church there, Matias was replaced by a certain Aquino, a resident of Alimodian, another nearby town. A yellow-orange sandstone was the primary building material. The splendid church was completed in 1797 and has since then withstood all the earthquakes and typhoons that have ravaged Panay, including the calamitous earthquake of 1948 which ruined many of the island&#x2019;s finest churches. The interior was burned twice: in 1898 during the Philippine Revolution against Spain and again a few years later, during the Philippine-American War. A third story was added to the right tower in 1830, which still did not raise it to the level of the four-story left tower. There is logic in the left tower being taller since it commands a magnificent view of the sea."

The pediment features San Cristobal clad like a farmer with rolled-up trousers, carrying the Santo Ni&#xF1;o on his back and holding on to a lush coconut tree for support. They are flanked by guava and papaya trees, and ornamental urns adopted from <strong>vi&#xF1;etas</strong>, decorative cliches in engraved books. The cornice separating the pediment and the lower facade is interrupted by two windows and the central niche containing the patron saint. This niche, framed by fern-like C-scrolls, also bisects the Doric frieze which surprisingly appears in this <a href=\"/2/4/217\">rococo</a>-like arrangement&#x2014;Doric motifs were rarely used in Philippine colonial churches. The frieze supports a blind balustrade, but the frieze is not supported by a logical system of pilasters. Moreover, it does not extend along the entire width of the pediment. Swaying secondary cornices over the two tower niches give the illusion that the facade projects in an undulating manner. Rocaille decorations flank the central portion of the facade and are intimated on other details."

Morong would play a central role in the towns along the eastern coast of Laguna so that on 23 Feb 1853 it was constituted capital of a district with the same name. That district was renamed Rizal in the American period.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The present <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was built ca 1615 by Chinese masons who laid its foundations on a rock, some 10 m in height from the level of the town and the river that divides it. An earlier church, located on the opposite side of the river, was burned in 1612 with the rest of the town. The church fabric seems to have lasted for more than two centuries because there are no reports of it being destroyed or repaired until the 19th century when Bartolome Palatino from Paete worked with Fr Maximo Rico, OFM, to create a new facade. Because there was very little space on the rock where the church was built for a separate bell tower, it was decided to pull down the old facade and integrate the bell tower with the design, which is what Palatino did. He built the new facade three-stories tall, with the tower constituting the fourth story. The central vertical section bulges outwards, while the portions flanking it recede. Paired columns mark the central portion, and single columns mark the sides. Above the main entrance, shaped as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Roman</a> arch, is the window of the choir loft. Above that is a window corresponding to the third story. Both windows are flanked by pilasters and crowned by ornamented lintels. To either side of the main entrance and the choir loft are ornamented blind windows. A frieze of dentils defines the division between stories. The octagonal bell tower is pierced by windows on all sides and crowned by a dome, on top of which is a cross. Twin columns decorate the sides of the octagon. The bell tower and the lower two stories are linked by a decorative balustrade. This facade, decorated with the symbol and image of San Geronimo touching the head of a Chinese lion has been called an excellent expression of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pair of granite Chinese lions also flank the beginning of the road ascending to the church. Some of the stone statuary from the facade that had been damaged have been removed and are found in a garden along the gospel side of the apse. In front of the church is an elevated patio with a low adobe fence from colonial times, decorated at set points with pyramidal finials topped by spheres. On the side of the fence across from the facade is inscribed &ldquo;A&ntilde;o de 1696&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is shaped like a cross. Although greatly renovated after 1965, the interior has retained some of its original ornamentation and design. Noteworthy are the corbels shaped as crocodile heads supporting the choir loft. Also to be noted are the painted Stations of the Cross, the paintings of the evangelists at the pendentives supporting the cupola, and the bas-relief of Christ&rsquo;s baptism in the baptistry. The church&rsquo;s old <strong>convento</strong>, now a school, is well preserved. A modern convento is found on the other side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is uncertain when the adjoining convento on the nave&rsquo;s gospel side was built but details of construction suggest that it or part of it may be as old as the church. The nave is pierced by openings, some serving as <strong>tribunas</strong> or balconies that are accessible through the convento. One narrow opening previously functioned as the way to the pulpit, which is now missing. Such an arrangement is found in another Franciscan church, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/352\">Pakil</a>. The pulpit was accessed through the convento, rather than through the body of the church because in colonial times it was common to have a preacher other than the priest presiding at Mass. Usually, the preacher was someone well versed in the local vernacular. A room at the bottom floor of the convento has been remodeled as a Blessed Sacrament Room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morong Church has been marked by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a> since 1939.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Above that is a window corresponding to the third story. Both windows are flanked by pilasters and crowned by ornamented lintels. To either side of the main entrance and the choir loft are ornamented blind windows. A frieze of dentils defines the division between stories. The octagonal bell tower is pierced by windows on all sides and crowned by a dome, on top of which is a cross. Twin columns decorate the sides of the octagon. The bell tower and the lower two stories are linked by a decorative balustrade. This facade, decorated with the symbol and image of San Geronimo touching the head of a Chinese lion has been called an excellent expression of Philippine <a href=\"/2/4/217\">baroque</a>."

Some of the stone statuary from the facade that had been damaged have been removed and are found in a garden along the gospel side of the apse. In front of the church is an elevated patio with a low adobe fence from colonial times, decorated at set points with pyramidal finials topped by spheres. On the side of the fence across from the facade is inscribed &#x201C;A&#xF1;o de 1696&#x201D;."

Noteworthy are the corbels shaped as crocodile heads supporting the choir loft. Also to be noted are the painted Stations of the Cross, the paintings of the evangelists at the pendentives supporting the cupola, and the bas-relief of Christ&#x2019;s baptism in the baptistry. The church&#x2019;s old <strong>convento</strong>, now a school, is well preserved. A modern convento is found on the other side."

				"value": "It is uncertain when the adjoining convento on the nave&#x2019;s gospel side was built but details of construction suggest that it or part of it may be as old as the church. The nave is pierced by openings, some serving as <strong>tribunas</strong> or balconies that are accessible through the convento. One narrow opening previously functioned as the way to the pulpit, which is now missing. Such an arrangement is found in another Franciscan church, <a href=\"/2/8/352\">Pakil</a>. The pulpit was accessed through the convento, rather than through the body of the church because in colonial times it was common to have a preacher other than the priest presiding at Mass. Usually, the preacher was someone well versed in the local vernacular. A room at the bottom floor of the convento has been remodeled as a Blessed Sacrament Room."

Architect: Attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, who also designed the lagoon and open areas. Art deco statuary of a Filipina and a Filipino attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three blocks north of the cathedral, bound by Gatuslao and Lacson Sts and North and South Capitol Sts is the Negros Occidental Provincial Capitol complex. This consists of the Capitol building, an artificial lagoon in a spacious park in front of it, and auxiliary government buildings south of the capitol.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Capitol was built from 1924 to 1925, following the Beaux-Arts style favored by the city planner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a>. The Bureau of Public Works, established to implement the modernization of infrastructure and the construction of government buildings, implemented the principles of Beaux-Arts by opting for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic</a> style for civic buildings, thus setting a pattern for many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">provincial capitols</a>. The Capitol survived World War II and continued to function as such for four decades after the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1993, a new provincial capitol was built on an adjacent lot along North Capitol St. The governor&rsquo;s office was transferred to the new building and the central part of the capitol given to the judiciary. With the construction of a new hall of justice, the capitol&rsquo;s central portion was transformed into the Negros Museum. The museum, which highlights the history and the life of the Negrenses, was opened on 16 Mar 1996. A campaign was launched to turn over the rest of the capitol to the museum but that did not happen. Instead, the provincial government turned over the former Agriculture Building on Gatuslao St and expanded it by building a new annex. Negros Museum transferred to this space in May 2003 and has remained there since. The capitol reverted to the Office of the Governor, who returned the office to its historical location, while auxiliary provincial services remained in the 1993 office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The capitol is laid out as an E. A three-story colonnade crowned by Corinthian capitals, forming a loggia, accentuates the central section. On either side of this central portion, wings run parallel and come to a stop at wings built perpendicular to the central structure. Entrance to the capitol is through wide stairs equal in width to the loggia. Three entrances lead to the central lobby. Directly in front of the entrances, twin staircases in tropical hardwood lead to the main session hall on the second floor.

The museum, which highlights the history and the life of the Negrenses, was opened on 16 Mar 1996. A campaign was launched to turn over the rest of the capitol to the museum but that did not happen. Instead, the provincial government turned over the former Agriculture Building on Gatuslao St and expanded it by building a new annex. Negros Museum transferred to this space in May 2003 and has remained there since.

As a parish it was administered by the Franciscans. The first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was made of bamboo. The foundations of a stone structure were dug in 1732, and work continued for more than 30 years. The church and <strong>convento</strong> were finally completed in 1767. Enshrined in the church in 1788 was the image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores, more popularly known as Turumba and presently honored with seven feasts beginning with Biyernes Dolores, the Friday before Palm Sunday. The convento was damaged in a fire that devastated most of Pakil in 1851. An earthquake in 1881 destroyed the bell tower and ceiling of the church. Another earthquake damaged the church in 1937. Repairs were done afterwards, but the topmost story of the bell tower was not reconstructed until 1980 to 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The body of the church is made with alternating bands of yellow adobe and bricks, while the bell tower is made solely of bricks.

Its ornamented facade is similar to that of others in the Laguna Lake towns, with Corinthian columns and floriated crosses in decorative frames flanking the main entrance. Angel heads are distributed on the facade and the bell tower. Above the main entrance is a niche with crosses, foliage, and a shell-like dome, containing a stone sculpture of the patron saint.

This side door is known as the Portiuncula after the Franciscan mother church in Assisi. It was customary to have a Saturday morning procession in honor of the Virgin Mary, passing through this door.

The central retablo, four stories high, contains 11 niches. The central one displays the image of the Turumba. Columns are used throughout. The two side retablos, three-stories high, are mirror images of each other and are lushly covered with floral decorations and foliage. On the wall near the pulpit hangs a bas-relief of San Francisco de Asis receiving the stigmata of Christ on Mt Alverna, while the miracle of the Eucharist performed by San Antonio de Padua is on the opposite wall. This depicts a donkey kneeling before the Blessed Sacrament, preferring to adore the Sacrament rather than eat. Three other retablos are found in the church.

Built ca 1692, first reconstructed 1774, second reconstruction completed 1884.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> stands on a swampland that was once so low that it would flood when the river overflowed, hence the name of the town, Pan-ay, meaning &ldquo;mouth of the river.&rdquo; In 1569, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi transferred the capital of the Spanish colony from Cebu to Pan-ay. The Augustinians took charge of Pan-ay. The first permanent building must have been up by ca 1692. The Augustinian Fr Manuel Lopez reported church damages after a typhoon in 1698. In 1774, Fr Miguel Murguia, OSA, rebuilt the church, which was struck by a violent typhoon a century later. Fr Jose Beloso, OSA, completed the second reconstruction in 1884, although the adjacent <strong>convento</strong> was never rebuilt. The church facade, built of finely cut coral, is an excellent example of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> merged with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classic</a>. Shallow pilasters divide the first story, while two small deep niches balance the simple arched entrance of the church. The more ornate second story has fanciful niches, a rose window at the center, and a statue of Santa Monica in a niche below it. Pineapple-like finials punctuate the undulating pediment lines and flank another relief of a saint. Finely carved floral swags and leaves decorate all the niches and windows of the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The floral swags that decorate the exterior are carried into the nave, whose floors are of white and black marble. The crossing tower is supported by four carved posts. A pulpit is attached to one of them. The five <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>, bas-relief, and statuary were carved by the town&rsquo;s best sculptor, Bergano. The retablos are unique for their Biblical verses. The church has silver frontals made by Manila artisans. Pan-ay&rsquo;s other claim to fame is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2258\">10,400-kilogram-bell</a> in the five-story belfry, standing to the left of the facade. A parish donation of 70 sacks of coins went into casting the Dakong Lingganay or Big Bell. A foundry was dug nearby for the project. In this same tower a clock has been attached. The topmost level of the bell tower was recently rebuilt. To the right of the church, by the ruins of the old convento, a new building has been constructed. In this building is a small museum that houses the treasures of the parish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> declared Pan-ay a National Cultural Treasure in 1996 and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute </a>declared it a National Historical Landmark in 1997. Since the declaration, the people of Pan-ay under the leadership of the parish priest of Santa Monica church have worked on refurbishing the church. The wooden roof frame, which had deteriorated, was replaced with a steel framework and the roof replaced by long-span galvanized iron. The plaza in front of the church, formerly a grassy field, was paved. The convento, which had been repaired a number of times, was remodeled to look like a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Flooding behind the church was addressed by filling in low areas. All the effort at repair and refurbishing was given a harsh blow when, on 7 Nov 2013, Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) ran the breadth of the Visayas. Part of the church roof was damaged but by and large the damage to the church complex was not catastrophic. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Monica P.

Since the declaration, the people of Pan-ay under the leadership of the parish priest of Santa Monica church have worked on refurbishing the church. The wooden roof frame, which had deteriorated, was replaced with a steel framework and the roof replaced by long-span galvanized iron. The plaza in front of the church, formerly a grassy field, was paved. The convento, which had been repaired a number of times, was remodeled to look like a <a href=\"/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house)."

Archaeological excavation undertaken by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> revealed that the burial ground is a pit-grave where human skeletons were found in layers.

Below this layer, another layer of human skeletons was found which had ornaments, metal and stone implements, and wooden coffins that could be traced back to AD 140. The wooden coffins were of two types: dug-out coffins that are rectangular and human-shaped following the outward contour of the human body, and bier-type coffins that consist of five planks of longitudinally cut wood. Funerary offerings or grave goods were found associated with human skeletons. During this period, it was customary for the early inhabitants who used this burial ground to bury the dead with items of their personal belongings. Valuable things that best identified the deceased were buried with the individual. A red glass bead was even found inside the mouth of one individual.

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constructed by Luna de San Pedro-Cortez Associates, the Luis Perez-Samanillo Building was the first building on the northwest end of the Escolta. It won first prize in the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/224\">commercial building</a> category&rdquo; in an architecture competition in 1928. With its main entrance facing the Escolta, it occupies a squarish area almost coinciding with the entire street block. However, it appears to be sprawling horizontally, the height of the six-floor structure a mere three-fourths of the length of all its four sides. Luna achieved the illusion of height using <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a> design expedients, now interpreted along the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> sensibility as stylized recessed rectilinear arches that are more ornamental than functional. These recessed rectilinear arch motifs are established on both the northwest and southwest corners of the building as facets facing the street corners obliquely.

It won first prize in the &#x201C;<a href=\"/2/5/224\">commercial building</a> category&#x201D; in an architecture competition in 1928. With its main entrance facing the Escolta, it occupies a squarish area almost coinciding with the entire street block. However, it appears to be sprawling horizontally, the height of the six-floor structure a mere three-fourths of the length of all its four sides. Luna achieved the illusion of height using <a href=\"/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a> design expedients, now interpreted along the <a href=\"/2/4/217\">art deco</a> sensibility as stylized recessed rectilinear arches that are more ornamental than functional. These recessed rectilinear arch motifs are established on both the northwest and southwest corners of the building as facets facing the street corners obliquely. They are repeated at the Escolta side, with a wider central one, to dramatize the main entrance. The corner motifs rise as fluted pilasters from the second floor to the fifth floor and are topped by oval forms. The tops of the arches coincide with the sixth floor and are articulated as a five-sided pediment. Two lotus-bud stupas flank the pediment, the middle of which is a rectangular frame with an octagon at the center.

Location: Possibly Legazpi St, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, Manila. Built: ca mid-17th century</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A will of Do&ntilde;a Isabel Navarro de Pi&ntilde;ero dated 1699, a copy of which was kept in the Dominican Archives, describes a house in Intramuros, Manila. This house is so far the oldest documented in the country. Its architectural aspects differ from those of later periods but its floor plan typifies those that would last until the 1890s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house of Do&ntilde;a Isabel, a native of Cebu who settled in Intramuros with her husband Sevillian captain Don Manuel Pi&ntilde;ero, seems to have stood along today&rsquo;s Legazpi St, &ldquo;which runs towards the gate of Santo Domingo, in front of the cemetery of San Francisco.&rdquo; The house was probably already very old by the time the will was made, because Do&ntilde;a Isabel, then already a widow and great grandmother, could not remember its age. Three heights of wall hint that the house was a veteran of the earthquakes of 1645, 1658, and 1677. It occupied almost all of the trapezoidal-shaped lot, approximately around 589 m plus a second floor area of 565 sqm. This made it not just an ordinary bahay na bato but a mansion, or maybe a house-cum-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortress</a> since two of its four doors served to guard access to the stairway. The house had an L-shaped floor plan, which provided space for a courtyard and a well on one side.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The house rested on 24 stout wooden pillars each measuring 1.67 m across. The ground floor with a high ceiling was made of adobe 1.12 m thick. It had storage rooms as well as a porter&rsquo;s room. The two-flight stairway led to the rooms above starting with the <strong>corredor principal</strong> or main corridor, which opened to a hall called <strong>ca&ntilde;on</strong>, probably a receiving room. Beside the ca&ntilde;on were two <strong>cuartos</strong> or bedrooms while behind the house as a separate structure was the <strong>cocina</strong> or kitchen. It was connected to the main house through a walkway. The latrine on the other hand had wooden floors and walls and a roof of tiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second level of wood had <strong>balcones voladizos</strong> or balconies that projected over the street. These protected the house interior from the sun while allowing the air to flow in. The balconies were closed with latticework shutters with <strong>capiz</strong> shell panes. These shutters were swung out instead of being slid&mdash;the first of its kind on record. The walls between the ca&ntilde;on and corredor principal were fitted with <strong>barandillas</strong> or wooden grilles that allowed light and air to pass through. This particular detail of the house evolved into partition jalousies in some 19th century houses. Below the windows of the house were <strong>ventanillas</strong> or small windows that reached down to the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no mention of a ceiling so it is believed that the rafters and beams were exposed, like the houses of the following century. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Edgar Allan M.

Three heights of wall hint that the house was a veteran of the earthquakes of 1645, 1658, and 1677. It occupied almost all of the trapezoidal-shaped lot, approximately around 589 m plus a second floor area of 565 sqm.

Built 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plaridel, previously known as Quingua, already existed prior to 1599 when it was annexed to Malolos. Then, the settlement was located in Lumang Bayan, a barangay of present-day Plaridel. The first Augustinian friar to serve in Lumang Bayan was Fr Pedro Vasquez (1580-95), who built the earlier <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> at Lumang Bayan. In 1936, Quingua was renamed Plaridel after Marcelo H. del Pilar, the great propangandist who hailed from the province. Plaridel is del Pilar&rsquo;s pen name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1602, it was made a vicariate under the supervision of the Augustinian Father Provincial. For many years, it was annexed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a> as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel). The town was officially founded as a Spanish pueblo in 1605 when it was accepted as a house of the Augustinian order during a council meeting on 30 Apr of that year. In the same year, the town site was transferred from Lumang Bayan to where it is presently found. Fr Diego Pardo had spiritual charge of the town. From the 1620s, it had its own resident priest in response to the request of its residents. The Augustinian house of Quingua was exempted from paying rent to the San Agustin Monastery from 1640 to 1704, primarily because the convent was very poor. In 1771, the parish was given to the secular clergy after the secularization decree, but was returned to the Augustinians in 1778. The present town of Baliuag, which then included Bustos, was a visita of Quingua until 1732 when Baliuag became independent. The residents of Plaridel supported themselves through farming and shoemaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>During the British occupation of 1762 to 1764, the Augustinian Province transferred some of the orders&rsquo; jewels and money plus official records from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a> in Intramuros to Plaridel&rsquo;s convent for safekeeping. By the end of the 19th century, Plaridel was under the administration of the secular clergy. The Filipino parish priest Fr Victorino Lopez joined the revolutionaries as an officer under Capt Jose Serapio of Santa Maria. In 1899, the church and convento were comandeered by the Americans and used as a hospital and barracks. It was also in Plaridel where the famous Battle of Quingua in 1899 took place. A prominent figure in the Philippine-American War, Col John Stotsenberg, was killed in that battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the present townsite, Fr Tomas Quijano built in 1722 a church and convent of strong materials, following the framework of the previous structures which were previously destroyed, possibly by fire. The church was burned in 1772 and was immediately rebuilt. It was damaged during the 1863 earthquake but was repaired the same year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present church is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> in style, with noticeable mudejar elements, like the trefoil arches, which embellish the facade and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> inside the church. Although the recent addition of a concrete porte cochere in front of the facade has obscured the original features of the church, the unique pediment of the building still stands out. It has an onion-shaped silhouette, reminiscent of the domes of mosques and churches of the Eastern Orthodox Church. This shape is achieved by a pair of volutes that define the otherwise semicircular pediment. Beginning at the apex, which is the base for a cross, the volutes descend to the sides and terminate in curls that bulge out beyond the tops of the twin columns that define the boundaries of the lower sections. The pediment has a rose window flanked on both sides by insets of vases with flowers, cherub heads, and the Augustinian coat of arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two lower stories of the church are divided vertically by twin pillars. The first story&rsquo;s central section is much wider than the flanking sections. In the central section is the church&rsquo;s entrance, which has a trefoil arch. On the two sides are niches with statues. The second-story windows are placed directly above the niches and entrance on the ground level. Attached to the church on the gospel side is a five-tiered bell tower, crowned by a cone-shaped dome. The base of the tower is quadrilateral while the upper four stories are octagonal but of diminishing sizes, reminiscent of Chinese pagodas. The bell tower has blind and open fenestrations with balusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not far from the church, in the midst of modern houses, is the Spanish-era <strong>simborio</strong> (dome), the mortuary chapel of the town&rsquo;s old cemetery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2011 to 2013, following extensive research, the church ceiling was painted with the images of Christ, Mary, and the 12 apostles in the trompe l&rsquo;oeil style, while the two rose windows were exposed after decades of being covered by adobe.

First bridge built 1629-39; repaired by Lucas Maria de Castro, OAR ca 1757 and Domingo Ildefonso de Aragon in 1814; rebuilt 1868-75 according to the design of Casto Irizar Olano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located slightly to the west of the area presently occupied by Jones Bridge, Puente de Espa&ntilde;a, or Bridge of Spain, replaced an earlier bridge, Puente Grande de Espa&ntilde;a, or the Grand Bridge, that spanned the Pasig River, linking the south and north banks. For the first 70 years or so of its existence, the City of Manila did not have a bridge spanning the Pasig. Citizens commuting from either bank used boats and other riverine means of transport. Gov Luis Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as blocked the initiative of the&nbsp;<em>cabildo&nbsp;</em>(city chapter or council) of Manila to span the Pasig with a bridge when he assigned the rights for creating &ldquo;a passageway over the river&rdquo; to the Comunidad de Sangleyes, the council of the Manila Chinese, who built and maintained the Hospital de San Gabriel in Binondo. The City Chapter protested Dasmari&ntilde;as&rsquo;s action and even brought their objections to Madrid. Noche (2011) surmises that the council objections had to do with loss of income from the toll the city collected from the ferries that crossed the Pasig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Dasmari&ntilde;as prevailed. Thus a bridge was built and completed sometime between the last three months of 1629 and early 1630. A 17th-century document describes the bridge as made of 10 spans, supported by nine strong piers, which blocked the swift currents of the Pasig. Its walkway was wood. The bridge survived the earthquake of 1645 and 1663, but by the early 18th century the bridge had suffered so much and was in need of repair estimated to cost 25,000 pesos. Fr Lucas Jesus de Maria, OAR, repaired the bridge&rsquo;s posts ca 1757. The earthquake of 1771, which ruined many buildings in Manila, may have damaged the bridge, because in 1781 the City Corporation nominated Don Miguel Gomez and Fr Alonso Herrero, OSA to examine the bridge and propose repairs. The bridge was subsequently repaired.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1814, it was renovated by Domingo Ildefonso de Aragon, the leading engineer of the early 19th century. He strengthened the piers with cut stone, linked them with stone arches of various spans, laid out a pavement of granite from China and handrails of ordinary stone, and added a pillar to give better symmetry to the bridge. The bridge was renovated again between 1824 and 1859. The stone railing was replaced with wood, and resting places paved with marble were added along the sides for the convenience of pedestrians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1850s, Puente de Espa&ntilde;a ceased to be the lone bridge over the Pasig because the Puente Colgante was built in 1852. During the succeeding decades, two more bridges were built: Ayala, during the term of Gov-Gen Rafael Izquierdo; and Santa Cruz, whose foundations were dug beginning 16 May 1890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1859, the Corregimiento y Provincia Civil de Manila was organized to unite Intramuros and its&nbsp;<em>arrabales&nbsp;</em>(districts) under one government. Manila&rsquo;s governing body had been discussing plans to replace the old stone bridge with one of steel when in 3 Jun 1863 an intense earthquake damaged the bridge. Initially the bridge was assessed as structurally unsound, but as the Puente Colgante now spanned the Pasig, there was no urgency to repair the bridge. Instead, a temporary floating bridge was built following the recommendations of the architect Pedro Lopez Esguerra. This temporary bridge remained for 10 years, while city engineers debated over the utility of repairing the old stone bridge or replacing it with a steel one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12 Apr 1867, the engineer Casto Irizar Olano submitted his recommendation that after thorough analysis, the bridge could still be repaired. It was structurally sound in contrast to earlier assessments, only it needed reinforcement. In 1868, Madrid granted permission to proceed with the repairs as Olano had recommended, which was to add new piers and take down the stone arches at the center, replacing it with an iron trussed steel center. As planned the bridge was to have eight spans: six stone, both its piers and arches, and the central two spans (Nos 4 and 5) of cast iron to be manufactured in France by Imbert and Company. Jose Echevaria, Spain&rsquo;s resident engineer in France, was to oversee the construction of the spans and it shipment to Manila. The contract with Imbert included 18 distinctive lamps, aside from the spans with their supporting arches. The delivery of the ironworks was delayed because of the Franco-Prussian war. It was not until 1874 that they arrived. The bridge was opened on 1 Jun 1875 and given the official name Puente de Espa&ntilde;a by Gov-Gen Jose Malcampo y Monje. The new bridge was built right beside the old bridge but its northern landing was at Calle Nueva, not Plaza San Gabriel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several plans of the bridge under different names are in Spanish archives, namely: Casto Irizar Olano, 1869; Felix Roxas, Manuel Ramirez, and Jose Echevarria, all three dated 1870; Juan Jose Hervas, 1883; and three more signed by Juan Cologan, 1886, 1887, and 1888.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puente de Espa&ntilde;a remained in use until a flashflood destroyed it in 1914.

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\">Alfredo J. Luz</a> and Associates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ramon Magsaysay Awards Foundation was established to perpetuate the legacy of a former president of the Philippines, who died in an airplane crash in 1957. A piece of land in Ermita, Manila formerly known as Plaza Militar, was donated by the Philippine Congress in 1959 to be the site of the commemorative building. The Ramon Magsaysay Center (RMC), an 18-story office cum commercial building, rose on this dramatic location that fronted the busy Roxas Blvd and Manila Bay. Housed here are the Asian Library and the offices of the foundation that adminsters the Ramon Magsaysay Award, Asia&rsquo;s equivalent of the Nobel Prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The iconic RMC building was designed by Alfredo J. Luz in modernist style, melding innovative structural solutions such as precast and pre-stressed construction with earthquake-resistant design. Luz consulted the American engineer and architect Pietro Belluschi from Boston and a structural firm headed by Dr Alfred Yee from Honolulu, USA. Yee introduced Hawaii&rsquo;s first precast, prestressed concrete mass production facility in 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RMC may be characterized as a rectangular block raised above the ground by 12 tree trunk-like massive square reinforced concrete columns. The block is a cast-in-place concrete sheer wall core (moment frame) on concrete piles. The facade of repeated rows of deeply recessed square windows is finished with travertine slabs on precast wall panels. The travertine slab cladding was chosen not only for its aesthetic appearance but also for a functional purpose: it lessened the maintenance of a building that was constantly exposed to the salty environment of Manila Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other structural features are the prestressed concrete beams and multiple in-place floor slabs. The building&rsquo;s interior introduced a column-free concept, fire resistant gypsum boards, metal runners in the dividing walls, and movable partitions to maximize space according to different users&rsquo; needs. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Clarissa L.

Church and tower built early 18th century; nave raised and transept added 2nd half of 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since time immemorial, Romblon and its cluster of islands have provided food and shelter to sea-voyagers negotiating the turbulent waters between Luzon and the Visayas. Though the area was known to Spanish explorers from 1572, a Christian settlement was only formally organized in Romblon, on the island of the same name, in 1631. Together with Banton, established earlier in 1622, it was under the spiritual care of the diocesan parish priest of Ajuy, Iloilo. In 1635 Romblong&mdash;as it appeared in early documents&mdash;with its adjacent islands was turned over by the Bishop of Cebu to the care of the Augustinian Recollects. Though a quasi-parish, it remained a district of the province of Capiz throughout the rest of the Spanish regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It turned out that slave-raiders had also set up their lairs in these very islands. In 1644 the Recollect Superior ordered the transfer of Agustin de San Pedro, OAR, from Cagayan de Misamis in Mindanao to Romblon. Born in Portugal in 1599, Fray Agustin had already earned some fame for building palisades and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">forts</a> in Linao and Cagayan. From 1644 to 1650, he inculcated in the Romblomanon the arts of defense, including fighting on land and sea, surprise attacks, and pursuit of the enemy. He instructed them in constructing forts on Romblon and Banton islands. He died in 1653, and his remains are enshrined at the foot of the Romblon bell tower which used to serve as his own bulwark. These achievements earned him the name el Padre Capitan. The title was soon recorded in chronicles of the era such as the <strong><em>Historia de Mindanao</em></strong> by the Jesuit historian Francisco Comb&eacute;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fray Agustin fortified the semicircular enclave of Romblon facing the sea, with its back shielded by the thickly forested vertical slopes of an extinct volcano. A 9,144-meter masonry wall connected the stone bulwarks at both ends of the enclosure, and closed off any enemy entry into the town. Inside the enclosure a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was built. Its apse or rear was firmly set into the mountain wall for stability and security, a unique undertaking in Philippine architecture. The <strong>convento</strong> extended from the right side of the facade so that the compound formed an &ldquo;L&rdquo;. The houses of the residents radiated from the church. We get an idea of how the fortified town looked like through a plan prepared in 1734 by Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes y Tamon. The forts in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/298\">Romblon</a> and Banton were built with local labor and under the direction and maintenance of the Augustinian Recollects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a hundred years after the coming of el Padre Capit&aacute;n to Romblon, the district enjoyed a period of relative calm. The bulk of the present church and convent of cut coral-stone must have been erected by the first decades of the 18th century. This is presupposed by the dating of certain furnishings and structures in the complex. Roman numerals for the year &ldquo;1726&rdquo; mark the construction of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo mayor</strong></a>. The two retablos fronting each other in the transept are of the same <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> style and must have come at around the same time. Roman numerals for the year &ldquo;1727&rdquo; provide a date for the lower level of the bell tower. An image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o based on the famous one in Cebu was gifted to the church in 1728. The church and convento of Banton were also built in 1726.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wave of bloody raids that commenced in 1740 retarded development in the Romblon area for most of the century. The two hills flanking the town of Romblon were crowned with forts in 1760. Natural calamities and famine worsened living conditions as its residents lost their fields and cattle in the adjoining islands of Tablas and Sibuyan. Typhoons in 1780 and 1829 greatly damaged the church and convento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decrease of pirate raids in the early 19th century brought in more maritime commerce and local prosperity. To accommodate the growing population, a transept was added to the church in the 1860s and 1870s. At the same time the walls of the nave were raised by a few meters, a cupola was built over the crossing, and the building was roofed with tile. A section of the convento adjoining the church was taken down to give access to the right transept. In the 1890s, the windows were enlarged and enhanced with colored glass panes, a pipe organ was installed, the church was painted, and the tile roof replaced with a lighter one of zinc. The famous marble industry of Romblon seems to have been initiated only in the last years of the 19th century, as there is no mention of it in earlier chronicles. The Recollects assisted the residents in carving holy water fonts and baptismal basins that were distributed all over the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite all the changes the church has gone through, the early 18th century shell has survived almost intact. It seems unusually tall in relation to its width, due to the additions of the 19th century. The octagonal cupola over the crossing has recently been replaced by an ill-advised dome. Over the central doorway is an image of St&nbsp;Joseph cradling the Christ Child, who affectionately curls his right hand on his earthly father&rsquo;s nape. Three intricately carved doors give entrance to the church. The year M./DCC./XX/VI (1726) is inscribed on the base of the second level of the central <strong>retablo</strong>, making it a benchmark for Philippine colonial art history. This altarpiece, along with two others in the transept ends, is exuberantly decorated with twisted columns, graceful scrolls, and flowery finials and flanges.

A site in this city, named Intramuros when it was later rebuilt in stone, was apportioned to the Augustinians, the first religious order to evangelize in the Philippines. Early structures of bamboo, nipa, and wood burned down in 1574, 1583, and 1586. Thus, the friars decided in 1586 or 1587 to build a church and monastery of stone. About 20 years later both structures were substantially complete. Various dates are given for the completion of the church: 1605, 1608, and 1609. Juan Macias, a Spaniard, was the architect and director of construction. He died in 1611 and was buried in the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the San Agustin church has survived intact to the present, making it one of the earliest examples of late 16th-century and early 17th-century architecture. The atrial plan of the monastery and its architectural articulation owes much to Mexican models, according to Galende.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practical and direct to the point, the church&rsquo;s exterior form is boxlike and rather plain. From 1854 onwards, architect Luciano Oliver worked on renovating the church. He modified the squat facade by raising the two bell towers flanking the main section in 1861. The tower to the left or the gospel side cracked in the earthquakes of 1863 and 1880 and had to be torn down. The facade represents a sedate style more akin to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a>. The only concession to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> is the carved doors decorated with rocaille of the late baroque or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a> style.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church&rsquo;s more significant characteristics are found inside. Of prime interest are the series of chapels lining both sides of the nave. The walls separating the chapels also act as buttresses, in the same manner as the <strong>wandpfeiler</strong> (wall pillars) of German baroque churches. Perhaps due to limited space within Intramuros these buttresses were placed inside the church, the voids between them providing spaces for chapels. Both these chapels and the wall-buttresses are features found nowhere else in the country. The Manila cathedral a few blocks away possessed these features in the 18th century. San Agustin also boasts of a barrel vault, dome, and arched vestibule, all of stone supporting the choir loft. These are also the only extant examples in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The monastery, being the motherhouse of the Augustinians in the Philippines and their springboard to other parts of Asia, came to comprise three distinct buildings. The first was built together with the church and adjoins its left or south side. It is quadrangular, enclosing a cloister and inner garden. The second monastery was built from 1623 to 1668 to accommodate the growing religious community. It was linked to the first monastery by a passageway. A third floor was added by Oliver in 1861. The third monastery was actually an extension of the first building and was built intermittently from 1713 to 1828. These last two were destroyed by American bombs in the Battle of Manila in 1945. The church, however, was the only church in Intramuros that survived World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church and monastery are priceless repositories of the country&rsquo;s religious art including: the earliest dated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> by Juan de los Santos, ca 1620; 26 huge oil <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> by Fuster and Enriquez; a sumptuous baroque pulpit; a 17th-century Macao-made choir lectern; exquisitely carved 17th century choir stalls of molave, in the church choir, and the ivory image of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Correa or La Consolacion; an ivory crucifix by Juan de los Santos; an ivory San Miguel; and gold embroidered vestments for images and for Mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church interior was painted in 1875 by the two Italian painters <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3386\">Cesare Alberoni and Giovanni Dibella</a> in trompe l&rsquo;oeil style, which influenced the decoration of some churches of that era. The heavily carved baroque doors at the front and side entrance are outstanding. The 19th century grille door leading from the epistle transept to the cloister is an example of the art of wrought iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Agustin is also a veritable historical relic.

The first church, a wooden one with a tile roof, was built in 1587 with donations from Don Gabriel de Ribera, the&nbsp;<em>oidor&nbsp;</em>(judge) of Manila. It was replaced between 1590 to 1596 by the first Jesuit stone church in the Philippines, dedicated to Santa Ana, the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s mother. It was planned by the Jesuit <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a> after the pattern of the Jesuit church in Rome&mdash;Giacommo da Vignola and Giacommo della Porta&rsquo;s Il Gesu. Santa Ana church was seriously damaged by the earthquake of 1600. The church was subsequently repaired.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was replaced between 1626 and 1632 by a new church constructed following the plans of the Italian priest-architect Gianantonio Campioni. The church as it came from Campioni&rsquo;s hand was plain, perhaps more Italian than Spanish <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>. The church was dedicated to San Ignacio de Loyola who was canonized in 1622. In 1700 the church ceiling was painted by Bro Manuel Rodriguez, assisted by Filipino artisans. Around this time the church facade was decorated with carved foliage that gave it a plateresque appearance. In 1727 the church was solemnly consecrated after extensive renovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Jesuits&rsquo; expulsion from the Philippines, the archbishop of Manila in 1771 requested the government to allow the diocesan seminary, San Carlos, use of the abandoned Jesuit College of Manila, adjacent to the church. In 1784 the College of Manila and the church were turned over to the archdiocese following the visitation of 1778. The seminary was renamed Real Seminario Conciliar de San Carlos. On 6 Sep 1852 at 1:30 pm an earthquake destroyed the church. Stones of the church were later used in the foundations of the second San Ignacio the Jesuits were going to build at Arzobispo St, next to the episcopal palace of Manila, beginning 1879.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first San Ignacio, of grayish adobe quarried from Antipolo, was located on a southeast-by-northwest axis, its front door opening to a quadrilateral plaza flagged with stone and surrounded by a breast-high wall ornamented by stone lions. The plaza opened to Calle Victoria. The church was 62 m long and 30 m wide. Its height from the base to the top of the dome was 33.83 m. The central nave was 12 m wide. This was flanked by aisles of about 7.62 m wide, enough to appear as naves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade was divided into two stories crowned by a triangular pediment. Twin towers of three stories, terminating in a triangular roof, flanked the facade. The church bells were hung in one of the facade towers and a clock installed in the other tower. Ionic capitals on pilasters were used throughout. At the first floor of the bell tower, decorative niches were gouged into wide pilasters, while at the facade thin pilasters flanked niches. Pairs of pilasters were on the second and third floors of the bell towers. Large windows pierced the second floor both at the facade and on the towers. All in all the facade gave a pleasing appearance. Hence, according to the Jesuit Murillo Velarde, the Campioni-designed facade is the shell that declares its content. However, Velarde writing in 1734 and referring to the plateresque designs imposed on the facade, lamented the excessive ornamentation that ruined the majesty of the original concept behind the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The choir loft rested on elliptical arches. The church roof was supported by 12 well-wrought pillars, rectangular in shape, fluted with tiny canals terminating in Ionic capitals. From pillar to pillar were semicircular arches decorated at the center with cartouches. Then from pillar to the 2.74 meter-thick wall were equally well-wrought arches, together forming domes of stone. Above these arches, galleries were made to accommodate large crowds for such times as Lent, missions, and solemn feasts. The idea of the gallery was not novel. Santa Ana on the same spot had already used it. Il Gesu in Rome also had galleries, called <strong>correte</strong>. The upper gallery, covered with domes, rested on the pillars that echoed those below. The axis of these domes coincided with those below. The interior gave an overall impression of solemnity. The crossing of the principal nave and transept was covered by an octagonal crossing tower, which had a window on every side to allow light to filter into the church. The crossing tower&rsquo;s exterior had a gallery that ran around it, making the dome accessible from outside. San Ignacio, the titular of the church, was depicted in a life-size statue and located in a niche on the second level of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> that was all of four stories. The retablo was richly gilded, and before it stood an altar with a frontal of finely chased silver. Flanking the altar and distributed throughout the nave were lampstands, also of silver. At the side of the transepts were the collateral naves. Beneath the choir loft stood altars dedicated to different saints. At the right side was the altar of the crucifix. There was also the altar of the Blessed Virgin under the invocation of Dolores and Loreto. The collateral aisles, which terminated in chapels, had one dedicated to San Jose and the other to San Francisco Xavier. Beneath the choir loft were smaller altars for San Francisco Regis and San Luis Gonzaga; and San Juan Nepomuceno and San Joaquin, the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s father. An auxiliary entrance on the gospel flank of the nave was also loaded with ornamentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second San Ignacio was built to serve two purposes: as the oratory or college chapel of the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and as the central Jesuit church in the Philippines. The Ateneo used the church for special occasions or when large crowds were expected, otherwise, the Ateneo used the students&rsquo; chapel dedicated to the Immaculate Conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was considered the masterpiece of the Filipino artists Isabelo Tampinco et al, and the architect Felix Roxas Sr. The plan was drawn by Roxas, who had trained in England and had traveled extensively in Europe and India. The cornerstone was laid on 9 Feb 1878, with the archbishop of Manila the Dominican Pedro Payo presiding over the rites. He was also one of the principal patrons of the church, who donated part of his garden as the site for the San Ignacio. Roxas died while the church was being built, and the Jesuit brother Francisco Riera took over the supervision of the work. Riera would later help build churches in Mindanao, among them the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/418\">Dapitan</a> Church and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/312\">Jasaan Church</a>, the latter patterned after Roxas&rsquo;s San Ignacio. In 1882 Tampingco and 50 to 60 artisans, including his father-in-law Crispulo Jocson, began finishing the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2290\">church interior</a> following designs drawn by Agustin Saez and sometimes improving on them. Saez was director of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura and a teacher of art at Ateneo. Tampinco and his artisans carved the retablo, colonnade, and coffered ceiling of the church using hardwood from Surigao. A Spaniard, Francisco Rodoreda, carved the three marble altars, and a Filipino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3653\">Felix Martinez</a>, painted canvases of Jesuit saints. The bell tower, made of iron sheets, was built by Jose Fuentes, a government engineer. On the whole, Roxas&rsquo;s plan was executed except for a cupola, which the Jesuits decided not to build for lack of funds, and the bell tower, which was built taller and slimmer. In 1895 a crypt was dug under the main altar to hold the remains of Jesuits who had worked in the Philippines since the 16th century. In 1932 a fire swept Intramuros, destroying Ateneo but leaving San Ignacio intact. The church was finally destroyed by fire in 1945 during the Battle of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Ignacio was designed in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style with touches of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a> in the interior, especially in the colonnade with its contrasting colors of white and natural wood. The chaste facade of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>piedra de visayas</strong></a> (cut coral), bricks, and marble led into an arcaded church with Corinthian columns of carved wood. The arcade was ornamented with medallions depicting Jesuit saints. The arcade supported galleries that were joined to the choir loft and that opened into the nave. The ceiling was ornamented with acanthus leaves enclosed in boxes with ropelike designs. Where the cupola should have been the ceiling was raised to form a truncated octahedron decorated with reliefs of Jesuit saints. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2290\">main retablo</a> had a single niche with a statue of San Ignacio carved by Jocson in the classical style favored by the Gremio de Escultores. The corners of the retablo were ornamented with angels. The altar table itself of Carrara marble was decorated with a high relief version of Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s Last Supper. The pulpit of hardwood was designed by Saez and meticulously embellished with images from the bible and the symbols of faith, hope, and charity. It was considered the masterpiece of the interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plans to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restore</a> the San Ignacio had long been in the works since the time when Imelda Marcos, appointed governor of Manila in 1975 and then minister of the Ministry of Human Settlements, commissioned studies on how to restore the San Ignacio and the adjoining buildings of Casa Mision and Ateneo de Manila. No restoration was done but the lots of Ateneo and Casa Mision were cleared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the administration of Maria Ana L. Harper, appointed head of the Intramuros Administration (IA) in 2008, a more assiduous move to restore the San Ignacio was launched. Planning was begun and an inventory of the IA&rsquo;s holding of ecclesiastical art was done. The plan was to restore the San Ignacio not as a church but as a museum of ecclesiastical art. Some of the objects IA wanted to exhibit had been earlier shown in the Puerta Isabel museum inside the <strong>casamata</strong> or chambers of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">Intramuros walls</a> near Puerta Isabel II. But more were in storage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restoration project finally got under way, after a plan to build a very modern museum, which suggested the lines of San Ignacio was rejected as not conforming to the norms and guidelines of Intramuros as a historic district. The restoration of San Ignacio began with an archaeological survey under Harper. This uncovered evidence that the site of the San Ignacio and the Casa Mision was inhabited in precolonial times. Terra cotta <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a> and Chinese trade pottery were unearthed. Among the more significant finds was a shard believed to be with&nbsp;<em>baybayin&nbsp;</em>(alphabet) script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restoration was underway in 2013. The decision was to rebuild the San Ignacio&rsquo;s exterior as faithfully as possible. However, the twin towers made of imported iron cast components were to be replicated in reinforced concrete. The interior is still a subject of debate. One school of thought is to rebuild as much of the interior because it was the center of attraction in San Ignacio. It has been argued that there is sufficient data (plans and photographs) to recreate the interior, and that there are corps of artisans who can do a good job. Another school of thought is that the church will no longer be a church, and the interior, destroyed and gutted by war, is a blank slate in which to build an appropriate design for a contemporary museum. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Architect: Genaro Palacios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earthquakes of 1863 and 1880 severely damaged the Recollect church of San Sebastian. Wishing to build a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> that would endure, the Recollects contracted the services of government engineer Genaro Palacios to design a church in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> style, without flying buttresses, in the spirit of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Revivalist</a> architecture then in vogue. Plans for the church and all the necessary authorization were drawn while Fr Gregorio Sesma, OAR was vice-prior of San Sebastian from 1887 to 1888. The responsibility of overseeing the construction fell on Fr Bernardo Muro de la Virgen del Carmen, OAR, the prior, and Fr Remigio San Miguel de Santo Cristo, OAR. The former took charge of the legal work, the workers and consultants, and the procurement of materials; the latter supervised the daily work on the church. The church was blessed in the afternoon of 15 Aug 1891 by Fr Bernardino Nozaleda, OP, Archbishop of Manila. The inaugural Mass was celebrated the following morning, and festivities continued until 19 Aug with a triduum of thanksgiving. The festivities concluded with a procession at 9:30 pm, with the customary fireworks lit by the archbishop.

Steel was used extensively in Europe and the United States for commercial building, e.g., the cast-iron buildings in lower Manhattan, New York, the Crystal Palace exhibition halls, and the Victoria Train Station in London. However, it was rarely used for a church. The plans were sent to Belgium, where the parts were manufactured in sections and then sent to Manila onboard 10 steamships. The parts were then assembled and erected on the site of the old church and anchored to an elevated concrete pavement. A trench 4.70 m deep and 3.60 m wide was dug along the perimeter of the church. The trench was filled with masonry of lime, sand, and cement, which formed a wall. Trenches filled with mortar were also built to link the pilasters on the longitudinal side of the church and the main door with the sanctuary. This network of masonry was built to support the heavy steel structure. The load bearing columns, attached to cast-iron plates were sunk two meters into the ground, and a heavy load of steel was placed over these plates, forcing them to descend one more meter. Iron chains, 5 m in length and one ton in weight, tied the columns together. Likewise, chains were run along the perimeter to link the outer pillars together. The whole area defined by the perimeter was filled with clay, sand, and mortar, and leveled to form the support of the floor. Then the heavy gauged steel plates were riveted together to form walls.

Started 1720.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Ana was the first settlement outside Manila to be evangelized by the Franciscans. Called Sapa by the Tagalog, the settlement, which for centuries had traded with the Chinese and Arabs, stood at the confluence of the Pasig River and an&nbsp;<em>estero&nbsp;</em>(canal), called&nbsp;<em>sapa</em>, a Tagalog word for stream. In 1966, archaeological diggings in the courtyard of the Santa Ana Church and its surroundings uncovered burial sites rich with artifacts and tradeware dated to the Sung Dynasty, 1127-1279. These indicate that the settlement had achieved a high level of sophistication prior to the coming of the Spaniards. The first Franciscan provincial in the Philippines, Pedro de Alfaro, sent Juan de Plasencia, OFM, Diego de Oropesa, OFM, Juan de Garrovillas, OFM, and Francisco de Santa Maria, OFM, to convert the Tagalog of Sapa. In 1580 the Franciscan chapter appointed Pablo de Jesus, OFM, as first resident minister of Sapa.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> of bamboo and nipa was dedicated to Santa Ana, the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s mother. In 1599 the government allowed the construction of a stone church, which was begun not much later than this year. In 1720 construction of a larger stone church was begun under the direction of Vicente Ingles at a site different from that of the earlier church. The Archbishop of Manila Francisco Cuesta, concurrently acting as governor general, blessed the cornerstone on 12 Sep of the same year. Toward the construction of the church, the archbishop donated 4,000 pesos, while Ingles added to the sum from his own savings and from donations given by devotees to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Desamparados, an image of the Virgin enshrined in Santa Ana which Ingles brought from Spain. The total cost of the project was 33,000 pesos. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the church and <strong>convento</strong> were looted of its statuary, furniture, and church records. In the 1960s, the church was renovated with the addition of side aisles to accommodate the growing number of parishioners. Further intervention of the church fabric involved adding stained glass windows made of resin and covering the adobe stones with a cement and adobe mix, which would prove inimical to the structure in the long run. The altar was replastered, painted in enamel, and gilded with faux gold leaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade of the church is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>. Tall and narrow, it is divided into three narrow vertical sections by engaged pilasters. The triangular pediment is pierced by two octagonal windows and a niche at the center, while volutes on the raking cornice crown it. The original church was cruciform in plan with an octagonal crossing tower. The four-story octagonal tower stands at the right of the facade. The church has a main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> in the baroque style. Divided into horizontals and verticals, the retablo has a number of niches; the principal one houses the Virgin. Floral motifs decorate the columns of the retablo. Behind the main altar is a chapel called Camarin de la Virgen, the entrance of which is decorated with trompe l&rsquo;oeil paintings depicting angels. The chapel&rsquo;s focal point is a small shrine surmounted by a crown. This shrine directly leads to the Virgin&rsquo;s image in the retablo. The octagonal ceiling is decorated with paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 2008 and 2010, the Cofradia de la Inmaculada Concepcion and other devotees and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage</a> advocates restored the Camarin. Badly planned interventions using modern material incompatible with 18th century construction, painting materials, and techniques were removed. The painting in the Camarin was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> and its whole interior refurbished. Work also began on the main retablo, where layers of paint were removed beginning with the niche of the Virgin. The earliest layer of paint and true gold gilt was discovered and this guided the work of restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exterior walls of the nave were replastered with lime plaster and work continues at restoring the church properly. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The first Franciscan provincial in the Philippines, Pedro de Alfaro, sent Juan de Plasencia, OFM, Diego de Oropesa, OFM, Juan de Garrovillas, OFM, and Francisco de Santa Maria, OFM, to convert the Tagalog of Sapa. In 1580 the Franciscan chapter appointed Pablo de Jesus, OFM, as first resident minister of Sapa."

In 1599 the government allowed the construction of a stone church, which was begun not much later than this year. In 1720 construction of a larger stone church was begun under the direction of Vicente Ingles at a site different from that of the earlier church. The Archbishop of Manila Francisco Cuesta, concurrently acting as governor general, blessed the cornerstone on 12 Sep of the same year. Toward the construction of the church, the archbishop donated 4,000 pesos, while Ingles added to the sum from his own savings and from donations given by devotees to the Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de los Desamparados, an image of the Virgin enshrined in Santa Ana which Ingles brought from Spain. The total cost of the project was 33,000 pesos. During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the church and <strong>convento</strong> were looted of its statuary, furniture, and church records. In the 1960s, the church was renovated with the addition of side aisles to accommodate the growing number of parishioners. Further intervention of the church fabric involved adding stained glass windows made of resin and covering the adobe stones with a cement and adobe mix, which would prove inimical to the structure in the long run. The altar was replastered, painted in enamel, and gilded with faux gold leaf."

Builders: Fr Francisco Agueria, Fr Mateo Rodriguez, Fr Calixto Fernandez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Formerly a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of Jaro, the town of Santa Barbara became an independent parish in 1760, named after its patroness Santa Barbara Virgin and Martyr. It was earlier known as Catmon, after the plant&nbsp;<em>Dilenia bracteata&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dilenia speciosa,&nbsp;</em>with San Pedro Apostol as its titular patron. The town&rsquo;s fertile land is irrigated by the Salog river to its north and east, and by the Aganan river on the west.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1617, the Augustinians considered transferring the seat of the Jaro parish to Catmon due to its wider and better location. This plan never materialized. After its independence from Jaro and subsequent renaming to Santa Barbara, its progress declined because its political system was ruled only by a privileged few individuals. Up to 1820, its residents were involved in hunting, agriculture, and wood cutting. They also supported themselves through cultivation of tobacco, wheat production, and weaving. Santa Barbara was known for its musical bands, touted as some of the best in the whole of Iloilo. Today, its musical bands continue to perform during religious activities, though not in as grand a scale as before.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of the town&rsquo;s present <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was started by Fr Francisco Agueria in 1849. It is made of limestone blocks quarried from the towns of Alimodian, Leon, and Tubungan. It replaced an older church destroyed in 1787 by an earthquake. The stone edifice started by Fr Agueria was continued by Fr Mateo Rodriguez from 1855 to 1873 and eventually finished by Fr Calixto Fernandez in 1878. The adjacent convent, with floors made of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>piedra silleria</strong></a> (cut stone) was constructed simultaneously with the church. Both church and convent served as the headquarters of the revolutionary government in Western Visayas led by Gen Martin Delgado. During the Philippine Revolution, both were spared from destruction. They also survived World War II and the &ldquo;Lady Caycay&rdquo; earthquake of 1948. On the occasion of the 220th founding anniversary of Santa Barbara, both structures were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> by Msgr Enrique Perez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance-baroque</a> facade has well-unified designs of arches, pillasters, and vas finials. It is divided into three vertical registers and three horizontal sections. The vertical divisions are defined by four twin Ionic pilasters mounted on rectangular bases. The horizontal sections are defined by friezes. In the center of the first story is an arched entrance. Flanking it are niches with statues. This design of arches is echoed at the second story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church pediment consists of another shorter story with a niche with statue, crowned by a pediment and finials at the center register. The center is flanked on either side by broken arches that link the pediment to the second story. The facade is embellished with the seal of the Augustinian Order and the Holy See.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento follows an L-plan, with its main wing running parallel to the facade and attached to it, and the adjoining wing running perpendicular and attached to the main wing. It lacks a fourth wing to make it a complete atrium. The <strong>convento</strong> is built in the manner of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house), with a lower story in coral stone and brick, and an upper story of wood. The upper story has a <strong>volada</strong> (cantelivered overhang), sliding <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows), and <strong>capiz</strong> windows. But the gem of the convento is found inside. Passing through the main entrance, one is led to an inner garden through archways and a brick colonnade that supports the corridor on the second floor. This corridor of wood is decorated with wooden cutout arches reminiscent of the Victorian gingerbread style. An English connection may not be too far fetched, because with the opening of the Iloilo port to world trade in 1856, the British were actually operating in the Visayas, engaged in the developing sugar industry. The church and convent are examples of better preserved structures in Iloilo that still maintain their Spanish colonial architectural features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another notable Spanish-era structure in the town is its stone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>, built in 1878-88 by Fr Mateo Rodriguez, using materials coming from possibly the same places as those used in the construction of the church and convent. The cemetery facade bears similarity to the facade of the church. The striking unique feature of this cemetery is the stone tablet located above the arched entrance. It bears an inscription written in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Hiligaynon</a>, &ldquo;Ig-ampo ni&ntilde;o cami.

The walls of the church are very thick, bolstered by huge quadrangular buttresses. The facade is plain and undecorated. It is framed by two exaggerated cylindrical columns. The pediment is curved, a feature shared by the twin school buildings and the cemetery chapel, located below the hill. Their architectural similarities strongly imply that all were built at the same time. The <a href=\"/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a> installed a historical marker on Santa Maria in 1974 and declared it a National Historical Landmark in 1978.

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, sixth Santo Domingo. Location: Quezon Ave, Quezon City. Inaugurated 1954. Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2708\">Jose Maria Zaragoza</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dominicans arrived in Manila in 1587. Welcomed by the bishop of Manila Domingo de Salazar and the city council, they sought lodging with the Franciscans in Manila, while some friars were sent to Bataan and Pangasinan to start mission work. With the bishop contributing 300 pesos for land and 3,000 pesos for the construction of a church, ground was broken on 6 Aug 1587 for a small <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> of light materials. The church, completed on 1 Jan 1588, housed the image of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario which the Dominicans brought from Mexico. In 1589 the roof of this first church collapsed, and the friars decided to build a much bigger church using more durable material.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This second church of stone was completed and inaugurated on 9 Apr 1592. A fire on 30 Apr 1603, which destroyed a third of the city, consumed both the church and the <strong>convento</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third church, bigger and costlier, which had a stone vault as a precaution against fire, was built almost immediately. On 30 Nov 1610, the feast of San Andres, the church collapsed during an earthquake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fourth church of stone and hardwood was built. This time, wooden posts supported the roof and divided the church into a central nave with side aisles. The church took two years to build. The structural soundness of the church made it last for 250 years. A new facade, flanked by two towers and patterned after London&rsquo;s St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral designed by Christopher Wren, was built for the church. The facade lasted almost a year. It was inaugurated on 15 Jun 1862. But on 3 Jun 1863, the eve of the feast of Corpus Christi, the church was ruined by an earthquake of the same intensity as that which hit Manila in 1610.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1864 to 1867 the fifth church was built in the <strong>gotico fingido</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a>) style. This measured 70 m long, 31 m wide, and 22 m high at the central aisles, and 16.6 m high at the lateral aisles. Its towers rose to 23.3 m. Although Fr Sixto, OP, and Fr Ristoro, OP, would supervise construction of the church, the Dominicans contracted the services of the European-trained architect Felix Roxas Sr. Roxas, adapting to seismic realities, designed a church with a lower story of stone and an upper story of wood. He worked closely with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> who decorated the interior with carving imitating the fan vault reminiscent of the English Gothic. The walls and the ceiling of the sacristy were similarly treated. Even the furniture in the sacristy was treated in the Gothic manner. Noteworthy was a vesting table with niches containing relics. The chapel of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario had an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a> with lancet arches and Gothic-inspired ornamented pinnacles. Colored glass chandeliers imported from Europe hung inside the church. Fr Joaquin Sabater, OP, professor of drawing at the Universidad de Santo Tomas (UST), designed and supervised the construction of four <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>. That of the Virgin was embellished with reliefs of the Mysteries of the Rosary and titles of the Virgin from the Litany of Loreto, and figures of the apostles and prophets in high relief. The images of Santo Domingo, Santa Catalina, and the four evangelists were in the round retablos. The gilded main retablo had two parts, the lower occupied by an image of Santo Domingo and the upper by an image of Maria Magdalena. The columns surrounding the sanctuary were decorated with images of Dominican saints. Behind the altar was the choir, where the friars gathered for their devotions separate from the congregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church incurred damage over time and was repaired. In 1887 the vault and the rose windows of&nbsp;<em>batikuling&nbsp;</em>were restored. The main altar was almost totally renovated, and the columns repaired. The roofs of the bell towers were renovated to assume a crown-like form. The second to the fifth Santo Domingos were bound by a common symbol, the image of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Santisimo Rosario or La Naval de Manila which was solemnly crowned on 5 Oct 1907.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 21 Dec 1941, the church and the Dominican convento beside it were hit by Japanese bombs. This was the first church to be ruined during the Pacific War. The friars, their archives, the image of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, and some movable property like ivory statues, the gala vestments of the Virgin, jewelry, and sacred vessels were the only survivors of the war. The friars had kept valuable items inside a cement vault.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, the Dominicans decided to move out of Intramuros and the lot occupied by the Santo Domingo was acquired by the Bank of the Philippine Islands. The Dominicans built the postwar Santo Domingo in a lot they had purchased in Quezon City. Built in the Spanish Moderne style, so called by its architect Jose Maria Zaragoza, the church employed the latest technique in reinforced-concrete building. The church and its adjoining quadrangle and living quarters were inaugurated on 12 Oct 1954. The church facade has receding planes with eaves designed in corbel arches. Over the triple portals of the church is a high-relief frieze depicting the story of the La Naval designed by the Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a>, then a professor at the UST. The gigantic sculpture of Santo Domingo that graces the otherwise plain quadrilateral bell tower is also by Monti. The interior gives a sense of expansiveness, as the nave gives full view of the apse whose focal point is a mosaic of Santo Domingo with a dog carrying a fiery brand designed by Zaragoza. The pendentives supporting the quadrilateral-crossing tower are designed as reliefs of the four evangelists depicted as winged creatures or the tetramorph. Monti designed the reliefs. Above these are murals of the evangelists by Antonio Llamas. Other areas beneath the crossing tower are decorated with eight murals by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a> depicting scenes from the life of Santo Domingo. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a> designed the stained glass of the church, whose bases show different ecclesiastical seals. The image of La Naval is kept on the side altar all year round, except during the October fiesta when a special canopy and platforms are built for it behind the main altar. The canopy is designed like a retablo in the neo-Gothic style reminiscent of the prewar Santo Domingo. Curtains in gold, white, and blue adorn the sanctuary for the festivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work to maintain the church continues. The exterior has been repainted several times. The frieze, at one time, was painted silver, but it has been restored to white, which has long been its color. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Location: Cebu City. Built 1735 onwards. Basilica completed 1739; monastery completed 1760.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Basilica Minore del Santo Ni&ntilde;o is the shrine of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Cebu, oldest known Catholic image in the Philippines. During the conquest of Cebu by the Spaniards in 1565, one of the soldiers of Legazpi found the image in a wooden box in an abandoned house. It is said to be the same image which<strong> </strong>Magellan gave the queen of Cebu in 1521 after she was baptized. On seeing the image, Legazpi declared that the statue should be enshrined in the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> to be built in the place and that it should be called the Church of the Santisimo Nombre de Jesus. Since then the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o has been in the custody of the Augustinians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr Diego de Herrera, OSA, is said to have built the first church, made of wood and nipa, which was completed 21 years later. This building was destroyed by fire in 1628. A church of brick and stone was built that same year by Fr Juan Medina, OSA. This church appears in a 1699 map of Cebu. By 1729 the church needed major structural repairs. The Augustinian chapter of 31 Oct 1729 decided that the church be rebuilt. In 1731, Fr Jose Bosqued, OSA, informed the governor-general that the building should be demolished and a new one built on its site. Construction began but the project was suspended when the walls were found to be defective, being made of bricks that easily crumbled.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundations for a church made of stone were laid in 1735. The project was directed by Fr Juan de Albarran, OSA, who left his experiences in an unpublished work, &ldquo;Arte de construir Iglesias en Filipinas&rdquo; (Art of Constructing Churches in the Philippines). The stones came from quarries on Mactan and Panay islands which were brought to Cebu by banca. Molave for trusses came from the mountains of southern Cebu. Coral stones, transported to the site by banca, were used to make lime for mortar. Records show that wage laborers from San Nicolas, Carcar, and Boljoon worked on the church for five years. The building was completed in 1739. On 16 Jan 1740, the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o was installed in the new church. According to an inscription over its entrance, the convento was completed in 1760.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repairs were undertaken in 1782. Two side <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altars</a> were constructed between 1861 and 1865. In 1889, glass windows and iron grills were installed, two side altars were added, the floor was finished with marble, and the interior and main altar were painted. In preparation for the Fourth Centenary of the Christianization of the Philippines in 1965, both church and <strong>convento</strong> were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> and renovated. Of the four <strong>arcos torales</strong> (semicircular arches) at the transept, the two transverse arches were removed. The two side altars were also removed. On 1 Apr 1965, under a special privilege granted by Pope Paul VI to the Augustinian Order, the church was recognized as the&nbsp;<em>mater et caput&nbsp;</em>(mother and head) of all churches in the country and at the same time declared a basilica minore. In 1973, Pres Ferdinand Marcos declared it a national historical shrine.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is cruciform in plan with a transept half the length of the nave. The walls are of coral stone and range from 1 to 1.5 m in thickness. The facade, including the bell tower and the convento portal, is a masterpiece of balance and harmony. The two-story sections are divided by thin pilasters into three vertical sections. The three-story belfry is hexagonal in plan. This disposition of elements influenced the later Cebuano churches of San Nicolas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/272\">Boljoon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/291\">Dalaguete</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a>, Opon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/368\">Samboan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trefoil arch of the church portal is echoed in the small relief above it and in the convento&rsquo;s portal, as well as in the shallow niche on the second story of the bell tower. The relief over the portal is flanked by small pilasters topped with small finials and adorned with florid flanges in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> manner. A triangular pediment rests over the relief. The central panel of the facade has its own pediment echoing the main pediment on which it is imposed. The resulting three layers of pediments on the central panel are unique in Philippine colonial church architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each side section of the facade has an arched window on the second-story resting directly on the cornice. Under these windows on the first story are large reliefs, each portraying an Augustinian saint in a florid rectangular frame resting on a fan-shaped console adorned with volutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wall on the bell tower along the line of the church facade has an image in a trefoil niche on the second story and another relieve of a saint on the first story.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the basilica has two important features: the ornate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> and the <strong>coro-cum-tribuna</strong> (choir loft with balcony). The first is a three-story structure with seven niches each on the first and second stories and two niches and a relief on the last. Salomonica columns and carved flanges and statues of Augustinian saints make the retablo impressive, perhaps the widest of its kind in the Philippines. The coro-cum-tribuna is distinguished for its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">mudejar</a>-style carvings of flat screen-like balustrades. Notable too are the carved benches and the oil portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Santo Ni&ntilde;o is now enshrined in a bulletproof altar. The convento has been renovated and the atrium between the church and the adjoining convento has been <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscaped</a> and decorated. To accommodate the large crowd that attends the Sinulog fiesta, celebrated on the third weekend of January to honor the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, an altar and a grandstand have been built along the perimeter of the church plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a strong earthquake on 15 Oct 2013, a part of the belfry, including its bulbous coral stone roof, tumbled down and broke into pieces. Inventory and restoration efforts with the help of several cultural agencies are now done bringing the belfry back to its original form. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5517\"><strong>Resil B.

The Augustinian chapter of 31 Oct 1729 decided that the church be rebuilt. In 1731, Fr Jose Bosqued, OSA, informed the governor-general that the building should be demolished and a new one built on its site. Construction began but the project was suspended when the walls were found to be defective, being made of bricks that easily crumbled."

Its Christianization was undertaken by the Franciscans, who dedicated the town to Santa Clara. In 1605, the town was placed under the jurisdiction of Tayabas. It was reestablished in 1631 along the banks of the Cayanuang River. A stone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was constructed on this new site from 1632 to 1641&mdash;this time, it was dedicated to San Francisco de Asis. In 1703 Sariaya was transferred a third time to a place called Tumbaga or Lumang Bayan. An eruption of Mt Banahaw in 1730 forced the town a year after to move a fourth time. The eruption also formed a lake in the caldera of Banahaw. A lip of the caldera collapsed in 1743, releasing boulders and torrents of water that destroyed the townsite and the stone church in Tumbaga as well. Thus, Sariaya relocated for the fifth and last time to the place it presently occupies. On this site Fr Joaquin Alapon, OFM, built a stone church and <strong>convento</strong>, which were completed in 1748. The church was repaired in 1850. It was painted and renovated by Fr Andres Alvarez, OFM, who also had the old convento demolished and a new one built.

Cherub heads fill the arch of the main portal and of the second-story windows.

Present church dates from about 1848 and after; <strong>convento</strong> inaugurated 1896, although unfinished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarrat was known by various names throughout its dramatic history. It was once called Cabayugan, after a kind of bamboo in the area. It was listed as Santa Monica de Sarrat in 1586 when the Augustinians established it as a mission station of Laoag further down the Padsan River. Separated and erected as a parish in 1724, it was then called San Miguel de Sarrat, but occasionally San Miguel de Cuming after an abundant saffron-like plant. Finally, it was officially changed to Sarrat in 1917.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarrat was one of the richest towns in the Ilocos, essentially due to its cotton textile industry. However, its people joined the Basi Revolt in 1807. In 1815, the&nbsp;<em>cailianes&nbsp;</em>(common people) rose up against the&nbsp;<em>principales&nbsp;</em>(land-owning local elite) and the friars, ending with the church and town in ashes. This incident led to the formal partition of Ilocos into two provinces. Sarrat would have been the capital of Ilocos Norte, except that Laoag had a larger population.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1815, Sarrat relocated on a promontory on the other side of the river, apparently standing guard over what could have been its old seat in Nagrebcan (destroyed). On 3 Mar 1816 both church and convento caught fire, and it is after this date that the extant parish books commence. The convento was reconstructed in 1817, while the church was rebuilt in 1848. The preponderance of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> elements on a monumental scale implies that much of the form of the church dates from the first half of the middle of the 19th century. Both structures burned down again in 1882. The grandly reconstructed but not quite completed convento was inaugurated in Jun 1896. To one side is a well finished on 21 May 1895. Expense records in the parish archives indicate that work was still in full swing when the Philippine Revolution spread to Sarrat in 1898. The church was occupied by the Iglesia Filipina Independiente from the early 1900s to 1910, when it was returned to the Catholics on 1 Feb 1910.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earthquake of 19 Mar 1931 toppled the bell tower and damaged the church and convento. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">Philippines Historical Committee</a> placed a historical marker on the facade in 1959. In 1977 the protective stucco was peeled off from the walls of both buildings. Another earthquake in 1983 caused the church&rsquo;s pediment and part of the apse to fall. Unfortunately, the rebuilding did not follow the lines of the 19th century original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite extensive earthquake damage, many original aspects and details can still be observed in the interior. Most striking is its size&mdash;the nave, said to be about 105 m, is the longest in the province. All three brick <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> are intact and still maintain their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> (stucco). Like the 19th century facade, they were built in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> idiom, with smooth massive columns flanking niches for saints&rsquo; images. But surely the most important treasure of the church is its roof trusswork. In this excellent example of the <strong>par y nudillo</strong> (collar-beam roof) system learned from the Hispanic world, hundreds of logs seem miraculously locked in place without benefit of any supporting columns from below. This is one of the most amazing architectural feats of its kind in the Philippines, and cannot be replicated even with today&rsquo;s technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A picturesque brick bridge on three arches leads from the church choir loft to the second story of the all-brick convento. Each arch delineates a dome with special acoustic properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Both levels of the convento are of brick, but the application of the protective lime plaster was interrupted in 1898 and never resumed. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5798\">Zialcita</a> describes the convento&rsquo;s method of cooling as the &ldquo;thermos effect&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., a corridor runs between the external walls and the inner wall&mdash;thus sheltering the rooms from the solar heat. Large brick shrines distributed along the main street of the town mark the route of the penitential Stations of the Cross procession. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>De los Reyes, Isabelo. 1890. <i>Historia de Ilocos</i>.

On 3 Mar 1816 both church and convento caught fire, and it is after this date that the extant parish books commence. The convento was reconstructed in 1817, while the church was rebuilt in 1848. The preponderance of <a href=\"/2/4/217\">classical</a> elements on a monumental scale implies that much of the form of the church dates from the first half of the middle of the 19th century. Both structures burned down again in 1882. The grandly reconstructed but not quite completed convento was inaugurated in Jun 1896. To one side is a well finished on 21 May 1895. Expense records in the parish archives indicate that work was still in full swing when the Philippine Revolution spread to Sarrat in 1898. The church was occupied by the Iglesia Filipina Independiente from the early 1900s to 1910, when it was returned to the Catholics on 1 Feb 1910."

Like the 19th century facade, they were built in the <a href=\"/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> idiom, with smooth massive columns flanking niches for saints&#x2019; images. But surely the most important treasure of the church is its roof trusswork. In this excellent example of the <strong>par y nudillo</strong> (collar-beam roof) system learned from the Hispanic world, hundreds of logs seem miraculously locked in place without benefit of any supporting columns from below. This is one of the most amazing architectural feats of its kind in the Philippines, and cannot be replicated even with today&#x2019;s technology."

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The town and church of Taal were organized by the Augustinians originally in a place called Balagon. It was abandoned when the community transferred to what is the present-day town of San Nicolas. When Taal volcano erupted in 1754, the townspeople, together with the parish priest sought refuge in Caysasay. Here in 1756 Fray Martin Aguirre, OSA, began construction of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> of reef stones. Completed in 1782, the church and its adjoining <strong>convento</strong> were again ruined by Taal&rsquo;s eruption in 1852. In 1858 Fr Marcos Anton, OSA, with the help of the government architect Luciano Oliver, started the construction of the present church of Taal on a plateau above Caysasay. Although inaugurated in 1856, the church was completed only in 1878. Fr Agapito Aparicio, OSA added a main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a> and paved the baptistry with tiles said to come from Europe. It was elevated to a basilica minore on 22 Oct 1948. After years of neglect, the church was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> in 1972 to commemorate the quadricentennial of the town&rsquo;s foundation. In 1974, it was declared a &ldquo;national shrine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church stands majestically on top of a hill and is unobstructed by any edifice. Its facade has been described as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> as it is a single mass of stone shaped according to complex, rich, and dynamic designs. Paired Ionic and Corinthian columns contrast sharply with the massiveness of the facade and create &ldquo;a dramatic vertical movement broken by the roundness of fenestration aligned horizontally&rdquo; (Galende 1987). Ever since Taal town was marked as a potential <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage zone</a> with its unusually wide and stately <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> church, community effort has been expended to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">preserve</a> the town&rsquo;s heritage. The focus was the church complex, with various levels of success. The exterior continues to go through refurbishments. The small bell tower that had been destroyed was rebuilt, and the Escuela Pia outside the church was restored to be reused as a venue for events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basilica&rsquo;s cruciform interior is divided into three naves by massive piers supporting rounded arches of stone. The transepts, like the apse, are rounded. The interior has recently been refurbished in a more pleasing and aesthetically sound way. Around 2008, the trompe l&rsquo;oeil painting in the manner of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">reconstructed</a>. The nave floor was resurfaced. The side altar, formerly an unsightly neon-lit cement structure which occasionally housed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2246\">Virgin of Caysasay</a>, has been replaced by a replica of the original wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a>. However, by 2013, the neoclassical main retablo had been restyled with the addition of flanking niches in the baroque idiom, detracting from its authenticity. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

It was abandoned when the community transferred to what is the present-day town of San Nicolas. When Taal volcano erupted in 1754, the townspeople, together with the parish priest sought refuge in Caysasay. Here in 1756 Fray Martin Aguirre, OSA, began construction of a <a href=\"/2/5/244\">church</a> of reef stones. Completed in 1782, the church and its adjoining <strong>convento</strong> were again ruined by Taal&#x2019;s eruption in 1852. In 1858 Fr Marcos Anton, OSA, with the help of the government architect Luciano Oliver, started the construction of the present church of Taal on a plateau above Caysasay. Although inaugurated in 1856, the church was completed only in 1878. Fr Agapito Aparicio, OSA added a main <a href=\"/2/5/240\">altar</a> and paved the baptistry with tiles said to come from Europe. It was elevated to a basilica minore on 22 Oct 1948. After years of neglect, the church was <a href=\"/2/6/255\">restored</a> in 1972 to commemorate the quadricentennial of the town&#x2019;s foundation. In 1974, it was declared a &#x201C;national shrine.&#x201D;"

Paired Ionic and Corinthian columns contrast sharply with the massiveness of the facade and create &#x201C;a dramatic vertical movement broken by the roundness of fenestration aligned horizontally&#x201D; (Galende 1987). Ever since Taal town was marked as a potential <a href=\"/2/5/227\">heritage zone</a> with its unusually wide and stately <a href=\"/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> church, community effort has been expended to <a href=\"/2/6/255\">preserve</a> the town&#x2019;s heritage. The focus was the church complex, with various levels of success. The exterior continues to go through refurbishments. The small bell tower that had been destroyed was rebuilt, and the Escuela Pia outside the church was restored to be reused as a venue for events."

The later church was burnt by a flaming arrow shot by enemies of the settlement. There was only enough time to save an image of the Purisima Concepcion, which the natives venerated. How they acquired the image is unknown. It may have been left by the troops of Juan de Salcedo sent to explore the area in 1572. In 1639 the Chinese in Manila rose in revolt against the Spaniards. The rebels were repulsed and fled in the direction of the Sierra Madre, first attacking the town of Antipolo and retreating all the way to Tanay.

The image of the Virgin was installed in the provisional church and a feast was celebrated annually in honor of the Concepcion after the feast of San Ildefonso, which is on 23 Jan. Because of the miraculous reputation of the image, Fr Pedro de Espallargas, OFM, was able to construct a church and <strong>convento</strong> of stone in 1680 through votive offerings alone. This church faced east and was located in what is presently called Tanay Plaza in front and to the right of the church. By 1773, the church and convento was almost a century old and was in poor condition. Fr Ildefonso Fentanes began a new construction on an adjacent site with a mere fund of 37 pesos and two reales. He begged for money from the town of Majayjay and Manila. He completed construction a decade later, 1783. The church and convento were made of stone, quarried in Tanay, because de Huerta (1865) reports that about one&nbsp;<em>legua&nbsp;</em>(between 4 and 7 km) from the poblacion, there was a stone quarry whose quality could not be matched in the whole archipelago. This is the church of Tanay that still stands today. In 1851, the convento was repaired and improved. Huerta, 1865, reports that in the town there was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>casa tribunal</strong></a>, an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\"><strong>escuela</strong></a>, and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>camarin</strong></a> or storehouse of nipa. There were about 700 houses&mdash;a good three-fourths was of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present Tanay Church follows the cruciform plan with a shortened transept. Like the other Franciscan churches along the eastern shores of Laguna Lake, its gray-adobe facade is ornamented with floral insets, cherubs, foliage, and niches containing saintly images. The church&rsquo;s plain interior contrasts with the six <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> decorated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a> elements, which first appeared in the 1770s. Ornaments divide the twisted columns in the middle. The main retablo, completed in 1785 and installed in 1786, contains the patronal image of San Ildefonso, which is lit from a window behind the retablo. This halo effect is unique to Tanay, but reminiscent of baroque churches in Central Europe. A semicircular wooden tabernacle emblazoned with the symbol of the Eucharist replaces a silver one, 1.5 m tall, with a dome which was stolen in the 1970s. The three other retablos are found in the left transept, with the Angustias surmounted by angels carrying symbols of Christ&rsquo;s passion; the right transept, with San Pedro de Alcantara; and the baptistry, with an image of San Juan Bautista baptizing Jesus. The pediment has a niche containing a saint, possibly San Francisco Javier since Tanay was once under the Jesuits. The nave has an outstanding&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2316\">Via Crucis</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>(Way of the Cross) carved by an unknown master, popularly called &ldquo;Maestro de Tanay.&rdquo; The first 12 stations seem to have come from one artist, and the last two from two others.

Completed 1860.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frs Juan de la Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa first preached the Christian faith in the Tayabas region in 1578. Between 1580 and 1585, a bamboo, nipa, and anahaw <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>camarin</strong></a> or granary-type <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was built and placed under the patronage of San Miguel Arcangel. Following the 1590 visitation of Fr Pedro Bautista, superior of the Franciscans in the Philippines and later a martyr in Japan, an order was issued that all camarin-type churches be replaced with structures of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not until after 1600 that a stone church was built in Tayabas. In 1721 the church roof was repaired, and in 1736 a wall was built around the mission complex. The church was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1743, probably caused by or simultaneous with the eruption of Mt Banahaw that year. It was subsequently rebuilt on a grander scale on the same site. In 1746 the wall was fortified by adding a meter more of mortar. Four years later, its height was increased. In 1761 a two-story facade crowned by a triangular pediment was constructed. In 1768 the church&rsquo;s nipa roof was replaced by tiles, and the dome over the main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a> was built. In 1771 a wooden barrel vault was constructed. From 1855 to 1860 a transept with rounded ends and circular crossing was added to the church. In 1858 the construction of the cupola over the crossing began, and a third story and semicircular pediment was added to the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Completed on 1 Nov 1860, the church was blessed on 11 Nov by Fr Jose Urbina Esparagos, OFM, parish priest. In 1864 the interior walls were covered with stucco as a ground for decorative painting. The following year, the church acquired a pipe organ assembled by Telesforo de Lavarez from Pasay. In 1873 a new sacristy was added to the transept. In 1894 the church roof of tile was replaced by galvanized iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925 the church interior received another set of decorative paintings, done under the supervision of Victor Flores.

As a formal part, it is relatively undefined since it incorporates both third and second levels, emanating from an apex whose design is the only one of its kind in the country over.

Its name is derived from the&nbsp;<em>tigbaw&nbsp;</em>or ditch reed, abundant in the area.

A prewar photograph shows that the facade originally sported a pair of turrets flanking the pediment. An earthquake in 1948 greatly damaged the church and <strong>convento</strong>. Today, only the church&rsquo;s facade with its unusual ornamentation, the squat three-story bell tower, and the walls of the convent remain of the original colonial-era structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade and bell tower are built of at least two varieties of stone, yellowish and reddish, similar to those material used in the churches of nearby <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a> and Guimbal. An unusual facade results from decorations limited only to the central portion around the entrance. Even the pair of windows on the choir loft level is unarticulated. The facade is reminiscent of Spanish and Mexican churches in the plateresque manner, so called because the carving resembled the work of&nbsp;<em>plateros&nbsp;</em>(silversmiths). This style was characteristic of 15th and 16th century Spanish architecture. There is a slight affinity to <strong>tequitqui</strong> or carved ornamentation by newly Christianized Mexican Indians. But what is plateresque in style is not so in form. Where plateresque and tequitqui are characterized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> motifs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a> grotesqueries, here the elements are more vegetal in form and in fact exude the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> spirit of a century later. Other scholars heighten the Mexican affinity by mistakenly citing the presence of <strong>estipites</strong> or inverted obelisks characteristic of the churrigueresque style in the 18th century&mdash;mistakenly because there are actually no estipites. The Tigbauan facade reflects a Filipino adaptation&mdash;with a strong vegetal bias&mdash;of plateresque, tequitqui, and baroque elements. It is the only extant facade of its kind in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the church is distinct for its Stations of the Cross and other religious scenes interpreted in mosaic by local artists. The pair of turrets flanking the pediment were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">reconstructed</a> in concrete in recent years. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong>, with notes from Edgar Allan M.

The facade is reminiscent of Spanish and Mexican churches in the plateresque manner, so called because the carving resembled the work of&#xA0;<em>plateros&#xA0;</em>(silversmiths). This style was characteristic of 15th and 16th century Spanish architecture. There is a slight affinity to <strong>tequitqui</strong> or carved ornamentation by newly Christianized Mexican Indians. But what is plateresque in style is not so in form. Where plateresque and tequitqui are characterized by <a href=\"/2/4/217\">classical</a> motifs and <a href=\"/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a> grotesqueries, here the elements are more vegetal in form and in fact exude the <a href=\"/2/4/217\">baroque</a> spirit of a century later. Other scholars heighten the Mexican affinity by mistakenly citing the presence of <strong>estipites</strong> or inverted obelisks characteristic of the churrigueresque style in the 18th century&#x2014;mistakenly because there are actually no estipites. The Tigbauan facade reflects a Filipino adaptation&#x2014;with a strong vegetal bias&#x2014;of plateresque, tequitqui, and baroque elements. It is the only extant facade of its kind in the Philippines."

		"text": "<p>Roman Catholic Parish Church of San Matias Apostol. Location: Tumauini, Isabela. Started ca 1783-84.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumauini came into being as a midway stop between Ilagan and San Pablo along the Cagayan River. The Dominicans, who had jurisdiction over the entire Cagayan Valley, established it as a mission post in 1707. As river traffic increased, Tumauini grew in importance until, in 1749, the&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>(elite) thought it fit to petition the authorities to declare the settlement a town. The parish itself was founded in 1751. Tumauini was briefly the capital of the province of Isabela, created in 1856.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A provisional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> was erected in 1707. In 1759 and 1771, the townspeople attempted to rebuild the wooden church but were stopped by authorities. In Jun 1783, the people petitioned Manila to let them build a stone church since, by this time, the existing church was not only too small but near collapse. In Sep 1783, government approval was finally given. By this time, however, the townspeople, having anticipated government approval, were well into their third month of construction. Brick insets on the inner and outer walls are marked with the years &ldquo;1783&rdquo; and &ldquo;1784&rdquo;. Excavation and settling of the foundations may have begun even earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Work on the church was led by the Dominican vicar of Tumauini Domingo Forto and the&nbsp;<em>alcalde de naturales&nbsp;</em>or mayor Pablo Siason. They were reportedly aided by a mason, named Castillejos, from Lal-lo, Cagayan. While kilns and lime were constructed, bricks may have come from Tuguegarao, Cagayan. Carvers from Pampanga helped make the decorative brick insets used throughout. Brick making was most developed in the Cagayan Valley. Moulded, numbered, dated, and signed bricks distinguish a certain technology that runs throughout the churches built in the late 18th century by Dominicans in the Cagayan Valley. A charcoal-black 1783 brick on the facade appears overcooked, witness perhaps to experimentation in firing temperatures. By such practical experience, Dominican-fired brick walls in Cagayan exhibit much less wear and tear even without protective layers of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> (stucco or lime plaster) unlike Ilocos and Pangasinan churches whose bricks erode if the palitada were removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church complex is still almost complete. The patio is fenced off by a sway back wall with alternating crests. In the center of the patio is a dilapidated wooden cross on its brick base. The <strong>convento</strong> stands in ruins to the church&rsquo;s left, destroyed by an earthquake in 1863 and further damaged by bombs during World War II. The remains of a larger church with a brick arched vault can still be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade is a fanciful variation of the silhouette first utilized in Tuguegarao in the 1760s. But instead of a triangular pediment, it has an arched wall that echoes the shape of the circular window meant to light the choir loft. This semicircular pediment is flanked by finials and volutes. Its shape is repeated in the curious wheel decorations, resembling stone wheels in Hindu temples, on the facade&rsquo;s base. Scrolls and volutes ornament the outer edges of the facade. The individual brick pieces for these decorations were numbered before firing to ensure proper assembly. A pair of niches house images of Dominican saints in stone, themselves rare examples of sculpture in this material. All over the facade and on the exterior and interior walls are molded-brick decorations depicting flowers, leaves, saints, scallops, religious symbols, and other fanciful motifs. To the facade&rsquo;s right is a unique cylindrical bell tower, which reached the height of the church in 1805 and must have been completed soon after. It is unique for at least three reasons: its round plan is not seen elsewhere except in Itbayat (Batanes), Borongan (Eastern Samar), and San Francisco, Naga City (Camarines Sur); the brick artistic elements are left exposed, to contrast with the rest of the walls covered with lime plaster; and the decorative scheme is a delight by itself, with swags, festoons, hearts, pineapples, and the so-called egg-and-dart motif with the &ldquo;darts&rdquo; left out, making it look like a huge wedding cake.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior, although heavily damaged, retains its otherworldly aura. The sanctuary is marked off from the rest of the nave by an expansive <strong>arco toral</strong> (semicircular arch). Bright light from elliptical side windows immediately draws attention to this area, dominated by a huge scallop of brick. Behind the apse is a buttress, pierced by a narrow passageway, thus making it look like a flying buttress. A similar pair of buttresses can be seen supporting the apse of Santo Domingo Church, now in ruins, in Piat, Cagayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brick convento was greatly damaged by the earthquake of 1863. Parts were demolished by Fr Juan de Dios Rico, 1867-72, who had to bring in prisoners from Ilagan because of strong opposition from the residents. What was rebuilt by Fr Alejandro Sarralde, 1872-78, was destroyed by a typhoon in 1884. Fr. Jose Brugues, 1883-89, continued the rebuilding and replaced the tile roof with galvanized iron. Despite its present ruined condition, there are amazing survivals. Over what must have been the dining area is a curved masonry ceiling, technically called a barrel vault. Such solid vaults are rare in the Philippines, and the majority of Filipino examples are found in the Cagayan Valley. In Tumauini alone, there are three: the largest, over the dining area (the refectory), another over the hallway linking the convento to the church, and a small one over a portion of the sacristy. Notable also are the impressions on the <strong>palitada</strong> or lime plaster of the vault which show that the wet plaster was held up by mats of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>sawali</strong></a>. At the end of the dining area is the kitchen, surmounted by an impressive quadrangular brick chimney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of this legacy of intricate brick architecture perished when Allied forces bombed the towns along the Cagayan Valley in 1945. They were ostensibly mopping up Japanese troops, whereas by this time the Japanese had already vacated the area and were holed up in Ifugao. In Tumauini, the townspeople trustingly stored their pianos in the church. Legarda ruefully notes, &ldquo;Musical life in Tumauini has not been the same since the bombing.&rdquo; Fr Forto&rsquo;s 1790 bell resembles a giant sieve due to Allied strafing of the belltower.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumauini remained a magnificent ruin, like numerous other Cagayan Valley churches, for many years after 1945. Hollow blocks filled in the gaping holes on both sides of the nave. The rose window on the facade was reconstructed as best as the people could at that time. The old convento was not rebuilt, and a new one rose instead in a corner of the patio. Notwithstanding this series of misfortunes which have not ended&mdash;in Oct 2010 Typhoon &ldquo;Juan,&rdquo; as it devastated the Cagayan Valley, unroofed a third of the church&mdash;the Parish Church of San Matias in Tumauini, Isabela is the masterpiece of brick architecture in the Philippines. In the Cagayan Valley, where bricks were produced so well they outlasted those in other regions, Tumauini represents the height of brick technology in colonial Philippines, in terms of both durability and design. Added to this attainment are unique details such as the round bell tower; the sanctuary with its half-dome altar, oval windows, and curved corners; the kitchen chimney; the three barrel vaults; and the sawali impressions on the palitada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tumauini Church, with its highly decorative facade, cylindrical bell tower, and festive brick decorations, is one of the Philippines&rsquo; most important historical landmarks.

The Dominicans, who had jurisdiction over the entire Cagayan Valley, established it as a mission post in 1707. As river traffic increased, Tumauini grew in importance until, in 1749, the&#xA0;<em>principalia&#xA0;</em>(elite) thought it fit to petition the authorities to declare the settlement a town. The parish itself was founded in 1751. Tumauini was briefly the capital of the province of Isabela, created in 1856."

In Jun 1783, the people petitioned Manila to let them build a stone church since, by this time, the existing church was not only too small but near collapse. In Sep 1783, government approval was finally given. By this time, however, the townspeople, having anticipated government approval, were well into their third month of construction. Brick insets on the inner and outer walls are marked with the years &#x201C;1783&#x201D; and &#x201C;1784&#x201D;. Excavation and settling of the foundations may have begun even earlier."

They were reportedly aided by a mason, named Castillejos, from Lal-lo, Cagayan. While kilns and lime were constructed, bricks may have come from Tuguegarao, Cagayan. Carvers from Pampanga helped make the decorative brick insets used throughout. Brick making was most developed in the Cagayan Valley. Moulded, numbered, dated, and signed bricks distinguish a certain technology that runs throughout the churches built in the late 18th century by Dominicans in the Cagayan Valley. A charcoal-black 1783 brick on the facade appears overcooked, witness perhaps to experimentation in firing temperatures. By such practical experience, Dominican-fired brick walls in Cagayan exhibit much less wear and tear even without protective layers of <a href=\"/2/6/253\"><strong>palitada</strong></a> (stucco or lime plaster) unlike Ilocos and Pangasinan churches whose bricks erode if the palitada were removed."

				"value": "The facade is a fanciful variation of the silhouette first utilized in Tuguegarao in the 1760s. But instead of a triangular pediment, it has an arched wall that echoes the shape of the circular window meant to light the choir loft. This semicircular pediment is flanked by finials and volutes. Its shape is repeated in the curious wheel decorations, resembling stone wheels in Hindu temples, on the facade&#x2019;s base. Scrolls and volutes ornament the outer edges of the facade. The individual brick pieces for these decorations were numbered before firing to ensure proper assembly. A pair of niches house images of Dominican saints in stone, themselves rare examples of sculpture in this material. All over the facade and on the exterior and interior walls are molded-brick decorations depicting flowers, leaves, saints, scallops, religious symbols, and other fanciful motifs. To the facade&#x2019;s right is a unique cylindrical bell tower, which reached the height of the church in 1805 and must have been completed soon after. It is unique for at least three reasons: its round plan is not seen elsewhere except in Itbayat (Batanes), Borongan (Eastern Samar), and San Francisco, Naga City (Camarines Sur); the brick artistic elements are left exposed, to contrast with the rest of the walls covered with lime plaster; and the decorative scheme is a delight by itself, with swags, festoons, hearts, pineapples, and the so-called egg-and-dart motif with the &#x201C;darts&#x201D; left out, making it look like a huge wedding cake."

Behind the apse is a buttress, pierced by a narrow passageway, thus making it look like a flying buttress. A similar pair of buttresses can be seen supporting the apse of Santo Domingo Church, now in ruins, in Piat, Cagayan."

				"value": "The brick convento was greatly damaged by the earthquake of 1863. Parts were demolished by Fr Juan de Dios Rico, 1867-72, who had to bring in prisoners from Ilagan because of strong opposition from the residents. What was rebuilt by Fr Alejandro Sarralde, 1872-78, was destroyed by a typhoon in 1884. Fr. Jose Brugues, 1883-89, continued the rebuilding and replaced the tile roof with galvanized iron. Despite its present ruined condition, there are amazing survivals. Over what must have been the dining area is a curved masonry ceiling, technically called a barrel vault. Such solid vaults are rare in the Philippines, and the majority of Filipino examples are found in the Cagayan Valley. In Tumauini alone, there are three: the largest, over the dining area (the refectory), another over the hallway linking the convento to the church, and a small one over a portion of the sacristy. Notable also are the impressions on the <strong>palitada</strong> or lime plaster of the vault which show that the wet plaster was held up by mats of <a href=\"/2/6/253\"><strong>sawali</strong></a>. At the end of the dining area is the kitchen, surmounted by an impressive quadrangular brick chimney."

They were ostensibly mopping up Japanese troops, whereas by this time the Japanese had already vacated the area and were holed up in Ifugao. In Tumauini, the townspeople trustingly stored their pianos in the church. Legarda ruefully notes, &#x201C;Musical life in Tumauini has not been the same since the bombing.&#x201D; Fr Forto&#x2019;s 1790 bell resembles a giant sieve due to Allied strafing of the belltower."

The rose window on the facade was reconstructed as best as the people could at that time. The old convento was not rebuilt, and a new one rose instead in a corner of the patio. Notwithstanding this series of misfortunes which have not ended&#x2014;in Oct 2010 Typhoon &#x201C;Juan,&#x201D; as it devastated the Cagayan Valley, unroofed a third of the church&#x2014;the Parish Church of San Matias in Tumauini, Isabela is the masterpiece of brick architecture in the Philippines. In the Cagayan Valley, where bricks were produced so well they outlasted those in other regions, Tumauini represents the height of brick technology in colonial Philippines, in terms of both durability and design. Added to this attainment are unique details such as the round bell tower; the sanctuary with its half-dome altar, oval windows, and curved corners; the kitchen chimney; the three barrel vaults; and the sawali impressions on the palitada."

Architect: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2697\">Roque Rua&ntilde;o, OP</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main building of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) was the first building erected in its Espa&ntilde;a campus. The University was originally located in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, near the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a>. In 1911, when the University celebrated its third centenary, the cornerstone for a new building was laid in a 22-hectare lot in Sulucan, Sampaloc, in a new section that had been the hacienda of the Poor Clares. Fr Roque Rua&ntilde;o, OP was assigned to prepare the plans for the building in the new campus in 1911. Fr Rua&ntilde;o was one of the first graduates of the UST College of Engineering, having received his licentiate in civil engineering in 1912. In 1917 the revised drawings in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style were done, then from 1920-1923 they were further modified. Construction began in 1923 and was completed in 1927. Two hundred workers from Pampanga were hired for the project. The building cost one and a half million pesos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For UST, Rua&ntilde;o designed a majestic building that would house 3,000 students as well as the Dominican faculty and administrators. The four-story building is 86 m wide and 74 m deep, with a 33,500-square-meter floor area. It has a nine-story tower, 47.61 m high, featuring the cross that symbolizes the Catholic faith; the Coat of Arms of the Dominican Order; and the huge Rosary, the emblem of the patroness, the Lady of the Holy Rosary. The building has had two courtyards, which flanked the central section that houses the <strong>paranymphus</strong>, originally an auditorium, but now used for the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences (the oldest museum in the Philippines, established in 1871, transferred in 1936 from Intramuros). On the roof deck are small buildings designed for laboratories. Their roofs are shallow pools, containing water about 30 cm deep to serve as insulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the former Estero Sulucan once flowed, the site for the building was muddy and swampy, so Fr Rua&ntilde;o had to design a structure with special features that would enable it to withstand earthquakes. Thus the building was made by putting together 40 separate sections, each complete with its own foundation, columns, beams, walls, and floors. Gaps of 1-5 cm between walls and beams were filled with a soft, compressible material like tar. This gave the building a certain elasticity that enabled it to survive tremors. During construction, floor slabs were prefabricated on the ground and were hoisted to the upper floors. Construction was organized to minimize the use of form lumber. Concrete was prepared, mixed, and formed in such a way that its surface could be left exposed without any finishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Rua&ntilde;o&rsquo;s architectural style is a fusion of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a>, and the application of eastern-inspired details&mdash;particularly the precast concrete forms (resembling wooden <strong>kumimono</strong> bracket used in traditional Japanese structures)&mdash;embellish the whole envelope. For passive cooling, the building was punctured with large double-hung windows alternately treated with pilaster covers. The building is adorned with as many as 492 capitals and 433 base mouldings. The A-clock from France was added six months after the structure&rsquo;s inauguration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1952 to 1953, 15 statues each 3.05 m high were installed on pedestals on the roof deck. These were the products of the Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a>, who taught in the University&rsquo;s School of Fine Arts. In the center of the facade are Faith, Hope, and Charity. On the facade&rsquo;s right corner are Aristotle, St Albert the Great, and Plato. On the facade&rsquo;s left corner are Vincent of Beauvais, St Augustine, and St Raymond of Pe&ntilde;afort; while on the left side elevation facing P. Noval St are Calderon de la Barca, Sophocles, and Shakespeare. On the right side elevation facing A. H. Lacson St are Lope de Vega, Aristophanes, and Moliere. These great philosophers, playwrights, medieval scientists, and canonists, embodied the aspirations of the venerable institution, although they constitute only half of the originally intended 30 figures meant to represent a wider range of intellectual endeavors. Without the other figures, not all branches of discipline were represented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lobbies are adorned with significant murals depicting events in the University&rsquo;s history, created by leading artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo Ocampo</a>, Antonio Garcia Llamas, Dante Fabie, and Danilo Santiago, all professors of the UST School (later College) of Fine Arts. The porte cochere was added in 1955 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>, architect of the UST Central Seminary and Gym.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A catalyst in the development of the UST campus and the Sampaloc district in Manila, the main building became the focal point of the Espa&ntilde;a boulevard vista and the district&rsquo;s skyline. In front of it, the 4-hectare Benavides Park serves as the lung of the vicinity. This landmark has come to represent the seat of Dominican and Catholic education in the Philippines and in Asia, as well as a Dominican institution of higher learning producing a long tradition of heroes, presidents and leaders inspired by the teachings and philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas. It witnessed the historical changes of the nation and the transitions in the University&rsquo;s administration. It withstood the ravages of World War II and provided shelter to foreign internees in 1942 to 1945. It witnessed the milestone turnover of the university&rsquo;s educational governance from Spanish to Filipino in 1971. It serves as a venue for significant social events and visits of important local and international personalities. Its cultural significance was validated when it was declared a National Cultural Treasure in Jan 2011. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

This landmark has come to represent the seat of Dominican and Catholic education in the Philippines and in Asia, as well as a Dominican institution of higher learning producing a long tradition of heroes, presidents and leaders inspired by the teachings and philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas. It witnessed the historical changes of the nation and the transitions in the University&#x2019;s administration. It withstood the ravages of World War II and provided shelter to foreign internees in 1942 to 1945. It witnessed the milestone turnover of the university&#x2019;s educational governance from Spanish to Filipino in 1971. It serves as a venue for significant social events and visits of important local and international personalities.

Statuary and bas-reliefs: Benjamin Valenciano. Metal work: Arcadio Anore. Chief assistant for mosaics: Romola Santa Ana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after World War II the Victorias Milling Co commissioned the architectural firm of Czech American architect Antonin Raymond (1888-1976) and Slovak Ladislav Rado (1909-1993) of New York to design a chapel for the sugar-milling community, which then had a population of about 3,000. Raymond had worked with Frank Lloyd Wright on the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He worked with Wright from 1917 to 1921, when he left the firm and set up American Architectural and Engineering Company in Tokyo with Leon Whittaker Slack. After the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 destroyed his own house, Raymond avidly researched and developed earthquake resistant designs. Between 1941 and 1945, the World War II years, Raymond returned to New York where he had lived earlier and together with Ladislav Rado (1909-1933) formed Raymond &amp; Rado after World War II. Raymond explored <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a> and made friends with Belgian liturgical artist and illustrator for the <strong><em>Catholic Worker</em></strong>, Ade de Bethune (1914-2002). <strong><em>Catholic Worker</em></strong> was a publication of the Catholic Worker Movement founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 in the United States (US).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ossorio family, which controlled Victorias Milling, hired the services of the firm to design a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> fit for the company and suitable to the geological and climatological conditions of Negros. The cosmopolitan Ossorios must have known of Raymond&rsquo;s work in Japan in designing earthquake resistant buildings. Raymond &amp; Rado designed the church as two separate structures connected by movable beams as a precaution against earthquakes. The longitudinal nave rested on foundations separate from the sanctuary, crowned by a rib like belfry. The church structure was completed in 1949.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 23 Dec 1949 Ade de Bethune arrived in Negros to design and supervise the decoration of the church exterior and baptistery. Raymond knew de Bethune and may have recommended her and the Ossorios must have known about her association with the Catholic Worker Movement and were seeking an original interpretation of the church&rsquo;s patron St Joseph the Worker, whose feast was established by Pius XII on 1 May to counteract the May Day (International Workers Day), established by the Communists and Socialists. Alfonso Ossorio, a Filipino-American&nbsp;artist newly arrived from the US and relative of the owners of Victorias Milling, was commissioned to paint the sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Bethune, after going through various media for decorating the church and with Ossorio&rsquo;s advice, decided upon mosaic. Broken glass of different colors was gathered from the community. Green, aqua, and dark brown were the most common colors, acquired from things like beer and whiskey bottles. Blue, the hardest color to find, were shards of milk of magnesia bottles. The facade was decorated with three scenes acquired from the life of the patron St Joseph: the marriage to Mary, the workshop in Nazareth, and the death of Joseph. Using material left from work on the facade, De Bethune and her Filipino assistants, among them Romola Santa Ana as chief assistant, worked on the mosaic for the baptistery, depicting the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan. The mural at the back of the church was painted. Apparently, materials for making a mosaic had run out before De Bethune had to return to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To carve the images for the church, Filipino carpenter Benjamin Valenciano, a migrant from Manila who had no academic training, was commissioned to do the images of Mary and Joseph and later a crucifix that doubled as a Santo Entierro. The crucifix depicts Christ as a beardless young man. Valenciano also sculpted the images of the Stations of the Cross. Valenciano&rsquo;s friend Arcadio Anore worked on engraving the brass plates for decorating the five-sided pulpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the humid condition of the walls, Ossorio, upon the recommendation of Ralph Mayer of New York, used ethyl silicate 40 as a painting medium. Working on the flat wall, light well, and beams of the apse, Ossorio painted the Trinity and its role in saving humanity. The open hands of the Father offer the Son to the world. The Son, with open arms and heart aflame with love, sits in triumph over sin and death, symbolized by the snake and skull of traditional iconography. The Holy Spirit, depicted as a white descending dove, is flanked by angels blowing their trumpets on Judgment Day. The eye of God and the scroll with seven seals decorate the front beam. Pink, yellow, red, violet, and blue form Ossorio&rsquo;s palette. Flamelike drops fill the mural, giving it a feeling of violent and frenzied movement. The Christ, amidst the falling flames, has been dubbed, &ldquo;The Angry Christ.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial reaction to the decorations of the Victorias Chapel was negative.

Built 1790-ca 1800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vigan was the seat of one of the five dioceses established during Spanish colonial rule, the others being Manila, Nueva Caceres or Naga, Cebu, and Iloilo. The diocese originally had its seat not in Vigan but in Nueva Segovia next to an Ibanag settlement at Lal-lo, Cagayan. In 1581 Pablo Carreon was sent by Gov-Gen Ronquillo to establish a town in Cagayan Valley, which he named Nueva Segovia in memory of his own hometown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1595, a bill of Pope Clement XIII, setting up the diocesan structure of the Philippines and elevating Manila as an archdiocese and metropolitan to which the other dioceses were suffragan, decreed that the settlement of Nueva Segovia, established on the bank of the Ibanag River (also Rio Grande), become the seat of a diocese for northern Luzon. Although founded as an Augustinian mission, Nueva Segovia had been ceded to the Dominicans, who were evangelizing Cagayan Valley. Nueva Segovia&rsquo;s first bishop was the Dominican Fray Miguel de Benavides who took possession of the see in 1599.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The townsite was far from ideal and ravaging floods threatened the town. Thus Nueva Segovia was transferred to Lal-lo on the opposite bank. For many decades the cathedral was an edifice of humble material. It was not until the years 1653 to 1651 that a stone church was commenced. But by 1719 the church was sufficiently damaged. The walls were cracked, the roof greatly deteriorated, and the posts supporting it about to fall. The church was in such a bad state that a church of nipa had to be built in 1721.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this year onward the incumbent bishops sent petitions to the Crown to transfer the seat of the diocese to Villa Fernandina (now Vigan) because Vigan was more accessible as diocesan seat. The petition was granted only on 7 Dec 1758. Although the seat of the diocese had been transferred, it retained its former name of Diocese of Nueva Segovia, while the town was called Vigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than 20 years, no new cathedral was built, rather the Church of San Pablo was used as a cathedral. In 1785, Gov-Gen Jose Basco de Vargas visited Vigan and saw the ruinous state of the church. The following year, Basco authorized the construction of the present cathedral. The cornerstone was laid on 31 Jan 1790.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>With the support of Bp Juan Ruiz de San Agustin, construction continued with sufficient speed. In a report dated 26 May 1794, the bishop stated that as of that year, the stone walls had been raised, the baptistery and sacristy completed, and the facade completed up to the cornice. The detached bell tower was completed up to the second story, and necessary material, e.g., stones for the facade, and wood and tiles for the roof, were already available. According to a document of 20 Apr 1797, Tomas and Alejandro Arenas, Chinese artisans and <strong>maestros de obras</strong> (master builders) of the cathedral, estimated that the sum of 14,000 pesos was needed to complete the roof over the aisles, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>, the pulpit, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>. The cathedral was almost finished when rough sketches of it, dated 1799, were sent to Spain. These sketches of the cathedral, the detached bell tower, and a separate building&mdash;probably the sacristy&mdash;are preserved in the Archivo de las Indias in Seville, Spain. The sketch gives the dimension of the church as 16.5&nbsp;<em>brazas&nbsp;</em>(fathoms) wide and 49.5 brazas long (approximately 28.05 m x 84.15 m). The bell tower rises to a height of 19 brazas (32.4 m) to the tip of the wrought-iron wind vane. The height of the central nave from floor to the apex of the ceiling is 11 brazas (18.7 m), while the aisles flanking it reach 5.5 brazas (9.35 m). Another document gives the following dimensions: the cathedral was 97.67&nbsp;<em>varas&nbsp;</em>(rods) (88.40 m) long, 35 varas and 2&nbsp;<em>puntos&nbsp;</em>(points) (10.67 m and 2 in) wide, and 18 varas (16.46 m) tall when measured from the central section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baroque affinities of the cathedral&rsquo;s facade are suggested by the alternation of columns and frames and the pediment, which is decorated by alternating pyramidal and urn-like finials connected by descending curves. This treatment of the pediment is found in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/274\">Calasiao</a>, Pangasinan, and, in an exaggerated manner, in the Cagayan Valley churches, particularly in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/392\">Tuguegarao</a>. Three arched doorways, leading to the three naves of the church, make the first level of the facade. Ionic pillars and two Chinese&nbsp;<em>fu&nbsp;</em>dogs guard these entrances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the church is simple, distinguished mainly by its division into the nave and flanking aisles, all of which end in altars. The wooden ceiling is made to resemble rib vaulting, whose arches spring from the pillars dividing the center from the side aisles. The ceiling was probably painted as the sanctuary&rsquo;s faux vault still has traces of paint. The sanctuary is separated from the nave by a wrought-iron communion rail pushed forward into the nave to create space for choir stalls, formerly used by the cathedral canons for the daily recitation of the Divine Office. The altar, found at the end of the right aisle or epistle side, dedicated to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, is noteworthy for the miniatures depicting scenes in Mary&rsquo;s life. Another noteworthy altar is found in the baptistery. The altar table has reliefs of the apostles and San Jose. Also notable is a silver tabernacle in the shape of the Sacred Heart. The cathedral has two wrought iron pulpits facing each other along the nave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral&rsquo;s facade and interior was repainted around 2011. The color scheme of the cathedral, white walls, columns in light ocher, and ornaments in green have been replicated in the repainting. The repainting of the interior was ongoing in 2012. The repainting introduced a new color for the back wall behind the retablos. Formerly white, these are now in dark red. While it does not recreate the former color of those walls, it does offset the retablos refurbished earlier and gilded, providing a pleasing contrast to the opulence of gold leaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several steps to the right of the church is the bell tower. The tower is built very much as planned except that it is detached rather than attached to the body of the church. A quadrilateral base supports the octagonal upper stories crowned by a dome roof and decorated by a wrought-iron wind vane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral dominates a long plaza from which straight and narrow streets emanate, forming the gridiron pattern of the colonial community. To the left or gospel side of the cathedral is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">episcopal palace</a>. Repaired after a fire in the 1990s, it is one of the few of its kind that have survived to the 20th century. On its upper floor is Vigan&rsquo;s archdiocesan museum, which keeps ecclesiastical artifacts from the cathedral and other churches in the Ilocos. A room has been arranged to house a display of a solemn high Mass or&nbsp;<em>Misa Dalmatica</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vigan was elevated to archdiocese on 29 Jun 1951, with the suffragan dioceses of Baguio, Laoag, and Bangued.
