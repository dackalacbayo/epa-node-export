Corruption is illustrated by the teachers feeding the students the answers to the National Achievement Test to upgrade their school&rsquo;s status, and a class president stealing answer sheets and going on to an affluent life in adulthood. The imbalance in the power structure is manifested in the students&rsquo; constant fear of their teachers&rsquo; mood swings and their own constant desire to please.

He finally becomes content in a vocational school, where the population is more caring and friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last third of the novel, the narrator becomes, with great reluctance, a substitute high school teacher. The chapters here are a mirror image of the book&rsquo;s first half, as the role of teacher and students are now reversed: the students are his tormentors and he, the tormented.

Amapola is a Kagumay, a manananggal who chooses not to eat humans. The manananggal who eats live human flesh is a Tungkab.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">(Shadow of Yesteryears). Published 1906. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5434\">Francisco Laksamana</a>. Serialized in <b><i>Muling</i></b><i> <b>Pagsilang</b></i>.<i> </i>Reprinted as a book, Manila: Limbagang McCullough, 1907; Manila: Pamana ng Panitikan ng Pilipinas, 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This novel exposes the roots of the Filipinos&rsquo; oppression, symbolized by the dreaded Spanish <i>guardia civil </i>(constabulary) and the friar. The first group figures as the narratives&rsquo; villains, whereas the second is held responsible for the people&rsquo;s blind adherence to superstition; both stand as the agents of destruction and violent death. The novel centers on how Modesto Magsikap decides to take the law into his own hands with dire consequences. What initially starts out as a colorful narrative of love and courtship becomes a tale of murder and pursuit. Enraged by Sergeant Cruz&rsquo;s arrogant behavior as the suitor of his sweetheart Elisea Liwayway, Modesto stabs the soldier dead and flees. He eventually finds himself behind bars with Fabian, accused by his wife of having been responsible for the death of their child, who has died with countless others during a stampede inside a church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modesto and several other prisoners are subsequently freed by bandits who attack the town. He comes home when he finds out that his father, Kabesang Angel, is dead. During the wake, Modesto stabs Lieutenant Rosca, another ardent suitor of Elisea; he flees, and his two brothers are imprisoned instead. The hunt for Modesto intensifies. He is betrayed by a close friend, but he manages to escape and decides to go to the United States. He writes Elisea to inform her of the many wonderful opportunities that democracy affords the people in the United States. In 1896, five years after the series of events, Modesto returns to his country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel&rsquo;s tightly nuanced evocation of community life in a small town in Luzon, with its rituals of birth, love, and death, is contextualized in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. All the major characters, especially the impulsive Modesto and the courageous Elisea, are drawn with attention to fine details of character. The result is a narrative that paints a broad canvas of life in the dying years of Spanish colonial rule. Laksamana&rsquo;s skillful manipulation of the narration lays bare the reasons for the people&rsquo;s continued oppression, with a humor that borders on the satirical and the grotesque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After depicting the past as one terrible nightmare, it seems easy for the novelist to hail the Americans as magnanimous, benevolent, and just. Where Spain represents darkness, the new conquerors symbolize light. This novel is one of the few pro-American texts in the first decade of American rule, a dissenting note in the overwhelming anti-American feeling characterizing most of the novels at the time.

				"value": "This novel exposes the roots of the Filipinos&#x2019; oppression, symbolized by the dreaded Spanish <i>guardia civil </i>(constabulary) and the friar. The first group figures as the narratives&#x2019; villains, whereas the second is held responsible for the people&#x2019;s blind adherence to superstition; both stand as the agents of destruction and violent death. The novel centers on how Modesto Magsikap decides to take the law into his own hands with dire consequences. What initially starts out as a colorful narrative of love and courtship becomes a tale of murder and pursuit. Enraged by Sergeant Cruz&#x2019;s arrogant behavior as the suitor of his sweetheart Elisea Liwayway, Modesto stabs the soldier dead and flees. He eventually finds himself behind bars with Fabian, accused by his wife of having been responsible for the death of their child, who has died with countless others during a stampede inside a church."

During the wake, Modesto stabs Lieutenant Rosca, another ardent suitor of Elisea; he flees, and his two brothers are imprisoned instead. The hunt for Modesto intensifies. He is betrayed by a close friend, but he manages to escape and decides to go to the United States. He writes Elisea to inform her of the many wonderful opportunities that democracy affords the people in the United States. In 1896, five years after the series of events, Modesto returns to his country."

				"value": "The novel&#x2019;s tightly nuanced evocation of community life in a small town in Luzon, with its rituals of birth, love, and death, is contextualized in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. All the major characters, especially the impulsive Modesto and the courageous Elisea, are drawn with attention to fine details of character. The result is a narrative that paints a broad canvas of life in the dying years of Spanish colonial rule. Laksamana&#x2019;s skillful manipulation of the narration lays bare the reasons for the people&#x2019;s continued oppression, with a humor that borders on the satirical and the grotesque."

Towering above all the characters is Amando, the new Christ willing to suffer and die so that his people might live in a just and peaceful society.

Dario Barrientos, a young engineer, discovers gold in the land of Mayor Philippe. He schemes with his brother Max to get the gold by marrying Philippe&rsquo;s daughter Cecilia. They stage a mock kidnapping and Dario pretends to rescue her. Now Dario, Philippe&rsquo;s son-in-law, has a change of heart, but Max is determined to kill the family of Philippe and acquire their fortune.

Serialized in <b><i>Muling</i></b><i> <b>Pagsilang</b></i>.<i> </i>Reprinted as a book, Manila: Limbagang McCullough, 1906; Quezon City: Manlapaz Publishing Co., 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This novel is widely considered a landmark in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a> for being the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> novel to treat romance, familial conflicts, and the socioeconomic issues of the day from the viewpoint of a writer with an emergent socialist consciousness. Set in Manila in 1904, Santos&rsquo;s novel portrays a society in crisis in the tradition of social realism. In the process, it prescribes a way out of the problem by infusing his work with the ideas of his newfound ideology of the working class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos creates Delfin and Felipe, two characters representing a new world outlook of dialectics, scientific thinking, and hope. They interact with an array of characters that embody the varied ideas, values, and norms in a decaying colonial and superstitious society. There is thus the constant tug-of-war between old and new, progress and retrogression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Delfin is a low-salaried journalist of poor origins, who nurtures socialist ideas regarding trade unionism, class struggle, and nationhood. Felipe, on the other hand, is born rich; his budding radicalism borders on anarchy. Delfin, calm and deliberate, is engaged to Meni, whose father is among Manila&rsquo;s richest. Felipe is paired off with shy Tentay, a poor worker&rsquo;s daughter. Their lives intersect, but the focus is definitely on Delfin and Meni. The social gap between the lovers serves as environment for the basic narrative. Delfin and Meni&rsquo;s love affair reaps the ire of the elite. When Meni gets pregnant, her proud and self-indulgent father Don Ramon is driven to shame. He disinherits Meni and flees to America, where he is killed by Tikong, an enraged servant. The family overrules the dead patriarch&rsquo;s decision and gives back Meni&rsquo;s share of the wealth on the condition that she abandon her husband. Meni rebuffs them. As love proclaims another victory at the novel&rsquo;s end, Felipe delivers an impassioned warning about the doom of the bourgeoisie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Curiously, there has been no serious challenge regarding the validity of Santos&rsquo;s socialist cause. The criticisms have been directed at the &ldquo;non-artistic&rdquo; integration of its political ideas. While the novel&rsquo;s conflict is raised from the level of the social custom to that of a political issue, the political dimension is presented in an inorganic fashion; the discursiveness of the novel tends to get in the way of swifter pacing. However, defenders of the novel contend that the &ldquo;essayistic&rdquo; speeches are spoken in character, and enliven and promote the action of the narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1579\"><b><i>&ldquo;<strong>Banaag at Sikat&quot;</strong>: </i></b><strong><i>Metakritisismo at Antolohiya</i></strong></a>&nbsp;(<b><i>Banaag at Sikat</i></b>: Metacriticism and Anthology), 2010, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5742\">Maria Luisa Torres Reyes</a> is a study of the critical reception of the novel from its initial publication to the 1980s. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Vina Paz</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

They interact with an array of characters that embody the varied ideas, values, and norms in a decaying colonial and superstitious society. There is thus the constant tug-of-war between old and new, progress and retrogression."

Felipe, on the other hand, is born rich; his budding radicalism borders on anarchy. Delfin, calm and deliberate, is engaged to Meni, whose father is among Manila&#x2019;s richest. Felipe is paired off with shy Tentay, a poor worker&#x2019;s daughter. Their lives intersect, but the focus is definitely on Delfin and Meni. The social gap between the lovers serves as environment for the basic narrative. Delfin and Meni&#x2019;s love affair reaps the ire of the elite. When Meni gets pregnant, her proud and self-indulgent father Don Ramon is driven to shame. He disinherits Meni and flees to America, where he is killed by Tikong, an enraged servant. The family overrules the dead patriarch&#x2019;s decision and gives back Meni&#x2019;s share of the wealth on the condition that she abandon her husband. Meni rebuffs them. As love proclaims another victory at the novel&#x2019;s end, Felipe delivers an impassioned warning about the doom of the bourgeoisie."

The criticisms have been directed at the &#x201C;non-artistic&#x201D; integration of its political ideas. While the novel&#x2019;s conflict is raised from the level of the social custom to that of a political issue, the political dimension is presented in an inorganic fashion; the discursiveness of the novel tends to get in the way of swifter pacing. However, defenders of the novel contend that the &#x201C;essayistic&#x201D; speeches are spoken in character, and enliven and promote the action of the narrative."

Manila: Libreria Manila Filatelica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is Balmori&rsquo;s first novel, which he wrote when he was 22 years old. Written in Spanish, the novel revolves around a love triangle. Angela Lima, born to an affluent family, falls in love with Augusto Valvidia, a poet known not only for his art but also for his penchant for liquor and women. Angela, however, is having an affair with Ventura Ruiz, an orphaned cousin who has been living with her family. Aware of Angela&rsquo;s interest in the poet, who charms her through letters and poetry, Ventura decides to stay away from her to have the quiet he sorely needs for his studies in law. Angela convinces him to return, but his jealousy intensifies as Angela continues to receive letters from Augusto. A duel follows in which Augusto leaves Ventura with a bleeding nose. Perturbed, Angela visits a priest and confesses her sexual relations with both her suitors. Angela&rsquo;s troubles are compounded when Augusto, afflicted with tuberculosis, dies, leaving her doleful and pregnant. Initially, she thinks of committing suicide, but then she follows her family&rsquo;s advice that she marry her cousin Ventura, who does not know that she is pregnant. On their honeymoon, Angela, whose thoughts are still filled with memories of Augusto, feels no love for her husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel insinuates the presence of the author Balmori in the character Augusto Valvidia, who is depicted in a positive, if not approving, light. The similarities between character and creator can be detected in their common skill in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, their alcoholism, and even in their curly hair and frivolity. Balmori&rsquo;s romanticism comes across through his use of different motifs typical in a love story: the tubercular poet-lover, a passionate love triangle, a duel between rivals, and a forced marriage of convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In depicting the conflict between conventionality and unorthodoxy, Balmori explores the role and position of women in society. They are allowed to participate in very limited social activities, and they are taught to develop a very timid and inhibited personality. In this novel, Angela thinks and acts ahead of her time, ahead of the moral norms of society. Although the society&rsquo;s moral codes pressure her into marriage as a sign of acquiescence in the social system, Angela continues her defiance of norms by refusing to love her husband. Her marriage, perhaps, is an even greater form of rebellion than her sexual liaisons with her poet-lover, for she is operating within a conventional system to protect the product of her illicit affair, her baby. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Reynaldo D.

Having completed their catechism lessons given by Jacinto&rsquo;s mother, the boy goes for further study in the seminary, and the girls to the convent school. When Jacinto comes home for vacation, he learns that Maria&rsquo;s mother wants her betrothed to Emilio Olivares, belonging to one of the rich families in Salog Jaro, and she even asks him to convince her daughter.

He is forced to sell everything and to go to faraway Camarines, promising Maria that when he comes back he will have enough money to start their life together. But he meets Leonor, a rich man&rsquo;s daughter, with whom he gets engaged to be married. Ines writes to him and reminds him of his promise to Maria. At a fiesta, Jacinto overhears two men talking of Leonor&rsquo;s past relationship with a married man that the whole town knows about.

The protagonist, Lea Bustamante, is a human-rights worker and a mother to two children: Ojie and Maya.

Udan&rsquo;s adventure starts when his father, Datu Maghusay, tells him to join a caravan bringing <i>manggad </i>(dowry) to Impasug-ong. The journey will lead him, his tribe Hanapulon, and its neighboring banuwa&mdash;Lantapan, Yandang, Kimambong, Dalwangan, Impasug-ong, and Sumilaw&mdash;into a series of <i>pangayaw </i>(tribal wars) that will take the lives of almost all of his loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the way to Impasug-ong, Udan loses his way.

Here Udan encounters various creatures&mdash;<i>aligasi</i>&nbsp;(giant), <i>bakesan</i>,<i> tagbusaw</i>,<i> </i>and <i>mantianak</i>, among others&mdash;that feed on humans. He suffers great misfortune and faces death eye to eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lidasan, however, is also the place of Udan&rsquo;s transformation.

He knows that the message comes from the same tagbaya that has helped him defeat the aligasis, but aware by then of what befell his forebears when they accepted Tium hu Gaun&rsquo;s help, he refuses to pawn his heart and liver for power that he knows he himself possesses and can muster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Udan refuses to perform the saut. Enraged by such irreverence, the tagbaya<i> </i>summons a great whirlwind to subdue Udan. Udan, however, has already attained his full humanity &ldquo;because everything that resides in his body has united and become one.&rdquo; He fuses with the whirlwind. When the wind settles, the tagbaya is seen kneeling, pleading that Udan kill him as the vanquished deserves.

Serialized in <b><i>Alitaptap</i></b>. An excerpt reprinted as <b><i>Ang Pagbabangon</i></b> (The Awakening) in <b><i>Pipit-Puso</i></b>, 1932. Reprinted as <b><i>Ilaw sa Hilaga</i></b> (Light in the North). Serialized in <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b>,<b> </b>1947-48.<i> </i>Reprinted as a book, Quezon City: Manlapaz Publishing Co., 1980; Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press, 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Set in the 1920s in a town called San Carlos, the novel begins with the town&rsquo;s wealthy capitalists, led by Don Benigno and Don Alejandro, plotting to destroy Heneral Masangkay. Masangkay&rsquo;s bus company, Kalahi Transit Company, is a rival to the Philippine Transit Company, owned by Jewish-American Ishmael Hanzen and managed by his son, Ishmael Hanzen Jr. Don Benigno allies himself with Hanzen, and they use their power to cripple their business rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The principled Masangkay is a hero in two revolutions. His adopted son, Javier Santos, educated at the University of the Philippines, is heir to the money left by his biological father, another revolutionary, and mother, a victim of the Spaniards. Masangkay and Javier are against any form of Western intervention, the infusion of foreign capital into the economy, and monopolies detrimental to the people&rsquo;s interests. Together with Tomas, a teacher, they spearhead the move to preserve the local heritage from Americanization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A romantic subplot is that of Javier and Anita, the daughter of Don Alejandro. Anita&rsquo;s parents send her to Hong Kong, where she gives birth to a baby boy. Heneral Masangkay&rsquo;s daughter Binyang, who is a personification of the ideal Filipino woman, rears the child. Binyang later assumes the leadership of the movement to propagate native ideals and protect the people&rsquo;s interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The conspirators defeat Heneral Masangkay, and only the timely intervention of Javier saves the Kalahi Transit Company. Javier, too, eventually gives up, but first sets fire to his building and the buses. When a badly burned corpse is discovered, the people think it is Javier&rsquo;s. Javier returns to San Carlos disguised as a mysterious and affluent foreign businessman named Rey Vajt Ossan. He parades a fleet of brand new buses, builds a rice mill, and soon lords it over San Carlos as a successful and benevolent businessman. The businesses of Don Benigno and Hanzen flounder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The townspeople&mdash;rich and poor alike&mdash;gradually realize that they must bond together for the common good. As the movement gains more followers, Ossan initiates a series of moves&mdash;charging higher fare, raking in huge profits, and running down other businesses&mdash;that incense the people. Led by a now reformed Don Benigno, they offer to buy him out but are unable to raise the whole amount. Ossan relents, stipulating that half of what they owe him be given to Heneral Masangkay and Binyang, and the other half to Anita and her son, Froilan. In the final scene, Javier, his friends, and family are reunited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel addresses crucial issues then prevailing: monopolies, the oligarchy, and the feudal system. Driven by poverty and desperation, for example, 400 tenants on Don Benigno&rsquo;s farm are forced to migrate to Hawaii to be cheap labor. The novel also criticizes the landlord class&rsquo;s shift from basic food production to an export economy. In one section, a landowner decides to stop planting rice and cultivate sugar instead because Hanzen plans to build a sugar mill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s two novels are clearly the main source of this work. The fictional town of San Carlos is like Rizal&rsquo;s San Diego, a microcosm of Philippine society. Like <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not), 1886, Francisco begins his novel with a banquet to reveal the personalities of the major characters. Javier is a combination of Ibarra and Simoun. His attempts to conduct business aboveboard fail because the people themselves are uncooperative. Like Simoun, he comes back in disguise and uses more forceful means. Not by accident, the resolution happens on Dec 30, the anniversary of Rizal&rsquo;s execution. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

				"value": "Set in the 1920s in a town called San Carlos, the novel begins with the town&#x2019;s wealthy capitalists, led by Don Benigno and Don Alejandro, plotting to destroy Heneral Masangkay. Masangkay&#x2019;s bus company, Kalahi Transit Company, is a rival to the Philippine Transit Company, owned by Jewish-American Ishmael Hanzen and managed by his son, Ishmael Hanzen Jr. Don Benigno allies himself with Hanzen, and they use their power to cripple their business rivals."

				"value": "The principled Masangkay is a hero in two revolutions. His adopted son, Javier Santos, educated at the University of the Philippines, is heir to the money left by his biological father, another revolutionary, and mother, a victim of the Spaniards. Masangkay and Javier are against any form of Western intervention, the infusion of foreign capital into the economy, and monopolies detrimental to the people&#x2019;s interests. Together with Tomas, a teacher, they spearhead the move to preserve the local heritage from Americanization."

Heneral Masangkay&#x2019;s daughter Binyang, who is a personification of the ideal Filipino woman, rears the child. Binyang later assumes the leadership of the movement to propagate native ideals and protect the people&#x2019;s interests."

Javier, too, eventually gives up, but first sets fire to his building and the buses. When a badly burned corpse is discovered, the people think it is Javier&#x2019;s. Javier returns to San Carlos disguised as a mysterious and affluent foreign businessman named Rey Vajt Ossan. He parades a fleet of brand new buses, builds a rice mill, and soon lords it over San Carlos as a successful and benevolent businessman. The businesses of Don Benigno and Hanzen flounder."

As the movement gains more followers, Ossan initiates a series of moves&#x2014;charging higher fare, raking in huge profits, and running down other businesses&#x2014;that incense the people. Led by a now reformed Don Benigno, they offer to buy him out but are unable to raise the whole amount. Ossan relents, stipulating that half of what they owe him be given to Heneral Masangkay and Binyang, and the other half to Anita and her son, Froilan. In the final scene, Javier, his friends, and family are reunited."

Driven by poverty and desperation, for example, 400 tenants on Don Benigno&#x2019;s farm are forced to migrate to Hawaii to be cheap labor. The novel also criticizes the landlord class&#x2019;s shift from basic food production to an export economy. In one section, a landowner decides to stop planting rice and cultivate sugar instead because Hanzen plans to build a sugar mill."

The fictional town of San Carlos is like Rizal&#x2019;s San Diego, a microcosm of Philippine society. Like <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not), 1886, Francisco begins his novel with a banquet to reveal the personalities of the major characters. Javier is a combination of Ibarra and Simoun. His attempts to conduct business aboveboard fail because the people themselves are uncooperative. Like Simoun, he comes back in disguise and uses more forceful means. Not by accident, the resolution happens on Dec 30, the anniversary of Rizal&#x2019;s execution. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em>"

Despite the forbidden nature of their love, Rosy France abandons her comfortable home in Zamboanga City and elopes with Hassan to Jolo, then a city where Christians and Muslims live in harmony.

She endures the difficulties of living in a city now governed by fear, but she can never move past her sense of responsibility to her missing husband. When Hassan returns, he too is but a ghost of the man she used to know. The firebrand and idealist in him have been replaced by a scheming, bitter failure of a man.

Nahla dreams of leaving Jolo to become an actress in Manila. But Captain Rodolfo&rsquo;s duties prevent them from leaving Mindanao, and Nahla finds herself trapped in a life she yearns to escape from and a lover who has suddenly become cold to her.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5667\">Alfrredo Navarro Salanga</a>. With a foreword by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a>, a Filipino translation by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5676\">Romulo A. Sandoval</a>, and illustrations by Ludwig Ilio. Quezon City: New Day Publishers. Philippine Writers&rsquo; Foundation writing grant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salanga&rsquo;s only published book of fiction, deftly translated into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> by Sandoval, is a novella with a near epic scope; it covers the period of the 1896 Revolution until the Americans&rsquo; return to the Philippines in World War II. The prologue describes the portentous birthing of Hannibal Valdez at an American camp on a stormy night. The delivery by a drunk American doctor costs Hannibal his left eye and his mother her life. Only his grandfather, Colonel Valdez, is pleased with this turn of events, seeing Hannibal as the one to inherit his place as a legendary officer of the Philippine Revolution, an aspiration which Hannibal&rsquo;s father, Antonio, failed to live up to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subsequent sections of the novel consist of the colonel&rsquo;s recollection of his personal history, tracing the events of his rise from being a son of a poor man to becoming the town&rsquo;s revolutionary leader and most powerful landowner: his initial foray into the local resistance movement; his leading a victorious charge against a handful of Spanish guards in the <i>poblacion</i> (town); and his eventual appointment as a colonel by a retreating Emilio Aguinaldo, who needed someone to delay the Americans running after him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All this he recounts to the American Major Weepingwillow, commander of the camp, whom he holds in high regard, while also expressing his resentment at the lack of recognition he has suffered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salanga renders the colonel&rsquo;s character as different from that formed in the usual mold of heroes. Shifting skillfully between the colonel&rsquo;s retelling and the events unfolding at the wake, Salanga exposes the colonel as a vacillating nationalist, a domineering, misogynistic patriarch, and a ruthless landlord, who, driven by his ambition and cunning, will do anything to achieve his goal. His moral ambiguity is underscored by the colonel&rsquo;s casual admission to Weepingwillow of his own acts of betrayal of his fellow revolutionaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More significant is how the novella demonstrates how individual acts, regardless of their moral and historical ramifications, are intertwined with larger social forces. Colonel Valdez&rsquo;s dubious deeds are framed within Philippine colonial realities like the feudal system, patriarchy, and uneven racial relations. Colonel Valdez justifies his acts by implying that he has merely prevailed over social structures imposed by Spanish colonialism and the American occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Colonel Valdez&rsquo;s narration concludes with a disturbing confession. In the epilogue, the reader is again made aware of this dark legacy which Colonel Valdez wants Hannibal desperately to inherit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the introduction, Almario emphasizes how the novella avoids &ldquo;mystifying history.&rdquo; Using the bloodstained Colonel Valdez as chronicler, Salanga poses the challenge of how one may resolve historical contradictions. In <b><i><strong>The Birthing of Hannibal Valdez</strong></i></b>, Salanga offers a critique, not just of personalities that make Philippine history, but of the ways in which history itself is written and perceived. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Om Narayan Velasco</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

He is engaged to be married to the beautiful Gloria, with whom Gerardo is also in love. With the assistance of Dimas, a bandit, Gerardo abducts Gloria.

Ester had given Oscar the strand of hair as a pledge of love, but later asked Ruben to retrieve it from Oscar.

Oscar tries to save Ruben from the gallows by falsely confessing to the crime. He hopes in this way to call for a reinvestigation of the case. In the meantime, Gloria&rsquo;s rape by Gerardo is prevented by Juaning, Dimas&rsquo;s wife who is later killed. Dimas repents and confesses the whole truth to Gloria, pointing to Gerardo as the mastermind of the sinister plot. Gloria returns to town in time to prevent the hanging of Oscar, publicly accusing Gerardo of the crime. When Gerardo calls her a liar, Gloria grabs from his coat pocket the handkerchief with a strand of Ester&rsquo;s hair wrapped in it.

Its critique of society is made within the framework of a love story. Edgardo Nufable, a medical student in Manila, receives the disturbing news from his father in his hometown Santol that his townspeople are being exploited by the Cardoces. Although Edgardo wants to help the townsfolk, his friend Arturo advises him to finish his studies first. When Edgardo visits his father in Santol, he discovers how the Cardoces have been manipulating the people. The Cardoces have forced the people to sell their fishing boats and to rely on Cardoce-owned vessels; they have also isolated the area so that the people are forced to buy medicine from them at high prices. Moreover, Bruno Cardoce, the mayor, has allowed the public school to rot. But following his friend&rsquo;s advice, Edgardo returns to Manila to finish his studies. He comes back to Santol a doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contrast to his professional success is his love life. Rodora, the daughter of a ranch overseer, hesitates to accept him, unconvinced that Edgardo could love a woman of her class when there are other more sophisticated women swooning for him. To complicate matters, Bruno is also in love with Rodora. The rivalry between Edgardo and Bruno culminates in a near fistfight. A typhoid epidemic strikes Santol. Rodora&rsquo;s father and Bruno&rsquo;s mother die; Rodora herself is stricken but is saved by Edgardo. Meanwhile, the Philippine Constabulary discovers Bruno&rsquo;s treachery. He is implicated in the disappearance of a suitor of Rodora and an engineer sent by the governor to supervise the public school, which Bruno had neglected. Bruno escapes the authorities and tries to take Rodora with her. The girl refuses him. Bruno is later found dead. Edgardo falls ill, physically enervated by work and emotionally wounded by unrequited love. Rodora learns from Tia Meding how Edgardo stayed by her bedside during her illness. Realizing that he sincerely loves her, she nurses him. Arturo arrives, now also a doctor, and cures Edgardo. The epidemic is stopped; and the lovers are happily united in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel makes good use of foils to highlight character. Bruno&rsquo;s corruption is contrasted with the governor&rsquo;s earnest efforts to improve Santol. The governor, well intentioned and committed to serve, is aptly named Fidel. But Norada does not oversimplify his characters. Among the evil Cardoces is a good daughter, Adelita, who remains unspoiled by her family&rsquo;s greed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This novel marks a shift in Norada&rsquo;s career as a novelist. Read avidly for his detective thrillers and romantic plots, Norada, in this novel, focuses on the ills of the ruling class, on political corruption and economic exploitation, symbolically represented by the epidemic. That the Cardoce matriarch dies from the epidemic is a sign that evil is, in the end, self-destructive. That Edgardo and Arturo, both young doctors, succeed in controlling the plague seems to point to Norada&rsquo;s optimistic belief that the youth can make a difference. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Morales, Noemi T. 1980. &ldquo;The Novels of Conrado Norada.&rdquo; Master&rsquo;s thesis, University of the Philippines.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5193\">Alberto Segismundo Cruz</a>. Manila: Palimbagang Tagumpay. Reprinted, <b><i>Piling Nobela: <strong>Lakandula</strong>, <strong>Halimuyak</strong>, <strong>Ang Bungo</strong> </i></b>(Selected Novels: Lakandula, Scent, The Skull), Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ang Bungo</i></b> became for post-World War II readers a recreation of some facets of a momentous event that they had only just experienced. Like the writer&rsquo;s other novels, <b><i>Ang Bungo</i></b><i> </i>provides historically specific details of time and milieu that help one reconstruct various events in the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel&rsquo;s protagonist is a guerrilla fighter, Ricardo Lakandula, who sows fear in the hearts of the Japanese soldiers. When a Japanese soldier attempts to lob a grenade at a platoon of Filipino soldiers, Ricardo throws himself at the Japanese. His body is badly burned, but he survives, his nose blown away and his cheeks turned into cavernous holes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thus, it is as the terrifying &ldquo;Skull&rdquo; that he attacks enemy camps and ambushes truckloads of Japanese soldiers. He dons an attire that makes him, in the darkness, look like a skeleton on a warpath. Although a sharpshooter, Ricardo&rsquo;s favored weapon is his bow and arrow by which quietly and stealthily he can execute his enemies. He thus appears both as a vicious killer and as a symbol of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ricardo fights incessantly in the company of his fellow guerrilla fighters until the end of the war in 1945. But the damage has been done not only on his face but also on his psyche: he thinks that with his hideous appearance he is less than human.

Celso, scion of a rich family, chooses to be a writer rather than to be a professional, as his father would wish him to be. He learns that for the right amount of money, he could have the most sought-after prostitute in a popular brothel. The description of the woman reminds him of his sweetheart Rita who mysteriously disappeared two years ago. He lies to his mother to get the money, and goes off to get the woman who, it turns out, is Rita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">How Rita has become a prostitute is told in a lengthy narrative flashback about trust and betrayal. Pepe, husband of Berta, relative of the couple who adopted her, rapes her, and gets her pregnant. He later sells her to the owner of the brothel, where she is repeatedly raped by all kinds of men. To add insult to injury, she even ends up indebted to the owner in the amount of 200 pesos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shocked by this revelation, Celso decides to take her away from the brothel. His friends and parents condemn him for loving a notorious prostitute. Celso is utterly devastated by this turn of events. He realizes that Rita is the only person left who cares anything about him. They share a brief period of togetherness. Celso goes on with his job as a writer while Rita, physically and emotionally spent, stays in their love nest. But one day she falls severely ill. A priest comes to minister to her, but to his outrage, Rita condemns society, which has done her much injustice. Instead of penitence, she expresses joy over the love shared between her and Celso. After Rita dies, Celso is confined to an asylum for the insane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The love story is tragic, contextualized within larger social issues, such as gender relations, society&rsquo;s pervasive role in forming values and influencing relationships, as well as the role of a benighted religion and its ministers in the lives of people. Rita is fully fleshed out as a developing character: from a timid and demure girl to an adult woman forced into a life of sordidness to a human being with the moral courage and fierce will to defend herself and her love. Celso, her lover, is the sole exception in Rita&rsquo;s unjust surroundings. Like her, he possesses moral courage to fight for what he loves and cherishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novelist succeeds not only in portraying the gross injustice that people, particularly men, can bring upon their fellow human beings, but also in indicting social institutions such as the church. In the novel, Aguilar turns sarcastic in his descriptions of the religiosity and piety manifested by Celso&rsquo;s mother, and in his caricature of the sanctimoniousness of the priest listening to Rita&rsquo;s tirades against society&rsquo;s hypocrisy and self-righteousness. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\"> </a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reyes, Soledad. 1982. <em>Nobelang Tagalog, 1905-1975: Tradisyon at Modernismo</em>.

Originally published as a short story in <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b>,<b> </b>11 Dec 1965, and included in <b><i>Tropical Gothic</i></b>, 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This novella is a coming-of-age story with the classic techniques the author Nick Joaquin is known for. The stream of consciousness allows the reader to inhabit the sometimes chaotic thoughts of the characters. There are gothic elements, such as the main character&rsquo;s ability to literally see through the people around him. Most important of all, the story presents several themes at the same time, allowing a reader to see the layers of meaning in what simply starts as a story of a stowaway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bobby, the main character, becomes Candido, who seems to have the gift of true sight. Suddenly, Bobby, or Candido, has X-ray vision, literally seeing everybody&rsquo;s nakedness. This condition sends him careening through the streets of Manila as he tries to find people whom he can still see as they usually are. Bobby realizes that he cannot handle the naked truth no matter how much he tries to act true to himself. Next, he sees people only as skeletons. Unlike the panic induced by his previous visions, this one triggers in him a profound sadness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The author Joaquin deftly weaves into this story the consequences of being confronted with the truth about the people around us. It is in human nature to deceive, but humans also have a propensity to seek the truth. &ldquo;Overacting,&rdquo; as Bobby calls people&rsquo;s acts of self-deception or cover-ups, is necessary in keeping human society intact. Humans are merely machines&mdash;skeletons, useful and reliable&mdash;but ultimately, soulless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the best scenes in the story takes place when Bobby returns home and his Tita Menchu goes to his room to check up on him. In Bobby&rsquo;s new vision, he sees only her skeleton, and, as she tarries, Bobby comes to realize that this is not the world that he wants. Everyone is &ldquo;overacting&rdquo; to cover up their secrets. Suddenly, he longs only for sincerity and authenticity, none of middle-class hypocrisy and self-righteousness. In a feverish state, he sees something else beyond the skeleton&mdash;something that might even be God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For Bobby, though, the bedrock of his sanity lies in his grandmother and her house. This is another one of Joaquin&rsquo;s underlying themes: the past is our anchor; it keeps our lives from floating aimlessly in the concrete jungles of rapid urbanization and technological advancements. In the end, Bobby returns to his old self, refusing the continued presence of Candido. But the reader detects that a profound change has been effected in Bobby. His adolescent anger and rebelliousness vanish; he has transformed into an adult. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The stream of consciousness allows the reader to inhabit the sometimes chaotic thoughts of the characters. There are gothic elements, such as the main character&#x2019;s ability to literally see through the people around him. Most important of all, the story presents several themes at the same time, allowing a reader to see the layers of meaning in what simply starts as a story of a stowaway."

				"value": "Bobby, the main character, becomes Candido, who seems to have the gift of true sight. Suddenly, Bobby, or Candido, has X-ray vision, literally seeing everybody&#x2019;s nakedness. This condition sends him careening through the streets of Manila as he tries to find people whom he can still see as they usually are. Bobby realizes that he cannot handle the naked truth no matter how much he tries to act true to himself. Next, he sees people only as skeletons. Unlike the panic induced by his previous visions, this one triggers in him a profound sadness."

It is in human nature to deceive, but humans also have a propensity to seek the truth. &#x201C;Overacting,&#x201D; as Bobby calls people&#x2019;s acts of self-deception or cover-ups, is necessary in keeping human society intact. Humans are merely machines&#x2014;skeletons, useful and reliable&#x2014;but ultimately, soulless."

In Bobby&#x2019;s new vision, he sees only her skeleton, and, as she tarries, Bobby comes to realize that this is not the world that he wants. Everyone is &#x201C;overacting&#x201D; to cover up their secrets. Suddenly, he longs only for sincerity and authenticity, none of middle-class hypocrisy and self-righteousness. In a feverish state, he sees something else beyond the skeleton&#x2014;something that might even be God."

This is another one of Joaquin&#x2019;s underlying themes: the past is our anchor; it keeps our lives from floating aimlessly in the concrete jungles of rapid urbanization and technological advancements. In the end, Bobby returns to his old self, refusing the continued presence of Candido. But the reader detects that a profound change has been effected in Bobby. His adolescent anger and rebelliousness vanish; he has transformed into an adult. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em>"

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5617\">Clesencio Rambaud</a>. Serialized in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5087\"><strong>Bannawag</strong></a></i></b>, 4 Sep&ndash;5 Dec 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel follows Piling and her family, who live in the small barrio of Puritac in San Isidro, Ilocos Norte. When the novel opens, a military detachment is established in the nearby barrio of Nagtrigoan, ostensibly to counter the worsening insurgency in the province and the region. Clashes between the military and the New People&rsquo;s Army (NPA) intensify, but Piling&rsquo;s family stays on, upon the insistence of her husband Fredo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the detachment is undermanned because of a birthday party and is attacked, Fredo is framed by soldiers. They suspect that it was he, a sympathizer, who had tipped off the rebels, and killed Fredo. The detachment commander Sergeant Magarro, who investigates the matter, convinces the people that it was the NPA who murdered Fredo. Meanwhile, Piling is raped and their son barely escapes death in the hands of the military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new police chief Moises Coloma stages an ambush that sends the inutile town mayor fleeing to Manila and the provincial command setting up another detachment in San Isidro. This sets the stage for a final and decisive clash between the two camps. The NPA, led by Napintas, offers to avenge Fredo&rsquo;s death. Piling accepts the offer. When the soldiers uncover the planned rebel offensive, the residents are evacuated, including an excited Piling and her family. The anticipated clash happens, however, when the residents have just returned to their homes. In her yard, Piling is recounting the plight of her family to Napintas when she and her eldest daughter Bising (Visayas) are shot and killed. The bloodstain on her back, where she was shot, resembles &ldquo;a map of seven thousand islands.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rebels flee with the rest of Piling&rsquo;s children&mdash;Bitti, Lucing (Luzon), and Minda (Mindanao)&mdash;who are taken to the church in accordance with their mother&rsquo;s wishes. Bitti tells Father Amador that it was the soldiers who killed his father. He stays in the church during the investigation, while Lucing and Minda are adopted by Moises Coloma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel might be read as an enactment of and commentary on the post-EDSA role of the military in state affairs. It writes the history of how the military worked its way back to power under and beyond the administration of Corazon Aquino, following its brief subordination to civilian authority when she assumed the presidency in 1986. But the turn of events in the novel&mdash;in particular, the emergence of a new benevolent military figure and the growing civilian alliance with the Church&mdash;points to the author&rsquo;s own vision of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Militarization frames the allegorical construction of the nation in <b><i><strong>Dagiti Bin-i ti Kimat</strong></i></b>. Piling&rsquo;s family is caught between the armed combatants, represented by the troops of Sergeant Magarro and of Napintas. Midway through the novel, a third alternative is presented, with Moises Coloma as the embodiment of supposedly a benevolent military-state complex. In the narrative&rsquo;s unfolding, this option is chosen by the succeeding generation, represented by Piling&rsquo;s children who are adopted by Coloma. Father Amador&rsquo;s adoption of Bitti, Piling&rsquo;s eldest, may be seen as the alliance between the Church and the state, supplanting Piling&rsquo;s alliance with the rebels. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Roderick Galam</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

When the novel opens, a military detachment is established in the nearby barrio of Nagtrigoan, ostensibly to counter the worsening insurgency in the province and the region. Clashes between the military and the New People&#x2019;s Army (NPA) intensify, but Piling&#x2019;s family stays on, upon the insistence of her husband Fredo."

When the soldiers uncover the planned rebel offensive, the residents are evacuated, including an excited Piling and her family. The anticipated clash happens, however, when the residents have just returned to their homes. In her yard, Piling is recounting the plight of her family to Napintas when she and her eldest daughter Bising (Visayas) are shot and killed.

Midway through the novel, a third alternative is presented, with Moises Coloma as the embodiment of supposedly a benevolent military-state complex. In the narrative&#x2019;s unfolding, this option is chosen by the succeeding generation, represented by Piling&#x2019;s children who are adopted by Coloma. Father Amador&#x2019;s adoption of Bitti, Piling&#x2019;s eldest, may be seen as the alliance between the Church and the state, supplanting Piling&#x2019;s alliance with the rebels. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Roderick Galam</strong> </em>"

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>. Manila: Jingle Publications. Reprinted, including chapters omitted from the first edition, Manila: Carmelo and Bauermann, 1988. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a>, grand prize for the novel, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This novel revolves around Amanda and her relationship with her husband and their five sons. The relative calm of this middle-class family is gradually shattered as her sons grow up to immerse themselves in experiences that go beyond family life. Amanda is not a passive, suffering mother as traditionally portrayed in Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novels</a>. She engages the menfolk in lively, passionate discussions of relevant social issues. In the process, she finds herself slowly leaving behind a world where social and political issues are perceived as alien concerns, and where knowledge is limited to the practical and the commonsensical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A son&rsquo;s early marriage and eventual departure for the United States reveal his uncritical acceptance of the myth of the great American dream. But where Isagani abandons his country, two other sons choose to stay and become politically involved. Jules becomes a dissident. He is captured, allowed to go free, rejoins his comrades, and eventually dies at the hands of the military. Em continues the struggle by joining a human rights group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The education of Amanda is almost complete. The novel ends in 1982, the year martial law is &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; farcically by the dictator. Amanda realizes that many structures of repression are still in place. After weathering a number of crises which would have destroyed a person of weaker resolve, Amanda finds herself more committed than ever to liberating herself as a woman and as a human being, in the most tumultuous decade of her life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Readers saw in Bautista&rsquo;s novel one of the earliest articulations of feminism in contemporary Philippine literature. Older novelists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5060\">Liwayway Arceo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5222\">Rosario de Guzman-Lingat</a> had used female characters to question the unequal relations between men and women, but it was not until Bautista&rsquo;s <b><i>Dekada &rsquo;70</i></b>&mdash;and her subsequent works&mdash;that a sustained inquiry into woman&rsquo;s condition was made and contextualized within the social and ideological issues of the times. The novel is considered principally a woman&rsquo;s text not only because it is about a woman as perceived by a woman, but principally because it analyzes the complex structures in which a woman is formed as a subject in the patriarchal system. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reyes, Soledad. 1978. &ldquo;The Individual and Society in the Novels of Dominador Mirasol.&rdquo; <em>Diliman Review</em> 26 (Oct-Dec): 49-53.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The relative calm of this middle-class family is gradually shattered as her sons grow up to immerse themselves in experiences that go beyond family life. Amanda is not a passive, suffering mother as traditionally portrayed in Filipino <a href=\"/9/73/1557\">novels</a>. She engages the menfolk in lively, passionate discussions of relevant social issues. In the process, she finds herself slowly leaving behind a world where social and political issues are perceived as alien concerns, and where knowledge is limited to the practical and the commonsensical."

Older novelists like <a href=\"/9/9/5060\">Liwayway Arceo</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5222\">Rosario de Guzman-Lingat</a> had used female characters to question the unequal relations between men and women, but it was not until Bautista&#x2019;s <b><i>Dekada &#x2019;70</i></b>&#x2014;and her subsequent works&#x2014;that a sustained inquiry into woman&#x2019;s condition was made and contextualized within the social and ideological issues of the times. The novel is considered principally a woman&#x2019;s text not only because it is about a woman as perceived by a woman, but principally because it analyzes the complex structures in which a woman is formed as a subject in the patriarchal system. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em>"

It centers on the demise of three men and the events that led to it. The novel begins in the city of Manila, in the residence of the papal nuncio, an old man who tends his bonsai collection and enjoys the company of cats. He refuses to comment on the slaughter of two priests and a close friend of theirs in a remote region of the Visayas. These three men are Padre Deuteronomio Diaz, a conservative, self-righteous, senior clergyman; Dr Macaraeg, a doctor who wants answers concerning his son&rsquo;s death; and La Crava, a younger, more unconventional man of the cloth, who once took pride in being a student activist and was acquainted with the doctor&rsquo;s son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Joe, the doctor&rsquo;s son, supposedly committed suicide. The circumstances are mysterious, and there are rumors that he was a member of Land of the Morning, a patriotic cult with an obsession for papaya. Joe&rsquo;s death affects Diaz as much as it does Dr Macaraeg, because the old priest had expected Joe to enter the seminary, following an agreement between him and the doctor. Diaz advises Dr Macaraeg to have Joe&rsquo;s body buried in the public <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery </a>because the interment of suicides at the Catholic cemetery is forbidden. As the body is being transported, however, it goes missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The three men investigate the mystery only to end up being drugged and taken to a den run by a mad ex-priest named Faustino, who makes a reverse sign of the cross. On the altar of this mock chapel is an offering, a corpse. The section ends with Diaz slipping into unconsciousness as the sound of chanting voices fade away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel returns to the nuncio in Manila. After he entertains guests at a charity function, he is presented by a nun&rsquo;s old uncle with a bonsai plant with a trunk shaped like a woman&rsquo;s thighs.

Can the people of the Philippines find balance between these sentiments? The three priests in the novel may represent the extremes and the middle ground: Diaz, the conservative right; Faustino, the extremely secular left; and La Crava in between, a socially active yet spiritually grounded clergyman.

Rosa&rsquo;s streak of ill luck with men continues when she becomes the kept woman of a rich Chinese businessman, Paulino Tan-Yun, friend and supporter of the leaders of two colonial regimes, the Spanish and the American. Sion is the product of this liaison. The final man in Rosa&rsquo;s life is Papa Dune, an ordinary farmer turned leader of a movement and religious cult called Ang Bagong Jerusalem.

Many of the characters from the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>reappear, such as Do&ntilde;a Victorina, the caricature of colonial mentality; and Basilio, the son of the deranged Sisa. However, Rizal introduces a host of new characters: Ben Zayb, a Spanish journalist; Quiroga, a Chinese merchant; Placido Penitente, a disillusioned student; and Se&ntilde;or Pasta, a typical bureaucrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 13 years abroad, Crisostomo Ibarra returns to the Philippines disguised as Simoun, a rich jeweller, to avenge himself on those who caused his downfall in the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>and to save Maria Clara from the nunnery. Using his wealth and his influence on the governor-general whose appointment he bought, he foments greed and corruption in official and upper circles, hoping to provoke a revolution. He buys arms from Quiroga and plots with Kabesang Tales to seize Manila. He destroys all hopes of reform in the status quo by framing the students fighting for a secular school. When his plans for a general overthrow of the government are about to be realized, he solicits the cooperation of Basilio to rescue Maria Clara. On the eve of the uprising, Basilio informs him that she has just died. Simoun is so shocked he fails to give the signal for the start of hostilities; he abandons his conspirators and leaves the uprising to utter failure, causing the death and arrest of many of his men. He falls ill for some time. Recovering from his illness, he plots anew. He again meets Basilio, whose release from jail he has paid for. This time the disgruntled Basilio is willing to join him. At the wedding of the couple Paulita Gomez and Juanito Pelaez, in which all the rulers and important people in Manila&mdash;including the villainous Padre Salvi&mdash;are invited, Simoun presents an elaborate lamp as his wedding gift, actually a bomb designed to explode the moment its wick is raised to revive the flame. The explosion is meant to herald another uprising. As the celebration starts, Basilio is watching the house from a distance. He is joined by Isagani, who is brokenhearted because his girlfriend Paulita is to be married to Juanito. Basilio tells Isagani to stay away from the house, informs him of the secret bomb, and moves away. Wishing to save Paulita, Isagani rushes up the house just in time to grab the fatal lamp and throw it into the river, with himself disappearing into the night. Thus is Simoun&rsquo;s plot foiled a second time. Now hunted by the authorities, a wounded Simoun escapes once more with a load of his treasures. He takes refuge in the mountain retreat of a virtuous priest, Padre Florentino. Knowing that the <i>guardias civiles</i> (constables) have discovered his whereabouts, Simoun drinks poison. But before he dies, he engages Padre Florentino in a dramatic conversation on the fate of the Philippines. The priest absolves him and gives him a final admonition on the wickedness of greed and of violence as a means for social change. The novel ends with the priest throwing Simoun&rsquo;s chest of treasures into the sea where it will do no harm, saying that these may be retrieved only when the time has come that it may be used for achieving good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The many other episodes in the novel reconstruct the social milieu. The story of Kabesang Tales and his family shows how the cruelty of some Spanish authorities leads people to violence. Through hard work, Kabesang Tales developed rice lands which the friars grabbed. He becomes a bandit named Matanglawin. Juli, his daughter, borrows money to free his father from prison, but eventually falls prey to the lustful Padre Camorra. Unable to face her fianc&eacute; Basilio, Juli commits suicide. In Manila, the young students, led by Basilio, Makaraig, Sandoval, and Pecson, rebel against the state of education in the country, which seeks to blind rather than enlighten. They agitate for a school that will teach Spanish, but are set up and thrown in prison for &ldquo;subversion.&rdquo; Padre Millon, a physicist at the Colegio de Santo Tomas, teaches without conducting experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The publication of this novel, like the publication of the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>in 1887, caused a commotion. Many copies of the books, shipped in boxes to Hong Kong, were confiscated. Rizal was ultimately exiled to Dapitan for the <b><i>Fili</i></b> and his other writings which were interpreted as separatist. Rizal&rsquo;s friends, however, reacted positively toward it. Ferdinand Blumentritt and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5463\">Graciano Lopez Jaena</a> thought it was better than the <b><i>Noli</i></b>.<i> </i>The Filipino community in Spain praised it in <b><i>La</i></b><i> <b>Publicidad</b></i>,<i> </i>a Spanish periodical, comparing it to the works of Alexandre Dumas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of all, it opened the eyes of natives all over the Philippines to the corruption of the Spanish bureaucracy and the inevitability of change, which Rizal hoped would not be violent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lasting legacy of the novel is seen today in the many adaptations made from it.

The lives of the residents of Filipinas Street&mdash;mostly laborers and a few middle-class families&mdash;are upended when a businessman, Mr Lopez, asserts ownership of the land on which their houses have stood for decades. With his private army, Mr Lopez threatens the residents with demolition. The community fights back, joined by a phalanx of student activists who form the front line.

The passage to a Promised Land turns out to be fraught with agony and pain, terror and tribulation. Moises and his family find themselves fighting for their very lives against the forces of evil.

Exploited and dirt poor, Moises leaves the camp site with his family, and they settle in the forest, which he has earlier cleared. They live a peaceful life for many years. Their only problem is a huge snake which Moises has repeatedly tried to kill, unsuccessfully. With his sons Tante and Francisco, Moises finally destroys the reptile, but only after it has crushed his body, weakening him greatly. Other enemies appear on the land&mdash;the hired goons of an influential mayor, the lawyer who betrays Moises&rsquo;s trust, and a group of avaricious Americans hunting for gold. Moises learns there is gold hidden in his land since the war, buried there by a Filipino soldier, and the secret has become known to the treasure seekers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">War breaks out between the forces of the mayor and the Americans, on one side, and the group of Moises on the other side. The fight is intense, and the forest is littered with casualties. A heavy rain pours for days, triggering landslides which bury the hidden gold beyond the reach of greed. Peace descends upon the land. Moises and Mando, dissident leaders whose forces have come to help, meet again, and the old peasant finds out that his son Francisco is now a member of Mando&rsquo;s armed group. The young man had left the land to seek education as a solution to poverty, only to be disillusioned with the system; he has joined the revolutionary forces fired up by new hope. Moises&rsquo;s mission of leading his people into a Promised Land now enters a higher stage, in which his son is going to play an important part. Moses had initially refused Mando&rsquo;s offer of joining up with the collective effort of organized people to fight for their right to the land they till.

Sanang, Edong&rsquo;s sweetheart, asks him to bring back some orchids that abound in the mountains. When the men return, Edong is not with them. Sanang is told that Edong has fallen into a ravine while trying to save some birds precariously perched on a mountainside. Sanang is disconsolate but her sadness turns into joy when Edong suddenly returns with a mystifying story. He narrates to Sanang how he was saved by a goddess, Mariang Makiling, and how he was nursed back to life by the inhabitants of the town at the foot of the mountain. According to this account, the inhabitants of this town are extraordinary creatures because they do not suffer from such emotions as greed, envy, hatred, or ambition. Instead they lead peaceful lives as farmers working on the land. But they are not allowed to bear any children. We learn that these are the country&rsquo;s heroes&mdash;Lakandula, Sulayman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Edong takes the child Doro back to Makiling with him. He has a happy stay with the immortals, and when he goes home, Maria gives him a sackful of ginger. Upon arrival at his house, he finds a sackful of gold nuggets instead. Greed possesses the boy&rsquo;s father. Together with other evil men, he hikes off to the mountains, planning to steal more of the gold. At night they hear terrifying sounds, warning them to leave the mountain. The goddess punishes them with the loss of their sanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narrative goes on to detail the life of Sanang and the many events in her life, which include a raid on the barrio perpetrated by her suitor. The battle ends with Sanang&rsquo;s folk lying dead. An account of what Sanang does for the rest of her life follows. The boy gets an education at Ateneo de Manila. The story ends with the narrator talking to Ka Doro, who is now an old man. He says that this is the time for the heroes to come and rescue the country from ruin. The gold of Makiling refers to the country&rsquo;s young men and women who are willing to work for humanity; this is possible, avers the old man, through education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The significance of the novel lies in its masterful handling of modern story techniques and the successful evocation of a past world. A visionary quality marks the dreamlike sequences set in Makiling, up to the final exhortation that Tata Doro gives as the story ends. A foil to the likes of Sulayman and Rizal is Sanang who is the novel&rsquo;s real heroine, because it is she who lives her life most fully in the service of others. It is characters like her, the novel seems to be arguing, who can rebuild the nation from the ruins that it has become. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Soledad Reyes</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The novel flashes back to three years ago: In the company of Kapitang Tomas&rsquo;s tenants, Pepe witnessed the rapacity and greed of the rich and powerful. As the tenants were delivering their sacks of rice, Bosyong, Kapitang Tomas&rsquo;s overseer, berated the farmers for cheating the owner of his share. When Pepe remonstrated with Bosyong, Bosyong made up a story to make Pepe look bad before Kapitan Tomas. The landlord shot and almost killed Pepe.

Quezon City: New Day Publishers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a World War II novel told from a Filipina&rsquo;s point of view. The title, according to the preface, draws on an incident in Jan 1944, when a vendor approached the author at a funeral cortege to sell honey, and, later in the 1950s, when she chanced upon a haiku by Matsuo Basho.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel is composed of loosely connected episodes about people displaced and dispossessed by the war, and all in search of home. In the first chapter, &ldquo;The Honeycomb,&rdquo; Fe Moreno waits out the war in Santa Barbara Dormitory in Manila. Carlos Arias, a childhood friend from Cebu, visits her to seek her assistance of food and medicine for the guerrilla movement. She decides to join the resistance herself and sets off on an odyssey back to her hometown in Cebu. Along the way she meets people broken by war, who are homesick and anxious about the people they love. Each has a tale that is spun in the succeeding chapters, with Fe bearing witness to it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Starling&rdquo; is about Ric Amado, a comrade in arms, who marries Fe&rsquo;s friend, Marian Abella. They decide to settle in the Visayas but their short-lived marriage ends in one violent sweep of the surging sea. &ldquo;Sapphire&rdquo; introduces another character, Guadalupe Smith, who, like Fe, procures food and medicine for the guerrillas in the north. In &ldquo;Macopa,&rdquo; when Fe has reached Cebu City, a love affair between the married Hilda Sancho and Bernie Vivo, who is a Bataan Death March escapee, turns sour when Hilda&rsquo;s husband sues them for adultery. The neighbors relish the entertainment that this domestic drama gives them amid the horrors of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Abelardo,&rdquo; Fe&rsquo;s cousin, Mrs Angelina Cortes, suffers the close scrutiny of their community. Coming from an affluent family she defiantly puts on a show of extravagance when she holds her American-style wedding reception in a Japanese-themed restaurant. This incurs the ire of the guerrillas and costs her her son. In &ldquo;Augusto Tan: Spy,&rdquo; a Chinese mestizo is hired by the Japanese for his oriental looks and for his knowledge of Nihongo. He, too, pines for Cebu, his home, and arranges for his return. Upon seeing the outline of Cebu, he lets slip a word in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> to the Japanese pilot. In &ldquo;Claudia in the Orchard,&rdquo; Fe is back in Manila, finding friendship in Claudia, a daughter of a Chinese woman and an Englishman, who has yet to communicate since the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Refusing to marry a Filipino hacendero, Claudia flees to Hong Kong the moment her father makes contact and sends for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Walls,&rdquo; Fe is again in Cebu, being held in a concentration camp after an embittered lover has testified against her. She is soon released, and she escapes to another province. The penultimate chapter, &ldquo;The Moths of Talavera,&rdquo; is about a settlement town stirred by an illicit love affair between Jessica Gabriel, whose husband is Fe&rsquo;s comrade, and Raul Gil, cousin of the parish priest. The two are turned away by this community of war refugees. In the final chapter, &ldquo;Deliverance,&rdquo; Fe is once again in the capital for the much-awaited liberation, but the nation&rsquo;s first sign of deliverance comes in the form of a US air raid. Those who survive it walk on, amid all the deaths, still seeking shelter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel&rsquo;s title is a biblical allusion, thus underscoring the characters&rsquo; faith in salvation and in finding the path home from the wilderness wrought by the war. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Julian dela Cerna</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Reyes reveals in the first chapter that he, or his first-person narrator, was intending to return to his hometown, Hagonoy, to retrieve the drafts of his novel / documentary film titled &ldquo;Ang Huling Dalagang Bukid,&rdquo; when his townspeople warned him of military personnel sifting through the debris of his house, which had recently burned down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Now haunted by the terror of state aggression and the specter of his unfinished work staying unfinished, he embarks instead on writing what he calls his &ldquo;erroneous authobiography&rdquo;&mdash;a meandering &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; of his growth as a writer known for his willful stance against the bearers of power. Erroneous because its subject and manner of telling stray from social and literary conventions, the &ldquo;authobiography&rdquo; is part personal essay and part sociological study. It covers Reyes&rsquo;s free-spirited boyhood in Hagonoy up to his present stature as a celebrated author now confronting the peril of state terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Weaving gossip and folklore, he recounts the boisterous stories of his relatively privileged childhood, the vibrant customs and traditions of his people, and the complex narrative of power relations in the small town. With an astute sociological eye, he paints the picture of Hagonoy and its people against the backdrop of feudalism, military terror, and the changing faces of elite democracy. The town is the focal point of Reyes&rsquo;s &ldquo;authobiography,&rdquo; to which his ruminations repeatedly return even when he narrates his more recent clashes with authority figures in the city, in the academe, and in the literary world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reyes&rsquo;s skillful use of stream of consciousness seamlessly sews together his &ldquo;authobiography&rdquo; with his spectral novel, which he has envisioned to be structured like a documentary film. The unfinished work is a tragicomic narrative of the impoverished town of Wakas (literally, &ldquo;End&rdquo;). To help their families escape from the clutches of poverty, the young women leave the town and work as migrant laborers, primarily as entertainers in Japan. Soon, the farmlands and fishponds of Wakas are abandoned, and the entire town is lured into the frenzy of the migrant labor phenomenon. Highly reminiscent of his hometown Hagonoy, Wakas, rendered in Reyes&rsquo;s satirical storytelling, is a microcosm of the nation. Within this fictional town, the issues of modern-day heroism, state abandonment, capitalist greed and exploitation intersect with the ordinary lives of the village people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More than its postmodern embellishments and subversion of traditional modes of storytelling, Reyes&rsquo;s work significantly engages with the crucial question of the writer&rsquo;s place and role in society. This he answers by painting a full-blooded portrait of a writer thoroughly acquainted with the political and historical reality of his society, along with its dangers and threats. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Laurence Marvin Castillo</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Manila: Palimbagang Manuel Zamora.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Said to be based on the novelist&rsquo;s actual experiences when he ran unsuccessfully for governorship of Rizal, the novel resonates with great power as a social realist text. It begins with widespread rumors of an impending rebellion to be mounted by the Colorum dissidents in the mountains of Baritan. Mateo de la Cruz, considered their leader, denies that they want to sow discord and shed blood. They have banded together&mdash;the oppressed farmers&mdash;because they have a noble cause. Their enemy is the prevailing system. They discern crooked politicians, such as Braulio de los Santos, Don Procopio, de los Santos&rsquo;s sponsor, and a mysterious character as the wielders of power. These people have done nothing to help the poor farmers. Ranged against these characters are the concerned and committed ones: Mateo de la Cruz, a former <i>ilustrado</i> (educated native) who turns his back on his class to be of help to the poor; Ricardo Pilares, a brave editor and a passionate enemy of the system; Jose Romero, a student who joins the <i>timawa</i> (freeman);<i> </i>Lieutenant Ventura, the head of the constabulary forces that try to understand the farmers&rsquo; plight; and Macario Romero, the candidate supported by the timawa because he has promised to help the poor. Collectively, and with great difficulty, they are able to destroy the political machinery of the rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel was written a few years after the bloody Colorum rebellion in Pangasinan and one year after the violent revolt of the Sakdalista. This was the period of much agrarian unrest in the face of which the government could do nothing but respond with violence. The world as depicted in the novel is full of opportunistic, greedy, and duplicitous politicians and government leaders. Of the major issues delineated in the novel, the novelist focused on rampant government corruption, found at all levels. Even the love between Jose Romero and Adela, the daughter of de los Santos, falls prey to politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ang</i></b><i> <b>Huling</b> <b><strong>Timawa</strong></b> </i>was a foil to the numerous novels of the 1930s, which delighted in describing agonizing love stories and endless sufferings inflicted on mothers and wives. Vigorous and dynamic, the novel exemplifies the strength of the tradition of protest. It suggests that the timawa<i> </i>as a destitute individual is an anomaly in a country that subscribes to democracy, and that it is only through the concerted effort of all the sectors in society that the slave may forever be banished from the land. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Ranged against these characters are the concerned and committed ones: Mateo de la Cruz, a former <i>ilustrado</i> (educated native) who turns his back on his class to be of help to the poor; Ricardo Pilares, a brave editor and a passionate enemy of the system; Jose Romero, a student who joins the <i>timawa</i> (freeman);<i> </i>Lieutenant Ventura, the head of the constabulary forces that try to understand the farmers&#x2019; plight; and Macario Romero, the candidate supported by the timawa because he has promised to help the poor. Collectively, and with great difficulty, they are able to destroy the political machinery of the rich."

This was the period of much agrarian unrest in the face of which the government could do nothing but respond with violence. The world as depicted in the novel is full of opportunistic, greedy, and duplicitous politicians and government leaders. Of the major issues delineated in the novel, the novelist focused on rampant government corruption, found at all levels. Even the love between Jose Romero and Adela, the daughter of de los Santos, falls prey to politics."

Sayo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This novel is one of the earliest novels to deal with the relationship between labor and capital. Set in 1914, it begins with the workers of a tobacco factory restlessly waiting for the result of a meeting. The labor leaders are deciding on what action to take in the face of the management&rsquo;s decision to lower the wages. The consensus is for the workers to stage a strike, although Mauro counsels patience and moderation. An unnamed company manager talks to Pablo and offers him and his friends the strikers&rsquo; jobs. Pablo, in turn, approaches Gervasio, one of the leaders of the striking workers, and echoes the management: the workers have families, and it is their responsibility to make sure that their loved ones have enough to eat. Pablo is thus able to entice some of the striking workers to return to their jobs. Pablo and Gervasio try to convince Mauro to give up the fight, but Mauro and his wife Serafina are adamant.

				"value": "This novel is one of the earliest novels to deal with the relationship between labor and capital. Set in 1914, it begins with the workers of a tobacco factory restlessly waiting for the result of a meeting. The labor leaders are deciding on what action to take in the face of the management&#x2019;s decision to lower the wages. The consensus is for the workers to stage a strike, although Mauro counsels patience and moderation. An unnamed company manager talks to Pablo and offers him and his friends the strikers&#x2019; jobs. Pablo, in turn, approaches Gervasio, one of the leaders of the striking workers, and echoes the management: the workers have families, and it is their responsibility to make sure that their loved ones have enough to eat. Pablo is thus able to entice some of the striking workers to return to their jobs. Pablo and Gervasio try to convince Mauro to give up the fight, but Mauro and his wife Serafina are adamant. The conflict becomes bloody when a riot breaks out between Mauro&#x2019;s group and Gervasio&#x2019;s scabs. Mauro is wounded in the arm. He stabs Gervasio. When the police arrive, Pablo and Gervasio lie on the street covered in blood. Mauro is arrested, tried, and eventually sentenced to serve a prison term of nine months and a day.

Jose barrels his way into Manila&rsquo;s criminal underworld and becomes known as &ldquo;Duyan.&rdquo; Thinking that Selya betrayed him for money, Jose throws his ill-gotten money at Selya.

The narrator and protagonist Cesar Selonia wishes to settle down after retiring early from his post as a government employee in Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental.

Cesar searches for Karyo in Misamis and discovers that Karyo has lied about details of his life. Witnesses inform him about Karyo&rsquo;s suspicious behavior. Cesar also learns that Karyo&rsquo;s parents in Pagadian were killed recently in an accident. He writes Connie that he has found her true aggressor.

Illustrator, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>. First published in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>11<i> </i>Jan 1929.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Kenkoy</strong></i></b><i> </i>formally introduced the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><b>komiks</b></a> in the Philippines. When Ramos, its writer, died in 1932, Velasquez, its illustrator, became the strip&rsquo;s writer as well, until it ended in 1961, having run for three decades in various publications. <b><i>Mga Kabalbalan ni Kenkoy</i></b> (The Antics of Kenkoy), as the cartoon was originally called, first came out as a four-frame weekly cartoon strip occupying one-fourth of a page. Its initial appearance was met with enthusiastic response from the public. After the third week, it was given one-half page in the magazine, with six frames. A year later, it was occupying a full page in full color, and was appearing in the <b><i>Liwayway</i></b><i> </i>chain of magazines published in five major languages: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kenkoy, whose full name is Francisco Harabas, is portrayed as a fun-loving, sartorially elegant, brilliantined dandy who talks in an amusing mishmash of Tagalog and English. This comic character illustrates the seepage of colonial ideas, tastes, terminologies, idioms, fashions, and values into the native sensibility. Kenkoy remains a romantic, devoted lover to his lady friend and future wife, Rosing, who is a marked contrast to the modernized Kenkoy with her traditional costumes, fidelity to her native tongue, and Maria Clara-like demeanor. While mainly about the adventures and misadventures of Kenkoy and the happy moments he shares with Rosing, the comic strip unravels a menagerie of characters and episodes reflective of the times and the manners. The cast includes Mang Teroy and Aling Matsay, his parents; Tirso, his archrival for Rosing&rsquo;s affections; Ponyang Halobaybay, the fashionable lady whose own comic strip also doubled as Velasquez&rsquo;s vehicle for showing off his modish fashion designs, which actually set off a trend during those days; Nanong Pandak, diminutive millionaire constantly scheming to impress women he admires, particularly Ponyang; Talimusak, neighborhood numskull who is Nano&rsquo;s sidekick; Tinyente Dikyam, an African-looking officer who&rsquo;s a friend to everyone; and other characters with names like Dr Wakwak, Talakitok, and Tsikiting Gubat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The comic strip evolved in drawing style and content through the years. The inaugural strip shows a roughly drawn Kenkoy wearing checkered, flared pants, and an American sailor&rsquo;s cap, strumming a Hawaiian ukelele as he croons an American song, then getting chased by a dog who keeps him up an electric post until the moon comes out. The drawings become more articulated: Kenkoy starts sporting a gleaming Valentino hairstyle and an American two-piece suit complete with tie, suspenders, and fedora hat; he begins spouting English words and expressions spelled in Tagalog; and the dog remains his nemesis on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The hybrid language used by Kenkoy was one of the comic strip&rsquo;s main attractions. These &ldquo;Kenkoyisms&rdquo; caught on fast: <i>halo</i>,<i> get redi</i>,<i> watsamara</i>,<i> beri nesesari</i>,<i> baygali</i>,<i> wetaminit</i>,<i> gud morning</i>,<i> okey</i>,<i> okedowk</i>,<i> istak</i>, <i>tekewok</i>,<i> isputing</i>,<i> nating duwing</i>,<i> </i>and many others.

This comic character illustrates the seepage of colonial ideas, tastes, terminologies, idioms, fashions, and values into the native sensibility. Kenkoy remains a romantic, devoted lover to his lady friend and future wife, Rosing, who is a marked contrast to the modernized Kenkoy with her traditional costumes, fidelity to her native tongue, and Maria Clara-like demeanor. While mainly about the adventures and misadventures of Kenkoy and the happy moments he shares with Rosing, the comic strip unravels a menagerie of characters and episodes reflective of the times and the manners. The cast includes Mang Teroy and Aling Matsay, his parents; Tirso, his archrival for Rosing&#x2019;s affections; Ponyang Halobaybay, the fashionable lady whose own comic strip also doubled as Velasquez&#x2019;s vehicle for showing off his modish fashion designs, which actually set off a trend during those days; Nanong Pandak, diminutive millionaire constantly scheming to impress women he admires, particularly Ponyang; Talimusak, neighborhood numskull who is Nano&#x2019;s sidekick; Tinyente Dikyam, an African-looking officer who&#x2019;s a friend to everyone; and other characters with names like Dr Wakwak, Talakitok, and Tsikiting Gubat."

As his plane nears, he is suddenly assaulted by flashbacks of his activist past. These flashbacks form the core of the novel. While the activist Bulaong seems idealistic, even eagerly overenthusiastic about fighting the regime, he is frustrated by the very people he calls his comrades. For him, they take in questionable characters, are moving too slowly, or do not exert enough effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bulaong&rsquo;s family is torn apart by his decision to quit school and join the activists.

In his activist days, she attracted him but he kept his distance because she was his friend and comrade Benny&rsquo;s woman. When he makes love to her this time, he finds the encounter unsatisfying. He realizes that he was only equating the movement to her. The romantic illusions that he forged about the movement, its members, and himself are gone. He must either move on with his life or fight a cause that he no longer believes in or that, as his comrade Jong puts it, he never understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel ends just before Bulaong&rsquo;s plane lands. Noel remembers that he has come to bury his father, his own flesh. The flashbacks have comprised a litany of his sins, imagined or otherwise. Coming back to the warm place of &ldquo;storms and coconuts&rdquo; in which people often have to find ways to kill time, he will need to confess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This multi-awarded novel has often been described by its author as a semi-biographical piece.

The narrative follows the adventures of Victor from his gilded youth to old age, and explores the numerous relationships he has with different characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The story begins when Victor impulsively decides to elope with Atanacia while they are enjoying themselves at the carnival. Seething with anger, Atanacia&rsquo;s family refuses to accept the couple into their home. This thorny relationship with his in-laws merely reinforces Victor&rsquo;s conviction that he will never find his happiness in the woman he has married. Victor meets Eking, a man who has two wives, and Victor becomes convinced that Eking is a model worth emulating in his own search for happiness. This signals Victor&rsquo;s odyssey from one woman to another until Atanada finally decides to leave him, unable to endure her husband&rsquo;s infidelity any longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">World War II breaks out, and Victor&rsquo;s only son Luisito dies on the battlefield. A daughter, Carmela, has eloped with a married man and returns to their home, a changed woman; she eventually dies. In his old age, Victor still struggles to find that elusive happiness. He meets Gina, a cabaret dancer, and lives with her for some time until Gina leaves him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traumatized by the series of tragedies that has struck his family, Victor has a nervous breakdown and, on one occasion, he tries to commit suicide. Atanacia comes back to Victor as the novel ends. Gradually, Victor learns to accept the coming of old age and the irretrievable loss of his youth. As the rains fall, Victor is resigned to what life has yet to offer him, with the wife at his side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the surface, this is a tale of an adulterous man who is punished for his indiscretions. What endows the novel with dramatic force is the writer&rsquo;s delineation of Victor&rsquo;s inner life and the many steps he takes to make real this obsessive quest for happiness. The writer&rsquo;s creative imagination renders in fully realized detail the complexity of Victor&rsquo;s character, one perpetually compelled to seize the day. He will fail, as he realizes much later, but only after he has seen the futility of this quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written in the 1970s, this is a groundbreaking text, offering a psychological study of a type of character which in earlier texts was used to symbolize wickedness and cruelty. Rather than follow a convenient stereotype, Lingat carefully draws a portrait of a man whose unceasing struggle becomes a myth for the contemporary man caught in a world where the dominant cult is that of the youth. The novelist subverts this central idea and shows the reader the same man peacefully accepting the passing away of summer. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Soledad Reyes</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Reyes, Soledad. 1978. 1982. <em>Nobelang Tagalog, 1905-1975: Tradisyon at Modernismo</em>.

However, he expresses doubt over the manuscript&rsquo;s authenticity, a self-reflexive comment on the unreliability of texts in general and of history and literature in particular. The author&rsquo;s historiographic intention is clear: the novel pays homage to Enrique in the same manner that Pigafetta&rsquo;s writings paid tribute to Magellan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">We hear Enrique&rsquo;s voice for the first time in the &ldquo;Prologue&rdquo; as he narrates the mythical foundation of his race, from its creation in the fabled mountain of Meru to the glorious days of Sri Harimau of Sri Vijaya. The novel is then divided into four main sections that follow the trajectory of Enrique&rsquo;s voyage: &ldquo;O Mundo Novo&rdquo; (The New World), &ldquo;No Outro Mundo&rdquo; (In Another World), &ldquo;O Mar Pacifico&rdquo; (The Pacific Ocean), and &ldquo;O Mundo Velho&rdquo; (The Old World).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;O Mundo Novo,&rdquo; the story begins in Seville, Spain. Enrique attends to Magellan as he prepares to embark on a voyage to find a Western route to the Spice Islands. At a stopover in the Canary Islands, they receive information about treachery in the armada. The mutiny begins but fails. Enrique observes the strange ways of his master and the &ldquo;white men,&rdquo; such as their faulty concept of time and distance and their inability to invent a method for measuring longitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;No Outro Mundo,&rdquo; the expedition reaches Brazil after many months at sea. During their search for the mythical passage of Mar do Sul (South Sea), they withstand another mutiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;O Mar Pacifico,&rdquo; they enter what they call the &ldquo;Pacific Sea&rdquo; after eight months of searching for the passage. Crossing the Pacific, Enrique dreams about Magellan&rsquo;s life before the expedition. Before they reach Guam and Homonhon Island, Enrique returns to the story of his race, narrating his birth and eventual enslavement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;O Mundo Velho&rdquo; describes the expedition&rsquo;s brief stay in Homonhon. They proceed to Masawa and Sugbu where they are warmly welcomed. The rajahs and datus pay tribute to the captain-general and Laksamana of Espa&ntilde;a. Lapulapu, the datu of Mat-an, refuses to welcome them, prompting the armada to launch an attack on Mat-an. They are easily defeated by the natives. After Magellan&rsquo;s death, Enrique turns against the armada and his treason incites a massacre at a banquet. Eventually, the remaining members of the armada leave Sugbu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the &ldquo;Epilogue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Afterword,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Endnote,&rdquo; Enrique plans to return to Malacca but decides to build a hut on a deserted island. In pursuit of historical accuracy, the author searches for the original owner of the source manuscript, one Trist&atilde;o Lopes-Pelea. He receives a letter reporting the death of Lopes and he soon notices the resemblance between the sender&rsquo;s signature and the handwriting in the manuscript. The author poses a theory that Enrique is originally from Sugbu, which if correct, would make Enrique the first circumnavigator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For much of history, Magellan&rsquo;s expedition is about finding new frontiers to conquer. In this novel, Enrique&rsquo;s odyssey becomes a search for one&rsquo;s place in the world. The voice that has been marginalized in history takes the role of protagonist in fiction. Inventive and at the same time rigorously attentive to archival details, Cortes sees colonialist history as a malleable fiction that can be reshaped to offer the alternative story of an exile. In the Age of Discovery, here is a character who is not looking for something new, but who seeks the glory of his past. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jeffrey Javier</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Inventive and at the same time rigorously attentive to archival details, Cortes sees colonialist history as a malleable fiction that can be reshaped to offer the alternative story of an exile. In the Age of Discovery, here is a character who is not looking for something new, but who seeks the glory of his past. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Jeffrey Javier</strong> </em>"

It opens with the main character, writer and university instructor Laya Dimasupil, reflecting on a recurring dream. In it she lives alone in a house and need not socialize&mdash;a dream life that differs from her waking life. Longing for solitude, which she can only experience in the house in her dreams, Laya, who is sometimes the narrator, brings the reader to every house she has lived in and all the people she has encountered and lived with: her now deceased father, Deo Dimasupil, himself a writer and university professor; her mother, Gloria Dimasupil, a housewife who used to work as an accountant; her siblings; the househelp; and her relatives. In all these houses, there is one room in particular that always intrigues her: her father&rsquo;s. It was where he used to isolate himself from his family. This is the same world that Laya dreams of living in, a secluded place that she can call her own, a world of words and of writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Deo&rsquo;s narrative is at the center of the novel. The silence that he demands while he writes is sometimes disrupted by the younger Laya&rsquo;s inquisitiveness, to which Deo harshly, sometimes violently, reacts. Because of his chain smoking, Deo succumbs to a terminal illness, and after his death, Laya digs into her father&rsquo;s elusive writings. She comes across her father&rsquo;s journals, and Laya learns about her father&rsquo;s world, where fishing and farming provide respite from the struggles between conforming to the policies of the academic community and remaining faithful to one&rsquo;s literary craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel&rsquo;s narrators vary every now and then. There is Gloria&rsquo;s point of view, which reveals how she gave up her job as an accountant to take care of her family while trying to build a contemplative space of her own. Laya finds herself confronting the same issues that plagued her father and mother as she juggles her time between working in the academic and artistic community, and performing her duties as a wife to her husband Antonio, and mother to her son Hugo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel offers wit and humor with its candid digressions, and its enjoyable, spontaneous, and freely flowing prose, as the reader is provided with rich descriptions of each character. The most interesting passages involve the three main characters&rsquo; reveries, which allow the reader to dissect the plotlines, names, and locations that compose the autobiographical elements of the narrative. The nonlinear structure and the use of shifting points of view do not allow for direct encounters among the three main characters; it is rather in their isolated and introspective writings that they find themselves engaged in meaningful conversations. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jemma Pamintuan</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Set in the historic Valladolid district of the municipality of Carcar, Cebu, Madrid&rsquo;s second novel returns to the themes found in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1728\"><strong>Devil Wings</strong></a></i></b>, 1996, such as the hypocrisy of the clergy and their uneasy relationship with the affluent members of their flock. The events in <b><i>Mass</i></b>, however, are set in the American colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the center of the novel is the household of Capitan Delfin, the administrative head of Valladolid, a passionate patron of the performing arts and a habitual betel nut chewer. The mysterious murder of Braulio Pantorilla, a lawyer who tricked a younger Delfin into purchasing property that was already owned by a businessman, sends the novel into full swing. Fearful of being found the most likely culprit, Arcadio flees to Manila where he stays with Nyora Candil, an old acquaintance of his father and the grandmother of an up-and-coming musician named Cordillera. One night, Nyora Candil finds the two young men in an embrace while asleep. This prompts her to write Delfin a letter against Arcadio. Once he deems it safe to return home and after hearing that his father is ill, Arcadio returns to Carcar, much to Nyora Candil&rsquo;s liking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cordillera also travels to Carcar after earning his performer&rsquo;s diploma.

One night, Nyora Candil finds the two young men in an embrace while asleep. This prompts her to write Delfin a letter against Arcadio.

Gamalinda goes further by involving a historical figure in the fictional love triangle, and setting the romance against the backdrop of the Philippines&rsquo; bloody transition from Spanish to American colonization. The historical &ldquo;Pope of Negros,&rdquo; Dionisio Magbuela, led a Catholic-infused, millenarian revolutionary movement on Negros Island as Papa Isio (Pope Isio), fighting against first Spanish, then American rule; and he continues to be regarded as a folk hero in the Visayas. Gamalinda fictionalizes his life and motives for pursuing revolution, explaining in an afterword that he &ldquo;found the obscurity of the pope&rsquo;s life an interesting parallel to the obscurity of the Filipino-American war.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gamalinda&rsquo;s Papa Isio begins as a young folk healer and mystic who comes to the attention of a hacienda matriarch, who introduces him to her ward Asuncion, bastard daughter of a Spaniard and a member of the matriarch&rsquo;s household. Also interested in Asuncion is Tomas Agustin, mestizo member of the local <i>guardia civil</i> (constabulary) and later a soldier in the Spanish army. Tomas impregnates Asuncion, thereby compelling her to marry him, although she remains in love with Isio, who receives stigmata and realizes his divine revolutionary mission. Asuncion and Isio remain obsessed with each other, even as Tomas&rsquo;s military career escalates his and Isio&rsquo;s mutual antagonism. Later, Tomas and Asuncion&rsquo;s son Felipe attempts to reconcile, in his own way, the contradictory beliefs of his father and his mother&rsquo;s lover. The love triangle narrative lends itself to an archetypal interpretation in which a hybrid woman/motherland is torn between a hybrid future and a return to the native, but also inadvertently suggests that Isio&rsquo;s revolutionary mission might have been derailed by requited love, marriage, and hacendero status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Isio eventually meets and befriends another historical figure, his eventual nemesis, the American general James Francis Smith, briefly military governor of Negros Island. This fictional friendship serves as the dramatic engine for the second half of the novel, predictably complicating Isio&rsquo;s revolt against American colonization and his eventual capture and sentencing. The novel is markedly sympathetic toward America, as evidenced by its moral, well-intentioned, and rational American characters, and its inclusion of a passage in which Isio is inspired and influenced by the utopian principles expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence, a copy of which he happens to come across. The spiritual, mystical, and emotional Isio can only aspire to such unattainable ideals, echoing his own unrealistic pursuit of Asuncion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gamalinda&rsquo;s prose is in top form here&mdash;lush, rhapsodic, and transporting, while remaining precise, felicitous, and concrete. The narrative allows Gamalinda to revel in the erotic and sensual, the occult, and the exotic, all of which he has also treated in his other works of fiction. In its final pages, the novel sidesteps the burden of passing judgment on history, choosing instead to affirm the mystery of existence, the power of storytelling, and the importance of memory. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5346\">Vicente Garcia Groyon</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5346\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

In his novel, he proposes to expose the sick, as the ancients did, &ldquo;on the steps of the temple so that everyone who came to the Divinity might offer them a remedy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The plot of the novel revolves around the hopes and the frustrations of a well-intentioned young mestizo, Crisostomo Ibarra. He has just returned from his studies in Europe, the classic example of the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated native) influenced by the Enlightenment ideas of liberalism and reform. After some investigation, he finds out that during his seven-year absence, his prominent father, Don Rafael, quarreled with the powerful Padre Damaso and eventually suffered the ignominy of imprisonment and death at the instigation of the latter. Ibarra controls his bitterness and decides to continue his plan to build, at his own expense, a schoolhouse for his townmates, believing that only education can uplift the <i>indio </i>(Christianized native) from their abject condition. But the friars, especially Padre Salvi, who lusts after Ibarra&rsquo;s sweetheart, Maria Clara, throw obstacles in his way. At the groundbreaking ceremonies, Ibarra is nearly killed in an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; designed by Padre Salvi and his indio accomplices. During the dinner following the ceremonies, the boorish Damaso heaps insults at the memory of Ibarra&rsquo;s father. Provoked, Ibarra nearly kills Damaso. For that incident, Ibarra is excommunicated and called a <i>filibustero </i>(subversive).<i> </i>His engagement to Maria Clara is called off. A few days later, a mock uprising, contrived by Salvi, erupts but is swiftly crushed. Ibarra is imprisoned as the leader of the plot. He escapes with the help of the enigmatic Elias, whose life he saved during the picnic on the lake. With his good reputation, his hopes, and his sweetheart Maria Clara all lost, Ibarra confronts an uncertain future. The novel ends with the death of Elias, who offers his life so that Ibarra may escape and work for reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An unpublished chapter involves Elias and his sweetheart Salome. Coming from the picnic in which he was nearly killed by a crocodile, Elias meets Salome in her place by a river. The chapter depicts the pitiful conflict between Elias&rsquo;s love for Salome and his duty to avenge his family&rsquo;s honor. Salome wants to return to her parents in Mindoro, but Elias decides to stay in San Diego.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<i> <b>Noli</b></i>&rsquo;s plot is not simple and unilinear. In fact, its epic quality derives from the many colorful characters and lives interwoven with those of Ibarra and Maria Clara: Capitan Tiago, Maria Clara&rsquo;s &ldquo;father,&rdquo; who will curry favor with anyone who can advance his business interest; Padre Damaso, Maria Clara&rsquo;s real father, who loves his daughter as much as he despises anyone who has progressive ideas; Pilosopong Tasio, whose progressive ideas are ridiculed as crazy or subversive; Sisa, who loses her sanity because her son Crispin disappears and Basilio goes into hiding; Elias, whose ancestors were victims of Spanish abuse and who decides to offer his life to effect social change; Do&ntilde;a Victorina and Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, who typify colonial mentality among the rich and the poor respectively; Fray Salvi, whose life is dominated by lust; and a host of other carefully drawn individuals, Spanish, mestizo or indio, upper or lower class, who embody the concerns, foibles, virtues, and humors of colonial Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Drawing influences from European writers like Alexandre Dumas, <i>p&egrave;re</i>, Victor Hugo, Eugene Sue, and Benito Perez Galdos, the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>is the first Philippine realist novel, presenting a vast and vivid panorama of Philippine life in the grip of Spanish ecclesiastical and secular authorities. For creating well-rounded individuals as characters and its as yet unrivalled use of irony, caricature, sarcasm, and black humor, the <b><i>Noli</i></b> has been accorded the foremost status in Philippine letters. Rizal&rsquo;s brand of realism is immediately evident in the <b><i>Noli</i></b>&rsquo;s opening scene, which paints the house of Capitan Tiago in painstaking but telling detail.

He has just returned from his studies in Europe, the classic example of the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated native) influenced by the Enlightenment ideas of liberalism and reform. After some investigation, he finds out that during his seven-year absence, his prominent father, Don Rafael, quarreled with the powerful Padre Damaso and eventually suffered the ignominy of imprisonment and death at the instigation of the latter. Ibarra controls his bitterness and decides to continue his plan to build, at his own expense, a schoolhouse for his townmates, believing that only education can uplift the <i>indio </i>(Christianized native) from their abject condition. But the friars, especially Padre Salvi, who lusts after Ibarra&#x2019;s sweetheart, Maria Clara, throw obstacles in his way. At the groundbreaking ceremonies, Ibarra is nearly killed in an &#x201C;accident&#x201D; designed by Padre Salvi and his indio accomplices. During the dinner following the ceremonies, the boorish Damaso heaps insults at the memory of Ibarra&#x2019;s father. Provoked, Ibarra nearly kills Damaso. For that incident, Ibarra is excommunicated and called a <i>filibustero </i>(subversive).<i> </i>His engagement to Maria Clara is called off. A few days later, a mock uprising, contrived by Salvi, erupts but is swiftly crushed. Ibarra is imprisoned as the leader of the plot. He escapes with the help of the enigmatic Elias, whose life he saved during the picnic on the lake. With his good reputation, his hopes, and his sweetheart Maria Clara all lost, Ibarra confronts an uncertain future. The novel ends with the death of Elias, who offers his life so that Ibarra may escape and work for reforms."

This theme is interwoven with the author&rsquo;s insight into Ilonggo society and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a quarrel with his father, Salvador Garcia runs away from the family mansion in Negros Occidental and fends for himself in Manila. Andres Lunares, a fruit vendor, adopts him. Through Salvador&rsquo;s intelligence and resourcefulness, Andres&rsquo;s business thrives. Salvador further adds to his foster family&rsquo;s income as a professional boxer. He puts himself through college and eventually becomes a newspaper editor. He has a turbulent love affair with Anita, who, despite her attraction to Salvador, belittles him for his apparently humble origins. Salvador then marries Cecilia, Andres&rsquo;s daughter. A reconciliation with his father takes him back to the family plantation in Negros. Labor unrest, brought about by worldwide recession, causes the accidental shooting of Cecilia. This, followed by the death of another woman who has offered him solace in his widowed state, drives him insane. He and Anita are reunited in Mariveles, where she lovingly nurses him from a most pitiful state to full recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Padya</i></b><i> <b>sang</b> <b>Kapalaran</b> </i>is an example of a novel that straddles both the romantic and realistic traditions. The melodramatic plot unfolds against the backdrop of realistic Ilonggo society. Salvador learns to be his own man when poverty teaches him the tricks of survival. Later, as the hacendero,<i> </i>he is momentarily defeated by class conflict.

A reconciliation with his father takes him back to the family plantation in Negros. Labor unrest, brought about by worldwide recession, causes the accidental shooting of Cecilia. This, followed by the death of another woman who has offered him solace in his widowed state, drives him insane.

The explicit and graphic description of sex was unprecedented and proved to be &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; for that period, while its political theme of totalitarianism focused attention on the social and political conflicts existing in the Philippines since the Huk rebellion of the 1940s. On top of these, the use of a Christ-figure to symbolize the main protagonist projected religion in a radical interpretation. The novel was written by a tandem of modernist authors; Abadilla was noted for his iconoclastic poetry celebrating individualism and the &ldquo;sovereignty of the poet,&rdquo; and Kapulong, for his short stories and powerful prose.

The local resistance is headed by Dario Lazaro, sporting the nom de guerre Kasamang Rizal. A professor at the University of the Philippines, he believes in a personal code of individual responsibility, sexual freedom, and a social philosophy reminiscent of the &ldquo;contractarian theory&rdquo; of civil society for its belief in &ldquo;self-interest&rdquo; as the prime mover of human action and collective behavior. Believing in national self-reliance, he cautions his fellow citizens against dependence on external&mdash;that is, American&mdash;aid in this struggle for liberation.

Sired by a priest, desired, used, and abandoned by a succession of men, she becomes &ldquo;Komrad&rdquo; Pong&rsquo;s spy and his unwilling mistress. She falls in love with Dario, attracted not only to his mind but also to his good looks. He is a sharp contrast to the sinister, because Sinic and leftist, Pong, to whom are attributed the most unpleasant qualities, including his sickly yellow color. Denang abandons Pong and aborts her mission, goes over to the side of the revolutionaries, and escapes with Dario to the mountains. Miss Reyes, a secretary in Pong&rsquo;s office, and a member of the resistance with the code name Kasamang Liwayway, has been nursing a secret love for Dario. In one fateful meeting with Dario, she bares her feelings, and they begin to carry on an affair. Dario&rsquo;s failure to fully reciprocate the pent-up passion of Miss Reyes leads her to betray him to the authorities. Playing the Judas archetype, Kasamang Liwayway is overcome with remorse, goes mad, and gets run over by a vehicle after being felled by bullets. The regime arrests many rebels in a dragnet. Dario is executed, and Denang becomes so distraught that she falls into a fevered swoon, during which she has a vision of Dario as Christ appearing to her and promising to return someday, when he has been freed from his Man-God duality. Another character is American Peter Johnston who, despite his being a professor and not a military man, has been dispatched by the US government to liaise with the guerrillas in the Philippines and in the Far East.

Quezon City: Writers Studio Philippines Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As its title suggests, the novel at first reads as if it were about five women, four of whom were ruined by love. Irene has a photographic memory but is unremembered by the man who promised her love when she was very young. Sandra, in love with her own brother, causes him lifelong suffering. Erica, coming from a community where love is unheard of, leaves home for a taste of love, only to realize that she is incapable of loving anyone. Ester, a widow raising a sexually active gay son, finally admits to herself that it is her female house helper and friend whom she has really loved all her life.

The novel opens with the arrival of the ships of the galleon trade, ending the long wait by the citizens of Manila. The readers are introduced to the royal fiscal, high priest of intrigue in the colonial bureaucracy, and to the unnamed governor-general and his young loyal aide Santistevan. Nearing the end of his term as governor-general and yearning to make his mark in history, he secretly commissions the building abroad of ships for a navy. He acquires the needed loan-capital from the Chinese merchants and gets additional funds by setting up Don Paco, an <i>indio</i> (Christianized native) merchant, for a loan from the Obras Pias. He feels himself deeply compromised by what he sees as necessary decisions. Meanwhile, a locust plague wipes out the rice harvest, leaving famine in its wake. The air thickens with rebellion and repression. The royal emissary Don Epifanio, a silk merchant, arrives to persuade Manilans to give up the Chinese silk trade for Spanish silk. Together with the royal fiscal, he foments a revolt, planning to heap the blame on the Chinese to cause their deportation. The revolt lasts only for some hours. The leaders are executed before dawn. Among them is Agbayani, son of a Spanish father and an indio mother. For him, rebellion is the sole logic of existence. His friend Santistevan asks the governor for his pardon, but it is denied. In his frustration, Santistevan joins the privateer Segovia on a voyage to pacify the Moros. Making a stopover in Negros, they are trapped by a Moro siege that lasts for days.

It begins in Cabugao, a town in Ilocos Sur, toward the end of the Spanish regime, when the clan name was Salvador. Eustaquio Salvador is an acolyte who receives Spanish- and Latin-book learning. But when the Salvador family suffers humiliations in the hands of the new young friar, Eustaquio&rsquo;s father kills the friar, and the entire clan is forced to flee. Pursued by the <i>guardia civil </i>(constabulary), they journey through mountain trail, Ilocos seashore, and the Agno River plains. The exodus encounters death, hunger, disease, pillaged villages, and the<i> </i>guardia civil;<i> </i>but they succeed in reaching the promised land in the new town of Rosales. Settling down in Cabugawan, Rosales, Eustaquio marries Dalin. But the Philippine-American War breaks out a year later. The Cripple, a personification of the hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>, sends Eustaquio back to Ilocos to take an urgent message to President Aguinaldo. Eustaquio passes by barrios destroyed by the American troops. He himself is tortured and left for dead. He fails to reach Aguinaldo, but he joins the heroic stand of the revolutionaries at Tirad Pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contrast to the peasant Eustaquio&rsquo;s turbulent and committed life is the lethargic and aimless life of an unnamed landlord&rsquo;s son. He recalls his childhood in Rosales with his tenant playmates and his love, Teresita. He is largely occupied with thoughts of his father, the right-hand man of Don Asperri, who is the chief landlord. His father is symbolized by the balete tree in their ancestral mansion. The tree is tall and overpowering, but beneath its shade grows nothing. The father is domineering, selfish, and unjust to the tenants and household help. It is through the secondary characters, his victims, that the father is defined. In the end, the father dies violently in a peasant uprising. The moral counterpoint is Baldo, who as land surveyor, gathers evidence of Don Asperri&rsquo;s land-grabbing. But Baldo fails the peasant&rsquo;s hopes, and in the end commits suicide. The son&rsquo;s insights come at the end of a long life, and his realizations are those of one who has been ignorant and uncomprehending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A generation later, at the time of the Huk rebellion in the 1950s, Luis Samson grows up as a peasant boy with his half-brother Victor. They are raised by their mother and grandfather, both poor tenants. When Luis turns eight, his father Don Vicente Asperri, the biggest landlord in Rosales, claims him as his own son and raises him as sole heir. Social circumstances now completely separate the half-brothers. Luis fashions a liberal outlook in his college education. He is forced by the religious authorities to quit his studies on an issue of insubordination. However, he quickly gets a job as the editor of an avant-garde magazine, which is published by a big industrialist, Dantes. At this point, he seems to be in want of nothing, not of creature comforts nor of romantic interest. Trining, his cousin, and Ester Dantes are devoted to him. Victor, meanwhile, has become a Huk fighter. When he comes one night to recruit Luis, the latter hedges. Victor leaves, walking into the &ldquo;primeval darkness, thicker than the night.&rdquo; But Luis cannot go undecided for long. The long simmering feudal conflict breaks out in Rosales, and his barriomates and grandfather are massacred by the military. His mother loses her sanity, and Don Vicente becomes a dying recluse in a mansion that is in a state of permanent siege. A host of military men are placed on guard against the inevitable attack by the Huk rebels led by Victor. Luis obeys when Don Vicente asks him to marry Trining to produce an heir, but he feels compelled to denounce the massacre which has shattered his complacency. He pours all his anger in a magazine expos&eacute;. But because of threats by the military, Dantes asks him to resign. Trining gives birth to a deformed baby. Don Vicente dies, and Luis himself dies when the Huks attack the big red stone mansion, signaling the end of the Asperri line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third-generation Samson is Antonio. His father has died in prison after joining the rebels in burning the municipal building. Antonio, his sister Betty, and his cousin Emy leave Cabugawan for Manila. Tony obtains a scholarship to Harvard and, in America, has an affair with Carmen Villa, a rich man&rsquo;s daughter. He is unaware that he had gotten Emy pregnant before he left for America. Emy returns to Cabugawan and there gives birth to a son. When Tony returns to Manila, he is betrothed to Carmen, having gotten her pregnant. He rises from his lower middle-class background to become a professor in the state university, but later, he is persuaded by his father-in-law, Don Manuel Villa, to join the corporation&rsquo;s public-relations circuit. Toward his erstwhile friends Godo and Charlie, Tony comes to adopt a cynical attitude, criticizing their &ldquo;idealism.&rdquo; Yet Tony is uneasy with himself. The unease reaches a turning point. He visits Cabugao in a search for his psychic roots, and comes upon Eustaquio Salvador&rsquo;s manuscript. The contrast to his life of abandoned ideals shakes him. When he returns to Manila, he learns through Emy&rsquo;s sister that Emy has borne him a son. He goes to Cabugawan to meet the child. He recalls how Carmen insisted on an abortion and realizes that Carmen has long been unfaithful to him. He leaves her and returns to his sister&rsquo;s house by the railroad tracks. His suicide leaves Carmen and his father-in-law contrite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose (Pepe) Samson, Tony&rsquo;s illegitimate son by his cousin Emy, is brought up in Cabugawan by his mother and unmarried aunt, who lovingly and painstakingly sustain him with their earnings as seamstresses. Although not ungrateful, Pepe is embittered by their poverty and his illegitimacy, a resentment that he carries with him when he comes to Manila to study. His lackadaisical attitude takes him from experience to experience. When he is caught up in the student activism of the late 1960s, he is skeptical. But he soon develops friendships with Juan Puneta, a rich man who provides the activists financial support, and Father Jess, who shelters him and his fellow activist Toto. Pepe learns his lessons in the organization, and he becomes an organizer. He falls in love with Betsy, an upper-class activist. His friend Toto is gunned down in a Mendiola demonstration; Pepe is himself arrested and tortured by the military. He discovers Puneta&rsquo;s villainy and finally decides to go back to Rosales to become a true revolutionary. <em><strong>Written by Victoria S. Calizo, with notes from Lourdes H.

His mother loses her sanity, and Don Vicente becomes a dying recluse in a mansion that is in a state of permanent siege. A host of military men are placed on guard against the inevitable attack by the Huk rebels led by Victor. Luis obeys when Don Vicente asks him to marry Trining to produce an heir, but he feels compelled to denounce the massacre which has shattered his complacency. He pours all his anger in a magazine expos&#xE9;. But because of threats by the military, Dantes asks him to resign. Trining gives birth to a deformed baby. Don Vicente dies, and Luis himself dies when the Huks attack the big red stone mansion, signaling the end of the Asperri line."

Antonio, his sister Betty, and his cousin Emy leave Cabugawan for Manila. Tony obtains a scholarship to Harvard and, in America, has an affair with Carmen Villa, a rich man&#x2019;s daughter. He is unaware that he had gotten Emy pregnant before he left for America. Emy returns to Cabugawan and there gives birth to a son. When Tony returns to Manila, he is betrothed to Carmen, having gotten her pregnant. He rises from his lower middle-class background to become a professor in the state university, but later, he is persuaded by his father-in-law, Don Manuel Villa, to join the corporation&#x2019;s public-relations circuit. Toward his erstwhile friends Godo and Charlie, Tony comes to adopt a cynical attitude, criticizing their &#x201C;idealism.&#x201D; Yet Tony is uneasy with himself. The unease reaches a turning point. He visits Cabugao in a search for his psychic roots, and comes upon Eustaquio Salvador&#x2019;s manuscript. The contrast to his life of abandoned ideals shakes him. When he returns to Manila, he learns through Emy&#x2019;s sister that Emy has borne him a son. He goes to Cabugawan to meet the child. He recalls how Carmen insisted on an abortion and realizes that Carmen has long been unfaithful to him. He leaves her and returns to his sister&#x2019;s house by the railroad tracks. His suicide leaves Carmen and his father-in-law contrite."

Although not ungrateful, Pepe is embittered by their poverty and his illegitimacy, a resentment that he carries with him when he comes to Manila to study. His lackadaisical attitude takes him from experience to experience. When he is caught up in the student activism of the late 1960s, he is skeptical. But he soon develops friendships with Juan Puneta, a rich man who provides the activists financial support, and Father Jess, who shelters him and his fellow activist Toto. Pepe learns his lessons in the organization, and he becomes an organizer. He falls in love with Betsy, an upper-class activist. His friend Toto is gunned down in a Mendiola demonstration; Pepe is himself arrested and tortured by the military. He discovers Puneta&#x2019;s villainy and finally decides to go back to Rosales to become a true revolutionary. <em><strong>Written by Victoria S. Calizo, with notes from Lourdes H.

The paintings confirm this version of history, which also resembles Marcos&#x2019;s appropriation of nationalist historiography in his <b><i><strong>Tadhana</strong></i> </b>textbooks."

Kitty Eugenio is 14 turning 15, and she experiences many of the pressures of growing up: mean classmates, unsympathetic adults, and a sense of isolation, even from her friends. Adding to these usual typical adolescent problems, however, is that her father has been missing and her mother decides to live abroad. Kitty feels abandoned even as she comes under the care of her aunt and uncle and their son Alan.

Set in 1986, the novel suggests that the nation&rsquo;s history folds into Kitty or any other adolescent&rsquo;s life drama. Kitty&rsquo;s missing father, the reader realizes, is detained by the military. Bensy, who becomes Kitty&rsquo;s boyfriend, is the son of a general loyal to Marcos.

The Marcos &ldquo;Loyalists,&rdquo; like Bensy&rsquo;s father, are not portrayed one-dimensionally, and the religious discourse adopted by supporters of Corazon Aquino, like Kitty&rsquo;s aunt Leanna, are gently satirized. Neither does the novel endorse false optimism.

The novel is replete with references to cassette tapes, greeting cards, and other things that now are quaint. The author artfully injects British New Wave music, a hit among Filipino middle-class teenagers in the 1980s, into the novel. Kitty is a fan of Depeche Mode, and her friends are followers of Duran Duran and Tears for Fears. The titles of the chapters are taken from the songs of New Wave bands, and ingeniously, lyrics from their songs, quoted intermittently in Kitty&rsquo;s diary, are made to signify in the Philippine context. <b><i><strong>Salingkit: A 1986 Diary</strong></i></b> is an example of how young adult fiction can be made to entertain and educate at the same time. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a>. Manila: Limbagan ni P. Sayo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regalado&rsquo;s novel deals with the moral norms of a society undergoing massive changes under the American sociopolitical order, focusing on the mores and lifestyles of rich and famous Filipino colonials. It revolves around Nenita Deala, the beautiful wife of Bandino Deala, a wealthy businessman, and the events that overwhelm her as she becomes deeply immersed in the activities of Manila&rsquo;s elite. As the story begins, Nenita is with Paquito, a handsome bachelor who used to be her sweetheart in the past, when he was still a poor man. A misunderstanding had cast them apart, and she later married the rich Bandino. Their love is now rekindled. Nenita finds in Paquito an exciting lover. They become bolder, and carry on their affair right at Nenita&rsquo;s house. Meanwhile, Bandino himself has been indulging in extramarital affairs. During the famous Manila Carnival where members of high society live it up in sybaritic pleasure, Nenita and Paquito are confronted by Bandino, who has been tipped off by a friend about the illicit affair. Up against the anger of her husband, Nenita breaks down in tears, unable to defend herself against Bandino&rsquo;s condemnation of her. Gloom descends on the Deala house. Bandino finds himself the laughing stock of his circle for being a cuckold. Nenita becomes an outcast because she has violated a cardinal rule in society. Out of frustration, Bandino tries to shoot himself, and only the timely arrival of his four-year-old daughter brings him back to his senses. The novel ends with Nenita weeping, distraught, on the verge of losing her mind, as the ship carrying Bandino and their daughter leaves Manila&rsquo;s harbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regalado not only weaves a moving tale of adultery and punishment, but also plays up the social drama that ensues when people like Nenita depart from traditional notions of fidelity and purity. Bandino is, of course, equally guilty of infidelity, but traditional culture puts a heavier onus on the woman to preserve her honor and her husband&rsquo;s reputation. The novel effectively demonstrates Regalado&rsquo;s thesis that cultural values derived from the West&mdash;such as liberality in human relationships&mdash;could be harmful and destructive. This theme is echoed in the other works of Regalado, who was a novelist of manners and a lively chronicler of the lifestyle of Manila&rsquo;s elite. These he portrayed as the protector of traditional values that he himself believed in. With this and other works, Regalado could lay claim to being the foremost social historian of Manila during the American colonial period. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

				"value": "Regalado&#x2019;s novel deals with the moral norms of a society undergoing massive changes under the American sociopolitical order, focusing on the mores and lifestyles of rich and famous Filipino colonials. It revolves around Nenita Deala, the beautiful wife of Bandino Deala, a wealthy businessman, and the events that overwhelm her as she becomes deeply immersed in the activities of Manila&#x2019;s elite. As the story begins, Nenita is with Paquito, a handsome bachelor who used to be her sweetheart in the past, when he was still a poor man. A misunderstanding had cast them apart, and she later married the rich Bandino. Their love is now rekindled. Nenita finds in Paquito an exciting lover. They become bolder, and carry on their affair right at Nenita&#x2019;s house. Meanwhile, Bandino himself has been indulging in extramarital affairs. During the famous Manila Carnival where members of high society live it up in sybaritic pleasure, Nenita and Paquito are confronted by Bandino, who has been tipped off by a friend about the illicit affair. Up against the anger of her husband, Nenita breaks down in tears, unable to defend herself against Bandino&#x2019;s condemnation of her. Gloom descends on the Deala house. Bandino finds himself the laughing stock of his circle for being a cuckold. Nenita becomes an outcast because she has violated a cardinal rule in society. Out of frustration, Bandino tries to shoot himself, and only the timely arrival of his four-year-old daughter brings him back to his senses. The novel ends with Nenita weeping, distraught, on the verge of losing her mind, as the ship carrying Bandino and their daughter leaves Manila&#x2019;s harbor."

				"value": "Regalado not only weaves a moving tale of adultery and punishment, but also plays up the social drama that ensues when people like Nenita depart from traditional notions of fidelity and purity. Bandino is, of course, equally guilty of infidelity, but traditional culture puts a heavier onus on the woman to preserve her honor and her husband&#x2019;s reputation. The novel effectively demonstrates Regalado&#x2019;s thesis that cultural values derived from the West&#x2014;such as liberality in human relationships&#x2014;could be harmful and destructive. This theme is echoed in the other works of Regalado, who was a novelist of manners and a lively chronicler of the lifestyle of Manila&#x2019;s elite. These he portrayed as the protector of traditional values that he himself believed in. With this and other works, Regalado could lay claim to being the foremost social historian of Manila during the American colonial period. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em>"

It depicts their day-to-day life, customs and beliefs, the joys and trials of married life, the economic complications of a barter economy, the exploitation by the rich, the cooperative system of farming and the resulting closeness among members of the community&mdash;all these against the backdrop of a harsh environment. The narrative contains only 12 incidents, which take place over a span of one year. The incidents are narrated as they are recalled by the characters Doro and Sabel; hence, there is no adherence to chronological time. Suspense or climax is absent in the novel, for the characters&rsquo; conflicts are recurring problems that come with each season of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sabel and Doro leave Tara-Poro, where the soil is overworked, for the fishing barrio at Alag. When survival here proves just as difficult, they leave again to clear a small parcel of farmland, or <i>kaingin</i>,<i> </i>of their own in the interior. Doro strikes a friendship with Blas Marte, once an independent small farmer, now a sharecropper. Together they clear the kaingin. Then come months of hunger, when the only food available are yuro, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. Although Doro and Sabel&rsquo;s marriage is generally stable, quarrels may occasionally erupt. Doro often has one drink too many; Sabel sometimes succumbs to impulse buying, which Doro resents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Certain elements of nature are used as portents of doom or malevolent symbols: fish, rats, a hawk preying upon the chickens, and the tall <i>dao</i> tree. The indirect depiction of the kainginero&rsquo;s problems is achieved through symbolism, imagery, and, occasionally, a surrealistic style. Hence, although this is a novel of social concern, social injustice is rendered with neither drama nor authorial comment. A memorable scene is the attack of the rice field by rats, which, as in a nightmare, Sabel sees as &ldquo;little people&rdquo; harvesting the rice. Repetition of certain incidents evokes the cyclical quality of the kainginero&rsquo;s life. The novel begins and ends with Sabel expecting a child during the harvest season. In the beginning, Sabel had to give up four of her six mats to the municipal officials; later it is Clara&rsquo;s turn. Recurring scenes are Sabel putting her children to sleep with a lullaby; Sabel&rsquo;s ritual baths after childbirth and after a serious illness; Doro&rsquo;s jocular moments with Blas Marte while harvesting; and the loss of the chicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel is written in the same terse and laconic style that is characteristic of Gonzalez&rsquo;s other novels, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1697\"><b><i>The&nbsp;<strong><strong><strong>Bamboo&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong>Dancers</i></b></a>,<i> </i>1959, and <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Winds</i></b><i> <b>of</b> <b>April</b></i>, 1941. But because it is narrated from the kainginero&rsquo;s point of view, Gonzalez transliterates the idiom and catches the rhythm of the local dialect in the English language.

The author later translated the novel in Spanish for <b><i>El Grito</i> <i>Pueblo</i></b> in 1905. The loss of the original Tagalog prompted a certain Carlos B. Raimundo to write a Tagalog version of the novel. The frontispiece of the 1912 edition featured the name of Isabelo de los Reyes as the author followed by the novel&rsquo;s title. A woman&rsquo;s picture is in the middle of the page with a caption below: &ldquo;O si Liwayway ng Baliwag&rdquo; (Or Liwayway of Baliwag), followed by the words, &ldquo;Mga Nangyari sa Paghihimagsik&rdquo; (What Transpired during the Revolution).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this short novel, two themes are explored in such a way that they appear seamlessly woven into the major narrative. The narrative is an engrossing, fast-paced series of movements where love of country is deftly interspersed with love of a woman, a grand motif that can be traced to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><b><i> at Laura</i></b></a> (Florante and Laura), 1838.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Colonel Puso is an officer in Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s army that has been fighting the Americans. When the novel opens, he is wounded and is recounting his story: Colonel Puso first met a woman named Liwayway in Baliwag as he was rallying his forces for an attack. He was instantly smitten with her and called her &ldquo;ice maiden.&rdquo; Though apparently indifferent to him, Liwayway gave him a handkerchief and a lock of her hair when he asked for a token that he could bring with him to the battlefield. When he was seriously wounded, he was sent to Baliwag to recover, with Liwayway attending to his needs. In jest, she offered him a gold ring upon which he could vent his frustration for her seeming coldness. Liwayway&rsquo;s adoptive mother, however, fearful that the officer was not taking Liwayway seriously enough, spirited the young woman away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is the story that the grieving officer unfolds as he begs a soldier to look for Liwayway and return the ring to her, as a reminder of her treachery. At this point, the place where the colonel is recuperating is attacked by American soldiers. Colonel Puso drives the soldier away and fights the enemies singlehandedly. He is eventually captured, and his wounds treated by a kindly American officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The soldier finds refuge in the house of an old woman, Aling Edeng. The old woman&rsquo;s curiosity is aroused when she sees the ring on the soldier&rsquo;s finger. She tells him that she is the mother of the colonel and asks the soldier to help her locate her son. They find the colonel in a hospital in Manila, and in a dramatic scene, Aling Edeng reveals her true identity as Liwayway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ill-fated lovers are finally joined in matrimony by a priest from the Philippine Independent Church founded by Fr Gregorio Aglipay. The Americans, earlier constructed as the Filipinos&rsquo; enemies, emerge as purveyors of progress in the colonized country. Colonel Puso is assimilated into the new system when he is appointed governor of the province of Kabulaklakan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The significance of this novel derives not solely from its wealth of historical details or from its masterful depiction of the traditional &ldquo;dalagang Pilipina,&rdquo; or Filipino maiden, who was lovely, modest, and gracious but who did not easily succumb to honeyed words of suitors. The novel owes its importance to the fact that it was written by Isabelo de los Reyes, 1864-1938. De los Reyes&rsquo;s place in Philippine history is as a revolutionary against Spain, an influential writer and founder of the newspaper <b><i>El Ilocano</i></b>, and as founder of the Union Obrera Democratica, 1902, and with Gregorio Aglipay, the Aglipayan Church, the last the result of the growing nationalism and an anti-imperialistic thrust directed against the ruling Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Isabelo de los Reyes lived through the experiences he depicts in the novel and witnessed both the destructive and the benevolent faces of American colonialism. It is this contradiction that shapes the novel, a timely one for its original readers, who were still reeling from the disastrous effects of Spanish colonization but who were faced with another colonial order. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The novel owes its importance to the fact that it was written by Isabelo de los Reyes, 1864-1938. De los Reyes&#x2019;s place in Philippine history is as a revolutionary against Spain, an influential writer and founder of the newspaper <b><i>El Ilocano</i></b>, and as founder of the Union Obrera Democratica, 1902, and with Gregorio Aglipay, the Aglipayan Church, the last the result of the growing nationalism and an anti-imperialistic thrust directed against the ruling Catholic Church."

On his way to work, Maximo &ldquo;Max&rdquo; Tirana encounters Noemi Molina, a woman he met during the war. When Noemi confronts Max about a ring she has given him, they are both overcome with emotion.

After learning that Max is from Lambusan, a stronghold of Filipino guerrilla fighters, and seeing that he still carries Philippine currency, the soldier takes him to a Kempeitai prison, where he is beaten up and repeatedly questioned. In prison, Max meets Watanabe, a sympathetic soldier who urges him not to give up.

In the first, Datu Amado Bualan, the last living king of the Subanon, has to confront the problems wrought by martial law. The first scene of the novel foreshadows the fate of the Subanon. One of Datu Amado&rsquo;s men is being tortured by the military on the mere suspicion that he is a spy for the New People&rsquo;s Army. The datu&rsquo;s stature is no longer enough to secure him the captive&rsquo;s freedom, and he begs for the man&rsquo;s release. That night, the Communist rebels attack the Subanon village. They kill all the dogs in retaliation for the Subanon&rsquo;s defaulting on the so-called revolutionary tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Datu Amado finds himself and his people trapped between the proverbial rock and a hard place. He tries to find a middle ground even as his people abandon the once-proud village, but ultimately the Communists put him on trial for being an enemy of the people. With his death, dies, too, the last vestige of royalty and political influence of the Subanon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second and third parts of the novel deal with the &ldquo;zoning&rdquo; operations of the military. Though originally conceived as a way of relocating people caught in the war zone to a safer place, &ldquo;zoning&rdquo; has become a means for the military to label everyone a Communist. To make matters worse, the local officials, who harbor deep hatred for the Bualan clan, accuse their political and business enemies of being members of the Communist Party. What ensues is the near extermination of the Bualan clan, signified by the death of the town&rsquo;s vice mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel is a microcosm of the national experience under military rule. The sufferings of the Subanon reflect the consequences of allowing the military to rule the land, including massive corruption and oppression, the eradication of entire communities, and the disruption of the family unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the final scene, the Subanon shaman retrieves the slain vice mayor&rsquo;s body, which the soldiers have left in the village plaza to rot as a warning to those who would stand against them, and carries it up to the mountains to give it a proper burial. The stench dissipates, but it has already seeped into the very wood of the houses&mdash;symbolic of the persistence of corruption and oppression even with the lifting of martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The supernatural way by which the shaman retrieves the body is a counterpoint to the grim realism of the novel. The scene suggests that, by forgetting who they once were, the Subanon are almost exterminated; but, as the shaman&rsquo;s act shows, if they are aware of who they are, then they, their culture, and their beliefs may yet survive. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The narratives in <b><i>Tandang</i></b><i> <b>Basio</b> <b>Macunat</b> </i>are rendered by various fictitious persons, who serve as the conduit for the friar&rsquo;s thinking. An unnamed general narrator is presented as making a decision to visit various rural places outside the city of Manila. In the course of his peregrinations, the narrator meets an old farmer named Gervasio Macunat. <i>Macunat </i>literally means &ldquo;wizened,&rdquo; &ldquo;grown tough and resilient with age,&rdquo; and figuratively means &ldquo;stingy,&rdquo; &ldquo;not liberal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;miserly.&rdquo; The farmer recounts to the narrator his early life, which had been dominated by two authority figures: the native teacher who proved to be an effective educator, despite the fact that he had not bothered at all to go to the city for enlightenment, and his peasant father who had demanded complete obedience of him. While largely uneducated, for there are limits to what the indio peasant is allowed to learn, old man Basio considers himself a simple man leading a simple contented life, not having absorbed strange ideas coming from the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narrator then introduces another story, this time revolving around a cabeza<i> </i>named Andres Baticot, his wife Maria Dimaniuala (literally, &ldquo;incredulous&rdquo;), and their children Pili and Proper.

Andres has decided to send his son to Manila for studies, over the hearty objections of Proper&rsquo;s sister, Pili. The parish priest has an explanation for Andres&rsquo;s dream of sending Proper to school: this is a form of arrogance, for he simply wishes to show off that he has the money to support his son. The priest further claims that because he has little intelligence, Proper will not prosper in the city, but instead will fall victim to wickedness which is rampant in that place. Baticot eventually sends Proper to Manila, where Proper soon wallows in a life of vice, progressively dissipating until he uses up the wealth of Andres and Maria, who become paupers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The thesis begins to take shape: education, or the yearning for it, can only bring the young indio to grief, and is not suitable for him.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5287\">Agustin C. Fabian</a> aka Angel Fernandez. Manila: Liwayway Publishing. Reprinted, with an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5060\">Liwayway A. Arceo</a>, Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This was the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> novel of Fabian, who had started out as a writer in English. It is the story of Andres Talon, son of a <i>timawa </i>or serf in a Philippine barrio. The word &ldquo;timawa&rdquo; has ambiguous connotations. In precolonial society, it referred to vassals who rendered service to an overlord by paying feudal dues in the form of agricultural labor. But they were neither serfs nor slaves since they enjoyed a measure of freedom. In Fabian&rsquo;s novel, the stigma of his lowly social class forces Andres to leave for the United States. He works at odd jobs and eventually makes it to medical school. His unhappy childhood experiences drive him to excel in everything he sets his mind on. Hardened, he deals with two fellow Filipino students in a very businesslike manner. He demands payment from both Alfred, a rich Filipino medical student, and Estela, the daughter of a rich family, for everything he does for them. This exploitation leads to arguments between him and Alice, an American girl who loves him, and between him and Bill, another classmate in school. Neither seems to understand why Andres is so rude and opportunistic in his dealings with rich Filipinos. World War II breaks out, and Andres enlists as a member of the US medical corps. He proves himself a capable surgeon and risks his life to save soldiers. He returns to the Philippines as a much-decorated major of the US Army. His American friends do not know this, believing he has died in an explosion. Andres returns to the barrio. His prestige confers on him a privileged status, even in the house of the rich woman who used to call him and his father timawa. Alice decides to devote her life to helping Andres&rsquo;s fellow citizens. She builds a hospital with the money Andres left in trust.

				"value": "This was the first <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> novel of Fabian, who had started out as a writer in English. It is the story of Andres Talon, son of a <i>timawa </i>or serf in a Philippine barrio. The word &#x201C;timawa&#x201D; has ambiguous connotations. In precolonial society, it referred to vassals who rendered service to an overlord by paying feudal dues in the form of agricultural labor. But they were neither serfs nor slaves since they enjoyed a measure of freedom. In Fabian&#x2019;s novel, the stigma of his lowly social class forces Andres to leave for the United States. He works at odd jobs and eventually makes it to medical school. His unhappy childhood experiences drive him to excel in everything he sets his mind on. Hardened, he deals with two fellow Filipino students in a very businesslike manner. He demands payment from both Alfred, a rich Filipino medical student, and Estela, the daughter of a rich family, for everything he does for them. This exploitation leads to arguments between him and Alice, an American girl who loves him, and between him and Bill, another classmate in school. Neither seems to understand why Andres is so rude and opportunistic in his dealings with rich Filipinos. World War II breaks out, and Andres enlists as a member of the US medical corps. He proves himself a capable surgeon and risks his life to save soldiers. He returns to the Philippines as a much-decorated major of the US Army. His American friends do not know this, believing he has died in an explosion. Andres returns to the barrio. His prestige confers on him a privileged status, even in the house of the rich woman who used to call him and his father timawa. Alice decides to devote her life to helping Andres&#x2019;s fellow citizens. She builds a hospital with the money Andres left in trust. The two separated lovers finally meet after a series of complicated events, which include Andres&#x2019;s being afflicted with amnesia and ending up for treatment in the hospital built by Alice. The novel ends with Andres regaining his memory. His many deeds of generosity are revealed to those who have been benefited by him."

Trese and her allies, the Kambal, are called upon by the police to investigate and solve strange cases in the city. The episodic nature of these volumes helps introduce the reader to the dark world Trese inhabits, and lays out the parameters by which this world works. There are engaging touches of local color: the dwende love chocnut, the Mercury Drug symbol can be used for healing, morgues are routinely visited by the aswang for their feeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Trese relies on the skills that she learned from her ancestors to solve these crimes. There are times, though, when even her skills and her knowledge are not enough to bring about justice for the victimized. In some cases, Trese has had to punish those who have broken her law even when they were seeking righteous justice. The world created by Tan and Baldisimo is a dark reflection of our world. These supernatural beings represent the many denizens of the capital city&rsquo;s underworld&mdash;the corrupt politicians, the gang lords, the smugglers, the dirty cops&mdash;and we find them all entwined with the monsters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two standout stories in these three volumes are &ldquo;Our Secret Constellation&rdquo; in <b><i>Murder on Balete Drive</i></b> and &ldquo;Fight of the Year&rdquo; in <b><i>Last Seen after Midnight</i></b>. In &ldquo;Our Secret Constellation,&rdquo; Tan and Baldisimo pay tribute to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>&rsquo;s classic creation, Darna. The story shows how even one of our enduring legends can be broken by an increasingly corrupt world, and how even her quest for justice has to give way to Trese&rsquo;s own code. It is a bittersweet story about how the city can crush the dreams of even the simplest people, and how strong family ties are what keep us together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Fight of the Year&rdquo; mythologizes the country&rsquo;s premier boxer&mdash;Manny Pacquiao. The story is set in General Santos City, not Manila, and the Pacquiao-like character is revealed to be a hero who for one night fights 12 different monsters all in an effort to keep his city safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Mass Murders</i></b> is an origin story. The episodes collected in this issue shed light upon Trese&rsquo;s initiation into the otherworld depicted in the series. It also gives the backstory of the mysterious Kambal&mdash;the children of Talagbusao&mdash;the native god of war. This is a myth-heavy story that manages to find its anchor in the realities of Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Midnight <strong><strong>Tribu</strong>nal</strong></i></b> introduces Trese&rsquo;s most dangerous foe yet and promises a story arch that could encompass several future volumes. It appropriates the story of Captain Barbel, another of Mars Ravelo&rsquo;s creations. In the story, Trese has to hunt down the heirs of Captain Barbel&rsquo;s powers as they have turned into vigilantes and wrecking havoc all across the capital city. In the end, it is not Trese who solves the problem, but the mysterious Madame&mdash;an Imelda Marcos-like figure&mdash;who manipulates the tigbalang into taking action into their own hands. Unlike her previous opponents, the madame is very human, and yet her influence over the otherworld and even this world is strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Trese</i></b> remains the Philippine benchmark for graphic novels. Its black-and-white illustrations give it a noirish feel. Its individual stories are gripping at times, heartbreaking at others. Most important of all, it gets the reader to look more closely at the people, places, objects, and events in the capital city, because as Trese consistently suggests, everything (and consequently, everyone) in this city, is not what it seems. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Baquiran Jr</a>, Quezon City: Sentro ng Wikang Filipino, University of the Philippines Press, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a>, 1996. Translated into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, and other languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This slim volume is a conduct book, because it teaches good manners and correct social behavior. During the Spanish period, conduct books were popular reading material, together with works written primarily for religious instruction, such as catechism, novenas, spiritual exercises, and sermons. The book is written in epistolary style, an exchange of letters among the characters, who become the channels for the author&rsquo;s discourse on Christian virtues a person must possess to be considered exemplary and upright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book was dedicated to Filipino young men and women, to equip them with a knowledge of proper social decorum. In his introduction (here rendered in English translation) the author declares that action, manner, and speech must not offend God and people: &ldquo;knowing this rule is the jewel of a young girl, an honor and an ornament to a young man&mdash;a beauty and loveliness that, with good manners, constitute twin virtues that captivate the heart.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The author&rsquo;s ideas are expressed through a fictitious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> family in Paombong, Bulacan, made up of a father a mother, and their children named Urbana, Feliza, and Honesto. The names are symbolic. &ldquo;Urbana&rdquo; suggests urbane, characteristic of one who is refined and polished in rearing and in manners. &ldquo;Feliza&rdquo; suggests a happy and tractable disposition. Honesto is described as an upright, honest, and God-fearing boy. The moralistic teachings are contained in 34 letters. Twenty-three are written by Urbana to her sister Feliza, and six by Feliza to Urbana.

The unilinear plot, relieved by a few flashbacks, is matched by one-dimensional and static characterization. This deliberate &ldquo;artlessness&rdquo; serves to reveal gradually the theme of psychological, moral, and cultural hollowness. Serving as foil to Dr Hunter is Don Vicente, the Spaniard, who lives a more natural, hence volatile, life than Hunter. However, he suffers from a kind of gangrene that causes his leg to be amputated. The volcano referred to by the title is Mayon Volcano, an entity which is both alive and dormant, self-generating and destructive, a natural force that throbs with life and energy. But it is also Junior&rsquo;s imitation volcano, which matches Hunter in its hollowness and artificiality. The <i>cadang-cadang</i>, a pest that eats the interior of coconut trees, reminds one again of Hunter&rsquo;s hollowness and also of Don Vicente&rsquo;s moral disease. It may symbolize the Filipino as well, which may appear whole and healthy but is actually sick. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Lourdes H.

The unilinear plot, relieved by a few flashbacks, is matched by one-dimensional and static characterization. This deliberate &#x201C;artlessness&#x201D; serves to reveal gradually the theme of psychological, moral, and cultural hollowness. Serving as foil to Dr Hunter is Don Vicente, the Spaniard, who lives a more natural, hence volatile, life than Hunter. However, he suffers from a kind of gangrene that causes his leg to be amputated. The volcano referred to by the title is Mayon Volcano, an entity which is both alive and dormant, self-generating and destructive, a natural force that throbs with life and energy. But it is also Junior&#x2019;s imitation volcano, which matches Hunter in its hollowness and artificiality. The <i>cadang-cadang</i>, a pest that eats the interior of coconut trees, reminds one again of Hunter&#x2019;s hollowness and also of Don Vicente&#x2019;s moral disease. It may symbolize the Filipino as well, which may appear whole and healthy but is actually sick. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Lourdes H.

It is about an aspiring writer, Daniel, writing his story. This <i>kunstlerroman</i>, or coming-of-age narrative of an artist, is thus also metafictional, being a self-aware narrative commenting on itself and on the details of how it was written.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The life of the protagonist begins in his hometown of Atisan, which he wants to use as the setting of his planned novel. In the book&rsquo;s introduction he is at the brink of death after being lured by a <i>tiyanak</i> (changeling). He receives an e-mail from Glen, who speculates on the possibility that they and their hometown of Atisan may just be products of Daniel&rsquo;s imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nonlinear narrative takes us back and forth in time to show Daniel&rsquo;s development as a person and as a writer. Back in primary school, he tells his classmates stories about the dwarf that he later calls &ldquo;Delka Linar,&rdquo; an anagram of his full name, &ldquo;Karl Daniel.&rdquo; He cherishes three childhood friends: Erik, his very first friend; Michael, who defends him from bullying classmates; and Glen, who shares his interest in literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Daniel&rsquo;s story is published in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><b><i>Liwayway</i></b></a> magazine, and he is determined to finish the next great Filipino novel. He begins by observing the people of his hometown, and he asks his Uncle Tony to tell him stories, which include those about Domeng. Domeng is their ancestor who was the first to clear Sapang Ligaw (Lost Lake) and to build the first nipa hut there. He took a wife and had numerous children before he disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Daniel regularly meets Teresa, a prostitute who can read minds at nighttime. Daniel has introduced himself to her as &ldquo;Karl.&rdquo; She calls him &ldquo;Karl Kabute&rdquo; because of his mushroom-sized ears, a mark, she says, of a short life. Teresa tells Daniel a story about Atisan, the muse. Once upon a time, Atisan sees Domingo&rsquo;s need for love. She appears to him, who appreciates her but eventually forgets about her. Atisan&rsquo;s spirit disappears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Teresa prevents Daniel from looking at her. The day before, she offered to accompany Daniel on the horror train. Daniel agreed, because it would be their first &ldquo;date.&rdquo; He would be able to see Teresa in broad daylight, instead of meeting her at night, he as a customer and she a prostitute. Daniel arrives at the rendezvous but sees someone resembling Orange, his first love, who denies being her. Daniel loses track of her, and again sees Teresa only after the sun has already set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Orange is one of triplets in Daniel&rsquo;s hometown, the other two being Apple and Peaches, so named because her family owns a fruit stand. After Daniel takes her virginity, they part ways. Later, Daniel learns that Orange is in Japan, married to a Japanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Uncle Tony tells Daniel stories of their hometown but is taciturn about family matters. Daniel&rsquo;s ignorance about his family prevents him from writing concretely about Arcangel, the protagonist of his novel in progress. Arcangel is an <i>albularyo</i> (faith healer) like Daniel&rsquo;s father. But Daniel knows very little about his father, and his mother is dead. There is a physical resemblance between Daniel and Tony, who later admits to being Daniel&rsquo;s father. A lengthy family history follows. Tony gives Daniel a photograph of his mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel is about to end when Daniel learns his mother&rsquo;s name: Olivia. Daniel goes to Boracay to find his mother, who, according to Tony, starred in a &ldquo;bold&rdquo; (pornographic) film. Daniel muses that he has lived a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life, unlike his father who, he guesses, went underground during martial law. Daniel sees Michael in Boracay and they engage in existentialist conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One night Daniel meets two intoxicated teenagers, to whom he shows his mother&rsquo;s photograph. The taller lad snatches the wallet but Daniel quickly restrains the other one. He demands that his captive lead him to his accomplice and return the photo. Daniel ends up falling off a cliff; it is the same scene in the introduction where he thinks he is being pushed by the tiyanak. Thus, Samar&rsquo;s novel comes full circle, and all the fragments in between are scenes from Daniel&rsquo;s life flashing before him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Samar makes considerable use of Philippine folklore even as he acknowledges his foreign literary influences, including Haruki Murakami and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5400\">Stevan Javellana</a>. Boston: Little, Brown and Co. Reprinted, Quezon City: Alemar-Phoenix, 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title is taken from a character&rsquo;s speech in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><b>Noli Me Tangere</b></a></i>, 1887. Usually classified as a war novel, <b><i>Without Seeing</i> <i>the Dawn</i></b><i> </i>does not actually begin with the story of the war. The first part, titled &ldquo;Day,&rdquo; depicts prewar farm life in a barrio and then city life in Panay; the second part, titled &ldquo;Night,&rdquo; depicts the effects of war on this barrio. Ricardo Suerte is the central character. He metamorphoses from a gentle, passive farmer to a bitter, violent man as he is buffeted by the social injustice of landlordism, the hostile forces of nature, the corruption in the city, and the atrocities of war. His character is likened to that of a carabao, which will endure patiently until, goaded by a series of blows, it finally fights back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the beginning, life for Carding and his bride Lucing seems idyllic as they build their new house and await the coming of their baby. But there are auguries of the sorrows that will soon befall them. Their baby is stillborn, a &ldquo;monkey child.&rdquo; The first serious rift between Carding and Lucing occurs when the landlord&rsquo;s son, Luis Castro, comes for a vacation in the barrio and seduces Lucing. Having caught them, Carding beats up Luis; consequently, the Suerte family loses the right to till the land. Carding and Lucing then move to Iloilo City, where people must harden themselves in order to survive. Carding becomes a stevedore and finds solace in Rosing, a prostitute who falls sincerely in love with him. Lucing leaves him and returns to the barrio. Carding is unwillingly dragged into unionism, whose leadership is based on patronage system. Disillusioned, Carding follows Lucing back to the barrio and tries to start farm life anew. Once again, he is foiled, this time by natural elements. After a huge flood destroys the farm, Carding decides to join the homestead program in Mindanao. But the war breaks out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel&rsquo;s second part begins with Carding&rsquo;s return home after having survived the Death March. Although he is determined not to get involved in the guerrilla movement, he is inexorably drawn into it when he learns that his family has been brutalized while he is away. Carding becomes a <i>verdugo</i>, the executioner of war collaborators. He is so notorious for his cruelty and ruthlessness that he is condemned by his own community. He intends to kill Lucing&rsquo;s baby, whose father might be a Japanese soldier, but it is stillborn.

Usually classified as a war novel, <b><i>Without Seeing</i> <i>the Dawn</i></b><i> </i>does not actually begin with the story of the war. The first part, titled &#x201C;Day,&#x201D; depicts prewar farm life in a barrio and then city life in Panay; the second part, titled &#x201C;Night,&#x201D; depicts the effects of war on this barrio. Ricardo Suerte is the central character. He metamorphoses from a gentle, passive farmer to a bitter, violent man as he is buffeted by the social injustice of landlordism, the hostile forces of nature, the corruption in the city, and the atrocities of war. His character is likened to that of a carabao, which will endure patiently until, goaded by a series of blows, it finally fights back."

But there are auguries of the sorrows that will soon befall them. Their baby is stillborn, a &#x201C;monkey child.&#x201D; The first serious rift between Carding and Lucing occurs when the landlord&#x2019;s son, Luis Castro, comes for a vacation in the barrio and seduces Lucing. Having caught them, Carding beats up Luis; consequently, the Suerte family loses the right to till the land. Carding and Lucing then move to Iloilo City, where people must harden themselves in order to survive. Carding becomes a stevedore and finds solace in Rosing, a prostitute who falls sincerely in love with him. Lucing leaves him and returns to the barrio. Carding is unwillingly dragged into unionism, whose leadership is based on patronage system. Disillusioned, Carding follows Lucing back to the barrio and tries to start farm life anew. Once again, he is foiled, this time by natural elements. After a huge flood destroys the farm, Carding decides to join the homestead program in Mindanao. But the war breaks out."

Carding becomes a <i>verdugo</i>, the executioner of war collaborators. He is so notorious for his cruelty and ruthlessness that he is condemned by his own community. He intends to kill Lucing&#x2019;s baby, whose father might be a Japanese soldier, but it is stillborn. Carding is regenerated at this moment, when he realizes that he could not have killed the infant anyway. He now joins the war in earnest.

The chapters venture into these character&rsquo;s thoughts and perceptions of events while constantly keeping Connie in focus. This use of a revolving point of view highlights a central theme of the novel: the difficulty of distinguishing between right and wrong, truth and falsehood, illusion and reality. Other themes are the middle-class Filipino&rsquo;s search for identity and roots, the Filipino&rsquo;s sense of alienation, and the inaction that arises from an individual&rsquo;s failure to distinguish between the illusory world and the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Set in Hong Kong and Manila, the story revolves around two women: Connie Escobar and her mother, Concha Vidal. Both women are complex, mysterious, and obsessive. Connie, tormented by painful realizations about her family, her marriage and her past, takes refuge in a lie; she insists to all who would listen that she has two navels. The illusion enables her to set herself apart from other people and thus retreat into a world where she need never make moral choices nor assume responsibility for anything. Concha, for her part, is obsessed with her past and her youth, and constantly seeks self-renewal in her affairs with younger men. The arrival of the women in Hong Kong quickly causes upheavals in the lives of the people all on self-imposed exile there and whom they encounter: Pete, a veterinarian; his priest-brother Tony; their homesick, dying father, Dr Monson; Paco Texeira, the bandleader who had brief affairs with both Connie and Concha during his stint in Manila; Mary, Paco&rsquo;s wife; and Rita Lopez, with whom Pepe has been going around for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel opens with Connie requesting a mystified Pepe to surgically correct her imagined defect: the two navels. Later, Pepe meets Concha who proceeds to contradict everything her daughter has told him. In a kind of ripple effect, this initial entry of the two women into the small, tight world of exiles causes the latter to reexamine their own relationships, their conceptions of right and wrong, truth and lies. In the end, Connie runs away with Paco, an act which takes her out of her world of illusions into a complex reality, and starts a string of reactions and realizations among all the characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel is rich in symbols. The two navels can represent life&rsquo;s dualities: Connie&rsquo;s dolls Minnie and Biliken represent the safe and secure, because illusory, world she has built around herself; the encounter between Connie and Dr Monson represents the meeting of present and past; and Connie&rsquo;s four &ldquo;deaths&rdquo; (by earth, water, air, and fire) parallel Connie&rsquo;s spiritual deaths at various stages in her life, and the rebirth she comes to crave and later attains. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.
