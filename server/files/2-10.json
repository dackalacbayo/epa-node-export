At the end of the 19th century, Spanish explorers accompanied by Augustinian friars from Ilocos, went up the Naguilian trail and found a fertile valley. The Spaniards named the valley La Trinidad, after the Holy Trinity, and built a chapel in which an image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Covadonga was enshrined. La Trinidad was the first colonial settlement in the Cordilleras. Eventually, the parish of San Jose was built, but the friars had little success in converting the local population. It was only later, when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> migrants from the lowlands migrated to the valley in search of livelihood, that Catholicism took its root in La Trinidad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kafagway&rsquo;s transformation to Baguio, which is said to come from the Ibaloy word &ldquo;bagyiw&rdquo; which means moss, would come later, after the Philippine-American War (1899-1901).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kafagway was chosen by the Americans as a colonial hill station and a health resort, following recommendations by the Spanish Benguet Commission, and verified through an exploratory trip in 1900 by Dean C. Worcester and Gen Luke E. Wright. Worcester and Wright were sent to confirm reports about the highlands in Luzon where the air was cool, pine trees grew, and fog regularly covered the landscape. Coming upon Baguio, set at 1,504 m in altitude, the Americans decided to develop it as a hill station, similar to the British hill stations in India, like Simla. They planned a sanatorium and summer retreat for American colonials. In 1903, the Philippine Commission designated Baguio as the &ldquo;Summer Capital&rdquo; of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>From about 20 indigenous houses at the turn of the century, the community grew the following years after the Americans started to build public structures. Infrastructure projects were also initiated starting with the construction of the Benguet Road on the Bued River Canyon. The road deviated from the proposed Spanish wagon road in the Naguilian Trail which, over time, had been widened and improved. It linked Baguio and Bauang, La Union, through the town of Naguilian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To build Benguet Road, rocks were blasted with dynamite and the debris cleared manually by workers of different nationalities&mdash;Filipinos, Americans, Japanese, Chinese, among others. Built from 1901 to 1905, the road links Rosario, La Union, and Baguio City. It was later renamed Kennon Road after Col Lyman Kennon, a United States (US) Army engineer who supervised the construction of the road from 1903 to 1905. The renaming of Kennon Road recognized the achievement of Col Kennon, who had solved the problem of how to expedite the construction of the road so that by 1905 the road could be opened to traffic. Kennon&rsquo;s solution was to build a trail, wide enough to be used by horses to haul supplies to seven camps, and from the camps, teams of workers would work simultaneously in cutting through the mountains, widening the road so that supply vehicles could pass through. The original road was a Macadam Telford-type, later improved as an all-weather asphalt road and much later replaced in some sections with concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Americans officially founded Baguio City on Sep 1909. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a>, urban planner and architect, designed the city. He went to Baguio on Dec 1904. On his voyage back to the United States, Burnham drew his plans for Baguio and Manila, sending to the Philippines what is popularly known as &ldquo;the Burnham plan for the improvement of the city of Manila,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Burnham plan for the improvement of Baguio.&rdquo; Burnham proposed adapting the standard grid to the terrain while respecting the scenic aspects of Baguio. Burnham left the articulation of the details of his proposal to the Bureau of Public Works architects and engineers. He recommended <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William E. Parsons</a>, a graduate of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts, as the implementing architect. The Philippine Commission Act No 1495, 26 May 1906, appointed Parsons as consulting architect of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Marcos era, Baguio City became accessible from Manila through the 42&ndash;kilometer Marcos Highway (renamed Aspiras-Palispis Highway in 2000) from Agoo, La Union. Halsema Highway also later linked Baguio to Bontoc and Sagada in Mountain Province. In 2008, a new road was inaugurated linking the city to the province of Nueva Vizcaya. Land travel to Baguio from Manila usually took six to seven hours, but with the completion of the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEX), travel time is now considerably faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city is also accessible by air through the Loakan Airport. Built in 1934 and measuring 4.3 km, the still-operational airport is seldom used by commercial airlines because of its short airstrip and other security concerns. However, private and military aircrafts still use the airport at present.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the construction of Kennon Road, Baguio was only accessible from Manila through a 24-hour sea trip to San Fernando, La Union, and about two to three days horseback travel via Naguilian on a trail built by the Spaniards in 1892. When the road was opened in 1905, it had a total of 60 wooden bridges. These bridges were all replaced with steel arches by prewar Baguio Mayor Eusebius J. Halsema, who was also then the district engineer of the Bureau of Public Works. The project was part of his overall plan to improve Benguet Road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the plan of making Baguio the summer capital, specific areas for government and municipal centers were identified in the 1905 Burnham plan. The government center complex was composed of nine buildings, all completed in 1909 and built mostly of wood. This complex included athletic fields, a mess hall, and a social hall at Luneta Hill, which was the former site of the Pines Hotel (now SM Baguio), tennis courts (now Baguio Convention Center), playground (now Department of Social Welfare and Development compound), and dormitories. One of these dormitories was converted into <strong><em>Casa Vallejo</em></strong> in 1923, and later became a 33-room hotel. The building, the oldest surviving structure in the whole of Baguio, became idle for years but was restored and renovated in 2010 to again become a hotel with a restaurant, bookstore, mini-theater, and a spa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 80 cottages were also built in the government complex from 1909 to 1911. Bureaus of the American government of the Philippines started to transfer to the city in 1910, with officials and employees staying in dormitories and government owned cottages during the so-called &ldquo;Baguio Season.&rdquo; However, this practice was terminated by Gov-Gen Francis Harrison in 1913, following opposition from Filipino legislators who argued it was just a luxury. Public buildings and cottages were left vacant because of this, but were eventually re-used as venues for public gatherings and other activities. Most of these buildings were destroyed during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the earliest buildings in the city was the site of the Philippine Commission&rsquo;s first session in Baguio from 22 Apr to 11 Jun 1904, where Baguio was declared the nation&rsquo;s summer capital. Located on a road at the foot of Luneta Hill (now Gov Pack Rd), only the historical marker placed by the Philippines Historical Committee, now the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a>, in 1940 survives to this day. The surrounding area at present is a bus terminal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio&rsquo;s main bus station pre-World War II is presently occupied by the Victory Liner bus station along Upper Session Road. The site used to be the terminal of the Benguet Auto Line (BAL), a government-owned transportation company linked with the Philippine National Railway (PNR), where passengers rode buses and limousines going to and from the Damortis rail station in Rosario, La Union for their trip to Manila and back. The government had an ambitious plan of lengthening the railroad tracks that linked Manila and Dagupan, originally laid out during the Spanish era to reach San Fernando, La Union and a spur going through Naguilian to Baguio City. World War II prevented the building of the Naguilian to Baguio spur. The tracks ended at Damortis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also located on Gov Pack Rd was the former Baguio Sanatorium, which dates back to 1902, near the site of the University of the Cordilleras and Commission on Elections. The Sanatorium opened on what is known today as Luneta Hill under its first director Dr. H. Eugene Stafford. It became the Hotel Pines, the first tourist hotel in Baguio, when Baguio Hospital was opened in 1908 at the upper end of the Benguet Road, located south of the present Baguio General Hospital building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio Hospital&rsquo;s construction began in 1907 and continued with the construction of a nurses&rsquo; home. At the top of the ridge adjacent to the Baguio Hospital were cottages used by recovering tuberculosis patients. A 1910 photograph of the Baguio Hospital shows it as a modest structure of two stories with a pitched roof and a one-story wing on either side. By 1910, the hospital had been expanded. In 1915, administration was given to Dr Silverio Garcia, the first in a long line of Filipino administrators. In 1930, Pres Manuel Quezon promised to rebuild the hospital on a bigger scale. But the project did not begin until 1937, when the hospital was renamed <strong><em>Baguio General Hospital</em></strong> (BGH). Inaugurated on 22 Feb 1941, the building is now the main building of the Baguio General Hospital. This was a two-story structure which followed a modified H-plan with four wings. This building was in a severe <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style with an arched porte cochere at the main entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Apr 1945, the hospital was closed due to severe bombing. The main building was severely damaged but was reconstructed in 1948. On 16 Jul 1990, a severe earthquake hit Baguio causing the destruction of several buildings. Fourteen others, including the main building, needed repair. Repaired, reconstructed, and painted with the green and white color scheme of the American era, the BGH main building continues to serve its function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on Romulo Drive, part of the Baguio-Tuding Road, <strong><em>Mansion House</em></strong> or <strong><em>The Mansion</em></strong> (also called <strong><em>Executive House</em></strong> ) was the official summer residence in Baguio of the American governor-generals, and later, Philippine presidents. It was constructed from 1907 to 1908. With an initial appropriated budget of $15,000, government architect William E. Parsons was asked to design the house. More than a hundred prisoners from the Bilibid penitentiary, whose sentences were commuted, worked on its paths, terraces, and paddocks. The garden was supervised by a professional nursery man from Scotland and Japanese gardeners. In 1935, the residence was expanded, probably to coincide with its turn over to the Philippine Commonwealth, established in July that year. The house became the summer residence of the Philippine President, Manuel Quezon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new summer house for the highest American official, the High Commissioner, was built in Camp John Hay. Completed in 1940, it was built under Paul V. McNutt but with Philippine independence, the residence was turned over to the American ambassador as a summer residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Badly damaged during World War II and rehabilitated in 1946-47, Mansion House continues to function as the summer residence of Philippine presidents. After the war, it became the venue for historic international conferences such as the United Nations Economic Commission of Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1947, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1948, and the first meeting of the Southeast Asian Union (SEAU), known as The Baguio Conference in 1950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons designed the Mansion House in a grand neoclassical style, following the tenet of Beaux-Arts. Subsequent expansions in 1935 respected this style so there is a seamless transition between the central section designed by Parsons and the additions. As it stands today, with the additions from 1935, Mansion house follows an H-plan, with the central two-story wing flanked on either side by perpendicular one story wings. The central wing has an arcade of seven arches, the central one has a semicircular pediment, set on a balustraded balcony that runs the length of the main building. The seal of the Republic of the Philippines is on this pediment. The second floor as well as the flanking wings have quadrilateral windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding to the grandeur of the Mansion, and this shows its Beaux Arts sensibilities, is the garden setting of the house. It is deeply recessed from the road and approached through the main gate by a short straight road that runs north west and connects to a large rotunda or round about. From this rotunda, two roads veer eastward and westward to auxiliary buildings discretely hidden by trees and foliage. The main entrance to the Mansion is at the southeast end of the rotunda. Visitors do not generally get inside the house, so the Mansion is seen through the elaborate grille work of the triple gated main entrance, which frames the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across from Mansion House is a garden called <strong><em>Wright Park</em></strong>. This park has a long but shallow reflecting pool. The park is separated physically from the Mansion by Romulo Drive, but aesthetically it forms one composition with the Mansion, whose silhouette is reflected on the surface of the pool. Either side of the pool is flanked by Benguet pines (<em>Pinus kesiya</em>; older name<em>Pinus insularis</em>) and formally planted gardens. There is a stone amphitheater in Wright Park, at the end of Lake Drive. Since this garden, like the Mansion, is located on high ground, a flight of stairs at the southwestern end leads to the lower area and to Leonard Wood Rd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sandwiched between South Drive and Leonard Wood Road is the <strong><em>Baguio Teachers Camp</em></strong>. Previously called by the locals as &ldquo;O-ring-ao,&rdquo; Teachers Camp was founded in 1908 under the administration of Benguet Gov William F. Pack and Education Secretary Morgan W. Shuster as a vacation or retreat place of teachers. It was operated by the Bureau of Education, and later became the venue of yearly summer camps. In Apr 1908, the assembly of American school teachers in the Philippines was held there using only tents complete with beds, tables, chairs, and wash stands. One of the first structures to rise in this camp was a mess hall which was already functional in 1912. By 1928, there were already 34 permanent structures inside the camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not far from Teachers Camp is a place called <strong><em>Topside</em></strong>, a gift of the city of Baguio to Gov-Gen William Cameron Forbes for his efforts in developing the city. His residence at Topside was constructed and finished in 1908. It became Forbes&rsquo; headquarters during World War II but was damaged during liberation. The ruins of this edifice is now the house of prayer of the Good Shepherd Convent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Americans established a country club in the city in 1905. Founded by Gov-Gen Forbes, its grass-thatched, wooden slab clubhouse was inaugurated in 1906. By the time it opened, the country club had a three-hole golf course and croquet course. A permanent clubhouse was completed in 1908, together with the construction of cottages. <strong><em>The Baguio Country Club</em></strong> was the center of the city&rsquo;s American residents but opened its doors to Filipino members in 1910. It became the Japanese Officers&rsquo; Club from 1942 to 1944, and the headquarters of the 33rd Division United States Armed Forces in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio Country Club once shared an 18-hole golf course with its neighbor, <strong><em>Camp John Hay</em></strong>, a US military reservation of about 216 ha. This camp traces its roots to 1903, when US President Theodore Roosevelt signed General Order No 48 creating it as an army post in Baguio. The camp had an officers&rsquo;s mess and barracks for enlisted men. The summer residence for the commanding general was constructed in 1907, overlooking an open-air auditorium called Bell Amphitheater which was built in 1913. It remained under the hands of the Americans for decades, but the property was turned over to the Philippine government in 1991. The camp was privatized and placed under the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the former buildings, like the barracks for enlisted men, were restored and reused as long-term rent-out residences. Others were torn down to make way for new development. Camp John Hay is presently one of Baguio&rsquo;s tourist destinations with hotels, restaurants, shops, and convention center. It has also developed as a place for those engaged in e-business, call centers, and back of house operations that serve an international market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers Camp, the Baguio Country Club, and Camp John Hay all used the stick-style of architecture, a term used for a 19th-century architectural style that emerged in the US. It is characterized by the use of strips of wood overlayed on the outside wall to mimic an exposed half-timbered frame. Sometimes the strips crossed diagonally and looked like Tudor dwellings. This style was used in Pines Hotel, but the rectangular overlay was far more common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typical Camp John Hay dwelling was almost entirely made of wood, from the posts to the roof structure. The whole house used a post and lintel framework, with wooden posts anchored to a cement base. To secure the connection between cement and wood, iron braces embedded in cement supported the lower part of the post and bolts joined the post with the braces. The house was covered by corrugated galvanized iron sheets covering a hip or pitched roof with wide overhangs. It was raised above the damp and cold earth by about a meter. The walls were of tongue and groove planks, usually laid out horizontally. The windows used glass in a wooden frame, and the floor was wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To protect the interior from dampness, asphalt paper was sandwiched between the outside wall and the wall within. The area for the kitchen and toilet, where there were faucets and sinks, were either covered with tiles or with flat galvanized iron sheets. The walls were painted white. The roof, windows, and door frames were painted a dark green. These stick house style dwellings in Baguio blended well with the environment; the green paint is reminiscent of Baguio&rsquo;s pine trees, and the white paint, of the fog that blankets Baguio when the temperature drops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio was both the seat of national and municipal or local power. The southern sector of Baguio, beginning at Luneta Hill and its environs and leading all the way to Mansion House, was set aside for the national government. Baguio&rsquo;s seat of municipal power was located facing <strong><em>Burnham Park</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The centerpiece of the Burnham Plan of Baguio is the 16-hectare park eventually named in Burnham&rsquo;s honor. Once the site of an Ibaloy village, Burnham designated the low-lying area as an open public space. He chose it for its scenic potential, hemmed as it was by hills. Built from 1904 to the 1910s, the park&rsquo;s construction employed many workers using manual tools and manually operated tram cars to move the soil. The water used for its man-made lagoon (later Burnham Lake) was tapped from the Minak creek. It used to have two small ponds at each end, and a race track with a 50-feet-wide race course. Inaugurated in 1914, the race track was removed by Mayor Halsema in the 1920s. In its place, Halsema had built a fountain in the middle of the lagoon and a nine-hole public golf course. At present, it has an Igorot Park, picnic areas, skating rink, rose garden, an athletic bowl, and a grandstand named after the founder of the Lions Club, Melvin Jones. It became a refuge for victims of the powerful Luzon earthquake of 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built on a hill to the northwest of Burnham Park, the first <strong><em>Baguio City Hall</em></strong> was constructed beginning in 1909 and completed in 1910, during the term of the city&rsquo;s first mayor, E.W. Reynold. Its construction coincided with Baguio&rsquo;s elevation as a chartered city in 1909. This first building was set on a terraced hill divided into three levels and approached by cement steps with landings at each level. This same configuration still exists today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the 1909 building, the stick-style of architecture was chosen but the thin wood planks were laid out following the lines of Tudor timber architecture. The city hall might then be described as Tudor-style. The choice of the stick-style was an aesthetic and clever way to disguise the materials used, which was wood and galvanized iron sheet. Wood was used for support and framing, galvanized iron for the roof and external walls. These were held in place by wood planks. In true Tudor-style, the iron sheets and the planks were painted a contrasting color. The planks were of a dark shade, most likely black or dark brown while the sheets were white. This first building was two stories high, with a pitched roof with wide overhangs bordered by rain gutters and downspouts at the corner designed to look like thin supports of the roof. Chimneys for fire places pierced the galvanized iron roof at either end of the longitudinal building. The building had eleven bays defined by the external timbering. The three central bays projected outward and were capped by a triangular pediment. In front of this central section was a balcony. The windows of the building were quadrilateral and the lower windows of the flanking bays as well as the windows at the second floor of the central section had <strong>media aguas</strong> (awnings). A covered corridor connected city hall to an auxiliary one-story building also in the same style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1941, the Japanese flag was hoisted at the city hall signaling Japanese occupation of the city. The building was destroyed in 1945. It was reconstructed in concrete from 1949 to 1950, when it was inaugurated by then-President Elpidio Quirino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-World War II building was no longer in Tudor-style but followed the neoclassical. Like the previous building, it was divided into bays, thirteen this time as opposed to eleven, with the central three projected outwards. The two story building had quadrilateral windows and openings. The central section was built as a simplified version of the Grecian temple style, but its four pillars had no capitals. The pillars run the height of two stories, capped by a triangular pediment with dentiles. The central section was a formal entrance to the city hall, its vestibule, which led to the triple doors of the city hall. For a period of two years, from 1997 to 1999, the structure was restored. The white and green color scheme characteristic of Baguio has been restored. Its dark green roof was pierced by dormer windows and white is the dominant color of the walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answering the need to educate the children of the Americans stationed in Baguio, as well as that of the locals, educational institutions were founded in the city, starting with the <strong><em>Baguio School</em></strong> (later <strong><em>Baguio Central School</em></strong> ) in 1899. Starting with 25 students, at a different site, it was moved to the Government Center in 1914. It was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt in 1949 from war reparations fund. The school building was restored in 2005 by the Department of Education and the Heritage Conservation Society. It echoes the design of Baguio City Hall with its Grecian temple facade at the center, also consisting of three bays, but it has two flanking bays on either side, three less than those at city hall. The lower windows are arched, and only the windows on the second floor are quadrilateral. The pediment is not embellished. The Baguio Central School followed the plans of American-era school buildings, where high schools, especially in urban areas and those designated as central, were designed in greater grandeur than the more common <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon-style school</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio School was followed by the <strong><em>Easter School</em></strong> (later Easter College, Inc) in 1906. Easter School started off with eight students from Bontoc, Mountain Province trained by Rev Walter P. Clapp. With the donation from Anglican Bishop Charles Henry Brent, a schoolhouse which also functioned as a dormitory, was constructed. This building was meant for the Igorot schoolchildren. Bishop Brent originally thought of building another structure for American boys but did not push through with it since he was not inclined to mixing races. Among the first structures erected at Easter School were the mission residence, church, weaving room, girls&rsquo;s dormitory, and a print shop. These buildings were already existing by the 1920s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1909, Bishop Brent founded the Baguio School for boys, which was later renamed after him in 1923. It served the educational needs of the children of the Anglican missionaries, soldiers, English merchants, and children of the Americans. The school became coeducational in 1925, with the opening of the girls&rsquo;s dormitory. During World War II, school employees and students transferred to the Scout&rsquo;s Barracks in Camp John Hay, then to Camp Holmes. Two years after the war, the school started to accept Filipino students. It branched out of Baguio in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the buildings in the <strong><em>Brent School</em></strong> is considered as one of the oldest surviving structures in Baguio. The building was constructed in 1909, the year the school was founded. The building, which would later be called Ogilby Hall, still has its original, complete stone-based framework. Brent School followed the same style found in Camp John Hay and Teachers Camp. This stick-style painted green and white became a Baguio signature style, which was used in projects of private individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Baguio City is the educational center of the north with a number of colleges and universities located there. Among these are Saint Louis University, University of the Cordilleras, University of the Philippines-Baguio, University of Baguio, Pines City Colleges, and the Philippine Military Academy, the premier military school of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from being the educational center, Baguio is also the commercial center of the Cordilleras. This started off with the establishment of the <strong><em><strong>Baguio Market</strong></em></strong> in the 1900s. The first two buildings of the market, located at the juncture of the present-day Session Road and Magsaysay Ave, were built of wood in 1908. Traders from the lowland used to travel to Baguio on bull carts to trade in weekend markets. It usually took them two to three days to travel up the city via Kennon or Naguilian Road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stone market was then constructed in 1917 by World War I German prisoners-of-war. The market was characterized by its generous use of stones quarried from a site behind the Baguio City Hall. This quarry yielded limestone of various hews: white, cream, beige, reddish, beige or speckled and veined with colors like black and dark brown. The stones were taken from the site, which is now remembered as Quarry or City Camp. The market was a simple box structure, with wide but low semicircular arches for portals. The stone framework survived World War II and a 1970 fire, but it was demolished in the 1970s to the dismay of vendors and civil groups who were pushing for its restoration. The Maharlika Livelihood Complex now stands in its place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Session Road</em></strong>, Baguio&rsquo;s most famous street, started as a narrow lane with shops and structures lining one side. The road was widened from the 1930s, following the gold mining boom of 1933. Concrete buildings were also constructed during this time. Some of the earliest businesses to open along Session Road were photo shops, silversmiths, bakery, and stores owned by Japanese and Chinese businessmen. The Japanese store known as the Japanese Bazaar had a pharmacy, photo studio, and a vehicle for rent service. It was on Session Road that the first pedestrian overpass in Baguio was built. Built of wood in 1939 by the city&rsquo;s first Filipino Mayor Sergio Bayan, it crossed from Casa Vallejo to the Post Office. First built in 1918, the <strong><em>Baguio Post Office</em></strong>, once had a public library on its second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Session Road is home to a number of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a> which are now either gone, or have fallen into disuse. The <strong><em>Alhamar Chainus Theater</em></strong> built in memory of Chainus Guirey, the 1915 Carnival Queen, is gone. It has been replaced by a center selling pre-owned garments. The <strong><em>Plaza</em></strong> and <strong><em>Pines Theater</em></strong> are no longer operational today. Pines Theater is in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> style, as were a number of demolished buildings along Session Road. The theater was in the Streamline Moderne idiom, distinguishable by the curving line of the facade. Even the signage of Pines is in the art deco style. While no longer a functioning theater, its interior has been repurposed for offices, shops, and restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The powerful Jul 1990 earthquake destroyed a number of establishments along Session Road and the roads connecting to it. Destroyed were the Nevada and FRB Hotels, Skyworld Condominium, and Amapola Restaurant. The nearby Park Hotel on Harrison Road also fell to the ground. The Hyatt Terraces Hotel on South Road also crumbled, killing a number of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio is also a religious center. This was deliberately planned by the American colonial government. To encourage residents and relocators to Baguio, the government set out on an active campaign to lure church groups to Baguio. In May 1905, a public auction of government lands where church groups, schools, and businesses were invited was held. From this auction church groups acquired large tracks of lands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most photographed landmarks in Baguio is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a> <strong><em>Cathedral of Our Lady of the Atonement</em></strong>. The parish started in 1907, when the first three Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (CICM) missionaries or Belgian Fathers arrived in Baguio. The first site of the CICM Mission was the house of a retired treasurer on Session Road. They dedicated this converted house to St Patrick, with Fr Serafin Devesse as the first rector. Fr Devesse remodeled the house into a chapel and convent in 1908. Fr Devesse started a school for boys there, which would be the forerunner of St Louis University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the congregation grew, the need for a larger church became apparent. Construction of the larger church at the nearby hill, called Kampo by the Ibaloy, was completed in 1924 but without the spire-capped towers, which were added the following years. Baguio became the seat of the apostolic prefecture of the Mountain Province in 1932, then elevated to Apostolic Vicariate in 1946. In 1992, the apostolic vicariates of Bontoc-Lagawe and Tabuk were separated from Baguio. Baguio became a diocese in 2004, under Vigan, which is its metropolitan. The parish church came to be known as a cathedral when it had its resident bishop in 1935, three years after being designated an apostolic prefecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral survived the bombings of World War II but suffered damage. It was restored after the war. Following the earthquake on 16 Jul 1990, conservation work was done on the cathedral. The foundations of the right tower were filled out with cement to stabilize the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral is inspired by the neo-Gothic style. Particularly neo-Gothic are its height and proportions, as well as the use of rose windows and stained glass. However, it uses the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Romanesque</a> arches for doors, windows, and as decorative embellishments on the facade and the collateral chapels. It is a cruciform church with an arcade separating the nave from the aisle. The ceiling is a barrel vault of Roman arches, divided by segments corresponding to the pillars of the arcade. Above the transept ends are galleries; one on the Epistle side has a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/820\">pipe organ</a>. The elevated choir loft over the vestibule is spacious to allow more churchgoers into the church. The apse is semicircular ending in a wall of stained glass inside narrow Roman arches and occuli above the arches. The apse is decorated with a low hardwood panel, carved with images of saints. Set against the backwall of the apse, it is inspired by altar pieces of the Gothic era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has stained-glass rose windows, flanked by occuli at the facade and four rose windows above a set of three Roman arches at the sides. The arches and windows covered by stained glass correspond to the transept end and the collateral chapels. To complete the use of the neo-Gothic, the church&rsquo;s bell towers flanking the facade are covered by spires surmounted by a cross, and decorative finials embellish the ends of pillars that rise to the level of the roof. The Baguio cathedral has always been a standout in the downtown area because of its elevation and its pink, gray, and red paint, which it has sported since the 1950s&mdash;a sharp contrast to the heritage green and white color of pre-World War II structures in Baguio. A columbarium was built beneath the apse of the cathedral and behind the apse is a small chapel in similar style to the cathedral. It was built recently for Latin Masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the CICM Missionaries, other religious congregations also established their respective houses in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dominicans built a monastery-cum-retreat house on a hilltop which would later to be known as <strong><em>Dominican Hill</em>.</strong> The building was constructed from 1913 to 1915 in a 17-hectare property bought by the Dominicans from the American authorities. The now-hundred-year old edifice was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2697\">Fr Roque Rua&ntilde;o, OP</a>, the architect of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/394\">University of Santo Tomas Main Building</a> in Sampaloc, Manila, which was completed in 1928. In 1915, a school was opened and was named Colegio del Santisimo Rosario. However, it closed after two years due to low number of enrollees. The Dominican Monastery was the most expansive stone structure in the city before 1920. The building, the first with rain harvesting facility, suffered damage during World War II and was rehabilitated from 1947 to 1948. In 1973, it was sold to Diplomat Hotels Inc which converted it to a 33-bedroom hotel, which ceased operations in 1987. The city government of Baguio bought the property in 2005, which is now called Heritage and Nature Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rua&ntilde;o designed the Dominican Monastery in the manner of a medieval castle. The building is built around two atriums with a central wing, dividing the site into two segments composed of four wings that enclose the perimeter of the building. It has two inner gardens with fountains. The facade of the building bears the Dominican seal, with the rosary garlanded around it, and above the arched center is the Dominican cross. This central section, like the flanking bays, projects outwards and a porte cochere has been built in front of the central section. The facade has 17 bays&mdash;3 for the central and 7 flanking it on either side. The lower floor has arched windows and is rusticated. The upper floor has quadrilateral windows and a smooth wall. At the roof level is a flat walkway with a decorative parapet around it. Visually separating the roof line from the floor below it is a frieze of dentils. The sides and back of this atrial-designed building is embellished in the same manner as the front by a pattern of arched windows below and quadrilateral windows above. Although it is in ruins, losing much of its woodwork and roof to the elements and unscrupulous scavengers, the interior hints at its now faded elegance. An arcade reminiscent of monastic buildings runs around the perimeter and opens to the gardens. At the central section are the remains of a once elegant semicircular staircase that led to the upper floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North of the Dominican monastery is the Jesuit property located on top of Mirador Hill. The area was named <strong><em>El Mirador</em></strong> in 1876 by the then-<em>gobernador politico-militar&nbsp;</em>of Baguio, Don Manuel Scheidnagel, since it offers a commanding view of the Lingayen Gulf, La Union, and the West Philippine Sea. Jesuit priest Miguel Roces suggested in 1890 that the property be bought to serve as a sanitarium for Jesuits, but this did not materalize until 1906 when they were able to buy the property in a public auction. Six years earlier, the Jesuits were able to set up meteorological and seismic station at Mirador Hill. In 1907, a three-bedroom house was built at the bottom of the hill. It was made of wood and had a cogon roof. It was the first of three houses built at Mirador Hill. The following year, a sturdier house made of stone and mortar was built, together with the road leading to the summit.&nbsp;The Jesuits used this as a summer residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous <strong><em>Lourdes Grotto</em></strong> was constructed in 1913, while the stairway connecting it from the foot of the hill was completed in 1918. It was the project of Fr Jose Algue, SJ, director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/336\">Manila Observatory</a> in Baguio. The original image of the Our Lady of Lourdes is made of polychromed&nbsp;<em>balayong&nbsp;</em>wood, carved and signed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> in Manila in 1913. During World War II, Mirador Hill was abandoned by the Jesuits when Japanese forces occupied it. It was destroyed during World War II and was rebuilt in 1951, following the plans of MIT graduate and architect Gines Rivera. He opted not to rebuild over the site of the prewar building, which was on the summit of the hill, but around it. He opted against using stone because it gets damp and cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new building was a wood and galvanized iron structure consisting of three parallel wings connected by a corridor. The north wing was the Manila Observatory and the remaining wings were the villa or vacation house. The reconstructed Jesuit residence, presently called <strong><em>Mirador Jesuit Villa</em></strong> was constructed of wood in the stick-style of American colonial architecture similar to the houses at Teachers Camp and Camp John Hay. The Manila Observatory transferred its operations to Mirador Hill in 1952, but transferred again to the Ateneo Campus in Quezon City after 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another group that set foot in Baguio and proselytized its people is the Protestant Church founded with the assistance of American missionary Rev Howard Widdoes. Founded by Maximino Nebres and Pastor Juan Abuan Nebres in 1911, the <strong><em>United Brethren Church</em></strong> (later <strong><em>United Evangelical Church</em></strong>) is one of the first Protestant churches in Northern Luzon. The church became part of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) in 1948 and was renamed UCCP Baguio two years after. The church became a refuge for the locals during World War II. UCCP church at the base of the hill of the Baguio City Hall still stands. It is a simple structure that combines neoromanesque and neogothic elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional Cordillera architecture can also be found in the city. The <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3791\"><strong>Tam-awan Village</strong></a></strong></em></strong> in Pinsao Proper is a living museum of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> traditional houses. In the late 1990s, the Chanum Foundation, Inc started reconstructing the houses to make them more accessible to the public. A total of seven Ifugao and two Kalinga houses were reconstructed on a property that resembled a Cordillera village. Tam-awan, a local word for vantage point, has one of three remaining <strong>binayon</strong> octagonal houses of southern Kalinga. Except for one which serves as an art gallery, all of the houses are open to lodgers. The houses are named after the places where they came from like Bangaan, Anaba, Batad, Dukligan, Kinakin, and Nagor in Ifugao, and Luccong and Bugnay in Kalinga. Tam-awan is a venue for art exhibits, workshops, and cultural performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, the NHCP has recognized a number of Baguio sites and structures. The Mansion was declared a National Historical Landmark in 2009, while the US Embassy Residence in Baguio, the former summer residence of the US High Commissioner of the Philippines, was marked by the same agency in 2005. Completed in 1940, this is where Gen Tomoyuki Yamashita and Vice Admiral Denhici Okochi formally surrendered to the US Forces. The NHCP likewise marked the city hall in 2009, Brent School in 2011, UCCP Baguio in 2012, and Dominican house in 2014. It earlier marked Teachers Camp in 1968. <strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Edgar Allan M.

At the end of the 19th century, Spanish explorers accompanied by Augustinian friars from Ilocos, went up the Naguilian trail and found a fertile valley. The Spaniards named the valley La Trinidad, after the Holy Trinity, and built a chapel in which an image of Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de Covadonga was enshrined. La Trinidad was the first colonial settlement in the Cordilleras. Eventually, the parish of San Jose was built, but the friars had little success in converting the local population. It was only later, when <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> migrants from the lowlands migrated to the valley in search of livelihood, that Catholicism took its root in La Trinidad."

Coming upon Baguio, set at 1,504 m in altitude, the Americans decided to develop it as a hill station, similar to the British hill stations in India, like Simla. They planned a sanatorium and summer retreat for American colonials. In 1903, the Philippine Commission designated Baguio as the &#x201C;Summer Capital&#x201D; of the Philippines."

It was later renamed Kennon Road after Col Lyman Kennon, a United States (US) Army engineer who supervised the construction of the road from 1903 to 1905. The renaming of Kennon Road recognized the achievement of Col Kennon, who had solved the problem of how to expedite the construction of the road so that by 1905 the road could be opened to traffic. Kennon&#x2019;s solution was to build a trail, wide enough to be used by horses to haul supplies to seven camps, and from the camps, teams of workers would work simultaneously in cutting through the mountains, widening the road so that supply vehicles could pass through. The original road was a Macadam Telford-type, later improved as an all-weather asphalt road and much later replaced in some sections with concrete."

It was constructed from 1907 to 1908. With an initial appropriated budget of $15,000, government architect William E. Parsons was asked to design the house. More than a hundred prisoners from the Bilibid penitentiary, whose sentences were commuted, worked on its paths, terraces, and paddocks. The garden was supervised by a professional nursery man from Scotland and Japanese gardeners. In 1935, the residence was expanded, probably to coincide with its turn over to the Philippine Commonwealth, established in July that year. The house became the summer residence of the Philippine President, Manuel Quezon."

Wood was used for support and framing, galvanized iron for the roof and external walls. These were held in place by wood planks. In true Tudor-style, the iron sheets and the planks were painted a contrasting color. The planks were of a dark shade, most likely black or dark brown while the sheets were white.

		"text": "<p><strong><em>Binondo</em></strong> is located north of the Pasig and across <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/364\">Puente de Espa&ntilde;a</a>. The Binondo heritage area is found between Ongpin Street to the south and Divisoria to the north. Divisoria separates Binondo from Tondo, and was a wide street originally cut to serve as a firebreak between the two pueblos of Binondo and Tondo. Technically, Escolta, located south of Ongpin St, belongs to Binondo, but Escolta, is here treated in a separate article (See&nbsp;<strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\"><strong>Escolta Heritage Area</strong></a></em></strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Binondo developed as a separate enclave for Chinese Catholics and eventually for their <em>mestizo</em> descendants. In order to control the&nbsp;<em>sangleyes&nbsp;</em>or Chinese traders, the Spaniards segregated them from the rest of the population just as they had done with the Jews in Spain. They established a separate ghetto outside of Manila called the Parian where the sangleyes could reside and conduct their trade. But Gov-Gen Luis Dasmarinas (1593-96) wanted to lessen the colony&rsquo;s dependence on the non-Catholic sangleyes. This led him to acquire the rights to the encomienda of Binondo or Binondok, awarded by Legazpi to Antonio de Velada, in Mar 1594. He then donated the land to the Dominicans for a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospital</a>, and a mission for Christianized sangleyes. Those who converted were allowed to move to Binondo and were granted greater physical and social mobility. As early as 1594, the Dominicans began ministering at Binondo, at a church dedicated to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario (later renamed Basilica Minore de San Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The different styles of architecture found in Binondo reflect the district&rsquo;s vibrant past. The district&rsquo;s oldest structure, the Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario (Binondo Church), was built in 1594 of wood and thatch. It embodied Spain&rsquo;s primary motivations in coming to Asia; which were to convert Asians into the Catholic faith, as well as enter into trade with them for goods like silk and spices. By 1614, a stone church had replaced the older structure. By the 18th century, a well-built church designed by the Spanish Domingo de la Cruz Gonzalez was constructed. The church followed the typical colonial plan consisting of a central vertical section between lateral towers, capped with a trapezoidal pediment over which was a small vaulted niche. Its octagonal windows were small and twin columns embellished the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church was destroyed by bombardment during the British occupation in 1762 and was left in ruins. It was rebuilt in 1862 but destroyed again by the earthquake of 1863. In 1945, the church suffered massive destruction during the Battle of Manila, with only its facade, nave walls, and bell tower left standing. In the 1950s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">reconstruction</a> of the church began, and work on it went on and off until 1984. In the postwar reconstruction, a new and higher roof structure was built, the remaining walls and bell tower were reinforced and repaired. A curious feature of the facade is a short wing that juts out to the left of the nave and behind the facade. It appears in early 20th century photographs and may have been a connecting wing to the Dominican convalescent home, which in the 19th century was converted to Fabrica de Puros, a cigar factory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present facade is divided into three vertical sections and two horizontal sections capped by a triangular pediment ornamented with balustrades. The balustrade disappeared with the post-World War II reconstruction. The central section, where the portal is, is wider than the two sides. The facade is flanked by quadrilateral towers that reach to the base of the pediment. The whole front section is decorated with niches. Even the pediment has a niche. To the right of the facade is a five-story bell tower, whose upper four octagonal stories rest on a quadrilateral base. Each story is of diminishing dimensions, making the bell tower look like a pagoda. Earlier engravings show that the bell tower had an octagonal pointed roof that soared like a spire, but by the early 20th century this roof had been replaced by a dome, as seen in the present church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the church, other major religious structures were built in Binondo during this period, like the Hospital de San Gabriel at the site now occupied by Plaza Cervantes and the Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Purificacion in Baybay (San Nicolas today). But this church was abandoned when the residents of San Nicolas were placed under Binondo. At first, most of these structures were constructed from bamboo and grass. But the Spaniards wanted durable structures that signified the importance of their mission. So they introduced stronger construction materials, based on technology from Spain and Mexico, such as lime concrete/mortar, stone, as well as clay bricks and tiles. More durable building materials could be sourced locally such as native hardwoods and adobe or local volcanic tuff. Clay <strong>ladrillo y tejas</strong> (bricks and tiles) could be fired locally, sometimes at the very site of a building project.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there is as yet no evidence that the Chinese built structures such as houses and temples in the Philippines before the arrival of the Spaniards, it is generally assumed that they passed on their knowledge of construction to their mestizo descendants. Those who became <strong>maestros de obra</strong> (master builders) introduced the post-and-beam type of construction that was common in China. This type of construction resulted in structures that were low, wide, and close to the ground. If there was a need to build something vertical, the builders would stack several layers rather than build a single straight structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of construction is evident in the bell tower of Binondo Church. This post-and-beam type of construction was also used for the framework of the roof in order to better support the weight of the clay tiles. This, in turn, resulted in <strong>rooflines</strong> with flaring corners similar to those found in Chinese temples. Furthermore, early friar and missionary chronicles record the crucial role played by the Chinese in construction. Augustinians and Jesuits employed Chinese as master carpenters, masons, and artisans; some they even taught to paint and sculpt religious images in the Spanish tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the 17th and 18th century, trading and hacienda agriculture were the main economic activities in the country. It led to the rise of a new economic class of Chinese merchant traders and Filipino professionals. As a status symbol, the newly rich class built two-story homes known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) that appropriated the materials and technology used for the building churches and convents. Aside from being expensive, these houses were distinguished from their less wealthy neighbors by their use of intricate ornamentation such as carved transoms and elaborately carved doors and furniture. The love for ornamentation could be considered another influence of Chinese architecture, whose structures are often distinguished by their heavy use of ornamentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But more than providing shelter, these houses were also a place of economic activity for the sangley merchants. In many cases, the ground floor of the house would be a place of enterprise such as a retail shop or workshop for the owner. These led to the development of shop houses that are still evident in Binondo today. Another feature of the house was the <strong>entresuelo</strong>, literally &ldquo;the space in between floors&rdquo; or mezzanine. These were originally designed to be the servant&rsquo;s quarters, but were later converted by some sangley merchants into home offices. If the owners did not use them as offices, they were converted into private rooms that were rented out to boarders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 19th century some of the bahay na bato began featuring overhanging balconies. These found favor with the pedestrians as the overhangs provided shelter from the sun and the rain. When more shop houses began featuring this architectural feature, it became possible to walk the entire length of a street and be protected from the elements. Protection from the elements was greatly enhanced with the installment of the <strong>toldas</strong> (awnings), usually in cloth, although some awnings would be more permanent, using metal and wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until the 1750s, trade between the Chinese and the Spaniards were carried mainly on board the Chinese junks, docked along the Pasig or near Intramuros. It was decided that a place was needed on land where the locals and Chinese traders could meet and conduct business. It would also be a place where the goods brought by the Chinese could be inspected and assessed for custom duties. The Spaniards also designed the structures to keep the resident and the transient Chinese apart. The reason for this has less to do with religion and more to do with internal security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1752, a site was selected across the Pasig River and construction began on what would later be called the <strong><em>Alcaiceria de San Fernando</em></strong> or the silk market of San Fernando. Designed by a Fray Lucas de Jesus Maria, it was a two-story octagonal-shaped structure with an inner courtyard. The lower floors were designated for shops while the upper floors were for residential use. Traces of the Alcaiceria are still evident in the lot and layout of the Pedro Guevarra School on San Fernando St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 18th century introduced dynastic change in Europe. The Hapsburg dynasty was replaced by the Bourbon, who prided themselves as being enlightened rulers. This extensive royal line had monarchs and nobles ruling in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy and elsewhere, becoming the ruling family of most of Western Europe. True to the spirit of the Enlightenment, which first saw light in France and spread throughout Europe, the economic and political policies of the Bourbons were modernizing. Wanting to free the Philippines from its dependence on the galleon trade, the government fostered the development of large-scale agriculture of cash crops to be traded in the international market. Supporting the work of government was the Real Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais, which was composed of entrepreneurs and others from the private sector, who pushed for economic reforms in the Philippines. By 1781, the colony&rsquo;s economy would change with the introduction of tobacco as a cash crop and the monopoly on its sales, development, and export, as a way to boost government revenue. But a place was needed for the manufacture of cigars as well as for their storage. This was solved when the Dominican friars donated their convalescence house next to Binondo Church to the monopoly. The factory that was built there would later be referred to as the Fabrica de Puros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As economic activity grew in Binondo, it became the commercial hub not only for Manila but the entire colony. But with the town&rsquo;s emergence as a business center arose new needs as well. First was the need for storage space for both raw material and finished goods. This led to the introduction of warehouses known as <strong>camarines</strong>, <strong>bodegas</strong>, or <strong>almacenes</strong>. Because they needed to be strong and sturdy, these were usually built of stone or brick. Depending on the owner, they varied in size from a small shed measuring five by eight feet to one that approximated a two-story house of that time. They are distinguished from other structures by a plain facade, sufficient number of grilled windows, and lack of ornamentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another need that emerged during this period was housing for the large number of migrant workers and their families that came to work in Binondo. This resulted in a new type of dwelling known as <strong>accesoria</strong>. These were one- or two-story buildings with several enclosed spaces that were rented out to separate occupants. Each accesoria consisted of a ground-floor entrance, a sala, and a spare room. Kitchen and bathroom spaces were usually shared with the other occupants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 19th century, Binondo was a thriving pueblo. While the tobacco monopoly ended in 1880, economic activity continued to grow in Binondo. More commercial and industrial structures were being erected such as the <strong><em>La Insular</em></strong> cigar factory, which was built over the site of the old Fabrica de Puros in 1884. La Insular was the business enterprise of Joaquin Santamaria, Luis Elizalde, and associates. Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2661\">Juan Jose Hervas</a> y Arizmendi, the building was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> in design. It featured the semicircular arch for windows and a balustraded parapet with finials. The structure had a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Mudejar</a> colonnade consisting of twin but thin columns rising to two floors to support a balustraded balcony on the third floor. The balustrade was broken at given intervals by plinths on which three-branched iron lamp posts with glass globes were mounted. The distance between the 11 arches of the colonnade alternated between narrow and wide arch, the central one being the widest. This added variety to the rhythm of the arches and broke the repetitiveness of arches of equal width. The arches had filigree like lattice work in the Mudejar style. La Insular became one of the district&rsquo;s most iconic landmarks until it burned down in 1944.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As disposable income rose in the late 19th century and foreign firms opened businesses in Binondo, a market for theaters, restaurants, and hotels opened. People could now afford to spend more on leisure activities. The most well-known hotel was <strong><em>Hotel de Oriente</em></strong>, also near Binondo Church. Built in 1889 it quickly acquired a reputation as the best hotel in the Philippines, and for a while the only hotel. Location was the prime asset of the hotel. In front of Plaza Calderon de la Barca (now Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz) and beside the La Insular, it was one block north of Binondo Church, near Calle Rosario, and a few blocks to the docks along the Pasig and the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a that spanned the north and south banks of the Pasig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built by Don Manuel Perez Marqueti, the father of Luis Perez Samanillo, who owned the art deco <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez Samanillo building</a> along Escolta, the hotel was designed by Juan Jose Hervas y Arizmendi, who also designed the neighboring La Insular. Hervas was known for his neoclassical design for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\">Ayuntamiento</a>. He was commissioned to plan a hotel with a budget of $100,000. Rising to three floors, the hotel had 83 rooms, stables for 25 horses, an attic, in suite toilet and bath, running water, electricity, and telephone service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entrance and the roof were tiled, while wood covered with hooked rugs were used for the upper floor. The facade was divided into seven bays, with a narrow arcade using Mudejar arches. The central arch, corresponding to the entrance rose to the top of the third floor, while flanking arches rose to the top of the entresuelo or second floor. To adapt to the humid and warm tropical weather, the windows were tall and wide and had <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows) beneath them. For security reasons, these ventanillas were protected by iron grilles. The rooms were furnished with hardwood furniture with rattan&nbsp;<em>solihiya&nbsp;</em>(caning), well adapted to the tropics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered plush for its day, Americans arriving in 1899 flocked to the Hotel. Its facade had a pleasing view of Plaza Calderon, which had manicured lawns and two cast iron fountains on either end. It opened to the vista of the Estero de la Reina and the San Fernando Bridge, which spanned it and connected Binondo with neighboring San Nicolas. Its cuisine was likewise famous; its menu was international. With its regular menus of French cuisine, it also served Spanish and Mexican dishes. Its curry was well known and favorably compared to the best of Bombay and Calcutta. It also served large prawns, Bombay duck, fried breadfruit, and grated coconut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the owner Don Manuel Perez Marqueti passed away, his widow sold the hotel in 1899 for $160,000. An Australian Walter Fitton bought it in 1900 for $350,000 and then sold it to Sellner&rsquo;s Manila Investment Co. Sellner&rsquo;s leased it to Ah Gong, a Chinese food and wine distributor, restaurateur, and food purveyor, who run a large store on Calle Echague. Under Ah Gong, the hotel&rsquo;s services took a down turn. The Philippine Commission assigned architect Edgar Bourne in 1903 to look into the purchase of the hotel for $675,000 because it was the only well-appointed hotel of sufficient size that could entice tourists. But seeing the limitations of the Oriente, the Commission instead started planning for a bigger hotel along the scenic Manila Bay, which was to be known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, inaugurated on 4 Jul 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government policies were also a factor in shaping architecture in Binondo. In an effort to reduce traffic accidents as well as create space for loading and unloading, an ordinance was enacted in 1869 that buildings located on corners had to have a <strong>chaflan</strong> (beveled or chamfered corner). This resulted in the creation of <strong>plazaletas</strong> or little eight-sided open spaces at every street corner. The closing decades of the 19th century were also the period when the Philippine-Chinese community began campaigning for the opening of a Chinese consulate in Manila. This was the community&rsquo;s reaction to what they felt was discriminatory and exploitative practices of the local Spanish authorities. Their effort succeeded in 1898 when the consulate was finally allowed to open. With the consulate&rsquo;s help, the local Chinese community succeeded in setting up the first local Chinese school, the Anglo-Chinese School or Tiong Se Academy. They also helped set up the community&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>, hospital, and temple. The temple known as <strong><em>Chong Hok Tong</em></strong> is notable, as it was the first structure to be built in the traditional Chinese style locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the arrival of the Americans in 1898, Binondo remained the economic hub of the colony. Aside from trading and manufacturing, financial institutions such as banks, underwriters, and insurance companies began opening offices in Binondo making it a financial center as well. By the end of the 19th century, Escolta, which was a farm for horse fodder, was already developing as a business district with the opening of the Philippines to world trade during the mid-century. It developed even more as American and European companies set up shop in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As business flourished, businessmen adopted to the changes by using architectural design to convey their image as modern and open to new ideas. They were able to do this with the introduction of new building techniques and materials such as the Kahn system of concrete reinforcement.&nbsp;A good example of this is Don Antonio Melian&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/294\"><strong><em>El Hogar</em></strong></a>. Built in 1914, this Beaux-Arts style building broke the height barrier by being taller than two stories and conveyed modernity by using concrete as a building material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the local Chinese community, the main economic activity shifted from manufacturing and hacienda agriculture to distribution. One of the more successful figures in this field was Mariano Uy Chaco and his son Uy Vet. Their company headquarter, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/359\"><strong><em>Uy Chaco Building</em></strong></a>, was the grandest and tallest building of its time.&nbsp;Built in 1914, the six-story building was designed by American architect, Samuel Rowell. Like El Hogar it was also made of concrete, but it conveyed its modernity through an art nouveau motif instead. With its location near Jones Bridge it was a gateway landmark into the district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction activity continued unabated between the 1920s to the early 1940s. Companies tried to stand out from each by trying to build structures with the most distinctive architectural styles. Architects such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna De San Pedro</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a> were commissioned to design these buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, Binondo emerged heavily damaged. During the reconstruction period, new construction methods and materials were introduced such as reinforced concrete, steel, and glass. Unlike the buildings before the war, the newer structures were characterized by the use of cubic form and geometric shapes and the absence of ornamentation. Aside from the challenges of reconstruction, Binondo now faced competition from other newly opened business districts such as the Ayala Center in Makati. But there were still businessmen who were willing to place their confidence in Binondo such as George Ty. When he started the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company in 1962, he chose Binondo as the site of the first branch. It was located in the most modern building in Binondo at that time, the <strong><em>Wellington Building</em></strong>. Built on the site of the Insular Cigar Factory, the building is distinctive for its use of the International Style as indicated by its facade that is made up of <strong>brise-soleil</strong> (sunbreaker). At that time the design of the building was considered cutting-edge, and the style was copied by other buildings in the area,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the population of Binondo grew in the postwar years, so did the demand for housing. But as Binondo&rsquo;s land prices soared, developers and builders began to update the accesoria by building apartments four to seven stories high. Unlike the accesorias during the Spanish era, these apartments had their own separate bathroom and kitchen facilities. Elevators were now installed to assist the residents living on the higher floor. A prime example of this type of building would be the <strong><em>Ligaya Building</em></strong> on Alvarado St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were attempts in the postwar years to emphasize Binondo&rsquo;s Chinese heritage through architecture. The most visible evidence of these are the five friendship arches around the district that are built in the traditional Chinese style. Other structures that help define Binondo&rsquo;s ethnicity include the Chinese Buddhist temples such as the <strong><em>Seng Guan</em></strong> temple on Narra Street as well as family ancestral halls such as the <strong><em>Kim Siu Ching Foundation</em></strong> on Santo Cristo St. There are also a number of commercial and residential structures that have used some Chinese architectural design elements, such as the pagoda-style roof of the <strong><em>Imperial Sky Garden</em></strong> on Ongpin St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the 1980s and 1990s, it was evident that Binondo was no longer Manila&rsquo;s main business center. Even so, it still had an active business community and some of the city&rsquo;s highest real estate prices. This convinced some developers that there was still a market for office spaces. Among those built during this time were the Tytanna Plaza on Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz and the State Investment Center on Juan Luna St. It was also in this period that the tallest structure in Binondo was built, which is the 33-story postmodern inspired <strong><em>World Trade Center</em></strong> designed by American architect Michael Graves. Developers also began to build taller structures for housing leading to introduction of condominiums such as the <strong><em>Numancia Residences</em></strong> at Numancia Street and Binondo Terrace on Alvarado St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The neighboring district of San Nicolas, where the Dominicans established a church in the 16th century which was eventually absorbed by Binondo, was also experiencing redevelopment. Spanned by the <strong><em>Puente de San Fernando</em></strong>, which crossed the Estero de Binondo and connected with San Fernando Street, this district was spared the destruction of World War II . A good number of turn-of-the-19th-century and early-20th-century bahay na bato escaped destruction. These were typical of the Spanish-era shophouses where the ground floor was for shops and the upper floor for dwellings. Whatever houses survived the war are now being torn down and replaced by high rises as the area redevelops and real estate prices rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2000s two trends have emerged. First, developers are building taller and taller structures. Although Binondo does not have the highest land prices in the metropolitan area, it is still expensive due to land shortage. So developers have no choice but to build upward. Even warehouses are now being built as multistory buildings rather than as low and wide structures. This is to accommodate the growing need of traders from mainland China for storage space, equipped with freight elevators, back-up generators, and close circuit TV for security. Second, the newer structures under construction are residential rather than commercial. In fact, no new office buildings are being built and some of the office buildings from the 1960s and 1970s are now being demolished to give way to new condominiums. This is also a response to the growing number of mainland Chinese traders that want to reside in Binondo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architectural heritage of Binondo is seriously under threat.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Anson Yu, with additional notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

				"value": "<strong><em>Binondo</em></strong> is located north of the Pasig and across <a href=\"/2/8/364\">Puente de Espa&#xF1;a</a>. The Binondo heritage area is found between Ongpin Street to the south and Divisoria to the north. Divisoria separates Binondo from Tondo, and was a wide street originally cut to serve as a firebreak between the two pueblos of Binondo and Tondo. Technically, Escolta, located south of Ongpin St, belongs to Binondo, but Escolta, is here treated in a separate article (See&#xA0;<strong><em><a href=\"/2/10/419\"><strong>Escolta Heritage Area</strong></a></em></strong>)."

In order to control the&#xA0;<em>sangleyes&#xA0;</em>or Chinese traders, the Spaniards segregated them from the rest of the population just as they had done with the Jews in Spain. They established a separate ghetto outside of Manila called the Parian where the sangleyes could reside and conduct their trade. But Gov-Gen Luis Dasmarinas (1593-96) wanted to lessen the colony&#x2019;s dependence on the non-Catholic sangleyes. This led him to acquire the rights to the encomienda of Binondo or Binondok, awarded by Legazpi to Antonio de Velada, in Mar 1594. He then donated the land to the Dominicans for a <a href=\"/2/5/244\">church</a>, a <a href=\"/2/5/236\">hospital</a>, and a mission for Christianized sangleyes. Those who converted were allowed to move to Binondo and were granted greater physical and social mobility. As early as 1594, the Dominicans began ministering at Binondo, at a church dedicated to the Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora del Rosario (later renamed Basilica Minore de San Lorenzo Ruiz de Manila)."

				"value": "The different styles of architecture found in Binondo reflect the district&#x2019;s vibrant past. The district&#x2019;s oldest structure, the Church of Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora del Rosario (Binondo Church), was built in 1594 of wood and thatch. It embodied Spain&#x2019;s primary motivations in coming to Asia; which were to convert Asians into the Catholic faith, as well as enter into trade with them for goods like silk and spices. By 1614, a stone church had replaced the older structure. By the 18th century, a well-built church designed by the Spanish Domingo de la Cruz Gonzalez was constructed. The church followed the typical colonial plan consisting of a central vertical section between lateral towers, capped with a trapezoidal pediment over which was a small vaulted niche. Its octagonal windows were small and twin columns embellished the facade."

				"value": "The church was destroyed by bombardment during the British occupation in 1762 and was left in ruins. It was rebuilt in 1862 but destroyed again by the earthquake of 1863. In 1945, the church suffered massive destruction during the Battle of Manila, with only its facade, nave walls, and bell tower left standing. In the 1950s, <a href=\"/2/6/255\">reconstruction</a> of the church began, and work on it went on and off until 1984. In the postwar reconstruction, a new and higher roof structure was built, the remaining walls and bell tower were reinforced and repaired. A curious feature of the facade is a short wing that juts out to the left of the nave and behind the facade. It appears in early 20th century photographs and may have been a connecting wing to the Dominican convalescent home, which in the 19th century was converted to Fabrica de Puros, a cigar factory."

The balustrade disappeared with the post-World War II reconstruction. The central section, where the portal is, is wider than the two sides. The facade is flanked by quadrilateral towers that reach to the base of the pediment. The whole front section is decorated with niches. Even the pediment has a niche. To the right of the facade is a five-story bell tower, whose upper four octagonal stories rest on a quadrilateral base. Each story is of diminishing dimensions, making the bell tower look like a pagoda. Earlier engravings show that the bell tower had an octagonal pointed roof that soared like a spire, but by the early 20th century this roof had been replaced by a dome, as seen in the present church."

But this church was abandoned when the residents of San Nicolas were placed under Binondo. At first, most of these structures were constructed from bamboo and grass. But the Spaniards wanted durable structures that signified the importance of their mission. So they introduced stronger construction materials, based on technology from Spain and Mexico, such as lime concrete/mortar, stone, as well as clay bricks and tiles. More durable building materials could be sourced locally such as native hardwoods and adobe or local volcanic tuff. Clay <strong>ladrillo y tejas</strong> (bricks and tiles) could be fired locally, sometimes at the very site of a building project."

Those who became <strong>maestros de obra</strong> (master builders) introduced the post-and-beam type of construction that was common in China. This type of construction resulted in structures that were low, wide, and close to the ground. If there was a need to build something vertical, the builders would stack several layers rather than build a single straight structure."

This post-and-beam type of construction was also used for the framework of the roof in order to better support the weight of the clay tiles. This, in turn, resulted in <strong>rooflines</strong> with flaring corners similar to those found in Chinese temples. Furthermore, early friar and missionary chronicles record the crucial role played by the Chinese in construction. Augustinians and Jesuits employed Chinese as master carpenters, masons, and artisans; some they even taught to paint and sculpt religious images in the Spanish tradition."

It led to the rise of a new economic class of Chinese merchant traders and Filipino professionals. As a status symbol, the newly rich class built two-story homes known as <a href=\"/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) that appropriated the materials and technology used for the building churches and convents. Aside from being expensive, these houses were distinguished from their less wealthy neighbors by their use of intricate ornamentation such as carved transoms and elaborately carved doors and furniture. The love for ornamentation could be considered another influence of Chinese architecture, whose structures are often distinguished by their heavy use of ornamentation."

In many cases, the ground floor of the house would be a place of enterprise such as a retail shop or workshop for the owner. These led to the development of shop houses that are still evident in Binondo today. Another feature of the house was the <strong>entresuelo</strong>, literally &#x201C;the space in between floors&#x201D; or mezzanine. These were originally designed to be the servant&#x2019;s quarters, but were later converted by some sangley merchants into home offices.

When more shop houses began featuring this architectural feature, it became possible to walk the entire length of a street and be protected from the elements. Protection from the elements was greatly enhanced with the installment of the <strong>toldas</strong> (awnings), usually in cloth, although some awnings would be more permanent, using metal and wood."

It was decided that a place was needed on land where the locals and Chinese traders could meet and conduct business. It would also be a place where the goods brought by the Chinese could be inspected and assessed for custom duties. The Spaniards also designed the structures to keep the resident and the transient Chinese apart. The reason for this has less to do with religion and more to do with internal security."

The lower floors were designated for shops while the upper floors were for residential use. Traces of the Alcaiceria are still evident in the lot and layout of the Pedro Guevarra School on San Fernando St."

This extensive royal line had monarchs and nobles ruling in France, Portugal, Spain, Italy and elsewhere, becoming the ruling family of most of Western Europe. True to the spirit of the Enlightenment, which first saw light in France and spread throughout Europe, the economic and political policies of the Bourbons were modernizing. Wanting to free the Philippines from its dependence on the galleon trade, the government fostered the development of large-scale agriculture of cash crops to be traded in the international market. Supporting the work of government was the Real Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais, which was composed of entrepreneurs and others from the private sector, who pushed for economic reforms in the Philippines. By 1781, the colony&#x2019;s economy would change with the introduction of tobacco as a cash crop and the monopoly on its sales, development, and export, as a way to boost government revenue. But a place was needed for the manufacture of cigars as well as for their storage. This was solved when the Dominican friars donated their convalescence house next to Binondo Church to the monopoly. The factory that was built there would later be referred to as the Fabrica de Puros."

But with the town&#x2019;s emergence as a business center arose new needs as well. First was the need for storage space for both raw material and finished goods. This led to the introduction of warehouses known as <strong>camarines</strong>, <strong>bodegas</strong>, or <strong>almacenes</strong>. Because they needed to be strong and sturdy, these were usually built of stone or brick. Depending on the owner, they varied in size from a small shed measuring five by eight feet to one that approximated a two-story house of that time. They are distinguished from other structures by a plain facade, sufficient number of grilled windows, and lack of ornamentation."

This resulted in a new type of dwelling known as <strong>accesoria</strong>. These were one- or two-story buildings with several enclosed spaces that were rented out to separate occupants. Each accesoria consisted of a ground-floor entrance, a sala, and a spare room. Kitchen and bathroom spaces were usually shared with the other occupants."

More commercial and industrial structures were being erected such as the <strong><em>La Insular</em></strong> cigar factory, which was built over the site of the old Fabrica de Puros in 1884. La Insular was the business enterprise of Joaquin Santamaria, Luis Elizalde, and associates. Designed by <a href=\"/2/2/2661\">Juan Jose Hervas</a> y Arizmendi, the building was <a href=\"/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> in design. It featured the semicircular arch for windows and a balustraded parapet with finials. The structure had a <a href=\"/2/4/217\">neo-Mudejar</a> colonnade consisting of twin but thin columns rising to two floors to support a balustraded balcony on the third floor. The balustrade was broken at given intervals by plinths on which three-branched iron lamp posts with glass globes were mounted. The distance between the 11 arches of the colonnade alternated between narrow and wide arch, the central one being the widest. This added variety to the rhythm of the arches and broke the repetitiveness of arches of equal width. The arches had filigree like lattice work in the Mudejar style. La Insular became one of the district&#x2019;s most iconic landmarks until it burned down in 1944."

Built in 1889 it quickly acquired a reputation as the best hotel in the Philippines, and for a while the only hotel. Location was the prime asset of the hotel. In front of Plaza Calderon de la Barca (now Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz) and beside the La Insular, it was one block north of Binondo Church, near Calle Rosario, and a few blocks to the docks along the Pasig and the Puente de Espa&#xF1;a that spanned the north and south banks of the Pasig."

Hervas was known for his neoclassical design for the <a href=\"/2/8/266\">Ayuntamiento</a>. He was commissioned to plan a hotel with a budget of $100,000.

To adapt to the humid and warm tropical weather, the windows were tall and wide and had <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows) beneath them.

Sellner&#x2019;s leased it to Ah Gong, a Chinese food and wine distributor, restaurateur, and food purveyor, who run a large store on Calle Echague. Under Ah Gong, the hotel&#x2019;s services took a down turn. The Philippine Commission assigned architect Edgar Bourne in 1903 to look into the purchase of the hotel for $675,000 because it was the only well-appointed hotel of sufficient size that could entice tourists. But seeing the limitations of the Oriente, the Commission instead started planning for a bigger hotel along the scenic Manila Bay, which was to be known as <a href=\"/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, inaugurated on 4 Jul 1912."

In an effort to reduce traffic accidents as well as create space for loading and unloading, an ordinance was enacted in 1869 that buildings located on corners had to have a <strong>chaflan</strong> (beveled or chamfered corner). This resulted in the creation of <strong>plazaletas</strong> or little eight-sided open spaces at every street corner. The closing decades of the 19th century were also the period when the Philippine-Chinese community began campaigning for the opening of a Chinese consulate in Manila. This was the community&#x2019;s reaction to what they felt was discriminatory and exploitative practices of the local Spanish authorities. Their effort succeeded in 1898 when the consulate was finally allowed to open. With the consulate&#x2019;s help, the local Chinese community succeeded in setting up the first local Chinese school, the Anglo-Chinese School or Tiong Se Academy. They also helped set up the community&#x2019;s own <a href=\"/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>, hospital, and temple.

Aside from the challenges of reconstruction, Binondo now faced competition from other newly opened business districts such as the Ayala Center in Makati. But there were still businessmen who were willing to place their confidence in Binondo such as George Ty. When he started the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company in 1962, he chose Binondo as the site of the first branch. It was located in the most modern building in Binondo at that time, the <strong><em>Wellington Building</em></strong>. Built on the site of the Insular Cigar Factory, the building is distinctive for its use of the International Style as indicated by its facade that is made up of <strong>brise-soleil</strong> (sunbreaker).

Among those built during this time were the Tytanna Plaza on Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz and the State Investment Center on Juan Luna St. It was also in this period that the tallest structure in Binondo was built, which is the 33-story postmodern inspired <strong><em>World Trade Center</em></strong> designed by American architect Michael Graves.

A good number of turn-of-the-19th-century and early-20th-century bahay na bato escaped destruction.

Although Binondo does not have the highest land prices in the metropolitan area, it is still expensive due to land shortage. So developers have no choice but to build upward. Even warehouses are now being built as multistory buildings rather than as low and wide structures. This is to accommodate the growing need of traders from mainland China for storage space, equipped with freight elevators, back-up generators, and close circuit TV for security. Second, the newer structures under construction are residential rather than commercial. In fact, no new office buildings are being built and some of the office buildings from the 1960s and 1970s are now being demolished to give way to new condominiums. This is also a response to the growing number of mainland Chinese traders that want to reside in Binondo."

		"text": "<p>Carcar, located 40 km south of Cebu City and between the municipalities of San Fernando to the north and Sibonga to the south, was the southern terminus of the now-defunct Cebu railroad, whose railway began at Carbon Market in Cebu. Carcar is strategically located at the southeastern coast of Cebu Island, at a point where Cebu narrows and the central mountain range opens to a pass where it is possible to cross to the northwestern coast to the towns of Barili, with Dumanjug, Ronda, Alcantara, Moalboal and Badian to the south, and Aloguinsan all the way to Toledo City to the north. While there are other cross-island roads such as Cebu to Balamban, Talisay and Naga to Toledo, and Sibonga to Dumanjug, Carcar was an important crossroad before World War II because of the railroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Augustinians, who established Carcar, first established a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o Priory in Cebu at a coastal village called Sialo or Siaro on 21 Jun 1599. They dedicated the visita to La Visitacion de la Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora, at a site known as Inayangan, presently a sitio of Tuyom in Barangay Valladolid. The site is also known as Daanglungsod or &ldquo;old town.&rdquo; The ruins of the church were reportedly still identifiable some time back, but its stones have been quarried by unknown persons. Because of its coastal location the visita at Inayangan was subject to slave raiders. So the Augustinians moved it to its present location, which was then called Mowag or Kabkad, after a local fern. By 1620, Augustinian records no longer mention Sialo but instead refer to Cabcar or Carcar.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While not officially declared a Heritage Zone, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> has recognized the heritage quality of Carcar by declaring four residential structures as heritage houses. Carcar&rsquo;s heritage area can be mapped out as a cross. The main artery is defined by the Natalio B. Bacalso South National Highway that links Carcar to the neighboring municipalities. The north end of this zone is in the area of Carcar Central School and the south end the rotunda beside the public market and from which the Carcar-Barili Road originates. Crossing the highway is the upper town of Carcar, where the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/280\">Church of Santa Catalina de Alejandria</a>, the town plaza, and other heritage structure are located. Contiguous to it is the lower town defined by the roads called Gen Luna, Santa Catalina and Burgos. Most of the heritage structures are found in these three areas. Exceptions are three <strong>lantawan</strong>, <strong>bantayan</strong> or watchtowers at Bantayan, Bas, Bacsiji and the church ruins at Daanglungsod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Upper Town</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Church of Santa Catalina de Alejandria</em></strong> was built on 1860 under Fr Antonio Manglano, OSA, and completed in 1875 by Fr Manuel Fernandez, OSA. The church design uses various <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> styles in a pleasing combination of forms. Roman arches allude to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> architecture while the recessed entrance is reminiscent of the <strong>iwan</strong> or main entrance in Muslim mosques. This design element, the minaret-type dome and the pointed windows point to a revival of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Mudejar</a>, a Spanish style influenced by the Islamic caliphates of southern Spain. At Cogon, the chapel of San Vicente Ferrer is dated to 1859, making it almost two decades older than the Church of Santa Catalina. (See <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/280\"><strong>Carcar Church</strong></a></strong>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jose Rizal Monument, which stands near the church, consists of a tall plinth, a standard in town plans since the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1929, the <strong><em>Carcar City Museum</em></strong> was formerly the Carcar Dispensary, operated by the Philippine Health Service as the town&rsquo;s primary health institution. This two-story structure is in the style of Victorian gingerbread houses, named after the delicate, filigree-like ornamentation that decorates the foyer, the balcony above it and the windows. Elevated from the ground by a cement platform, it is approached through a cement staircase with flanking balustrades that flares outwards and terminates in a graceful curve. The characteristic decoration of the exterior is a fan-shaped wooden cut-out, described as a sunburst or half a flower. This design is repeated in all the openings of the building. It has also been adapted informally as Carcar&rsquo;s signature motif, appearing in renovations of the city hall facade and adjoining annex and in the public market. The building&rsquo;s soffit is pierced with a floral type design, a development of the fan shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior is divided into rooms with pierced wooden transoms. Access to the upper floor is through a balustraded stairs. The pierced transoms are also found in the upper-floor rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>St Catherine&rsquo;s College Administration Building</em></strong>, Carcar&rsquo;s Catholic school, was formerly known as the P. del Corro building, which was inaugurated 15 Sep 1931. It is a two-story structure along the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> line with its extensive use of arch openings for windows and doorways. The central section has a projecting balcony supported by pillars. The balcony serves as an awning for the building entrance. Like the neighboring Carcar Museum, metal awnings over the window, decorations on the arches, and grille work on the windows soften the starkness of the neoclassical design, giving the building a warm feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Older than the dispensary or the del Corro building is the <strong><em>Uphill Elementary School</em></strong>. Built in 1905, this school antedated the Philippine Assembly Act No 1801 of 1908, which appropriated money for the construction of schools all over the Philippines. Named <strong><em>Gabaldon School</em></strong>, after Isauro Gabaldon, the assemblyman who authored the bill, the school type was made of reinforced concrete and wood and easily replicable. Although it bears resemblance to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon School</a>, especially in its layout, Uphill is a one-of-a-kind building. Painted in shades of pink and dark red, it is classical in design. The building is composed of three bays, where the central bay projects outwards and rests on a cement podium and is in turn raised from the podium by about a meter in the manner of the Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> (chalet). A triangular pediment, which is echoed in the decorations over the windows, caps the central portion. Windows and bays embellished by pilasters with stylized wheel and leaf designs define the building&rsquo;s vertical lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three floors, with an extension and perpendicular two-story building, the <strong><em>Carcar City</em></strong> <em><strong>Hall</strong> </em>has a core that goes back to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial era</a>. Windows with roman arches bearing the same fan-shaped filigree design found in the dispensary harmonize the city hall with the nearby buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Leon Kilat Monument</em></strong>, located at the foot of upper town, was erected in 1959. The equestrian figure is by Roman Sarmiento. The monument commemorates the&nbsp;<em>revolucionario&nbsp;</em>Pantale&oacute;n Villegas y Soldi, who was born 27 Jul 1873, at Bacong, Negros Oriental. Better known as Leon Kilat, Villegas led the revolution in Cebu on 3 Apr 1898, Palm Sunday. He was killed by his own aide-de-camp, Apolinario Alcuitas on 8 Apr 1898 in Carcar, in a plot hatched at the church of Santa Catalina by some local leaders who did not want Kilat to bring the revolution to Carcar. Fearing that their town would be razed to the ground by avenging Spanish troops, like they did to San Nicolas, the leaders wanted Kilat out at all cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lower Town</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NHI has declared four residences in the lower town of Carcar as heritage houses. The declaration was made through NHI Resolution No 7-10 on 4 Sep 2009. It listed the Silva House as one of the four houses, the other houses listed on the declaration were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Don Florencio Noel-Filomena Jaen House (Dakong Balay)</em></strong> is located at 312 (Old No 367) Santa Catalina St. The original owners of the house and lot were Jacinto Aldocente-Benita del Corro. Acquired by the Noel family, it was renovated around 1873. Listed as having worked on the house were Carcar-born Segundo Alesna as carpenter and Lito Alesna as mason and carpenter. Pelagio Guti&eacute;rrez, stone-cutter, worked on the renovation. Residents of Carcar, but born in San Nicol&aacute;s and Cebu City respectively, Cr&iacute;spulo Z&aacute;bate and Celestino Sarmiento were also listed to have worked as carpenters on the renovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Mercado Mansion</em></strong> (the <strong><em>Simplicio Mercado-Filomena Guerrero House</em></strong> or <strong><em>Nyor Nanoy Mercado&rsquo;s House</em></strong> ) is located along the main highway, Jose Rizal St. Painted in brilliant aqua and white, this eye-catching house was built in 1899. The 19th-century house was originally owned by the couple Simplicio Mercado and Filomena Guerrero from Manila. It is presently owned by a descendant, Catalina Camotes-Lucero, daughter of Mariano Mercado. Carcar mayor Mariano Mercado y Avila or Nyor Nanoy, 1877-1944, was reported to be its architect and builder, but this claim has not been corroborated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Balay na Tisa</em></strong> (the Sarmiento-Osme&ntilde;a House) is along Calle Santa Catalina St and was built in 1859. It is two-story longitudinal structure with a lower story of plastered stone and an upper story of wood. Its wide windows are shuttered by <strong>persianas</strong> or louvers. Its roof of terra cotta tiles flares at the side in the manner of Chinese-style roofs. At the center is a dormer, covered with a <strong>capiz</strong> window, also roofed in tiles. The ceiling is stamped metal. It is believed to one of the older houses, if not the oldest, in Carcar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although not officially declared as heritage houses, the following residences in lower town Carcar are potential candidates for heritage houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on 232 Jose Rizal St, the <strong><em>Yap House</em></strong> was erected by the couple Juan Ramos Rodriguez and Consolacion Florido Yap in 1905. Its builders are recorded as Salustiano (or Gonzalo) Abellana as architect and Andres Cui as chief carpenter. In 1936, the house was renovated with Mariano Mercado as designer, and Ceferino Bargamento as chief carpenter. This house, minus the <strong>azotea</strong>, was the model for the scaled-down version Visayan house in the now-defunct Nayong Pilipino in Para&ntilde;aque. Rodriguez, a&nbsp;<em>mestizo espa&ntilde;ol</em>, married Consolacion Yap, a&nbsp;<em>mestiza china&nbsp;</em>from Cebu in 1892. The house was built after a few years of married life in the same year as the construction of the Upland School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Sato House</em></strong> ( <strong><em>Dodoy Jaen&rsquo;s House</em></strong> ) is presently owned by Leto E. Sato. This grand house on Jose Rizal St was the residence of Timoteo Barcenilla (&ldquo;Kapitan Tiyoy&rdquo;) and Petrona Alcordo. It was in this house that the revolutionary Leon Kilat was assassinated in 1898. The house transferred ownership to Leocadio Jaen and his wife Anacleta Noel. Dadoy or Vicente &ldquo;Dadoy&rdquo; Jaen is Tiyoy&rsquo;s son and the only surviving heir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Aleonar House</em></strong>, located at 442 Gen Luna St, was erected in 1934. It is said to have been built by master carpenters remembered as Oming or Tiyoy, which could either be Timoteo Yba&ntilde;ez (Tiyoy), or his son Bartolome (Oming), or both of them. It was the residence of Aurelio Tigley Aleonar and Dolores Rodecindo de Veyra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Santiago Alegado Barcel&oacute;-Juana Pe&ntilde;alosa House</em></strong> ( <strong><em>Dr. Pablo Tumaliwan&rsquo;s House</em></strong> and <strong><em>Valencia House</em></strong> ) is located at the corner of Jose Rizal and Sta. Catalina Sts. The residence is presently owned by Guillermo Valencia, an heir of Catalina Osme&ntilde;a-Valencia. The house is associated with Santiago, one of the younger children of Arcadio Barcel&oacute; and Modesta Alegado. Santiago, the descendant, 1834-91, married a Cebu City native, Juana Pe&ntilde;alosa. The house was also commonly known as Tumaliwan house because the strategically located house was rented by Dr Pablo Tumaliwan, a dentist. The house served both as family residence and clinic. Later, when the Valencias resided in the house, it was called the Valencia House. The house came to be the possession of Catalina &ldquo;Nyora Taring&rdquo; Osme&ntilde;a-Valencia because it was allegedly used as collateral for a debt by an Aleonar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Mancao Panuncialman House</em></strong> is set from the road by a long driveway. This American period house follows a U-shaped plan with the central section receding, while the flanking sections project outward. Between the flanking sections, on the second floor is a balcony that serves also as a port cochere. The house is painted in pink and white and has a green roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several more residences that may be added to this list of potential heritage houses such as the Marfori-Cui House, Juario Villarosa House, the family homes of Archbishop Teofilo Camomot, and the house and studio of master painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\">Martino Abellana</a>, who has been compared to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rotunda</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crossroads that connect the highway running north-south to a mountain road running east-west is ornamented by a circular cement kiosk. On top of the kiosk is a cement sculpture that depicts two women, one in Filipina dress with butterfly sleeve and one in Western dress, both in the act of taking a step forward while the woman in the Western style dress points upward. It is said to represent the United States leading the Philippines to the future. The kiosk had four stairs with banisters that curve outward. It is divided into eight arches supported by columns. The arches are embellished with the fan shaped design found in the Carcar Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the perimeter of the rotunda are statues of couples dressed in different attire representing the diversity of Filipinos. The statues stand at the base of a street lamp. Across the street, on the opposite side of the road that runs around the rotunda, are pergolas for sitting. The precise year when the kiosk, pergolas, and statues were made is uncertain, but they can be safely placed during the American era, before World War II.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Cebu has the distinction of being the oldest hispanic&nbsp;<em>ciudad&nbsp;</em>(city) in the Philippines, founded by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1565 as Ciudad de Santisimo Nombre de Jesus. It also has the oldest named street in the country, <strong><em>Calle Colon</em></strong>, which runs from the Parian district, through Cebu&rsquo;s business district, crosses Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Blvd (formerly Jones), and turns to become Rizal Avenue Extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cebu&rsquo;s principal artery, Osme&ntilde;a Blvd, which runs approximately from southeast to northwest, divides the city&rsquo;s poblacion into downtown, midtown, and uptown areas. <strong><em>Downtown Cebu</em></strong>, which begins from the Port Area up to Gen Maxilom Ave (formerly Mango), contain sites associated with the Spanish and American colonial periods. <strong><em>Uptown Cebu</em></strong> begins from Gen Maxilom Ave up to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/285\">Cebu Provincial Capitol</a>. <strong><em>Midtown Cebu</em></strong> is where downtown and uptown meet, the area of Osme&ntilde;a Blvd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Downtown Cebu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Magellan&rsquo;s Cross</em></strong>, located on P. Burgos and City Hall Lane is the oldest Spanish landmark in the city. The&nbsp;<em>tindalo (Afzelia rhomboidea)&nbsp;</em>cross, which Ferdinand Magellan planted on 16 Mar 1521, is enclosed inside an octagonal kiosk. This kiosk of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>piedra de visayas</strong></a> or <strong>tabliya</strong> (cut coral), most likely from Mactan, and roofed with tiles, was built in the 19th century to protect the historical cross from the elements. The kiosk has been restored a number of times, although the dates of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a> are uncertain. Its ceiling has a 20th-century mural depicting the planting of the cross in Cebu, a ritual performed by the Spanish as a symbol of the acquisition of territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\"><strong><em>Basilica Minore of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o</em></strong></a> on Burgos St cor Osme&ntilde;a Blvd was built between 1711 and 1735. Its architect, Juan de Albarran, OSA, was prior of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in the 18th century. Albarran left a record explaining how the church was constructed, including details on how the stones were quarried from Mactan Island and brought to Cebu on a<em>baroto&nbsp;</em>(dugout) without&nbsp;<em>katig&nbsp;</em>(outrigger). Albarran&rsquo;s writing is considered a prototype of a locally written architectural handbook. Built from coral stone and tiles, the basilica is built on the site of the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> in the Philippines in 1565. As soon as the Spanish had conquered Cebu, and Legazpi had mapped out a plan for a city, the Augustinian friars built a provisional church of wood, bamboo, and thatch to house the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o found by a soldier of Legazpi in a native house. This image was believed to be the same one Magellan had given as gift to the Rajah Humabon&rsquo;s wife who was baptized as Juana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present 18th century church complex as designed by Albarran is in the atrial style, that is, the church forms one side of a quadrilateral, while the convent three sides, all surrounding an inner patio. The church is cruciform with a bell tower built to the right of the facade. This tower of diminishing dimensions follows a common design found in Philippine colonial churches. The main nave of the church leads to the sanctuary where a multileveled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> &mdash;divided into 17 sections or niches&mdash;stands against the principal wall. Fifteen of these house images of Augustinian saints, while the central niche is for the Santo Ni&ntilde;o (a replica of the original) and the crucifix below it. The fifteenth and topmost depicts the piercing of San Agustin&rsquo;s heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Formerly, the Santo Ni&ntilde;o was housed in this retablo, but for easy accessibility it has been transferred to a side chapel inside a bullet proof glass container. On the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Cebu in 1965, the church was renovated under Abp (later Cardinal) Julio Rosales (Bishop 1949-82). The pilasters were embellished with gilded capitals decorated with corn cobs, the floor replaced with tiles, and stained glass windows added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\"><strong>Fort San Pedro</strong></a></em></strong> on Antonio Pigafetta St was renovated in 1735. Its architect is uncertain. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> traces its origins to the triangular palisade Miguel Lopez de Legazpi set up in Apr 1565 to protect the Spanish settlement of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus. By the 17th century, a triangular stone fort was built, attributed to the design of Gianantonio Campioni SJ, who was at one time rector of the nearby Jesuit Colegio de San Ildefonso. Much of the present fort, however, traces to 1735, when the fort was remodeled and reinforced. The fort survived World War II, with some damage, but was restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fort follows a triangular plan, as did Legazpi&rsquo;s palisade. At every point in the triangle are bastions with a <strong>garita</strong> (sentry box) at the apex. The entrance to the fort is through an arched doorway cut through the side of the fort facing Plaza Independencia. Above the fort&rsquo;s entrance is the <strong>casa de castellan</strong> (quarters of the fort master). The fort has a branch of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> and its interior open space is used as a venue for public and private functions like wedding receptions. Outside the walls of the fort is a statue of Antonio de Pigafetta, the chronicler of Magellan&rsquo;s voyage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Plaza Independencia</em></strong> on Martires (later M. J. Cuenco Ave), a stretch of open land, shaped as an irregular quadrilateral, was once residential. It is bounded by Legazpi Ext to the north; A. Pigafetta to the east, M. C. Briones to the south, and M. J. Cuenco to the west. The first cathedral of Cebu was apparently built in this area. Most of the residential land was assigned to the Church and divided among the secular clergy and the Jesuits and Augustinians, the two religious orders allowed to minister in Cebu in accord with the decree of 1595 dividing the Philippines into ecclesiastical divisions to which a specific order was assigned. The present plaza commemorates the independence of the Philippines on 12 Jun 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CSCR (Cebu South Central Road) Tunnel, popularly known as the subway, runs under the plaza. Begun in 2006, it was inaugurated in 2010. In the process of building a tunnel, precolonial artifacts were accidentally unearthed. This prompted a systematic archaeological excavation of Plaza Independencia, which yielded evidence of habitation. Excavation was done by University of San Carlos Department of Sociology and Anthropology in Oct 2007, and Apr and May 2008. The finds range in age from A.S. Watson and Co. glass bottles for aerated water from the 19th century, to Ming ceramics and Sukothai ware from the 1400s to 1500s, and a gold mask, probably of older provenance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\"><strong><em>Metropolitan Cathedral of Cebu</em></strong></a>, dedicated to San Vitalis on P. Burgos St between Legaspi and F. Urdaneta was built from 1734 to 1836. Its construction was a series of starts and stops. Established as a diocese on 14 Aug 1595, Cebu took a long time to build its cathedral. Starting with a provisional cathedral of wood, bamboo, and nipa thatch, several failed attempts to construct in stone were done in 1670, discontinued on 1689, resumed in 1699 and altogether abandoned by Bp Sebastian de Forondo in 1719 because the cathedral was poorly designed. That year, the military engineer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan de Ciscara</a> was summoned to Cebu. He drew a plan for a cathedral with wide nave and lateral aisles, the main altar at the transept crossing, and an <strong>altar de perdon</strong> (altar of pardon) behind it. Ciscara&rsquo;s plan proposed a <strong>coro baxo</strong> (choir stalls on the ground floor) before the main altar in the manner of medieval churches in Spain and of the cathedral of Mexico. Again, the cathedral was not completed because it was resting on soft sand and because funds were diverted to military campaigns against Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present cathedral was begun in 1734, construction interrupted in 1739, resumed in 1741, halted soon after and resumed 40 years later in 1784 but not completed until 1836. It is in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> style. After being damaged during World War II, reconstruction was completed in 1959. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Zaragoza</a> was the architect for the reconstruction. In 1993, the cathedral was renovated by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2656\">Espinas</a>, Cebu-based architects, principally by Omar Maxwell Espina, in preparation for the 400th anniversary of the diocese of Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-World War II reconstruction saved as much of the Spanish-era cathedral. Characteristic of the facade was the ornamented pediment whose central section was arched, flanked by lower straight sections. The interior of the cathedral had a central nave flanked by collateral aisles. To answer the need for more space, the 1993 renovation took advantage of the aisles by building raised galleries over the ground floor. In between the pillars that divided the aisle from the nave, semicircular balconies were built. Because the massive pillars left blind spots, from which one could not see the sanctuary, television monitors were added. In 2008 and 2009, restoration of the cathedral and remodeling of the adjacent <strong>convento</strong> to conform in style to the cathedral was undertaken on the occasion of Cebu&rsquo;s 75th anniversary as an archdiocese. A set of retablos, based on the design in 1900, was built on this occasion. On 15 Oct 2013, the cathedral suffered damaged because of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake. Temporarily closed to the public, it was reopened as soon as repairs and reinforcement were completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Colegio de San Ildefonso</em></strong>, presently <strong><em>GMC Plaza</em></strong> on M.J. Cuenco, is the oldest school in Cebu, established by the Jesuits. In the 17th century it had its school buildings constructed by Gianantonio Campioni, an Italian Jesuit and architect. After completing the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">Church of San Ignacio</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> in 1632, he was assigned to Cebu as rector of the colegio. In 1768, the Jesuits were expelled from Cebu. The colegio was acquired by the diocese of Cebu and, in 1783, Bp Mateo Joaquin Arevalo reopened it as the Colegio Seminario de San Carlos Borromeo, a diocesan seminary. It was entrusted to the Dominicans in 1852, but when the Dominican rector Fr Mariano Cuartero was appointed bishop of the newly established diocese of Jaro in 1862, the Dominicans eventually turned over the colegio to the Vincentians or the Padres Paules in 1867. Under the Vincentians, the colegio was improved and expanded and the chapel of the school renovated. Land was also reclaimed by building a breakwater along the shore and filling the area behind it. Under the Vincentians, the colegio began to accept lay students as non-boarding students, who were not candidates to the priesthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old colegio was a long building, originally two stories; but by 19th century it was three stories tall. The lower floor of the building was for classes and the upper floor for boarders and the priests who run the school. On the southern end of the school building and perpendicular to it was the school chapel. When the Jesuits left it, the school chapel was a two-story structure with a triangular pediment. In the 19th century, the chapel was increased in height and the facade renovated by the addition of a straight parapet, embellished with bas-relief. The chapel was a single nave. It had no bell tower but built along the southern wall was an <strong>espada&ntilde;a</strong> belfry. The school building itself was like many Visayan conventos, an oversized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house), with a lower floor of stone and upper floors of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1930, the colegio inaugurated a new campus on Rosario St. In 1935, the archdiocese transferred administration to the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) and separated the seminary from the college for lay students. The lay college came to be known as San Carlos College. From then on the main campus would be at Rosario St. The seminary remained on M.J. Cuenco until World War II, when the seminarians were evacuated to Sibonga and Argao. The old building was utterly destroyed during the war and the property sold. In 1949, the seminary moved to Mabolo, once part of the Augustinian estate that stretched to Banilad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built across the Cebu Cathedral, <strong><em>Patria de Cebu</em></strong> on P. Burgos St. was the site of the bishop&rsquo;s palace of Cebu, built by Bp Santos Gomez Mara&ntilde;on, OSA (bishop 1829-40). Destroyed during World War II, Julio Cardinal Rosales, then archbishop of Cebu, transferred the palace to a larger piece of property along Jakosalem St, beside the Diocesan Shrine of the Sacred Heart (formerly Sacred Heart Parish). The ruin of the old palace was torn down and a new building, Patria de Cebu, was constructed by the archdiocese. It provided inexpensive accommodations, primarily for visiting priests and the religious who needed a place to stay while in the city. Patria is currently run by nuns and is open to the public. Patria is a straight-forward building, with Spartan accomodations. Its facade has touches of classicist architecture, but otherwise the building is a simple box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cathedral rectory or convent on Burgos St cor Urdaneta is presently the <strong><em>Cathedral Museum of Cebu</em></strong>. Built in the 19th century while Gomez Mara&ntilde;on was bishop of Cebu, it is in the style of the bahay na bato, consisting of a lower story of coral blocks and an upper story of stone. The cathedral convento, which served as the residence of the rector of the cathedral and the priests assigned to it, survived World War II. Sacred Heart Parish, a personal and non-territorial parish for Filipino-Chinese founded in Apr 1952, opened a chapel and an office at the <strong>zaguan</strong> (ground floor) of the convento. At one time it was used by the University of San Carlos and then by a cooperative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a new rectory was built beside the cathedral, the convento was abandoned and eventually boarded up. In 2000, work began on restoring the rectory, supervised by Architect Melva Hava, former dean of the College of Architecture of the University of San Carlos. The convento was consolidated, its post and foundation reinforced and converted to the Cathedral Museum of Cebu. It houses a collection of church artifacts and art, originally gathered by Msgr Virgilio R. Yap, who had opened a one-room museum at the zaguan in 1995. A room at the ground floor houses the &ldquo;Carmen Collection,&rdquo; which consists of a set of altar furnishings from the parish of Carmen. The ground floor has a room for conferences and meetings. The main exhibition area is the second floor, divided into four galleries depicting the growth of Catholicism in Cebu, the Church&rsquo;s heritage expressed in the memorabilia of Cardinals Rosales and Ricardo J. Vidal, the photographs of historic churches in Cebu, and a collection of statuary and sacred vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Parian</em></strong> and the neighboring <strong><em>Tinago</em></strong> (Tinagong Dagat) developed as the enclave of the Chinese&nbsp;<em>mestizos&nbsp;</em>of Cebu in the 19th century. Tinago to the west of Parian was once a lagoon bordered by a swamp (<em>pantanao</em>). When the lagoon dried up, it was reclaimed to build M.J. Cuenco Ave. In the early 19th century, Parian was an independent parish run by Chinese mestizo priests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Church of San Juan Bautista</em></strong> is presently the site of the Parian Fire Station on Mabini and Sikatuna Sts. The fire station occupies what was once the convento of the Parian parish church, dedicated to San Juan Bautista. Since its inception, this parish church was administered by the secular clergy. By the 19th century it was mostly under Chinese&nbsp;<em>mestizo&nbsp;</em>priests. Because of its close proximity to the Santo Ni&ntilde;o church, the Augustinians contended that the presence of a separate parish church was in conflict with the territorial rights of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o priory. In 1830, the parish was ordered disbanded and the Parian church demoted to a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) of Santo Ni&ntilde;o, but in 1848 Parian was reestablished as a parish. It came to a definite end when the church was demolished in 1876-78. The convento, however, was left intact. The church was built perpendicular to the convento and the complex had an L-plan. The site of the church sanctuary is presently a chapel in which old stones are found, said to be parts of the demolished church. A 1939 photograph shows a cross on a coral stone base marking the sanctuary. The convent was attached to the sanctuary and the single-nave church occupied the whole block reaching to the triangular plaza in front of it, which is now the site of the <strong><em>Heritage of Cebu</em></strong> <em><strong>Monument</strong> </em>. The church facade followed the commonly used design of a two-story structure crowned by a triangular pediment, and flanked on either side by a bell tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of three bahay na bato house museums in the Parian, the&nbsp;<em><strong>Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House</strong> </em>on Mabini St, was built in the late 17th century. Typical of the bahay na bato of the era, it had a lower floor of cut coral, an upper floor of wood, and a tile roof. Some sources say it was built between 1675 and 1700. Its original owners and builders were Don Juan Yap, a Chinese merchant, and his wife Maria Floriodo, who had three children, Maria, Eleuterio, and Consolacion. Maria, the eldest daughter, married Mariano Avenda&ntilde;o Sandiego, a&nbsp;<em>cabeza de barangay&nbsp;</em>(barangay chief) in the late 1880s Parian. The house is presently owned by Maria&rsquo;s great great grandson, Val Mancao Sandiego.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay&rsquo;s lower floor has been converted to a gallery for the display of the family&rsquo;s collection of colonial furniture and artifacts. The second floor and main living area is divided into a <strong>sala</strong>, which faces the street. Beside the sala is the dining room and at the very rear is the bedroom and the kitchen, which was built as an extension. The kitchen has a nipa roof and a bamboo floor. This extension has preserved kitchen&rsquo;s <strong>dapog</strong> (fire pit) and houses cooking utensils of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial era</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/313\"><strong><em>Jesuit House of 1730</em></strong></a>, presently <strong><em>Museo Parian sa Sugbu</em></strong>, on Zulueta St was built in the style of the bahay na bato. This is the second house museum. Privately owned, this house was used as a warehouse by Ho Tong Construction, a hardware store in Cebu. Oral tradition, supported by markings in the structure, attributes this house to the Jesuits. On the lintel of the gate, the perimeter fence, and above the arch entrance of the house are the seals of the Jesuit order. Inside the house is a wooden plaque with the inscription &ldquo;A&ntilde;o 1730,&rdquo; and below it is a heraldic crescent moon, symbolic of the Virgin Mary. The house has two separate structures: the main house with two stories and built of coral blocks, and a second house, with a lower story of coral blocks and an upper story of wood. The houses are connected by a bridge. The house is slowly being restored and has opened as a lifestyle museum on the second floor and a museum on the Parian&rsquo;s history and the Jesuits&rsquo;s presence in Cebu on the ground floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Heritage of Cebu Monument</em></strong> on Mabini and Sikatuna Sts was built from 1997 to 2000 by sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a>. A tableau of cement and bronze, the monument depicts important landmarks in Cebu, namely: Santo Ni&ntilde;o Basilica, Cebu Cathedral, Magellan&rsquo;s cross, and the demolished church of the Parian. Also depicted is a galleon. It depicts historical figures like Rajah Humabon, Magellan, King Philip II, and San Pedro Calungsod as well as important historical events like the Battle of Mactan. It is built on a triangular piece of land, a mini plaza, which in the 19th century was directly in front of the Parian church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/284\"><strong>Casa Gorordo</strong></a></em></strong> on Hernan Cortes (later Lopez Jaena) St was built around the mid-19th century and designed by architect Alejandro Reynes (born ca 1820). This is the third house museum. The house was bought by Juan Isidro de Gorordo in 1863. Now under the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc. (RAFI) since 1983, the house had been restored and outfitted as a house museum that showcases the elegant lifestyle at the turn of the century. In this house was born Juan Gorordo (1862-1934), who became the first Filipino bishop of Cebu from 1910 to 1930. Casa Gorordo is a longitudinal two-story structure. Its distinctive feature is a long-trellised balcony that runs the length of the dining hall and is parallel to it. The lower floor once used for storage houses galleries, a function hall, and the administrative division of the Casa. The second floor is divided into the living room, dining room, and kitchen all in one axis. Parallel to this section are the bedrooms with doors connecting either to the living room or the dining room. A room in the house has been set up as a chapel for the times when the bishop was visiting. The house displays furniture, utensils, memorabilia, and other artifacts of the Gorordo family. Perpendicular to the Casa Gorordo, an independent two-story building in the style of the bahay na bato was added to house a museum shop and other offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/281\"><strong>Carcel de Cebu</strong></a></em></strong> on M.J. Cuenco was built around 1871-78. Its architect was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a>, the lone government architect in Cebu, who also designed the churches at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/356\">Pardo</a>, Cebu and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/323\">Loon</a>, Bohol. He designed the jail as the <strong>carcel del distrito</strong>, the main prison for the Visayas District in 1869. The plan took two years to get approval and work commenced around 1871. The jail is in a sedate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style. Its first and principal building runs parallel to M.J. Cuenco. In 1892, more buildings were added behind the main structure. A second storey was added to the main building, probably during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>. Oral tradition claims that most of the coral blocks used for the jail came from the Parian church demolished in 1878. In its 135-year history, the jail housed not only criminals but also revolutionaries. Many Katipuneros who were incarcerated there were executed in nearby Carreta cemetery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the early 20th century, the jail was used as a stable for horses racing at the <strong>hipodromo</strong> (racetrack) nearby. It returned to use as a jail for both city and provincial prisoners, just before World War II. During the war, Japanese incarcerated guerrillas in the jail. From the 1950s to 1976, the jail was divided into two sections: the front served as the city jail and the rear as the provincial jail. The changes in administration and use caused the jail to be named variously. Throughout the American period and the postwar years, it was called Cebu Provincial Jail replacing the old Spanish name. In the 1980s, the jail was renamed Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC). CPDRC was transferred to a more modern and spacious prison away from downtown Cebu. In Dec 2004, the old provincial jail was converted into Museo Sugbo, the repository of Cebuano heritage. The first four galleries of the museum were inaugurated on 5 Aug 2008. On 13 Aug 2009, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a> marked the jail and the National Museum Cebu Branch Galleries was opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>City Hall</em></strong> beside the Basilica Minore de Santo Ni&ntilde;o was built ca 1937 in the neoclassical style. A new city hall was built in front of an older municipal hall to prepare for the elevation of Cebu to the status of a chartered city of the Philippine Commonwealth. The building followed the preferred neoclassical style for government buildings. A central section rose to three stories, above which was an attic and a parapet making it taller than the flanking sections of three stories and an attic. The ornamentation of the building is sedate and controlled. Fenestrations and openings all follow a rectangular plan. A pair of Tuscan pillars flanked by two pilasters, divides the central section into three segments. A staircase spanning the width of the central section leads to a three-story vestibule, positioned immediately before the main door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><strong>Aduana</strong></em></strong> (Malaca&ntilde;an of the South), customs house, was built in 1911. The building&rsquo;s design is attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William E. Parsons</a>. Done in the neoclassical style, it is one of a number of custom houses built of similar design, for instance in Manila and Iloilo. These buildings are characterized by a multistory podium for offices and a central tower. Since the aduana was built beside or near the port, the tower served as a lookout that gave a panoramic view of the pier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Compa&ntilde;ia Maritima Bldg</em></strong> on Quezon Blvd, between Lapu-Lapu and P. Burgos Sts, was built in 1910 in the neoclassical style. Built on reclaimed land and named the Fernandez Building when constructed, Shamrock Hotel occupied the building in the 1930s. Occupants of the building between its construction and Shamrock&rsquo;s occupation are uncertain. It came to be known as Maritima when the shipping company occupied the building after Shamrock had left. It was bombed during World War II and its owner, Fernandez Hermanos, abandoned the building. It remains a derelict waiting for restoration. Rising to three stories, the building has an irregular pentagon plan similar to a flatiron plan, as it follows the layout of the streets. The top two stories have arched openings in between engaged pillars, with simplified Tuscan capitals. Above the pillars runs a band of triglyphs. The two stories rest on a first story with deeply etched horizontal lines decorating its surface. The building has a roof deck decorated with balusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Gotiaoco Bldg</em></strong>, now the <strong><em>Sugbu Chinese Heritage Museum</em></strong> of the National Museum, located at M.C. Briones St, was built in 1914 in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a> style. Constructed at the initiative of a Chinese entrepreneur, Pedro Gotiaoco, the five-story commercial building was one of the first in Cebu and the first to have an elevator. An arcade at the ground floor, windows with awning type closures, the use of classical motifs and proportions are some of the neoclassical features of the building. After World War II, the building served many functions, including those of a warehouse, the office of the city government&rsquo;s market operations, and a center for senior citizens. The city council of Cebu declared the building as a historical landmark on 13 Feb 2013. The building&rsquo;s administration was turned over to the National Museum by the National Government, which owns the land on which the building stands, through the Natural Resource Development Corporation (NRDC), a corporate arm of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources (DENR). The National Museum is working with the Filipino Chinese community of Cebu to retrofit, repair, and restore the building as a museum on the Filipino Chinese community in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the pre-World War II period when a train ran though Cebu island, from Cebu City to Carcar in the south, <strong><em>Carbon Market</em></strong> was the place where coal was deposited and to which locomotives pulled the coal cars to be loaded&mdash;hence the name. Its location near the sea made it convenient for boats to unload coal and other goods, some from neighboring islands, like Bohol. As the last stop in Cebu City, it was a convenient place for merchants to download goods and produce from the countryside, even as far as Carcar, and to upload goods from Cebu City, which were distributed along the train route. Carbon was a major trading hub in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>San Nicolas Tolentino Parish</em></strong> was established in the 1574 by the Augustinians. Located south of Cebu&rsquo;s historic district it was the area designated by the Spanish colonist for a village of Cebuanos. To its north was <strong><em>Villa San Miguel</em></strong>, the Spanish enclave. In 1627, it is reported that fire destroyed the parish church, most likely the first. In 1641, a new church was built. Another one was built between 1787 and 1804. The church was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt afterwards by Fr Venerando Reyes, a secular priest who was in charge of the parish from before the war, 1942 to 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site of the Recoletos church is presently occupied by the <strong><em>San Jose de Recoletos University</em></strong>. The Recollect Augustinians arrived in Cebu in 1621. Bp Pedro Arce assigned them to the Ermita district, where a small chapel, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, had been built. In 1718, a new church was built which came to be known as Recoletos. This district was once a thriving parish for the Chinese, who settled in the area because of its proximity to Carbon Market. Recoletos church had a classical Grecian portico as facade, similar in design to the facade of the parish church of San Bartolome in Malabon. In 1964, a more spacious and modern church was built and integrated with University of San Jose Recoletos. The Recoletos church, dedicated to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Carmen, faces Magallanes St. The church&rsquo;s main retablo now belongs to the Pagrel collection in San Agustin Museum, Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Vision Theater</em></strong> on Calle Colon was built in the 1930s in the neoclassical style by Agustin Jereza, an educator and engineer, who established Jereza Construction Co. and was responsible for many public and private projects in the Visayas and Cebu. Vision Theater, although no longer functioning as such, stands as an elegant testimony to the ornamented neoclassical style. While shops at the ground floor and the buildings beside it have obscured details of the theater, vintage photographs show that Vision had a rusticated wall at the ground floor, over which were built three more floors and a roof deck with a balustraded parapet. The central section of three bays, defined by a pair of Corinthian columns and flanking Corinthian pilasters, was flanked by bays pierced by awning-type windows. Below and above the windows were classical ornaments like swags and medallions. Above the central section is a parapet decorated with sculptures by the Italian artist Dante Guidetti. This landmark building survived World War II and is awaiting restoration as it is no longer functional as a theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>University of San Carlos</em></strong> (USC) on P. del Rosario St was built from 1930 to 1932 in the neoclassical style. The USC claims direct descent from the Colegio de San Ildefonso. At the boundaries of downtown and uptown, a new campus was built for the collegiate part of the Colegio Seminario de San Carlos. In response to the directive of Pope Pius XI, who was in office from 1922 to 1939, that seminaries should be exclusively for the students to the priesthood, a college for extern students was established in 1924 for non-seminarians. But the college did not have its own building until 1932, when the P. de Rosario St building was completed. The seminary section remained at its original location near Plaza Independencia. Both schools were administered by the Vincentians who in 1934, turned over both college and seminary to the Fathers of the Society of the Divine Word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>P. del Rosario campus building</em></strong> was in a neoclassical style noted for its use of pilasters and engaged columns to define the vertical movement of the facade. The main building from 1932 is presently a four-story longitudinal structure with a pitched roof, hidden by a reinforced concrete parapet. Originally, the building was two stories with tall windows and the pitched roof visible. But after World War II , when the college was reconstructed, two extra floors were added, and the central section of three bays, separated by engaged Doric columns and pilasters and capped by a triangular pediment, has been integrated into the upper story. The central section, is flanked by nine bays on either side. In the prewar building, the fifth bay was ornamented with a faux facade demarcated by two-story pilasters and crowned by a triangular pediment. This ornament has disappeared in the postwar reconstruction. Added after the war are the swags and medallions that ornament the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Midtown Cebu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Fuente Osme&ntilde;a</em></strong> on Osme&ntilde;a Ave cor. Maxillom Ave, formerly Mango, marks midtown Cebu. The fountain dates to the pre-World War II era, but the rotunda and fountain, were named to honor prominent Cebuano politician Sergio Osme&ntilde;a only in 1960, through City Ordinance No 284, which renamed the area and the former Jones Ave as Osme&ntilde;a. Osme&ntilde;a was vice-president of Manuel Quezon, who took over the presidency when Quezon died in upstate New York. The main feature of the rotunda, which is also a park, is a whitewashed fountain, where a tapering plinth raises the basin for water, which then cascades as it overflows to a large catchment below. From the center of the basin rises an ornamented spire crowned by a light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Osme&ntilde;a Residence</em></strong> on Osme&ntilde;a Ave was built in 1947. This was the retirement home of Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Jr. It was in the family for four decades until sold to the College Assurance Plan (CAP). It is presently <strong><em>Don Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Museum</em></strong> and CAP Art Gallery. A room named after Gen Douglas MacArthur commemorates the visit of MacArthur to this house. Made of reinforced concrete and wood, the house belongs to the grand style of houses of an earlier period, where classical elements like Roman arches are harmonized with other elements like the corbels from the baroque and vernacular style and the pitched roof of the bahay na bato. The longitudinal facade of the two-story building is broken by a perpendicular bay at the southern end of the building and by the stairwell, which juts out of the line of the facade and is capped by a dormer roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace of Cebu</em></strong> on Dionisio Jakosalem St. was built in 1953. Its style is eclectic. Constructed during the incumbency of Julio Cardinal Rosales, the second archbishop of Cebu, the palace or <strong>palacio</strong> as it is commonly known is typical of large mansions in the Visayas that draws elements from various styles, in particular, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Romanesque</a> with its repetitive use of the Roman arch. However, the flaring pitched roof with exposed corbels harkens more to vernacular architecture and its cast-iron ornamentation to baroque. The building has two parts: the main building, which is entered through a raised entrance and leads to the chapel wing built perpendicular to it. At the other end of the main wing is another wing that projects in the opposite direction of the chapel wing. These two attached wings gives the palace an S-plan. Diocesan offices are on the ground floor and on the upper floor are the private areas of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/273\"><strong>Bradford Memorial Church</strong></a></em></strong> on 85 Osme&ntilde;a Blvd was built in 1912 in the style of neo-Gothic, favored by Protestant Churches. The Bradford Memorial is the oldest Protestant Church in Cebu. Formerly Presbyterian it is presently under the United Church of Christ. It is named after Matilda L. Bradford, the mother of Dorothy H. Day, its donor. This single-nave church has a porch in front of its facade that serves as vestibule. The interior is plain, its ornaments are the lancet windows characteristic of the neo-Gothic style. Bradford was declared as a National Landmark through the National Historical Institute Resolution No 4 of 20 Nov 1984, being the oldest Protestant church in Cebu. In 2013, the church underwent a thorough conservation and restoration in time for the May 31 cultural event,<em>Gabi-i sa Kabilin&nbsp;</em>(An Evening of Heritage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Uptown Cebu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em><strong><strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></strong></strong> Memorial Library and Museum</em></strong> was built in 1938 on Osme&ntilde;a Ave in the neo-Renaissance style. Its architect is uncertain. The library began as a project of Councilor Jose Nolasco to build a monument honoring Rizal. He was able to raise 60,000 pesos through various fund-raising events. With the support of Teodoro Kalaw, the director of the National Library in Manila, Flavia S. Muana, librarian of the Cebu Branch Library, appealed to Nolasco to use the fund to build a library rather than a monument. The building was constructed in a property donated by Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Sr. In 1938, an elegant three-story library was opened. The first floor was for bindery and storage, the second and principal floor was the circulating division, and the third floor was the reading room. In Apr 1942, the Japanese invaded Cebu and commandeered the library as their headquarters. The library&rsquo;s collection was dumped at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/285\">Capitol building</a>, where they were eventually lost. To flush out the Japanese, the Americans bombed the building in 1945 but did not completely destroy it. After World War II, the library was neglected. It moved to different sites, at one time the fourth floor of city hall. In 1960, the building was repaired and repainted. However, it did not occupy the whole building but shared it with other government offices, like the Civil Registry and the City Health Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building was planned as a U, with the main building parallel to Osme&ntilde;a Ave, and two perpendicular wings of two stories jutting toward the street. This left the facade and main structure of the building recessed. Between the perpendicular wings was a spacious flat patio raised one floor above ground. Access was through a pair of U-type stairs. Roman arches defined the facade and in between the arches were medallions, which gave the building its Renaissance look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/285\"><strong><em>Cebu Provincial Capitol</em></strong></a> aka <strong><em>Capitolyo</em></strong> was built in 1937. Its architect was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\">Antonio Toledo</a>. The building style is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> of the stripped classicism variation. Following Roy Cabalfin&rsquo;s classification of Philippine art deco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2668\">Lico</a> describes the Cebu Provincial Capitol as stripped classicism. This style at first glance appears to be in the neoclassical idiom favored by William Parsons for government building. But the simplified columns, pediment, and friezes reveal art deco aesthetics. The capitol is built on a recessed central section capped by a dome resting on an octagonal base. From this central section run on either side wings that connect to perpendicular wings. Behind the main wing run other perpendicular wings that give the capitol its H-plan. The whole complex is built on top of a raised plaza at the end of Osme&ntilde;a Blvd, which gives it monumentality and allows it to dominate the streetscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Seminario Mayor de San Carlos</em></strong> at John Paul II Ave (formerly San Jose de la Monta&ntilde;a and Juan Luna Ave) was built in 1949 in the neoclassical style. In the 1930s, the collegiate department of San Carlos moved to Rosario St but the seminary remained in the buildings of the former Colegio de San Ildefonso. During World War II, the seminary was forced to close but in 1943, classes reopened at the parish <strong>convento</strong> of Argao for those in high school and in rented houses in Sibonga for those in philosophy and theology. In 1945, the seminario building was destroyed by aerial bombing. Cebu archbishop Gabriel Reyes rallied support for a new building at Mabolo. In 1949, priests and seminarians moved into the new seminary. The Vincentians continued to administer the seminary until 1998 when the seminary was turned over to the diocesan clergy under the archbishop of Cebu, Ricardo J. Cardinal Vidal. A<em>seminario menor&nbsp;</em>(high school department) was opened in 1952 and shared residence with the&nbsp;<em>seminario mayor</em>. In 1973, the seminario minor moved to a new building in an adjoining lot and the 1949 seminary building was used exclusively by the seminario mayor, that is, the college and theology levels of seminary training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Carmelite Monastery</em></strong> on John Paul II (formerly San Jose de la Monta&ntilde;a and Juan Luna Ave) was built in 1949 in the neo-Gothic style. The monastery officially opened its doors on 13 May 1949 at Mabolo, a district of Cebu and north of downtown. The monastery consists of a cloister in the atrial style. From the atrium juts out the monastery chapel. The wing, perpendicular to the chapel, runs westward and at its end abuts another wing. Behind the main cloister is another complex of buildings. Beyond the chapel is an independent guest house. The cloister and chapel are a modern adaptation of the neo-Gothic. The characteristic lancet arch, used as the basic form of the facade, was pierced by three tall lancet windows. The center window had a rose window. The lancet shape was repeated in the windows of the church nave, the corridors, and the porte cochere. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Bp Pedro Arce assigned them to the Ermita district, where a small chapel, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, had been built. In 1718, a new church was built which came to be known as Recoletos. This district was once a thriving parish for the Chinese, who settled in the area because of its proximity to Carbon Market. Recoletos church had a classical Grecian portico as facade, similar in design to the facade of the parish church of San Bartolome in Malabon. In 1964, a more spacious and modern church was built and integrated with University of San Jose Recoletos. The Recoletos church, dedicated to Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora del Carmen, faces Magallanes St. The church&#x2019;s main retablo now belongs to the Pagrel collection in San Agustin Museum, Intramuros."

While shops at the ground floor and the buildings beside it have obscured details of the theater, vintage photographs show that Vision had a rusticated wall at the ground floor, over which were built three more floors and a roof deck with a balustraded parapet. The central section of three bays, defined by a pair of Corinthian columns and flanking Corinthian pilasters, was flanked by bays pierced by awning-type windows. Below and above the windows were classical ornaments like swags and medallions. Above the central section is a parapet decorated with sculptures by the Italian artist Dante Guidetti. This landmark building survived World War II and is awaiting restoration as it is no longer functional as a theater."

In response to the directive of Pope Pius XI, who was in office from 1922 to 1939, that seminaries should be exclusively for the students to the priesthood, a college for extern students was established in 1924 for non-seminarians. But the college did not have its own building until 1932, when the P. de Rosario St building was completed. The seminary section remained at its original location near Plaza Independencia. Both schools were administered by the Vincentians who in 1934, turned over both college and seminary to the Fathers of the Society of the Divine Word."

The main building from 1932 is presently a four-story longitudinal structure with a pitched roof, hidden by a reinforced concrete parapet. Originally, the building was two stories with tall windows and the pitched roof visible. But after World War II , when the college was reconstructed, two extra floors were added, and the central section of three bays, separated by engaged Doric columns and pilasters and capped by a triangular pediment, has been integrated into the upper story. The central section, is flanked by nine bays on either side. In the prewar building, the fifth bay was ornamented with a faux facade demarcated by two-story pilasters and crowned by a triangular pediment. This ornament has disappeared in the postwar reconstruction. Added after the war are the swags and medallions that ornament the building."

Its architect is uncertain. The library began as a project of Councilor Jose Nolasco to build a monument honoring Rizal. He was able to raise 60,000 pesos through various fund-raising events. With the support of Teodoro Kalaw, the director of the National Library in Manila, Flavia S. Muana, librarian of the Cebu Branch Library, appealed to Nolasco to use the fund to build a library rather than a monument. The building was constructed in a property donated by Sergio Osme&#xF1;a Sr. In 1938, an elegant three-story library was opened. The first floor was for bindery and storage, the second and principal floor was the circulating division, and the third floor was the reading room. In Apr 1942, the Japanese invaded Cebu and commandeered the library as their headquarters. The library&#x2019;s collection was dumped at the <a href=\"/2/8/285\">Capitol building</a>, where they were eventually lost. To flush out the Japanese, the Americans bombed the building in 1945 but did not completely destroy it. After World War II, the library was neglected. It moved to different sites, at one time the fourth floor of city hall. In 1960, the building was repaired and repainted. However, it did not occupy the whole building but shared it with other government offices, like the Civil Registry and the City Health Department."

This style at first glance appears to be in the neoclassical idiom favored by William Parsons for government building. But the simplified columns, pediment, and friezes reveal art deco aesthetics. The capitol is built on a recessed central section capped by a dome resting on an octagonal base. From this central section run on either side wings that connect to perpendicular wings. Behind the main wing run other perpendicular wings that give the capitol its H-plan.

		"text": "<p>Dapitan<em> </em> was officially declared as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">Heritage Zone</a>/Historic Center by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a> through Board Resolution No 03, S 2011, on 24 May 2011. The declaration was part of the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of national hero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Dr. Jose Rizal</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two reasons were cited for Dapitan&rsquo;s declaration as a Heritage Zone. The first is its status as being one of the oldest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> settlements in Northern Mindanao. The second is the four years Dr. Rizal lived there in exile.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Dapitan in Zamboanga del Norte was originally inhabited by the Subanon, but migrants from Bohol played a significant role in its history. In 1563, a Portuguese force with allies from Ternate, feigning to be traders, attacked Bohol. They destroyed the village built on the shallow waters of Panglao Strait. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2336\">Boholanos</a> who had survived the attack migrated to the northern coast of Zamboanga, led by Datu Pagbuaya, the brother of Dailisan who served as Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&rsquo;s pilot when he explored the Visayan seas. Another story has it that Pagbuaya left Bohol because of a family dispute. Whatever the truth may be, when the Jesuits arrived in Dapitan, they first met the Boholanos who had settled on the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Mindanao, Pagbuaya established a new settlement called Dapitan, said to be derived from &ldquo;dapit,&rdquo; a Visayan word meaning &ldquo;the place on the other side.&rdquo; The name was allegedly chosen because a line of demarcation was agreed upon between the native Subanon and the migrant Boholanos to establish peace between the two peoples. Fortunately, Dapitan was divided from the mainland by rivers so the demarcation was quite clear. Dapitan, a river delta, was a virtual island. In fact, the Spaniards perceived it as such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1607, Fr Pascual de Acu&ntilde;a, SJ arrived as a chaplain of the Spanish armada and preached in Dapitan. He baptized more than 200 people and administered the sacraments to the Boholanos. Until 1631, there were apparently no resident Jesuit pastors in Dapitan, but it was served by visiting priests from Cebu, among them Frs Fabrico Sarsili, SJ and Francisco Otazo, SJ, and Bp Arce, who acted as administrator of the archdiocese of Manila and concurrently bishop of Cebu. He officially turned over the spiritual care of Dapitan to the Jesuits between 1628 and 1629.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1631, the vice-provincial for the Pintados, Fr Pedro Gutierrez, SJ established Dapitan as a <strong>residencia</strong> or a central house for Zamboanga and finally assigned resident priests there. In 1639, the Jesuits, through the help of Pagbuaya&rsquo;s descendants, most notably Pedro Manuel Manoc, the ancestor of the Cabilin clan, built the first church in Dapitan, which was most likely made of stone. Much later, Manoc&rsquo;s daughter Maria Oray, would establish the first <strong>beaterio</strong> in Dapitan after the beaterios in Manila refused to accept the widow because she was an Indio woman. She and her&nbsp;<em>beatas&nbsp;</em>lived a life of prayer, penance, and seclusion in Dapitan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dapitan remained a Jesuit center until 1768, when they were expelled from the Philippines. Administration of Dapitan was then turned over to the Recollects. Nearly a hundred years later, in 1870, the Recollects returned the administration of Dapitan back to the Jesuits. The Jesuits had returned to Dapitan after an aborted mission to Sindangan, which was then closed because of an epidemic. The Jesuit community was composed of Fr Martin Luengo as superior, Frs. Peregria Gom&eacute;z and Antonio Obach, and Bros Jos&eacute; Canalda and Vicente Roviralta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1892 to 1896, Dapitan entered national history, when Rizal was exiled there. From Jul 1892 to Mar 1893, he was placed under house arrest in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> (royal house). But he was able to acquire property in Talisay, where he transferred residence and built a model community. In Talisay, Rizal built a school and a clinic, a model farm and a water system with the help of Bro Juan Costa in 1893. Costa, who was originally assigned to Balingasag, was transferred to Dapitan to help Rizal. Costa&rsquo;s transfer was part of an effort by Rizal&rsquo;s Jesuit mentors to bring him back to the Catholic faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That same year, Fr Francisco Paula de Sanchez, one of Rizal&rsquo;s teachers at the Ateneo Municip&aacute;l in 1876, visited him in Dapitan. Fr Sanchez and Rizal worked on a relief map of Mindanao in the town plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dapitan Heritage Zone includes both built and open spaces, thus protecting the historic configuration of the zone&rsquo;s streets and plaza. Some sites in the heritage zone had earlier been declared as National Cultural Treasure, like the Relief Map of Mindanao, and the town plaza, which was declared earlier as National Historical Landmark. The declaration as Heritage Zone adds another layer of government protection and also conserves the context of these declared sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others sites in the heritage zone have historical markers, like the site where Rizal first landed when he arrived in Dapitan, the site where he left for Manila in 1896, and the casa real. In the 1920s, the casa real in Dapitan, the residence of the local&nbsp;<em>gobernadorcillo&nbsp;</em>was demolished to build a dormitory for the medical personnel of the Rizal Memorial Hospital. A historical marker marks the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also previously marked is the <strong><em>Church of Santiago</em></strong>, which was completed in 1904 but already under construction in the 1890s. The church, which has two bell towers, is a mix of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style structure with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> style windows. In this church, Rizal attended Mass. He was said to have preferred staying at the back of the church, while Fr Obach SJ, one of the last Jesuits to be assigned to Dapitan, preached and denounced heretics and&nbsp;<em>filibusteros&nbsp;</em>(subversives)<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these already recognized sites, the designation Heritage Zone has recognized the importance of <strong><em>Ilihan Hill</em></strong>, a promontory beside the church where the Boholanos had built a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortification</a>. It was subsequently taken over by the Spaniards who by 1738 had built a fort on the hill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traces of the fort, now in ruins, can be found. The hill is accessed through a flight of cement steps. At its peak, it opens to a panorama of the city. The colonial fortification at Ilihan is unusual because it is not a bastioned fort, the most common type built during the Spanish era, but a fortification that maximizes the defensive capacity of Ilihan. Small separate structures are built on the slope and the top of the hill. These walls and blockhouses are connected by a winding path.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The declaration also covers the City Hall, which has been restored, and ancestral houses like the <strong><em>Adasa Residence</em></strong> and <strong><em>Corazon de Dapitan</em></strong>. The Adasa Residence is a two-story, all-wood structure, typical of frontier architecture in Mindanao. A wrap-around balcony on the second floor, an external staircase leading to the second floor, and spaces for shops on the first give the house its distinct quality. Corazon de Dapitan, meanwhile, was built like a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house), with a lower floor of stone and an upper floor of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Dapitan Parochial School</em></strong>, formerly the&nbsp;<em>escuela de ni&ntilde;os y ni&ntilde;as,&nbsp;</em>built in 1895, is a one-story neoclassical-style school. It is one of the few existing school buildings from the Spanish era.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it is some distance away from Dapitan and separated by a river, Talisay is also included in the Heritage Zone. Rizal lived there after his house arrest in the casa real, and established a model farm, clinic and school in the barangay. Among the structures rebuilt in Talisay are the&nbsp;<em><strong>Casa Redonda</strong></em>, an octagonal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), which Rizal used as a clinic, the school, and Rizal&rsquo;s residence. Also identified is El Retiro, a rock facing the sea, where Rizal would sit when he needed to be alone. The remains of the water system built by Rizal and Bro Juan Costa SJ are still in Talisay. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

In 1563, a Portuguese force with allies from Ternate, feigning to be traders, attacked Bohol. They destroyed the village built on the shallow waters of Panglao Strait. The <a href=\"/1/2/2336\">Boholanos</a> who had survived the attack migrated to the northern coast of Zamboanga, led by Datu Pagbuaya, the brother of Dailisan who served as Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&#x2019;s pilot when he explored the Visayan seas.

Fortunately, Dapitan was divided from the mainland by rivers so the demarcation was quite clear. Dapitan, a river delta, was a virtual island. In fact, the Spaniards perceived it as such."

The Jesuits had returned to Dapitan after an aborted mission to Sindangan, which was then closed because of an epidemic. The Jesuit community was composed of Fr Martin Luengo as superior, Frs.

But he was able to acquire property in Talisay, where he transferred residence and built a model community. In Talisay, Rizal built a school and a clinic, a model farm and a water system with the help of Bro Juan Costa in 1893.

		"text": "<p>Escolta is on the southern portion of the district of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, Manila and is attached to Chinatown to the north. This area on the northern bank of the Pasig was once the property of Jose Damaso Gorricho and Ciriaca Santos of Imus, Cavite. Damaso Gorricho was quartermaster of the Spanish army and his wife Ciriaca provided fodder or&nbsp;<em>zacate&nbsp;</em>grass for the horses of the army. To meet the demands of the army, Ciriaca purchased land on the north bank of the Pasig where she had zacate planted. This area became Escolta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Escolta and Chinatown are bounded by two esteros or brooks that feed into the Pasig River: Estero de Binondo to the west and Estero de la Reina to the east. Escolta is linked to the southern bank of the Pasig and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> by <strong><em>Jones Bridge</em></strong>, which replaced an earlier bridge, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/364\">Puente de Espa&ntilde;a</a>, which was damaged by floods in 1914. Construction of the new bridge commenced in 1916, following the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> design of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>. The bridge was located one block downriver from the original site of the older bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The name &ldquo;Escolta&rdquo; derives from a road that ran from the northern flank of Intramuros across the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a and veered right or east toward Santa Cruz. Escolta meant military escort. The Escolta heritage area is defined by Escolta St, and streets parallel&mdash;Dasmari&ntilde;as, Muelle de la Industria, and Muelle Banco Nacional &ndash; and streets perpendicular to it&mdash;Muelle de Binondo, Juan Luna (formerly Anlouagui), and Quintin Paredes Road (formerly Rosario), Yuchengco, T. Pinpin, and Burke. A bridge connects Escolta over the Estero de la Reina to the Santa Cruz district, formerly Isla de Romero, and Plaza Goiti, where the Roman Santos Building stands. This building is considered part of the Escolta area.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Escolta developed when Binondo, beginning in the last quarter of the 19th century, became Manila&rsquo;s premier business district. Binondo experienced commercial and economic growth with stores and business offices of British, American, German, and French companies opening there. Salon de Pertierra was one of these pioneer businesses, located on the ground floor of the Casino Espa&ntilde;a, at No 12 Escolta. It brought the first &ldquo;motion pictures&rdquo; to the Philippines in Jan 1897. The 19th century buildings were in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) idiom. These mixed-use structures typically had the lower floor dedicated to business and the upper floor set aside as dwelling. By the early 20th century, these buildings were replaced by multistory and multiuse commercial and office buildings. Escolta&rsquo;s attraction was its access to the riverside wharfs on the north and south banks of the Pasig. They were called Muelle de la Industria, which was begun in the 19th century but improved by the Americans in the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Escolta&rsquo;s boom in the 20th century, the area fell into a brief period of decline, when bars and dance halls were opened to cater to the American troops at the end of Filipino-American war. Gov Howard Taft (governor 1901-04) cleaned up Escolta by barring all saloons from Escolta, turning it back to a respectable commercial area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heyday of Escolta was before World War II, known as peacetime. In this area, buildings reflecting the architectural trends of the era rose; from the staid neoclassic to the more avant-garde, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Don Roman Santos</em></strong> on Plaza Goiti was built in 1887 following the plans of a number of architects. First was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>, then <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a> and Enrique J.I. Ruiz. It is neoclassical in style. The original building was one story, characterized by a Grecian temple facade at the center. In 1937, ownership of the building was acquired by the Consolidated Investment Corporation and the one-story building was redesigned as a nine-story structure and named after Consolidated. Andres Luna de San Pedro designed the remodeled building and engineer Jose Cortez took charge of construction. When war broke out on 8 Dec 1941, work on the building stopped at the fourth floor. During the war, Japanese forces occupied the building and used it as a warehouse. In 1944, the property was acquired by the Magdalena Estate. After the war it was used by the American Red Cross as a hospital until 1947.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On 2 Jul 1952, Prudential Bank and Trust Company, under Roman R. Santos, founder and chairman, opened the ground floor as the head office of the bank and on 3 Jan 1955, the Magdalena Estate sold the property to Prudential. From then on it came to be known as the Roman R. Santos Building. When Augusto A. Santos became president of the Roman R. Santos Building Administration, he proceeded to complete the unfinished building. Because architect Luna de San Pedro had died, architectural supervision was given to Enrique J.I. Ruiz. The nine-story building was completed in 1957. In 1961, the basement, ground floor, and mezzanine were remodeled following the plans of the firm of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a> and Associates. Construction was under Engr. David Consunji. Over the years and many stages of remodeling, the building has retained its neoclassical lines. The original Grecian temple facade at the center of the first story has been repaired, reinforced, and retained. Flanking it are rusticated arcades, using the semicircular arches, four arches on either side. The corner arches are recessed. The upper stories all have quadrilateral windows with a decorative balustrade. Defining the upper stories are engaged pillars terminating in a stylized capital of foliage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\"><strong><em>Perez Samanillo</em></strong></a>, presently <strong><em>First United Building</em></strong> on Escolta St was built from 1928 to 1930. The architect, Andres Luna de San Pedro and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>, opted for art deco. The building was well known because its first floor housed Berg&rsquo;s Department Store, considered as Manila&rsquo;s classiest department store. Berg was established in 1901 by Ernest Berg, a German. Berg moved into the area vacated by Lyric Music Store, the original tenant. The Perez Samanillo had two light wells flanking the central tower and a chamfered corner marked by a lower tower. The elevator shaft was in the central tower. The eye-catching features of the building are the embellishments on the facade, the chamfered corner, and the original top story. The embellishments consist of triple thin pillars rising from the ground to the topmost floor and terminating in a framed relief of stylized plants. Above the corner and the main door is a truncated triangular pediment beneath a parapet flanked by twin finials. This parapet, equivalent to a sixth story, has an elongated octagonal window. The original parapet seen in vintage photographs was not straight but alternately rose and fell, creating the style reminiscent of the ziggurat strain of art deco. The building was put up for sale in 1979, and was purchased by Sy Lianteng, who had acquired Berg&rsquo;s in 1951. The building has been restored recently, its lobby and elevator rehabilitated. It now stands as an example of what well-planned conservation can do to preserve a building&rsquo;s beauty and utility.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Regina Building</em></strong>, formerly <strong><em>Roxas Building</em></strong>, stood on Escolta corner Banqueo St, in front of the Perez Samanillo Building. The building occupied a whole block up to David (Burke). The Regina building was constructed on the site of a three-story bahay na bato, owned by Carmen de Ayala Roxas, the widow of Pedro P. Roxas Castro. The house was remodeled by 1905, and had two wings: a concrete building facing David (Burke St) and the Pasig and was occupied by the offices of Roxas y Cia and Pedro P. Roxas Cia. The other wing faced the Estero de la Reina and Plaza Santa Cruz. With the death of the matriarch Do&ntilde;a Carmen in 1930, the property was sold to Jose Leoncio de Leon, an industrialist from Pampanga. Under De Leon, the building was expanded to fill the whole block and an additional floor added in 1934. De Leon renamed the building after his first wife, Regina. Following the plan of Andres Luna de San Pedro, the expanded and remodeled building was neoclassical. Later, the section of the building facing the Pasig was renovated following the plans of Fernando H. Ocampo. The section facing the Pasig was rented by Pacific Motors, dealer of General Motors vehicles, whose Cadillac was a prestigious status symbol. Regina Building rises to four stories. It has four wings arranged around an air well in the atrial style. The wings form an irregular quadrilateral because it traces the perimeter of the lot on which it is built. Three of the building&rsquo;s corners are chamfered. The two corners facing Escolta are surmounted by domed towers &ndash; the one along Burke is shorter than the one facing Estero de la Reina. True to the neoclassical idiom, tall arcades with Roman arches define the exterior of the building. This rhythm of arches is broken by the chamfered corners. The corner at Escolta and Estero de la Reina is the distinctive signature of the building. Here the arch stretches from the second to the fourth floor framing a recessed entrance, marked by Corinthian columns. The tower, effectively the fifth floor, is crowned by a hemispherical dome, which has a balustraded balcony at its base. The shorter tower at Burke rests above a projecting corner, designed as half of a hexagon, which rises from the second to the fourth floor. The upper stories rest on a ground floor, which has a covered arcade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Burke Building</em></strong> on Escolta St was built in 1919, following the plans of American architect William James Odom, on a lot which the family had owned since 1723. Named after the cardiologist and philanthropist William J. Burke, it was the first building to have an elevator in Manila. The building was destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt in 1949. Compared to other buildings in Escolta, the Burke building is simple. Its walls are not ornamented, and except for a chamfered corner terminating in a parapet which bears the building&rsquo;s name, there is not much by way of the more common pre-World War II motifs from the neoclassical, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Beaux-Arts</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art nouveau</a>, or art deco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Calvo Building</em></strong> on Escolta cor Soda St was built in 1938 following the plans of architects Fernando H. Ocampo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2636\">Tomas Arguelles</a>. The building is in Beaux-Arts style. Located in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/288\">Crystal Arcade</a>, the original building was three stories high, but an additional story brought it to four. It was built at the initiative of Edificio Calvo who hired Ocampo as architect. It housed the first radio station of DZBB-AM from 1950 to 1957, when DZBB transferred to Quezon City. As a Beaux Arts building it employs neoclassical motifs but embellished it. The building is defined by two-story Roman arches that are repeated along the facade and the side. Pilasters with Ionic capitals flank these arches. The upper part of the arches or the second floor is used as fenestration with static and operable glass windows. On the second floor, the arches are separated from the third floor by an encircling band. However, this band is broken at four places, by shields or cartouches, linked to the Ionic pilasters by garlands. The Ionic capitals are likewise ornamented with garlands. The third floor and the additional fourth have little ornament except for the pilasters, which have no capitals. The windows on these floors are quadrilateral. Likewise, the chamfered corner of the building uses quadrilateral windows. Above it, the encircling band rises to form an arch, thus providing a counterpoint to the broken band. The building was restored around 2013. It houses the Escolta Museum, which has models of the buildings in Escolta and vintage photographs of the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Capitol Theater</em></strong> on 245 Escolta St was built in 1930 following the plans of architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>. It follows a variant style of art deco called Zigzag Moderne. The facade has a central tower topped with a ziggurat and decorated with grille work at the center. Two bas-reliefs representing sound and cinema, attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a>, Italian sculptor and professor at the University of Santo Tomas, flank the grilled center. However, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2668\">Lico</a> (2008, 331) attributes the relief and lobby sculptures to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3538\">Severino Fabie</a>. In the theater&rsquo;s lobby was a mural, <strong><em>Rising Philippines</em></strong>, a collaborative work of artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3530\">Victorio C. Edades</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; V. Francisco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>, who would be identified as the leading modern painters against the conservatives represented by painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> and sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>. Considered as the best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theater</a> in Manila, Capitol Theater was unusual for having a double balcony. The theater is presently closed and unused, except for its front which has small commercial establishments and restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Natividad Building</em></strong> on Escolta cor Tomas Pinpin St was built in 1934 following the plans of Philippine-born Spanish architect Fernando de la Cantera Blondeau. Cantera Blondeau, who also designed the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\">Insular Life Building</a> at the foot of Jones Bridge between Plaza Moraga and Plaza Cervantes, designed the Natividad building in the Beaux Arts style. Along with the Calvo Building, Natividad is one of two Beaux Arts structures along the Escolta. Natividad was formerly the Philippine Education Company Building, a publishing house, bookstore, and retailer of school supplies and novelty items. Its lower floor was rented by Hamilton Brown Shoe Store and H. Alonso Boutique. After World War II, the building was purchased by Jose Leoncio de Leon from Pampanga, and renamed Natividad after his second wife, Natividad Joven Gutierrez. Natividad Building, like the neighboring Calvo, rises to four stories. Its first floor is rented out to shops, while the upper floors are for offices. The second and fourth floors are articulated in a similar way by pairs of arched windows separated from the other pairs by a blank wall, between Tuscan pilasters. The third story has quadrilateral windows. Entrance to the upper floors is through the chamfered corner of the building. The building has recently been restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>El Hogar Filipino</em></strong> aka <strong><em>Edificio El Hogar</em></strong> on 117 Juan Luna corner Muelle de la Industria was built between 1911 and 1914. Its architects were Ramon Irureta-Goyena Rodriguez and Francisco Perez-Mu&ntilde;oz. It is in the Beaux Arts style, combining neoclassical and neo-Renaissance elements. One of the oldest American era buildings, El Hogar is flanked by First National City Bank on the right and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank behind it. It was given as a wedding gift by the Zobel family to Margarita Zobel de Ayala, who had married a Peruvian, Antonio Melian Pavia. Margarita was the sister of the Ayala patriarch, Don Enrique. Melian established the Filipinas Compa&ntilde;ia de Seguros with brothers-in-law, Enrique and Fernando, which had its office in this building until it moved out when it acquired its own building on Plaza Moraga. El Hogar also housed the offices of Melian&rsquo;s business empire, which included Tondo de Beneficiencia, Casa de Espa&ntilde;a, Casa de Pensiones, and El Hogar. Other tenants were Ayala y Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a, and Smith, Bell and Company. El Hogar occupies an irregular lot, hence the irregular quadrilateral plan of the building. Four wings create the building perimeter, while a connecting building parallel to Muelle de la Industria cuts across the wings, creating light wells. The main decorative embellishments of the building are Roman or semicircular arches resting on Tuscan pilasters. Separating the arches are pilasters with composite capitals. The lower arches extend to two stories, while the upper arches correspond to the third story. The windows on the fourth story are quadrilateral and so are the windows of the tower at the corner facing Muelle de la Industria. Pre-World War II photographs show that cloth awnings were attached to the arches on the second floor to shield the interior from the afternoon sun, where the principal wing of El Hogar faces. Other classical motifs decorate the facade like the decorated keystone and the dentils decorating the frieze that separate the floors. While awaiting restoration, El Hogar transferred ownership. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">Heritage conservation</a> groups are concerned that El Hogar would be demolished to make way for a new building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>La Estrella del Norte</em></strong> on Plaza Moraga was designed by William James Odom in Streamline Moderne style of art deco. It was established by brothers Charles and Rafael Levy as Levy Hermanos in 1873. The brothers, who hailed from France&rsquo;s Alsace-Lorraine region, arrived in Manila through San Francisco, bringing with them five crates of goods, which they failed to sell in San Francisco. Successful in their enterprise, they secured dealership of Packard vehicles, sold through Estrella Auto Palace. Leopold Kahn, also from Alsace, joined their business. Levy Hermanos owned Oceanic Jewelry. The building is presently occupied by Savory Kitchenette, which opened in 1950 and has become famous for its fried chicken. While Savory has retained the art deco line of the main entrance at the corner of Escolta, the rest of the building has undergone renovation since the 1950s. The main entrance was decorated with glass blocks, a favorite art deco material, over which were horizontal sun baffles. Between the baffles was the store&rsquo;s name, Estrella del Norte. The baffles and the name have been removed and some blocks have been replaced by operable windows. The semicircular cement awning over the main entrance, in the post-World War II era, extended to the sides of the building. This was a postwar addition since prewar photographs do not show these extended awnings. The awnings have been removed and the configuration of the sides is closer to the prewar look. But the expansive glass picture windows on the sides, from the prewar days, have been replaced by arched cement windows protected by grilles. A floor was added to the building making it a three-story rather than a two-story structure. The name Savory in bold capital letters is emblazoned along the Escolta side of the building between the second and third stories. The restaurant was named The Original Savory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank</em></strong>, presently <strong><em>Hamilton Bldg</em></strong>, on 115 Juan Luna was built in 1921 following the designs of architect G. H. Hayward. Another neoclassical building, it was characterized by its chamfered facade crowned by twin octagonal turrets. It was five stories tall. Ionic pilasters three stories tall rested on the rusticated ground floor, which served as the plinth of the pilasters. The fifth floor was designed as an attic over the lower floors in the classical manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\"><strong><em>Insular Life</em></strong></a> on Plaza Moraga and Plaza Cervantes was built in 1930 by architects William James Odom and Fernando de la Cantera in the neoclassical style. It replaced an earlier building designed by Fernando de la Cantera Blondeau. The 1930 building was the third home of the company, which was established in 1907. The company remained in the building until 1970s, when the corporate office transferred to Paseo de Roxas in Makati, and later to a new corporate hub in Alabang. The 1930 seven-story building was noted for a globed lantern above its chamfered corner surmounted by the imperial eagle and imposing twin pillars surmounted by Corinthian capitals that rose from the second to the fourth floor. The first floor, embellished with arched openings served as the podium on which rested the classical columns. The Escolta building received an award as an outstanding commercial building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/349\"><strong><em>Pacific Commercial Building</em></strong></a> aka <strong><em>First City National Bank</em></strong>, presently <strong><em>Juan Luna E-Services Building</em></strong> on 120 Juan Luna and Muelle de la Industria, was built in 1923. It was designed by the Murphy, McHill and Hamilin Architectural Firm of New York in the neoclassical style. The building, a joint project of the International Banking Corp and the Pacific Commercial Co, followed the standard design used by the bank in its overseas branches. It was characterized by six three-story colossal columns in antis. That is, the columns are flanked on either side by a wall, resting on an arcaded ground floor, whose walls are given a rough or rusticated finish. It survived bombardment in 1945 and in the post-World War II years was used as the office of Ayala Life-FGU, until the firm moved to Makati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/359\"><strong><em>Mariano Uy-Chaco</em></strong></a>, presently <strong><em>Philtrust</em></strong>, on Quintin Paredes corner Dasmari&ntilde;as and facing Plaza Cervantes, was built in 1914 and designed by Samuel E. Rowell. The building catches the attention easily because the rounded corner of the building is immediately seen upon crossing Jones Bridge. It also stands out as different from the surrounding neoclassical buildings because it is in art nouveau. The recipient of an outstanding building award, the seven-story edifice is characterized by sinuousness. The semicircular corner, which projects above the street from the third to the sixth stories, is echoed in the curved balconies hanging above the street, also from the third to the sixth floor. The first two floors are defined by a rusticated arcade and the sixth floor had quadrilateral windows with no balconies. The corner of the building had an extra floor above the sixth, a tower, crowned previously by an eagle on top of a globe, but which has been replaced by a spire. Cloth awnings shaded the balconies before World War II, but the awnings have not been restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Bank of the Philippine Islands</em></strong> (BPI) opened its Manila branch on a lot owned by the Dominicans on Plaza Cervantes. Juan N. Arellano, who won an architectural competition in 1924 sponsored by the bank, designed the BPI building in the neoclassical style. Arellano&rsquo;s monumental interpretation of neoclassical architecture won for him an award when he submitted his designs for the BPI building in a competition held in New York. This multistory building rested on a ground floor consisting of a rusticated arcade, over which three-story tall columns rose, terminating in an entablature and an attic, and crowned by a parapet decorated with classical motifs. The corners of the building broke the box-like effect with recessed corners. Recessions are repeated at the attic, which again broke the lines and adding variety and movement to the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time and for various reasons, buildings which could have been classified as heritage structures, have been demolished in the Escolta heritage area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1429\"><strong>Crystal Arcade</strong></a></em></strong>, built in 1932 following the plans of architect Andres Luna de San Pedro, was located on the site of a two-story commercial type bahay na bato, which housed the Escolta Ice Cream Parlor and Alfredo Roensch &amp; Co. Its address was 17 Escolta St. The Crystal Arcade was an enterprise of the Pardo de Tavera and Luna firm, but from the start the enterprise brought the firm into financial difficulty. The high water table made the building&rsquo;s foundation costly, so the firm had to take a loan from El Hogar. The firm was unable to pay the loan, so in 1931, a year before its opening, the Supreme Court awarded the building to El Hogar, declaring it as its legitimate owner. The arcade was nicknamed the Pardo de Tavera mausoleum. But when the Crystal Arcade was inaugurated on 1 Jun 1932, it quickly became a prestigious address known for its underground parking and central air conditioning. It was the first building to have such amenities in the Philippines. It housed the Manila Stock Exchange, a mall, and store space for rent to retailers. The building was badly damaged during World War II. Some reconstruction was done after the war, but in 1966 the building was torn down, replaced by the main office of the Philippine National Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Crystal Arcade derived its name from the generous use of glass supported by steel frames. It alluded to the Crystal Palace in England, which had been built of a similar material. It was a grand art deco building with a central entrance, designed in the ziggurat style and embellished with geometrically designed bas-reliefs of plants and a decorative grille work which bore the name of the arcade. Flanking the central section were the two wings with rounded corners in the style of Streamline moderne. These flanking wings were a story taller than the central section. It was the central section that had the most eye-catching features. Entering the building through a cantilevered canopy, the entrance led to a corridor, lined with rental spaces. This corridor was lavishly embellished in marble of different colors. The corridor led to the grand concourse, whose feature was the double staircase, which came together halfway before dividing and running to the mezzanine on both sides of the staircase. Although called mezzanine, the distance between the ground and the mezzanine was equivalent to that of a full story. The staircase was supported as it branched outwards by an octagonal column of reinforced concrete sheathed in dark marble. This column rose to three stories, whose ceiling was a huge skylight that filtered the sun through colored and opalescent glass, used in many art deco buildings as decorative accent. The mezzanine allowed the construction of balconies that opened to the concourse, and allowed people in the arcade to see and be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>House of the Caryatids</em></strong> on Escolta St was built in the late 19th century, following the bahay na bato idiom. This wooden three-story structure was so named because it was decorated with classical caryatids at the third story, flanked by two bays with atlases. The first story had shops with retractable awnings covering the sidewalk for the convenience of customers and passers-by. The third floor, housed Fotografia Ingles. Its immediate neighbor, west or to the right of it, was Botica de la Marina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Lyric Theater</em></strong> on Escolta St was built on the former site of Gutierrez Building in the 1920s. It was remodeled in 1927, and then completely redesigned in 1935 by architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>. Lyric&rsquo;s architect was known for theater designs, and among his works were Ideal and Galaxy on Rizal Ave, Life on Quezon Ave, and Scala on C. M. Recto. Antonio opted for art deco but with Moorish touches, a popular development in the United States, which made its way to the Philippines. Existing examples of art deco&rsquo;s Moorish strain are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> on Liwasang Bonifacio and Bellevue in Paco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lyric theater was originally owned by Frank Goulette from 1916 to 1933. After his death, the Rufino family&rsquo;s Eastern Theatrical Inc took over the business. Under the Rufinos, the Lyric&rsquo;s facade was thoroughly remodeled around 1937. The new facade was in the Streamline Moderne variety of art deco, which drew inspiration from the sleek lines of luxury liners and airlines. Lyric was the location of several firsts in Philippine cinema, like the premieres of Disney&rsquo;s first animated full-length, <strong><em>Snow White</em><em>and the Seven Dwarves</em></strong>, and the first Filipino film with sound, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Punyal na Guinto</em></strong> (Golden Dagger). The building was destroyed in 1945, during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Masonic Temple</em></strong> on Escolta (front) and <strong><em>Muelle Banco Nacional</em></strong> (back) was built in 1913 following the plan of William James Odom, with engineer Fred Patstone and George Fenhagen as consulting architects. As a temple, the neoclassical design was appropriate. Built as a five-story structure, the Masonic Temple was one of the first multistory concrete buildings in the Philippines. The upper story rested on a colonnaded ground floor with an arch central portal. The fourth-floor windows had double arched articulation, typical of multistory Italian Renaissance palazzos. The fifth floor echoed the colonnaded ground floor. The building&rsquo;s rear, which faced the Pasig River, repeated the articulation of the facade but with less ornamentation. At the rear, instead of colonnades on the ground floor, arched windows were used, while the double arches of the facade&rsquo;s fourth floor were replaced by rectangular windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other heritage buildings and institutions within the Escolta Heritage Area, of which there is inadequate information, are listed below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Alhambra Cigar Factory</em></strong> on Escolta and Nueva St produced cigars for a Swiss company founded in Manila in 1898. Its first site was near the Muelle de la Industria. Women hand-rolled cigars in a building similar to a bahay na bato. <strong><em>Botica Boie</em></strong> was not so much a building but a business, established in 1830, selling pharmaceuticals. Botica Boie pioneered in extracting scents from tropical flowers like&nbsp;<em>ilang-ilang</em> and exported this to perfumeries in Europe. The Botica passed through various German owners until it was incorporated by Reinhold Boie and Paul Satorious, when it came to be known as Botica Boie. For 86 years, the botica was located on 81-87 Escolta, on which Lyric Theater would be built. In 1916, Botica Boie moved to a two-story building at 95 Escolta. In 1925, the building was demolished and replaced by a five-story building in the Streamline Moderne style that housed offices, a laboratory, and a store. Botica Boie was known for its soda fountain and grand staircase that led to the upper floors. It closed in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Clarke&rsquo;s Ice Cream Parlor</em></strong>, located west of the foot of Puente de Espa&ntilde;a, was the first ice cream parlor in Manila. It was founded by M.A. &ldquo;Met&rdquo; Clarke, who came to the country as an entrepreneur. He had invested heavily in Benguet Mines in 1910. <strong><em>Heacock</em></strong> on Escolta and David (Burke) St was one of Manila&rsquo;s prestigious department stores, surpassing the older American Bazaar, which was later known as Beck&rsquo;s. Heacock had its own building by 1930, constructed while Sam Gaches was president and general manager. Heacock&rsquo;s site was later occupied by <strong><em>Syvel&rsquo;s</em></strong>, a post-World War II building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other historical sites are: <strong><em>34 Escolta</em></strong> at Escolta cor Nueva St; the <strong><em>American Chamber of Commerce</em></strong> on Dasmari&ntilde;as and David Sts; <strong><em>Bureau of Internal Revenue</em></strong> on Juan Luna and Renta Sts; <strong><em>Canadian Pacific</em></strong> on David St; <strong><em>Escolta Drug</em></strong> on Escolta St; <strong><em>Fernandez</em></strong> on David St; <strong><em>Filipinas Building</em></strong> on Plaza Moraga; <strong><em>Hike Shoe Store</em></strong> on Escolta St; <strong><em>Kuenzle and Streif</em></strong> on Dasmari&ntilde;as St; <strong><em>Leyba</em></strong> on Escolta and David Sts; <strong><em>Meralco</em></strong> on San Vicente and David Sts; <strong><em>Peoples Bank</em></strong> on Dasmari&ntilde;as and David Sts; and <strong><em>Yutivo</em></strong> on Dasmari&ntilde;as and Nueva Sts. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The 19th century buildings were in the <a href=\"/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) idiom. These mixed-use structures typically had the lower floor dedicated to business and the upper floor set aside as dwelling. By the early 20th century, these buildings were replaced by multistory and multiuse commercial and office buildings. Escolta&#x2019;s attraction was its access to the riverside wharfs on the north and south banks of the Pasig.

The architect, Andres Luna de San Pedro and <a href=\"/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>, opted for art deco. The building was well known because its first floor housed Berg&#x2019;s Department Store, considered as Manila&#x2019;s classiest department store. Berg was established in 1901 by Ernest Berg, a German. Berg moved into the area vacated by Lyric Music Store, the original tenant. The Perez Samanillo had two light wells flanking the central tower and a chamfered corner marked by a lower tower. The elevator shaft was in the central tower. The eye-catching features of the building are the embellishments on the facade, the chamfered corner, and the original top story. The embellishments consist of triple thin pillars rising from the ground to the topmost floor and terminating in a framed relief of stylized plants. Above the corner and the main door is a truncated triangular pediment beneath a parapet flanked by twin finials. This parapet, equivalent to a sixth story, has an elongated octagonal window. The original parapet seen in vintage photographs was not straight but alternately rose and fell, creating the style reminiscent of the ziggurat strain of art deco. The building was put up for sale in 1979, and was purchased by Sy Lianteng, who had acquired Berg&#x2019;s in 1951. The building has been restored recently, its lobby and elevator rehabilitated.

The other wing faced the Estero de la Reina and Plaza Santa Cruz. With the death of the matriarch Do&#xF1;a Carmen in 1930, the property was sold to Jose Leoncio de Leon, an industrialist from Pampanga. Under De Leon, the building was expanded to fill the whole block and an additional floor added in 1934. De Leon renamed the building after his first wife, Regina. Following the plan of Andres Luna de San Pedro, the expanded and remodeled building was neoclassical. Later, the section of the building facing the Pasig was renovated following the plans of Fernando H. Ocampo. The section facing the Pasig was rented by Pacific Motors, dealer of General Motors vehicles, whose Cadillac was a prestigious status symbol. Regina Building rises to four stories. It has four wings arranged around an air well in the atrial style. The wings form an irregular quadrilateral because it traces the perimeter of the lot on which it is built. Three of the building&#x2019;s corners are chamfered. The two corners facing Escolta are surmounted by domed towers &#x2013; the one along Burke is shorter than the one facing Estero de la Reina. True to the neoclassical idiom, tall arcades with Roman arches define the exterior of the building. This rhythm of arches is broken by the chamfered corners. The corner at Escolta and Estero de la Reina is the distinctive signature of the building. Here the arch stretches from the second to the fourth floor framing a recessed entrance, marked by Corinthian columns. The tower, effectively the fifth floor, is crowned by a hemispherical dome, which has a balustraded balcony at its base. The shorter tower at Burke rests above a projecting corner, designed as half of a hexagon, which rises from the second to the fourth floor. The upper stories rest on a ground floor, which has a covered arcade."

Named after the cardiologist and philanthropist William J. Burke, it was the first building to have an elevator in Manila. The building was destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt in 1949. Compared to other buildings in Escolta, the Burke building is simple. Its walls are not ornamented, and except for a chamfered corner terminating in a parapet which bears the building&#x2019;s name, there is not much by way of the more common pre-World War II motifs from the neoclassical, the <a href=\"/2/4/217\">Beaux-Arts</a>, <a href=\"/2/4/217\">art nouveau</a>, or art deco."

The building is in Beaux-Arts style. Located in front of the <a href=\"/2/8/288\">Crystal Arcade</a>, the original building was three stories high, but an additional story brought it to four. It was built at the initiative of Edificio Calvo who hired Ocampo as architect. It housed the first radio station of DZBB-AM from 1950 to 1957, when DZBB transferred to Quezon City. As a Beaux Arts building it employs neoclassical motifs but embellished it. The building is defined by two-story Roman arches that are repeated along the facade and the side. Pilasters with Ionic capitals flank these arches. The upper part of the arches or the second floor is used as fenestration with static and operable glass windows. On the second floor, the arches are separated from the third floor by an encircling band. However, this band is broken at four places, by shields or cartouches, linked to the Ionic pilasters by garlands. The Ionic capitals are likewise ornamented with garlands. The third floor and the additional fourth have little ornament except for the pilasters, which have no capitals. The windows on these floors are quadrilateral. Likewise, the chamfered corner of the building uses quadrilateral windows. Above it, the encircling band rises to form an arch, thus providing a counterpoint to the broken band. The building was restored around 2013. It houses the Escolta Museum, which has models of the buildings in Escolta and vintage photographs of the area."

Along with the Calvo Building, Natividad is one of two Beaux Arts structures along the Escolta. Natividad was formerly the Philippine Education Company Building, a publishing house, bookstore, and retailer of school supplies and novelty items. Its lower floor was rented by Hamilton Brown Shoe Store and H. Alonso Boutique. After World War II, the building was purchased by Jose Leoncio de Leon from Pampanga, and renamed Natividad after his second wife, Natividad Joven Gutierrez. Natividad Building, like the neighboring Calvo, rises to four stories. Its first floor is rented out to shops, while the upper floors are for offices.

Its architects were Ramon Irureta-Goyena Rodriguez and Francisco Perez-Mu&#xF1;oz. It is in the Beaux Arts style, combining neoclassical and neo-Renaissance elements. One of the oldest American era buildings, El Hogar is flanked by First National City Bank on the right and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank behind it. It was given as a wedding gift by the Zobel family to Margarita Zobel de Ayala, who had married a Peruvian, Antonio Melian Pavia. Margarita was the sister of the Ayala patriarch, Don Enrique. Melian established the Filipinas Compa&#xF1;ia de Seguros with brothers-in-law, Enrique and Fernando, which had its office in this building until it moved out when it acquired its own building on Plaza Moraga. El Hogar also housed the offices of Melian&#x2019;s business empire, which included Tondo de Beneficiencia, Casa de Espa&#xF1;a, Casa de Pensiones, and El Hogar. Other tenants were Ayala y Compa&#xF1;&#xED;a, and Smith, Bell and Company. El Hogar occupies an irregular lot, hence the irregular quadrilateral plan of the building. Four wings create the building perimeter, while a connecting building parallel to Muelle de la Industria cuts across the wings, creating light wells. The main decorative embellishments of the building are Roman or semicircular arches resting on Tuscan pilasters. Separating the arches are pilasters with composite capitals. The lower arches extend to two stories, while the upper arches correspond to the third story. The windows on the fourth story are quadrilateral and so are the windows of the tower at the corner facing Muelle de la Industria. Pre-World War II photographs show that cloth awnings were attached to the arches on the second floor to shield the interior from the afternoon sun, where the principal wing of El Hogar faces. Other classical motifs decorate the facade like the decorated keystone and the dentils decorating the frieze that separate the floors. While awaiting restoration, El Hogar transferred ownership. <a href=\"/2/6/255\">Heritage conservation</a> groups are concerned that El Hogar would be demolished to make way for a new building."

It was established by brothers Charles and Rafael Levy as Levy Hermanos in 1873. The brothers, who hailed from France&#x2019;s Alsace-Lorraine region, arrived in Manila through San Francisco, bringing with them five crates of goods, which they failed to sell in San Francisco. Successful in their enterprise, they secured dealership of Packard vehicles, sold through Estrella Auto Palace. Leopold Kahn, also from Alsace, joined their business. Levy Hermanos owned Oceanic Jewelry. The building is presently occupied by Savory Kitchenette, which opened in 1950 and has become famous for its fried chicken. While Savory has retained the art deco line of the main entrance at the corner of Escolta, the rest of the building has undergone renovation since the 1950s. The main entrance was decorated with glass blocks, a favorite art deco material, over which were horizontal sun baffles. Between the baffles was the store&#x2019;s name, Estrella del Norte. The baffles and the name have been removed and some blocks have been replaced by operable windows. The semicircular cement awning over the main entrance, in the post-World War II era, extended to the sides of the building. This was a postwar addition since prewar photographs do not show these extended awnings. The awnings have been removed and the configuration of the sides is closer to the prewar look. But the expansive glass picture windows on the sides, from the prewar days, have been replaced by arched cement windows protected by grilles. A floor was added to the building making it a three-story rather than a two-story structure. The name Savory in bold capital letters is emblazoned along the Escolta side of the building between the second and third stories. The restaurant was named The Original Savory."

Its address was 17 Escolta St. The Crystal Arcade was an enterprise of the Pardo de Tavera and Luna firm, but from the start the enterprise brought the firm into financial difficulty. The high water table made the building&#x2019;s foundation costly, so the firm had to take a loan from El Hogar. The firm was unable to pay the loan, so in 1931, a year before its opening, the Supreme Court awarded the building to El Hogar, declaring it as its legitimate owner. The arcade was nicknamed the Pardo de Tavera mausoleum. But when the Crystal Arcade was inaugurated on 1 Jun 1932, it quickly became a prestigious address known for its underground parking and central air conditioning. It was the first building to have such amenities in the Philippines. It housed the Manila Stock Exchange, a mall, and store space for rent to retailers.

Flanking the central section were the two wings with rounded corners in the style of Streamline moderne. These flanking wings were a story taller than the central section. It was the central section that had the most eye-catching features. Entering the building through a cantilevered canopy, the entrance led to a corridor, lined with rental spaces. This corridor was lavishly embellished in marble of different colors. The corridor led to the grand concourse, whose feature was the double staircase, which came together halfway before dividing and running to the mezzanine on both sides of the staircase. Although called mezzanine, the distance between the ground and the mezzanine was equivalent to that of a full story. The staircase was supported as it branched outwards by an octagonal column of reinforced concrete sheathed in dark marble. This column rose to three stories, whose ceiling was a huge skylight that filtered the sun through colored and opalescent glass, used in many art deco buildings as decorative accent. The mezzanine allowed the construction of balconies that opened to the concourse, and allowed people in the arcade to see and be seen."

The city got its name from the local word &ldquo;irong-irong&rdquo; or &ldquo;ilong-ilong,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;nose-like,&rdquo; after the shape of the Catalman islet on the Batiano estuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to its establishment as a separate parish, Iloilo, called La Punta in 1617, was previously under the administration of Arevalo, and before that of Ogtong (now Oton). The parish was created between 1768 and 1775 and administered independently from the neighboring towns of Molo and Arevalo by Dominican priests Diego Garrido, Anselmo Zialcita, and Jose Arritegui.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 16th century, a military detachment was assigned to Iloilo, which was set up as a supply point for an aborted plan to conquer Sabah. In the early 17th century, a small wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortress</a> was built in La Punta under the order of Pedro Bravo de Acu&ntilde;a (governor 1602-06) to protect it from pirate raids and East Indies Company ships, which threatened commerce. Huts and fishermen&rsquo;s stalls nearby later became Estanzuela, today identified as near the Iloilo Fish Port on Rizal Estanzuela St. Upon the orders of Gen Alonso Fajardo de Entenza (1618-24), clergymen began to serve as chaplains of the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1628, the Jesuits took charge of a nearby place called Cota in Molo and built a house and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> in Estanzuela. A street named La Compa&ntilde;ia in Molo has been interpreted as the area where the Jesuits established themselves. During this time, the Jesuits thought of administering La Punta, possibly because of the small number of parishioners at Estanzuela. Worried of the intentions of the Jesuits, the parish priests of Arevalo built a church in La Punta and resided there for a period of time. Because of this move by the priests from Arevalo, the number of parishioners at La Punta increased. An order by Gen Hurtado de Corcuera (1635-44) in 1637 for the Chinese and Spanish traders to move in further increased the population of La Punta, and decreasing that of Arevalo. This resulted in Arevalo&rsquo;s annexation to Ogtong. Then, sections of Arevalo, from Salinas to La Punta, were ceded to the Jesuits by Arevalo&rsquo;s parish priest, Juan Borja, to avoid lawsuits and inconveniences to the Society of Jesus. Arevalo regained its independence in 1653. Its incumbent secular parish priest, Licenciado Gregorio Bruno, protested Fr Borja&rsquo;s decision to cede sections of Arevalo to the Jesuits. However, after 25 years of lawsuits, the frail Fr Bruno acknowledged Borja&rsquo;s decision and made a pact with the Jesuits called Concordia. This agreement was met with protests from Fr Bruno&rsquo;s successors, and the litigation continued until 1768, when the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines as a result of a royal decree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1780, Fr Juan de Figueroa became the chaplain of Cota and the parish priest of Iloilo and the nearby island of Guimaras. In 1868, Iloilo was administered by the Augustinians together with the then village of Loboc (now La Paz).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A battle between the inhabitants of Iloilo and the Dutch in 1616 resulted in the victory of the natives and the discovery of the image of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario. This image survives up to this day and is enshrined at the 19th century parish church of San Jose in Plaza Libertad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the triumph of the locals against the Dutch, La Punta was fortified and Cota was widened and reconstructed in stone, replacing the previous wooden material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the rise of the weaving industry, Iloilo became a commercial center in the 19th century, exporting products such as sinamay, cotton, and silk fabrics to Manila, Leyte, Samar, and Europe. This bustling industry came to a halt in the 1870s with the introduction of the sugar industry. Nicholas Loney, first British Vice Consul in Iloilo, was partly to blame for the decline of the weaving industry because of the increased sales of English cotton in the local market. Loney was a commercial agent for a number of British companies and he advanced British interest in sugar as a cash crop. Loney introduced steam-powered machines from Britain that revolutionized the milling of sugar and increased its production. The machines replaced the animal-driven wooden presses used to extract the juice from sugar cane, which was then condensed by boiling in large open vats, called&nbsp;<em>kawa.</em>The product was a dark, brown raw sugar, called&nbsp;<em>muscovado</em>. Local businessmen and entrepreneurs shifted their interests from weaving to acquiring sugar plantations, both in Iloilo and the island of Negros. Foreigners from France, England, Germany, and the United States migrated to Iloilo lured by the prospect of the growing sugar industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The opening of the port of Iloilo to world trade in 1855 contributed to the growth of the city into an important commercial center outside Manila. Its well-sheltered harbor made it an entrepot for sugar produced in the neighboring island of Negros, which up to the 19th century remained largely unexploited and sparsely inhabited. Entrepreneurs from Iloilo set up large sugar haciendas in Negros and shipped them to Iloilo. Initially, the produce from Negros was shipped on board large round-bottom sailboats, called&nbsp;<em>batel</em>. Later, this was replaced by motor-driven vessels as the growing sugar industry fostered the growth of auxiliary business like hauling and shipping. Likewise, this growth resulted in the establishment of many businesses such as banks, educational institutions, theaters, warehouses, and shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 5 Oct 1889, the Queen Regent of Spain, Maria Christina of Austria (1885-1902), raised the status of Iloilo from a town to a city. It was formally inaugurated as a city in 1893. Because of its rise as a commercial hub, it was given the label &ldquo;Queen City of the South,&rdquo; the title it would lose to Cebu City in the 20th century. By a royal decree in 1896, Iloilo had the privilege of having its coat of arms inscribed with &ldquo;la muy leal y noble ciudad de Iloilo&rdquo; or &ldquo;the most loyal and noble city of Iloilo&rdquo; because of the loyalty of the Ilonggos to the Spanish crown during the early stages of the Philippine revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A notable architectural remnant and testament to the economic boom experienced by this &ldquo;Queen City&rdquo; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are the grand mansions of the elite that still stand today in many parts of the city, notably in Jaro, which had a heavy concentration of&nbsp;<em>mestizo&nbsp;</em><em>espa&ntilde;ol&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>mestizo sangley&nbsp;</em>entrepreneurs. The cosmopolitan education and training of these mestizos encouraged the flourishing of the theater arts, including the performances of an Italian diva. Other refinements of the well-to-do included the exclusive clubs like the Casino Espa&ntilde;ol and Club Ingles, as well as horse racing and golf, which the British introduced when the Santa Barbara Club was opened in 1895.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the American colonial period and after World War II, Iloilo remained as a commercial center. Sugar was still being produced but Negros proved to be a rival entrepot<em>.&nbsp;</em>In the 1930s, the town of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/425\">Silay</a> opened its own port, later followed by Pulupandan and Bacolod, thus diminishing the role of the Iloilo port. The weaving industry continued, practiced in towns like Miag-ao and Arevalo, but not to the extent comparable to its boom years in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Commonwealth period, on 16 Jul 1937, Iloilo became a chartered city incorporating the neighboring towns of Arevalo, Jaro, La Paz, Mandurriao, and Molo. Lapuz, which was formerly a sub-district part of La Paz, became a separate district in 2008. Today, Iloilo City remains as the commercial and educational center not only of Iloilo province of but the whole of Western Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Republic Act 10555 declaring a number of sites in Iloilo &ldquo;Cultural Heritage Tourism Zones&rdquo; was passed into law. It listed a number of sites worthy to be promoted: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/311\">Jaro Cathedral</a>, Jaro Plaza Complex, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/344\">Molo Church</a>, Molo Plaza Complex, Iloilo City Central Business District, Plaza Libertad Complex, and Fort San Pedro. On 16 Jun 2014, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines</a> declared the Iloilo Commercial District as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage zone</a>. There are several notable heritage sites in Metro Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Iloilo City Proper</em></strong> is separated by the Iloilo River from Lapuz to the east, La Paz in the north, and Mandurriao in the northeast. To its west is Molo, separated by Infante St through the mouth of the Batiano River. To its south is the Guimaras Strait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old <strong><em>Iloilo Provincial Capitol</em></strong> building was first built of wood and stone in 1840 as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> (royal house) for the then town of Iloilo. It officially became the Iloilo Provincial Capitol building in 1901 when the civil government of the province was established. The Japanese forces used it as garrison during World War II. It was repaired in the 1960s but was damaged by a fire in 1998. It was renovated after that fire but the provincial government decided to construct a new multistory provincial capitol building nearby as a replacement. The old provincial capitol building was declared a historical site by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) in 2010 and was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> with the help of NHCP in 2012. The facade of this two-story arcaded structure is described as eclectic with a colonnade on the second level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standing in the middle of the intersection of three streets in front of the old capitol building is another Iloilo landmark, the <strong><em>Arroyo Fountain</em></strong> aka <strong><em>Sen Jose Ma. Arroyo Fountain</em></strong>. The once semicircle garden with a flagpole at the center was replaced by the fountain in 1927. Originally it had sculptures of semi-nude women which were replaced with modestly attired figures in 1929, after the Women&rsquo;s Association of Iloilo protested its alleged indecency. The Arroyo Fountain is the kilometer zero of Iloilo, the point of reference in measuring distances from the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three decades after the conversion of Iloilo&rsquo;s Casa Real into the provincial capitol, a new town hall was constructed in 1934 on General Luna St. Designed by renowned architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> styles, it has <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> and nativist elements inside. The one-story structure is marked by arched windows, stylized composite columns with a dome and high ceiling. The features of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) were also incorporated into the structure such as sliding main windows and <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows). The wooden floors are also raised. The structure has a wide court serving as an entrance foyer and also has two big patios. The main entrance is flanked by composite pilasters on both sides. Its facade features reliefs and bronze sculptures by Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3670\">Francesco Riccardo Monti</a>. Monti&rsquo;s work on the facade include a bas-relief of human figures that depicts a Roman Court above the main entrance and male statues representing law and order flanking the main portal. The building was used as a Japanese garrison during World War II. It became the University of the Philippines Iloilo College in 1947, through a donation given by the city government. The new Iloilo City hall was constructed on Plaza Libertad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also located on the same complex with the capitol building along General Luna St, Muelle Loney, and Bonifacio Drive are the <strong><em>Old Provincial Jail</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Museo Iloilo</em></strong>. Built in 1911, the old provincial jail is set to become the regional branch of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>. The Museo Iloilo, on the other hand, was built in 1971 and designed by Arch Sergio Penasales. Its trapezoidal-like facade has reliefs of significant Iloilo landmarks like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/311\">Jaro belfry</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/344\">Molo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/371\">San Joaquin</a> churches as well as the San Joaquin Campo Santo. The museum houses important ethnographic, archaeological, and religious collections from the province, like trade pottery and ceramics, jewelry, santos, human remains from an excavated site, and related artifacts. The local weaving industry called&nbsp;<em>hablon&nbsp;</em>is also featured in the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing Plaza Libertad is the church of <strong><em>San Jose de Placer</em></strong>. It was first built as a chapel of light materials by the Jesuits in 1607. In 1768, it was handed over to the Dominicans when the Jesuits were expelled out of the country. The Dominicans administered the church until secular clergy came in 1775. Around 1868, the church was ceded to the Augustinians. The present stone-and-brick church structure was started in 1873 by Fr Maurico Blanco, OSA. Fr. Blanco added the two towers&mdash;one with a clock and the other with a barometer&mdash;flanking the facade in the 1890s. He also built the adjacent convent. Fr Manuel Diez repaired the church in 1902. It was spared during World War II. Engineer Mariano Cacho restored it in 1945. Fr Jesus Fernandez gilded the main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a> with gold panels. The church was again renovated from 1980 to 1982 by Fr Gilbert Centina, using marble on the walls of the main and side altar, transept, and for the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade has an arched main entrance with two side entrances. It also has rose and semicircular arch windows. Its triangular pediment has a niche for a statue at the center and dentils at its cornice. The three-tiered rectangular towers have ionic piers at each corner. The church houses the image Our Lady of the Holy Rosary which was found in 1614, during the defense of Iloilo against Dutch forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Plaza Libertad Complex</em></strong> was so named because on 25 Dec 1898, the Philippine flag was raised on the spot to announce the independence of Iloilo from Spain. During the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>, this area was improved. Street lights and caryatids were installed. It was marked by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a> on 17 Nov 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on Burgos St is the prewar <strong><em>Casa de Espa&ntilde;a</em></strong> building. Also called <strong><em>Casino Espa&ntilde;ol</em></strong>, the building was constructed in 1926 as venue for social gatherings and events, not only by the Spaniards living in Iloilo, but also affluent Ilonggos and foreigners. As a result of the poor economy after the war, businesses in Iloilo declined. Casino Espa&ntilde;ol was abandoned and is now in ruins. The building has neoclassic columns with a portico big enough to accommodate private vehicles. Above the elevated main portal, the name &ldquo;Casa de Espa&ntilde;a&rdquo; is etched together with the date 1926. Still visible are the coat of arms of Spain, the lion of Aragon, and the castle of Castille, symbolizing kingdoms united under Ferdinand and Isabela in 1492, after the fall of Granada. This marked the beginning of Spain as a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were two well-known <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a> in Iloilo during the 1920s, the <strong><em>Palace</em></strong> and <strong><em>Eagle</em></strong> theaters at the corner of J.M. Basa and Mapa Sts. The Palace Theater, now Regent Arcade Building, was built in the neoclassical style in 1927. Its portico is formed by Corinthian capitals on fluted columns. The facade has two identical square windows with the same female figures with cherubs and floral motifs on top. To its right, across Mapa St, used to stand the Eagle Theater, which was built during the early American period, and later renamed Prince Theater. This arcaded structure was topped by crow-stepped gable design while its windows had a configuration of a Roman arch. Standing in its place now is a modern four-story Eagle Building which has incorporated the eagle sculpture on its facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ker and Company House</em></strong> on J.M. Basa, Macario Peralta, and Ortiz Sts was the office of a British trading company established in the 19th century to purchase and export sugar from Iloilo and Negros, with the support of British vice-consul, Nicolas Loney. This 19th-century bahay na bato, which has a gabled roof at the center sits on a 3063 square meter lot. The Ker house stands near the Elizade Building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-story <strong><em>Elizalde Building</em></strong> (formerly <strong><em>Ynchausti Merchant House</em></strong> ) on J.M. Basa St was built around 1906, following the style of a typical bahay na bato, albeit bigger in size. Its first level is made of bricks while the second level is made of wood. Also, the second level is marked by sliding windows each framed by double arches. The wrought iron ventanillas have floral designs. On top of the <strong>capiz</strong> shell windows are crossbars of pierced decorative wooden panels. The eaves and the projections on the second level are supported by wood brackets that have foliated motif. The main entrance is marked by a grand staircase with banisters of two types&mdash;turned and carved. This building was previously converted into an annex building of the Iloilo City Hall and the Commission on Audit office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Celso Ledesma Mansion</em></strong> on Rizal and Ortiz Sts is popularly called the <strong><em>Eagle Mansion</em></strong> because of the statues of eagles perched on the cement post of the house&rsquo;s perimeter fence. Constructed as the residence of Celso Ledesma in 1922, it is a Beaux-Arts style house with decorative touches of art deco and an interior furnished in the Victorian style. The exterior appears stately and formal because of its classical features, like arched windows and doors, but it is softened by the glass and hardwood door with lines of art deco and flanking panels of stained glass. Murals of tropical scenes by Vicente San Miguel, glass chandeliers from Europe, colored glass on window panes, and local interpretations of art deco expressed in furniture further mitigate the severity of the classicist style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Fort San Pedro</em></strong>, at the end of Gen Hughes St, was the site of the fort built in 1616 as a defense against the Dutch. This replaced an earlier military station, which had been established as early as 1595 as a provisioning station for a planned attack on Borneo, led by Capt Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa. The attack failed because of Figueroa&rsquo;s untimely death in Cotabato. Fort San Pedro was a fort with straight bastions at the corners. Two of the bastions were built over the sea. It was demolished by the Americans in the 1900s, and only the foundation of the seaside bastions remains, incorporated in the breakwater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Iloilo Central Business District was declared by the NHCP as a heritage zone by virtue of NHCP Resolution No 3 of 16 Jun 2014. On 8 Aug 2014, a historical marker was unveiled in Iloilo with the title &ldquo;Distritong Pangkomersyong Lungsod ng Iloilo Bilang Pook Pamana.&rdquo; The heritage district refers to the area of the former Calle Real, clustered around the Iloilo Central Market building. The Iloilo City Cultural Heritage Conservation Council (ICCHCC) further defines this district as consisting of major arterial streets Iznart and J.M. Basa and minor arterial streets Aldeguer, Arsenal, Guanco, Rizal, Arroyo, and Mapa. It includes Plaza Libertad. It lists the following as heritage buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many buildings from the American era range in style from neoclassical to art deco. The <strong><em>Javellana Building</em></strong>, constructed in 1922, is an example of classicism. Tastefully restored, with the signage of Sarabia Optical its tenant on the ground floor modified to be less intrusive, the restored neo-Renaissance building has an arcaded walk with the lower arcade supporting the arcaded balcony on the second floor. Tuscan columns support both arcades. The chamfered corner is the building facade, which is crowned by an arch pediment with a decorative occulus; decorated corbels support the arch. The <strong><em>S. Villanueva Building</em></strong> (<strong><em>New Central Bazaar</em></strong>), constructed in 1936, is in art deco with simplified fluted pilasters and course molding. Generous amounts of glass give the building clean lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Iznart St, other heritage buildings include the neoclassical <strong><em>S. Villanueva</em></strong> built in 1926. Three other Villanueva buildings are located on this street. One neoclassical, one Streamline Moderne, (1936) and the other neoclassical with parapets divided by urns on pedestals. Also located on Iznart are the prewar <strong><em>J. Melliza Building</em></strong>, 1931, <strong><em>Commoner</em></strong>, and the art deco <strong><em>Iloilo Central Market</em></strong> on its corner with Rizal St. This particular building has a central tower flanked by step structure in the ziggurat style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other heritage structures on the heritage zone are the prewar, neoclassical <strong><em>Celso Ledesma</em></strong>, 1923; <strong><em>M. Villanueva</em></strong> and <strong><em>Dominican Sisters</em></strong>, 1927; neoclassical S. Villanueva, <strong><em>Divinagracia</em></strong>, <strong><em>Iloilo Central Trading</em></strong>, <strong><em>Cacho</em></strong>, and another Villanueva building. There&rsquo;s also the neoclassical <strong><em>Pilar</em></strong> building which has art deco arches at the ground floor and the neoclassical with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> ornamentation <strong><em>Iloilo Lucky Auto Supply</em><em>Building</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postwar <strong><em>Javellana II</em></strong>, 1950-51, was of international modern, characterized by sun baffles, together with <strong><em>L.J. Hermillosa</em></strong>, 1950. The <strong><em>Tayengco Building</em></strong>, 1950s, on J.M. Basa St on the other hand is of the art deco revival while S. Villanueva (New Central Bazaar) is art deco. The <strong><em>Magdalena Building</em></strong>, built in 1938, rebuilt in 1948, and remodelled in 1955 is eclectic in style, probably because of the changes done on the structure over time. The building was originally designed by Arch Jose Tantoy Locsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two characteristics of the streetscape of this heritage district gives it distinction. First are the chamfered corners of buildings. Similar in design to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>, Manila streetscape, the chamfers open up street corners and minimize blind corners, which could be driving hazards. The second characteristic are the arcaded sidewalks that make it possible to move from one building to another while shielded from sun and rain. These building features mark the Iloilo Central Business District and give it distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Muelle Loney</em></strong> is the principal port of Iloilo built along the banks of the deep draught Iloilo River and protected by Guimaras Island. It was opened as an international port in 1855, and was one of the catalysts for Iloilo&rsquo;s wealth. It is named after the British vice-consul John Loney, who was responsible for upgrading the sugar industry in the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important structure on Muelle Loney, overlooking the Iloilo River, is the <strong><em><strong>Aduana</strong></em></strong> or the <strong><em>Iloilo Customs Building</em></strong> built during the early American period. This neoclassic structure is identical to the Immigration Building in Port Area, Manila. The Aduana features a tall tower at the center of the building. The exterior of the building is marked by columns with ionic capitals, parapet walls, decorative moldings, and rows of dentils. The main portal is a semicircular arch opening topped with a triangular pediment. The interior has neoclassic elements as well. In the octagonal public area, horizontal moldings and dentils frame the octagonal coffers with inverted pyramidal moldings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Panay Railway</em></strong> was a subsidiary of the Philippine Railway Company Inc, which was founded in Hartford, Connecticut on 5 Mar 1906. It included in its assets the Manila Electric Railway and Light Company (Meralco), Manila Construction Company, Manila Suburban Railways Company, and later, Philippines Railways Construction Company. On 28 May 1906, the Philippine Commission granted the company a concession to construct railways in Panay, Negros, and Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction on the Panay Line began in mid-1907. It ran north to south, connecting the capitals of Capiz (later Roxas City) and Iloilo. The track ran for 117 km, with its highest point at Passi&rsquo;s border (Iloilo) with Dumarao (Capiz). It had 19 permanent and 10 flag stations and ran through the towns of La Paz, Jaro, Pavia, Santa Barbara, Lucena, Pototan, Dingle, Due&ntilde;as, and Passi in Iloilo; and Dumarao, Dao, Panit-an, Cuartero, Loctugan, ending in Capiz, Capiz. A total of 46 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a> were built. Its terminal in Iloilo was next to the Aduana on Muelle Loney. In Capiz, it was at Tabuc, on the southern bank of the Pan-ay River. The railway ceased its passenger operation in 1985 and its freight operation in 1989. The buildings of the Panay railway are functional. Its Iloilo depot and terminal was broad and low two-story warehouse, where the upper floor was for offices and the lower floor for the terminal train terminal. The existing stations at Roxas City and La Paz, Iloilo were both designed as one-story buildings of reinforced concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Assumption College</em></strong> on Gen Luna St was established in Iloilo in 1910 by the Religious of the Assumption. This congregation of women was established by Mere Marie Eugenie Milleret in France in 1839. Known for their education work, the sisters were invited by Queen Regent Maria Cristina of Spain to establish a training school for women teachers. They arrived in 1892 and established a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">school</a> in 1893, which complemented the work of the Jesuit-run Escuela Normal de San Francisco Xavier. However, with the end of colonial rule, the sisters returned to Europe. In 1904 they came back at the request of the Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. Assumption first opened on Gen Hughes St but moved to its present address three years later. After World War II, its elementary and secondary schools gained government recognition, and, in 1948, it became a college. The historic buildings of Assumption College sit in a tree-lined lot. The main building is two stories high with the gabled central section projecting outwards from the flanking wings. These flanking wings have arched windows, and the upper floor have quadrilateral windows. The building is white washed and the roof has a dark green color reminiscent of the American colonial period <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon schools</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Colegio del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus</em></strong> on Gen Hughes St began as a modest school established by the Daughters of Charity, a female congregation established by Saints Vincent de Paul and Louise de Marillac. The nuns started by teaching young boys and girls near Fort San Pedro. On 14 Sep 1917, the school was formally recognized and the sisters were able to acquire a lot for the Escuela Gratuita (Free School). The lot was formerly owned by the English Consulate. The sisters also acquired the lot in front of it. The school was housed in a two-story bahay na bato. In the 1950s and 1960s, the school flourished and its Conservatory of Music became well known. Its post-World War II building is a straightforward structure with elements from classicist architecture. It has a central parapet decorated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a> finials at the center and at the end of the bays flanking it. The parapet is not a solid wall but consists of a series of gothic arches. The bay flanking the center are ornamented with geometric designs in the manner of art deco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>University of San Agustin</em></strong> (USA) on Gen Luna St was established on 15 Jul 1904. It opened with an initial enrollment of 40 students. The first Augustinian community was composed of Fr Bernabe Jimenez, OSA, the first rector; Fr Mateo Fuentes, OSA; Fr Ramon Lucio, OSA; Fr Tiburcio Recio, OSA; and Fr. Sotero Redondo, OSA. Its pre-World War II building is in the neoclassical style, which is characterized by a central colonnade of Corinthians rising two stories, crowned by an attic with arched windows. Flanking the colonnade are stairwells with operable awning windows. On either side of the colonnade and stairwells are the wings of the main building, whose arched windows on the second floor echo the designs of the attic over the central section. This building replaced a 1939 structure, named after Fr Andres de Urdaneta, OSA, Legazpi&rsquo;s navigator. The earlier building also had a central section flanked by wings. This was in the style of a bahay na bato, with the central section projecting outwards and covered by a gable roof. The first floor had arched windows and the second floor quadrilateral openings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>University of the Philippines in the Visayas</em></strong> (now <strong><em>UP Visayas</em></strong>) main building was previously the city hall of Iloilo. It is a neoclassical building with monumental statuary designed by Juan Arellano and Francesco Riccardo Monti. It was built from 1933 to 1935, and inaugurated in Dec 1936. After being occupied by the Japanese from 1942 to 1945, it was turned over to UP on 8 Apr 1947 by Fernando Lopez, then mayor of Iloilo. It had been damaged during World War II, but was repaired in 1950 through the War Damage Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>St Paul&rsquo;s Hospital</em></strong>, run by St Paul de Chartres sisters, is a pre-World War II institution and a pioneer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospital</a> in Iloilo. Its main building in the neoclassical style goes back to before the war. It has a wide porte cochere consisting of an arcade. This arcade design is repeated in the flanking wings, which terminate in two wings that run perpendicular to the main wing. The arches are used on the first story as windows as well as arcades. The second story quadrilateral windows are protected by a wide overhanging roof. The central section, where the porte cochere is, has tree bays and terminates in a triangular pediment. Above this pediment was a short tower, probably for ventilation. In the postwar era, the porte cochere was cut to three bays, from the original five, and the tower removed. Behind the main wing is a chapel whose pediment was clearly added after the war. Also added in front of the flanking wings are the <strong><em>Chauvet Complex</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Cardina Dougherty Annex Building</em></strong>, which covers the original prewar main building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Jaro</em></strong>, formerly called <strong><em>Salog</em></strong> &mdash;a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Hiligaynon</a> word meaning water current&mdash;was an independent <strong>pueblo</strong>, but it is now integrated as a district of Metro Iloilo. The name Salog was hispanized to Xaro or Jaro. The Augustinians placed the spiritual administration of Jaro under Oton in 1575 and it remained Oton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>visita</strong></a> (mission chapel) until 1584. In 1587, Jaro became an independent parish. For lack of personnel, the Augustinians gave up administration of Jaro in 1587, but took it back in 1588 with Fr Juan Villamayor as prior. In 1613, the Augustinian visitor Diego de Guevara ordered Jaro reduced to the status of visita, probably because the Dutch had attacked and destroyed Jaro in 1614, and placed it under Catmon (Santa Barbara); but the order was not carried out. A council on 31 Oct 1636 authorized changing Jaro&rsquo;s patron from Navid&aacute;d de la Virgen to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Candelaria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaro&rsquo;s first town site was at Alanga in La Paz. But after the town suffered a series of slaving raids, Fr Bernardino Alisen transferred Jaro to its present site around 1720. Fr Juan Aguado, his successor completed the relocation from 1742 to 1746. The precise location of Alanga is disputed. Some sources identify it with La Paz poblacion, others say Alanga was part of La Paz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 27 May 1865, the diocese of Jaro was created by splitting the once extensive diocese of Cebu. Territorially, Cebu covered Mindanao, Guam, and the Marianas. With the split, Jaro assumed jurisdiction over western Mindanao, while eastern Mindanao remained with Cebu. Cebu lost its jurisdiction over Guam and the Marianas with the Treaty of Paris, which redefined Philippine territory in 1898. Jaro became the center of a diocese, the fifth to be established during Spanish colonial times, and the only new one to be established in more than 300 years. The Dominican Mariano Cuartero was appointed first bishop of Jaro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 20th century, Jaro became an affluent suburb of Iloilo. For many years, there was only one bridge across the river which led to Jaro. The bridge to La Paz was wooden and had a limited load-bearing capacity, thus all traffic in and out of Iloilo City passed through Jaro. Once farmlands, Jaro became the center for schools and large convents of priests and nuns. Located along Eugenio Lopez St, <strong><em>Colegio de San Jose</em></strong>, founded on 1 May 1872, is one of the oldest educational institutions in Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/311\">Jaro cathedral</a>, and along the main road of Juan Luna, which runs south (E. Lopez) to north (towards Iloilo) are rows of large mansions. Sitting on wide tracts of former farmlands, some on a hectare of property or more, these mansions in various styles were mostly built in the late 1920s and 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antedating all these mansions is <strong><em>Casa Mariquit</em></strong> on Santa Isabel St, two blocks northeast of the cathedral. Oral tradition claims that the house is two centuries old, but no clear records of its construction or architect are available. It is claimed that the house was built either by the grandfather, Ramon, or the father, Julio, of Maria &ldquo;Mariquit&rdquo; Javellana. It became the home of former vice president Fernando Lopez who married Do&ntilde;a Mariquit. The house is a straightforward two-story box made of a lower story of bricks and an upper story of hardwood. It has a balcony that runs the length of the facade and sides of the house, with delicate metal grille work in repetitive geometric patterns of cartwheels enclosed in a frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>zaguan</strong> or first floor was formerly the office of Don Julio Javellana and housed a bank. Later, it was used by Lopez as an office. The area presently displays memorabilia from the vice president. Access to the second floor is through a wide hardwood staircase in the zaguan. The staircase leads to the <strong>sala</strong> and the adjoining rooms upstairs, namely the dining room and bedrooms. The hardwood walls are varnished and the interior is quite dark, especially if the three French doors that open to the balcony are closed. The open doors are the principal source of light for the sala.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lopez clan has three notable houses on E. Lopez St which are next to each other. Built in 1928 by Vicente Lopez and his wife Elena Hofile&ntilde;a, this large villa is in the Beaux Art style. It is dramatically set back deeply from the street by a wide formal garden called <strong><em>Nelly Garden</em></strong>, after Lopez&rsquo;s eldest daughter, Nelly. It is set in a four-hectare property, about a kilometer from Jaro&rsquo;s center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the same road is the neoclassic residence built by the former vice president, and inherited by his children. It has been painted in eclectic pink, which does not enhance its neoclassical features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another Lopez family mansion, an example of the art deco in the streamline modern house, is the <strong><em>Boat House</em></strong>, so called because it resembles a steamship with its porthole windows and upper story that resembles a ship&rsquo;s deck. Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\">Fernando H. Ocampo</a> in 1935 to 1936, its present owner, Oscar Lopez, has restored the building and the adjoining maids and drivers&rsquo;s quarters to become a house for training executives of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> in the Visayas. The house straddles the boundary between Jaro and La Paz and is technically listed under La Paz. The National Historical Institute declared it as a heritage house on 13 Mar 2002 and marked it on 28 Mar 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the north, near the cathedral, is the delicately designed <strong><em>Sanson y Montinola Residence</em></strong>, referred to as Antillan because some critics note affinities with tropical architecture in the Antilles. The name Antillan came from the work of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel de Ayala</a>, a pioneer art historian, who did not claim that the house was Antillan in style but that it resembled houses in the Antilles because of its light and airy look. The house is best described as Victorian gingerbread for its delicate wooden cutouts. It was built in the early 1900s, and was the home of Gregorio Montinola and Matilde Jalandoni. The house has been recently restored by a descendant Gregorio Sanson and his wife Marilou Tirol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built around 1925, the <strong><em>Ledesma Mansion</em></strong> was the residence of Joaquin and Pilar Ledesma. Facing the Jaro cathedral, the mansion&rsquo;s central entrance was a colonnade of Corinthian columns that supported a half-circle balcony on the second floor. The Corinthian motif is repeated in the pilasters of the sections that flank the facade. A roof deck surrounded by balusters was used for grand occasions, when the weather allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other mansions in Jaro are the <strong><em>Jalandoni</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ramon Lopez residences</em></strong>, which are along a side street perpendicular to E. Lopez. In its neighborhood is the <strong><em>Dellota residence</em></strong>, noted for its collection of santos. Near the cathedral is the Beaux-Arts <strong><em>Montinola residence</em></strong> known for its elegant, ceremonial staircase and a tower where a playhouse has been built. The half-size house comes complete with half-size furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On MacArthur Drive, in the direction of the neighboring town Zarraga, is the grand <strong><em>Lizares Mansion</em></strong>. Built by Emilio Lizares in the 1920s for his wife Conchita Gamboa, it stood on one of the largest pieces of urban property, which consists of 16.5 ha. The property is marked by gates which still stand to this day. During World War II, the house was abandoned by the family, who sought the safety of the inland town Pototan. Japanese troops took over the house. In 1950, after the death of Don Emilio, his widow moved to Manila and leased the house to a businessman who made it a casino. In 1962, the house was sold to the Dominican order, which the following year turned it into a house of formation. In 1978, the Dominicans turned it into the Angelicum School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-story house, with basement and attic, is an eclectic mix of styles. Classical rounded arches are used for windows, but the rounded portico and winding staircase are more akin to those in Renaissance palazzos. An open deck with a trellis copies Mission style architecture. The twisted columns of the staircase and the wide overhangs of the roof, supported by zapata or corbels, are baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/311\"><strong><em>Santa Isabel de Hungria Cathedral</em></strong></a> (Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Candelaria) and the adjoining plaza complex which houses the Jaro <strong>campanario</strong> or bell tower can be considered as one entity. Although the Cathedral is presently named after Santa Isabel, the patroness of Jaro is Our Lady of Candelaria, whose feast is celebrated on 2 Feb. In 1865, the Augustinians handed over the parish to become the episcopal see of Jaro; Bp Mariano Cuartero implemented an earlier plan by Fr Aguer&iacute;a, OSA of rebuilding. The church was completed in 1874. The church was damaged by the earthquake of 1848. Only the first floor of the bell tower remained. Damaged further during World War II, the church was repaired and renovated under Abp Jose Maria Cuenco in 1956. Galende claims that only the remaining portion of the tower and the church plans can be attributed to the Augustinians. The facade was renovated during the Papal visit of John Paul II in 1971, with the addition of a balcony above the main door. Jaro Cathedral was declared a National Historical Landmark in 1976 by the NHI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>San Vicente Seminary</em></strong> on Seminario St was inaugurated as a diocesan seminary in 1869 at the Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace. It was under the supervision of the Vincentian Fathers (Padres Paules). In 1871, a building was raised for the seminary and the following year classes opened. It was to be known as <strong><em>Colegio Seminario de San Vicente Ferrer</em></strong>. In 1899, during the Filipino-American War, American troops occupied the building. After the conflict, the building was returned to the Vincentians but in 1906, the building was burned. A new structure was completed in 1912, but this was damaged during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1946, the school was reopened in makeshift quarters until a new building was completed and inaugurated in 1954. The 1954 structure, which still stands today, hews very much to the 1912 design, which was in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Mission</a> style characterized by arch windows at the facade, an arcaded corridor at the back and exposed corbels supporting the roof and upper story. The central section, which housed the chapel, was taller than the two-story wings that flanked it. The lower floor was used for classrooms, offices, and commons spaces, while the upper floor was used for bedrooms and dormitories. In the 1954 reconstruction, the corbels were no longer built, the central section was lower than in the 1912 design and a porte cochere added to the entrance, which was not found in the earlier design. Recognizing its pivotal role as pioneer in higher education in Western Visayas, the NHI marked the building as a National Historical Monument in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arsobispado de Jaro</em></strong>, which faces the plaza of Jaro, is a post-World War II work by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, built under the incumbency of Abp Jose Maria Cuenco (term 1951-72), first Filipino bishop of Iloilo. The house uses elements from classical architecture like the arch windows. It is laid out in the manner of a residence, where the offices are on the bottom floor and the residential area is on the upper floor. Because of road widening, the street in front of Arsobispado runs very close to the structure, with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old <strong><em>Jaro Municipal Building</em></strong> was designed by Juan Arellano in 1934. It no longer functions as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">municipal building</a> but as the police station. It is in the art deco ziggurat style, because its lines allude to ancient Persian stepped temple architecture. It has a central tower buttressed by decorative pilasters, a lower floor, and a still lower and wide podium, that gives the whole facade the look of stairs. Pilasters mark the division of the bays. Decorative grille work, an outstanding feature of the building, adorns all windows and openings. The building has been restored and inaugurated in 2017 as the Iloilo branch of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>La Paz</em></strong>, a district of Metro Iloilo on the northern bank of the Iloilo River, was formerly known as Loboc but was renamed La Paz after the patroness of the parish Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Paz y Buenviaje (Our Lady of Peace and Safe Voyage). This title of Mary was originally given to an image of the Immaculate Conception, given as a gift in 1626 by Gov Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora to the Jesuit parish of Antipolo. Since the 17th century, a number of parishes in the Philippines have taken the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Paz as patroness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present church was completed in 1870, under the incumbency of Fr Candido Gonzales, OSA. The church was severely damaged during World War II, with only the facade remaining. The church was rebuilt after the war and was renovated in the early 1990s. The church&rsquo;s heritage facade belongs to the neoclassical style and is divided into five bays. The central bay corresponds to the nave, the pair flanking it corresponds to the aisles, and further to the left and the right are bays on which bell towers are located. The central bay is defined by a Greek temple-type facade, including a decorative faux pediment under the principal triangular pediment of the church. Fenestrations and the main door use the Roman arch. The central bay is decorated by a pair of unfluted Corinthian columns, resting on a plinth and rising to two stories. The other bays are separated from each other by pilasters. The church is an entirely new reconstruction, although the altar and the arcade separating the nave from the aisles follow the neoclassical style. The upper octagonal stories of the bell tower are likewise reconstructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>St Clement&rsquo;s Church</em></strong> was constructed by the Redemptorist Fathers in 1931. Beside the church is the main house of the Redemptorists in the Visayas. The church is a modern interpretation of Romanesque architecture with an art deco touch. The general lines of the facade, with a narrow central section flanked by lower sections, is reminiscent of the Jaro Municipal building of 1934, an art deco building. However, the arcaded vestibule with a balustraded balcony above it is more in the line of Revivalist architecture. A four-story bell tower flanks the right side of the facade. The church is a popular destination because of the Wednesday novena to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, introduced in St Clement&rsquo;s in 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Iloilo National High School</em></strong> on Juan Luna St was established in 1902 as the Iloilo Normal School for teachers&rsquo;s training. But when the Iloilo Normal School transferred to a new location and became the West Visayas State University, the high school remained in the historic building. The date of construction of the heritage building might be the same year that the Normal School was established. The building&rsquo;s architect is uncertain, but the structure has all the marks of a project of the Bureau of Public Works. The main structure is a longitudinal single-story building raised from the ground in the style of the Gabaldon Schools. An external double staircase leads to the main building, which is characterized by an arcade. Perpendicular to the main building are flanking wings, connected to the main building by an arcaded bridge. The facade of the flanking wings is ornamented with a winged figure wearing a helmet and holding a book, symbolic of education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Molo was the Chinese enclave or Parian of Iloilo. Its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/344\">parish church</a> dedicated to Santa Ana, the mother of the Virgin Mary, is one of a handful of Spanish colonial churches known to have been built by the secular or diocesan clergy rather than by the religious orders. The church started as a structure of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>tabique pampango</strong></a> with a tile roof. The church was replaced by a nipa structure in 1863 by Fr Jose Ma. Sichon, a Chinese mestizo priest. A plan to build a new church of stone was presented in 1866 and approved by Bp Mariano Cuartero, OP in 1869, after which work began immediately. In a style that blends neo-Gothic and neo-Renaissance, the church is noted for its gothic spires resting on lower floors pierced by semicircular, rather than lancet, arches. The church interior is divided into a central nave flanked by aisles. On the posts of the arcade are women saints. The central altar is in the neo-Gothic style. Built in the 1920s, this wooden altar is varnished in a dark stain. The image of Santa Ana is in the central niche. The church was marked by the NHI in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built during the American era, probably around the 1920s, the plaza&rsquo;s centerpiece is a circular reinforced concrete gazebo supported by six Doric columns. Such gazebos were a common feature of American period town plazas. Providing shelter for promenaders, on Sunday afternoons, the gazebo became a bandstand for a brass band that played music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Asilo de Molo</em></strong> on North Fundidor St began as a home for the elderly poor run by the Sisters of Charity (Madres Paules). It was noted for the fine embroidery of its wards. Presently, the sisters have expanded their outreach to the urban poor and employ women from poor communities as embroiderers. Asilo was established on 27 Sep 1912 by the Daughters of Charity and incorporated in 1933. Little remains of the pre-World War II buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arevalo</em></strong> traces its roots to a settlement founded by Gov Ronquillo, who named it a villa, indicating that it was primarily a settlement for Spaniards as distinct from Molo, which would become a Chinese enclave, Jaro and La Paz, settlements for the local people and later as the mestizo villages of Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Parish</em></strong> <em><strong>Church of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus</strong> </em>is a post-World War II church built upon the foundations of an earlier Spanish colonial church. The present church is a two-story structure with a triangular pediment. Lancet arches pierce the facade wall. To the left of the facade is the bell tower resting on base with arched windows. The convento beside the church stands as an independent structure. It is a two-story bahay na bato with a lower floor of stone and an upper floor of wood. Grille work decorates the lower windows, while sliding capiz shell windows decorate the upper windows. The convento&rsquo;s date of construction is uncertain but it may have been built in the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arevalo Sinamay House</em></strong> on J.V. Hocson St is marked by a large sign that says &ldquo;Sinamay Dealer and Mama&rsquo;s Kitchen.&rdquo; Built in the late 1800s, it is a typical bahay na bato. Its upper and lower floor are whitewashed and sliding capiz windows allow light to flood the upper floor. The lower floor houses frame looms that weave sinamay from jusi fibers, and hablon from a mix of cotton and other fibers. The use of the lower or ground floor as a workshop was not uncommon during the heyday of the bahay na bato. The upper floor, once the living area of the house, is now a store selling handmade cloth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Monument to Reina Isabela II</em></strong> is a 19th-century monument in honor of the Spanish monarch Isabela (reigned 1833-68). The monument stands beside the Parish Church of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in Arevalo. It consists of a plinth on which stands a fluted Doric column. Above the capital is a tapered base on which a metal crown rests. The present monument appears to be a reconstruction because it has a plinth on top of another. Early 20th- century photographs of the monument show a single plinth and a far taller column. The earlier column displays <strong>entasis</strong>, that is, the bulging of a column at about midpoint found in classical Greek architecture. The lower half of the column has disappeared replaced by a plinth above an older plinth. This older plinth has inscriptions that are abraded and are difficult to read. Oral tradition states that the coral stone used for the monument came from the Jesuit church. Which church, however, is uncertain. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Edgar Allan M.

A street named La Compa&#xF1;ia in Molo has been interpreted as the area where the Jesuits established themselves. During this time, the Jesuits thought of administering La Punta, possibly because of the small number of parishioners at Estanzuela. Worried of the intentions of the Jesuits, the parish priests of Arevalo built a church in La Punta and resided there for a period of time. Because of this move by the priests from Arevalo, the number of parishioners at La Punta increased. An order by Gen Hurtado de Corcuera (1635-44) in 1637 for the Chinese and Spanish traders to move in further increased the population of La Punta, and decreasing that of Arevalo. This resulted in Arevalo&#x2019;s annexation to Ogtong. Then, sections of Arevalo, from Salinas to La Punta, were ceded to the Jesuits by Arevalo&#x2019;s parish priest, Juan Borja, to avoid lawsuits and inconveniences to the Society of Jesus. Arevalo regained its independence in 1653. Its incumbent secular parish priest, Licenciado Gregorio Bruno, protested Fr Borja&#x2019;s decision to cede sections of Arevalo to the Jesuits. However, after 25 years of lawsuits, the frail Fr Bruno acknowledged Borja&#x2019;s decision and made a pact with the Jesuits called Concordia. This agreement was met with protests from Fr Bruno&#x2019;s successors, and the litigation continued until 1768, when the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines as a result of a royal decree."

This bustling industry came to a halt in the 1870s with the introduction of the sugar industry. Nicholas Loney, first British Vice Consul in Iloilo, was partly to blame for the decline of the weaving industry because of the increased sales of English cotton in the local market. Loney was a commercial agent for a number of British companies and he advanced British interest in sugar as a cash crop. Loney introduced steam-powered machines from Britain that revolutionized the milling of sugar and increased its production. The machines replaced the animal-driven wooden presses used to extract the juice from sugar cane, which was then condensed by boiling in large open vats, called&#xA0;<em>kawa.</em>The product was a dark, brown raw sugar, called&#xA0;<em>muscovado</em>. Local businessmen and entrepreneurs shifted their interests from weaving to acquiring sugar plantations, both in Iloilo and the island of Negros. Foreigners from France, England, Germany, and the United States migrated to Iloilo lured by the prospect of the growing sugar industry."

On 14 Sep 1917, the school was formally recognized and the sisters were able to acquire a lot for the Escuela Gratuita (Free School). The lot was formerly owned by the English Consulate. The sisters also acquired the lot in front of it. The school was housed in a two-story bahay na bato. In the 1950s and 1960s, the school flourished and its Conservatory of Music became well known. Its post-World War II building is a straightforward structure with elements from classicist architecture. It has a central parapet decorated with <a href=\"/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a> finials at the center and at the end of the bays flanking it.

The general lines of the facade, with a narrow central section flanked by lower sections, is reminiscent of the Jaro Municipal building of 1934, an art deco building. However, the arcaded vestibule with a balustraded balcony above it is more in the line of Revivalist architecture. A four-story bell tower flanks the right side of the facade.

		"text": "<p>The name Intramuros comes from the Latin words &ldquo;intra,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;within&rdquo; and &ldquo;muros,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;walls.&rdquo; Intramuros is located on the southern bank of the Pasig River, near the river&rsquo;s mouth. Laid out as an irregular pentagon with an area of 0.67 sq km, Intramuros is enclosed by a 3.7-km-long wall. It is also known as <strong><em>Ciudad Murada</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Walled City</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intramuros was established in 1571. This was the center of Spanish colonial government, the civil, ecclesiastical, educational, economic, and cultural center of the Philippines for more than three centuries. It was also a residential area for Spanish colonists. Other ethnic groups, like the Chinese and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, lived outside the walled city.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Intramuros Heritage Area is comprised of two parts: a military area, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, and a civilian area, the Spanish ciudad or city of Manila. <strong><em>Fort Santiago</em></strong> occupies the northwestern apex of the walled city, while the rest comprises the ciudad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intramuros was laid out as a grid of streets with open and green spaces called plazas and spaces for a variety of buildings, following the principles of Renaissance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban planning</a> as codified in the 1573 Laws of the Indies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Streets</strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>The principal streets, which defined the city plan, runs northwest to southeast. These streets are <strong><em>Calle Real del Palacio</em></strong> and <strong><em>Calle (Real del) Parian</em></strong>, which set the grid layout of the city. Renaissance town planners drew inspiration from the classical era: Calle Real del Palacio was analogous to classical Rome&rsquo;s <strong>cardo</strong> and Calle Parian was analogous to the <strong>decumanus.</strong> Calle Real, now Gen Luna, was originally named for the governor general&rsquo;s palace, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">Palacio del Gobernador</a>, and later renamed to honor <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\">Gen Antonio Luna</a>, brother of the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3634\">Juan Luna</a> and an officer of the revolutionary army against Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calle (Real del) Parian was initially called Parian because it led to the Parian gate and ravelin. The street runs perpendicular to Real del Palacio and crosses it, three blocks south of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> and in front of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Monastery</a>. Called Real after 1780, when Puerta Real at the end of Calle Real was closed as a precaution against a siege, Real del Parian became the ceremonial street through which the carriages of the governor-general and the archbishop of Manila passed. Calle Parian led to the business district and Chinese enclave outside Intramuros located north and east, at the areas presently occupied by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Central Post Office</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, the LRT Central Station, and the Arroceros Forest Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the walls, a perimeter road follows the line of the walls. Its name varies depending on where it runs. It is called <strong><em>Muralla</em></strong> at its northeastern section. At the southwestern section it is called <strong><em>Fundici&oacute;n</em></strong> (foundry) because it passes a military foundry at the Baluarte de San Diego, as depicted in 18th century maps. The length of the perimeter road that runs parallel to the seaside flank of the city walls, passing by Santa Lucia gate, became known as <strong><em>Santa Lucia</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These secondary roads run on the city&rsquo;s northwest-southeast axis: <strong><em>Arzobispo</em></strong> was named for the archbishop&rsquo;s palace, which was located along this street. The site of the archbishop&rsquo;s palace is now occupied by the Archdiocese of Manila&rsquo;s archbishop&rsquo;s residence and chancery. The north end of Arzobispo was named <strong><em>Audiencia</em></strong> because it passed by the building of the Real Audiencia. <strong><em>Cabildo</em></strong> was named after the city council or cabildo, which had its session hall along the street. The session hall was also called <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a></em></strong> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\">city hall</a>. The 19th-century cabildo was destroyed during World War II and has recently been <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Magallanes</em></strong> is named after Ferdinand Magellan. <strong><em>Solana</em></strong>, formerly known as Fonda, is probably named in honor of Governor Urbiztondo, the Marques de la Solana. <strong><em>Legazpi/San Juan de Dios St</em></strong> honors Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who was the founder of Spanish Manila and first governor general of the Philippines. Its southeastern section was named after the hospital run by the Brothers of San Juan de Dios. The street was formerly known as <strong><em>Bomba</em></strong>, which can mean either pump or bomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Escuela</em></strong> is named after an unknown school. <strong><em>Letran</em></strong>, formerly Cerrada, is named after Colegio de San Juan de Letr&aacute;n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the roads that run perpendicular to the northwest and southeast axis of the city: <strong><em>Almacenes</em></strong>, presently <strong><em>Maestranza</em></strong>, is a short stretch of road that continues the perimeter road Muralla, near Plaza Militar. It is named for the&nbsp;<em>real almacenes&nbsp;</em>or the royal storehouses that stood inside and outside the walls, beside the Pasig River. The street led to a small gate called <strong><em>Almacenes</em></strong> that opened to the Pasig. The storehouses expanded to the <strong>casamata</strong> or vaulted chambers of the <strong><em>Maestranza</em></strong> wall, the thickest part of the Intramuros curtain wall. Maestranza has been restored, after it was deliberately demolished around 1905 to allow easy access to the wharfs along the Pasig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Santa Clara</em></strong> is named after the Real Monasterio de Santa Clara, a convent of contemplative Franciscan nuns, founded by Sor Geronima Asuncion in 1621. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a></em></strong>, referred to the Aduana or Custom house at the northeastern end of the street, built in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style of the 19th century. The Aduana building also housed the Intendencia or city management office and was the alternate name given to the building. The street is presently known as Andres Soriano Jr, after the industrialist and entrepreneur who founded San Miguel Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Postigo</em></strong>, formerly <strong><em>Cruzadas</em></strong> (Crusades), led to the postigo or postern gate and connects with Calle Santo Tomas. It was through this road and gate that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Dr Jose P. Rizal</a> passed on the way to his execution in Bagumbayan on 30 Dec 1896. Santo Tomas, the eastern end of Postigo, terminated at the Universidad de Santo Tomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Beaterio</em></strong> is named after the Beaterio de Santa Catalina. <strong><em>Anda</em></strong> honors Simon de Anda who organized the resistance during the British occupation of Manila (1762-64) and functioned as acting governor-general, while on exile in Bulacan. <strong><em>San Francisco</em></strong> is named after the Franciscan convent and church. <strong><em>Santa Potenciana</em></strong> is named after the patroness of Manila and a college for girls dedicated to her; the western end of this street is called <strong><em>San Agustin</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Novales</em></strong> is named after Capitan Andres Novales. <strong><em>Victoria</em></strong> is named after the 85-ton vessel used by Sebastian Elcano to circumnavigate the globe. Gen Douglas MacArthur built his headquarters at the western end of Victoria, giving it the address No 1 Victoria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>San Jose</em></strong>, named after the Colegio de San Jose, disappeared from the map, when the Jesuits petitioned the city to close the street and incorporate it as part of two adjacent compounds owned by the Jesuits. This made access to and from the Colegio de San Ignacio and Colegio de San Jose more convenient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Male&ccedil;on</em></strong> was a road built outside the walls, along the shore, and beyond the moat beginning at the mouth of the Pasig, and ending in a half-moon turn called Luneta. Part of the road has become Bonifacio Drive and Padre Burgos Ave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plazas<em>.</em></strong> Integral to the Renaissance-inspired colonial plans were plazas. These served as green areas for the city and as outdoor meeting places. The two largest plazas were: <strong><em>Plaza Militar</em></strong>, later called <strong><em>Plaza</em></strong> <em><strong>Moriones</strong></em>, and the <strong><em>Plaza Mayor</em></strong>. Located in front and southeast of Fort Santiago, Plaza Militar was used for military drills. Its perimeter was defined by the walls of the city and Almacenes or the royal storehouses and the Audiencia building. Inside Fort Santiago was <strong><em>Plaza de Armas</em></strong>, used for assembling troops as they changed guards for the walls of the fort and city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plaza Mayor stood in front of the Manila Cathedral. Around it were the most important buildings of the colonial era, the Cathedral, the Palacio del Gobernador, the Ayuntamiento, and the Real Audiencia. In 1824, a monument to Carlos IV was erected in the plaza to honor him for sending vaccines to control the spread of cholera in the 19th century. Bullfights and theatrical productions were held at the Plaza Mayor on several occasions. Plaza Mayor was renamed Plaza Roma to honor Pope Paul VI on his visit to the Philippines in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other minor plazas were located in front or near the principal buildings, like churches and educational institutions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/394\"><strong><em>Universidad de Santo Tomas</em></strong></a> (UST) had its own small plaza, where the statue honoring Abp Miguel de Benavides, founder of the Santo Tomas, used to stand. The statue is now in the Sampaloc campus of UST. <strong><em>Plaza Sampalucan</em></strong>, also known as <strong><em>Plaza de Santa Isabel</em></strong>, is presently the site of <strong><em>Memorare</em></strong>, a memorial to Intramuros&rsquo;s war victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fortification<em>. Fuerza de Santiago</em></strong> or Fort Santiago was the military fortification attached to the walled city. Built at the site of Rajah Sulayman&rsquo;s fortified palisade, the site was captured by the invading troops led by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi in 1571.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Intramuros&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortifications</a> consisted of walls, <strong>bastiones,</strong> and their variations: the <strong>falsabraga</strong>, <strong>plataforma</strong>, and <strong>media naranja</strong>. The walls connecting the bastions are called <strong>cortina</strong> or curtain wall. On the walls are parapets, a walkway for sentries, and the cylindrical <strong>garita</strong> or guardhouse used in inclement weather. Within the walls are barracks, officers&rsquo;s quarters, jail and dungeon, and storehouses. Outside the walls and protecting its perimeter was a moat and outer defenses called fortin, small independent forts, ravelin that protected the entrances, and <strong>luneta</strong> that helped reinforce the corners of the bastions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal parts of Fort Santiago are <strong><em>Falsabraga de Santa Barbara</em></strong>, named after the patroness of the artillery corps. It was probably built ca 1739. Near it is the <strong><em>Plataforma de Santa Barbara</em></strong>, a level area to mount artillery and probably part of the oldest section of Fort Santiago. Adjacent to Santa Barbara is the <strong><em>Falsabraga Media Naranja</em></strong>. It is called media naranja because its plan is a semicircle, or picturesquely, half an orange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other bastions are: <strong><em>Medio Bastion de San Francisco</em></strong>, called medio bastion because it lacks a full flank; <strong><em>Baluartillo (Bastion) de San Francisco</em></strong>, named after San Francisco de Asis, founder of the Franciscan order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the wall, facing the sea and near the Baluartillo de San Francisco is the <strong><em>Reducto (Fort&iacute;n) de San Francisco</em></strong>, an independent outer fortification, connected to the main walls by a walkway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Bastion Hererias Maestranza</em></strong> is named after two adjacent structures: Hererias or the royal foundry and the Maestranza or royal armory, both located beside Plaza Militar. Both structures are outside the south wall of Fort Santiago. No remains stand above ground, but foundations have been uncovered by archaeologists. Also in the area is <strong><em>Bastion de San Lorenzo</em></strong> which is named after San Lorenzo Martir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city of Manila, the non-military part, was separated from Fort Santiago by a gate and a moat in front of it. From the 18th century, a stone bridge connected the Fort with the city. The bridge was positioned to the western side of Fort Santiago&rsquo;s entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>City Fortification<em>.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Baluartillo de San Juan</em></strong> or small bastion of San Juan is named after San Juan Bautista on whose feast day, 24 Jun 1571, the City of Manila was founded. <strong><em>Bastion de San Jose</em></strong> is named after San Jose, the foster father of Jesus. The <strong><em>Reducto (Fort&iacute;n) de San Pedro</em></strong> is named after San Pedro Apostol&mdash;this is an independent outer fortification and connected to the main walls by a walkway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Bastion de San Diego</em></strong>, also known as Santiago, is built around an older fortification erected by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Fr Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a> in the late 16th century. It is named <strong><em>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia</em></strong>. Presently, the bastion and its lower section, the site of the Fundicion or foundry, is a garden park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Basti&oacute;n Plano de Santa Isabel</em></strong> is named after Santa Isabel, the cousin of the Virgin Mary. <strong><em>Baluartillo de San Eugenio</em></strong> is named after San Eugenio, who was the Pope from 654 to 657. <strong><em>Revellin de la Puerta Real de Bagumbayan</em></strong> is an outer fortification built to protect the Royal gate built after the British occupation of Manila from 1762 to 1764. The ravelin housed an aquarium in the 20th century. The ravelin faced the native settlement of Bagumbayan, whose site is now occupied by Luneta Park. <strong><em>Bagumbayan</em></strong> was so named because the Tagalog who were eased out of the area occupied by Intramuros built a new village (literally,&nbsp;<em>bagong bayan</em>) outside the southern perimeter of the walled city. It had its own parish church built and administered by the Recollects. The church was ordered demolished after the British occupation because attackers of the walled city could use it as a defensive position during a siege, which was what the British did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Bastion de San Andres</em></strong> is named after San Andres, proclaimed patron of Manila, after the attack by the Chinese Limahong in 1574 was successfully repulsed on the feast of San Andres on 30 Nov. San Andres is the brother of San Pedro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Revellin de Recoletos</em></strong> is an outer defense to protect the gate near the church of the Recollects. It is presently restored and reused by Escuela Taller, a school that trains out of school youths in restoration techniques and preserves the building tradition of the colonial era. <strong><em>Bastion de San Francisco de Dilao</em></strong> is named as such because it faced the district of Dilao, a Japanese enclave, east of the walls. The district was transferred to Paco and the residences were demolished after the British left Manila in 1764. <strong><em>Revellin de Parian</em></strong> protected the gate with the same name and led to the Parian, the Chinese district outside the walls. <strong><em>Bastion de San Gabriel</em></strong> is named after the Archangel Gabriel. <strong><em>Bastion de Santo Domingo</em></strong> is so named because of its close proximity to the Dominican compound. The bastion was demolished in the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Puertas<em>.</em></strong> Piercing the fortification wall and allowing controlled access in and out of the walled city were <strong>puertas</strong> or gates. Some gates had drawbridges, which in the 19th century were raised at 11 in the evening, when a curfew was imposed. The principal gates were Real and Parian. <strong>Real</strong> (royal) was a ceremonial gate used by the governor-general and the archbishop of Manila. In 1780, it was relocated where it presently stands, along Muralla St. The gate is protected by the Revellin de la Puerta Real and a curved stone bridge. The Parian gate faced Manila&rsquo;s Chinese quarters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Near Parian and along the north curtain wall is <strong><em>Puerta de Isabel II</em></strong>, named in honor of Queen Isabel II. It was the last gate to be built in 1861. It replaced Magallanes, a small gate that opened to the Pasig River bank and the monument to Ferdinand Magellan, along the southern bank of the Pasig River. <strong><em>Santo Domingo</em></strong> was built near the Dominican compound. The gate and the bastion named Santo Domingo were demolished in 1904 to open the city to commerce along the Pasig. <strong><em>Almacenes</em></strong>, located between the Intendencia and Fort Santiago, was likewise demolished in 1904, together with a length of curtain wall from San Juan de Letr&aacute;n to Fort Santiago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the seaward and western side are <strong><em>Postigo</em></strong> or postern gate, used as an emergency exit and <strong><em>Santa Lucia</em></strong>, near the San Agustin cloister. Badly damaged during World War II, it was rebuilt following original plans. The drawbridge was restored and part of the moat passing under the bridge was rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in all bastioned forts, straight walls called <strong>cortina</strong> or curtain wall, connected the bastions. The cortina did not have specific names unlike the bastions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the walls were military and civic buildings, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, chapels and convents, and private residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Military Buildings.&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Maestranza</em></strong> was a weapons arsenal outside Fort Santiago. Beside it was a foundry, <strong><em>Herrerias</em></strong>. Nothing remains of either structure. There is no clear data how the buildings looked. They were probably functional boxy structures, with little ornamentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The barracks on the fort&rsquo;s western flank, undamaged during World War II, was restored for the centennial of Rizal&rsquo;s birth in 1961 and redesigned in 1996, the centennial of the Philippine Revolution and Rizal&rsquo;s execution. Since 1961, the barracks has been called <strong><em>Rizal Shrine</em></strong> to commemorate and honor the national hero. It houses memorabilia, copies of Rizal&rsquo;s writing, and award-winning paintings depicting moments Rizal&rsquo;s life. The paintings were made in 1961 for the national hero&rsquo;s birth centennial. A room has been converted to a life-sized diorama depicting Rizal&rsquo;s incarceration in Fort Santiago, prior to his execution. Rizal, contrary to common belief, was not incarcerated in this building but in the one opposite it beside the Pasig River. This is now in ruins and has been reused as an open <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theater</a>, Rajah Sulayman Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Fundicion</em></strong> or foundry, beside Bastion de San Diego, was built on a site said to have been the workshop of Panday Pira. Nothing remains of the structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Cuarteles de Espa&ntilde;a</em></strong> was built on the site of the ruined 17th-century <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio</a>. Nothing remains of the structure. The site is presently occupied by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. The only visual evidence left of the Cuarteles is an 1852 proposal of Manuel Herbella, where a floor plan in red ink is superimposed over the floor plan of the San Ignacio and the adjoining cloister, drawn in black. There are no remains of the Cuarteles de Espa&ntilde;a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Cuartel de Santa Lucia</em></strong>, located near the Santa Lucia gate, was built in 1781 as the barracks for the Artelleria de la Monta&ntilde;a, following the plans of Tomas Sanz. In 1901, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) occupied the building, and on 17 Feb 1905 the Philippine Officers School was opened at the site. In 1908, the school was moved to Baguio, where it was renamed Philippine Military Academy (PMA). Damaged during World War II, its walls were reconstructed by the PC, which owned the property, but the interior was not rebuilt. What has remained after the restoration is a facade in the neoclassical style, with the central section and portal slightly higher than the rest because of the addition of a pediment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Hospital Militar</em></strong> was located near the Monasterio de Santa Clara, facing the Ayuntamiento. The <strong><em>Capilla Militar</em></strong>, dedicated to the Incarnation of Jesus, was the military chapel. It faced Plaza Militar, outside Fort Santiago. No remains of these structures stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Civic Buildings.</strong> The first residence of the governor-generals, <strong><em>Palacio del Gobernador</em></strong>, was built near Fort Santiago. During the governorship of Fausto Cruzat y Gongora (1690-1701), a building following an atrial plan was built at the present site of the Palacio. The southern side of the Palacio was used as a palace, and the north was used by the Audiencia. In 1850, the palace was given a neoclassical facade. The building was characterized by its arched windows and entrances, three arched entrances all told, and its rusticated stone work at the first floor. The upper floor was ornamented by engaged columns. The building suffered damage during the earthquake of 3 Jun 1863. After laying new foundations, plans to restore the Palacio were abandoned when another earthquake struck in 1880. It was decided to transfer the palace to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>. The building remained in ruins until it was rebuilt by Imelda Marcos and used as the office of the Ministry of Human Settlements. The reconstruction had been controversial from the very start. Preserving the remaining walls of the two-story palacio, the reconstruction added twelve more stories, almost exceeding the height of the Manila Cathedral&rsquo;s bell tower. Laws covering post-World War II development in Intramuros stipulated nothing could be built taller than the Cathedral&rsquo;s bell tower, as had been the law during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial era</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ayuntamiento</em></strong>, also known as <strong>cabildo</strong> and <strong>casas consistoriales</strong>, was the city hall of the City of Manila where the cabildo or city council met. An early building of cut stone was built before 1607, and rebuilt in 1684, probably because it was damaged by an earthquake. A new building was constructed from 1735 to 1738; it survived to the 18th century. A new neoclassical building was designed by Eduardo Navarro. Construction began in 1879 and was completed about 1885. In the 20th century, it was the site of the Philippine Assembly of 1907. Its most celebrated room was the Marble Hall, noted for its harlequin floor of white and black marble. The building was ruined in 1945 and remained in ruins for more than seven decades. It was reconstructed in 2011 by the Bureau of Treasury and reused as its main office. The main section, including the celebrated Marble Hall has been reconstructed, but the wings flanking the main section have interiors that, while respecting the historic structure, have been made functional as a modern office. In the reconstruction, the lines of the original 19th-century plan were followed, preserving the arched doorway, quadrilateral windows, rustication on the first floor, while the balconies of the second were repaired and reconstructed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Audiencia</em></strong> was the supreme court of Spanish colonial Philippines. It shared the same building as the Palacio until 1788, when a site was purchased and built for it across Aduana St. The Audiencia building was connected to the Palacio by a bridge over Aduana. The Audiencia had its own chapel and a jail. The building was damaged by the earthquake of 1863 and never rebuilt. Its site is presently occupied by a fire station. Very little evidence exists to describe the Audiencia building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em><strong>Aduana</strong> </em>or Customs house, also known as <strong>Intendencia,</strong> replaced the Alcaiceria de San Fernando which was built in 1752. It was located on the northern bank of the Pasig River. The Aduana followed the neoclassical design of Tomas Cortes. Plans for the building were submitted in 1822 and construction began the following year. It was completed in 1829. The building also housed the city corporation or Intendencia. It was damaged during World War II and remains as a ruin. There were plans to restore the building to house the Spanish collection of the National Archives, officially known as Records Management and Archival Office (RMAO). The building is a two-story structure built around anatrium. The facade is divided into five sections. The central portion has three arched portals corresponding to three bays, above the bays are grilled balconies accessed through French windows. On either side of the central portion are five bays. The pair nearest the center is projected slightly forward over the remaining four. These bays have quadrilateral windows and oculi on the first floor and the arched windows on the second floor. The arched windows were apparently a renovation. Antique photographs show that the oculi, rather than arched windows, pierced this section of the wall. The corner bays are about the same dimension as the central section; the first floor has a quadrilateral window and the second floor a balcony and French windows, topped by an ornamental triangular pediment. The central and corner sections have pilasters defining the vertical sweep of the building. The pilasters have garlanded Ionic capitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Churches, Convents, and Monasteries.</strong> Intramuros was the city of churches and convents. It was the seat of archdiocese of Manila, the Metropolitan or main archdiocese under which all other dioceses fell. In it were the motherhouses of the religious orders, the contemplative nuns, sisters, and beatas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong><em>Catedral Mayor de Manila</em></strong></a> was dedicated to the Inmaculada Concepcion. It was rebuilt at least eight times, the last after World War II, between 1954 and 1958. The 1958 reconstruction incorporated parts of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Romanesque</a> cathedral built after the earthquakes of 1863 and 1872.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Sagrario</em></strong>, built beside the cathedral as a chapel of the cathedral canons, was not rebuilt after it was damaged by the earthquake of 1880.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\"><strong><em>San Agustin</em></strong></a>, the oldest church in the Philippines, was begun in 1587 and completed in 1607. The church and the adjoining monastery cloister survived World War II. The second and third cloisters were damaged. Presently, the surviving cloister has a museum of religious art. The area of the second cloister has been partially rebuilt. An Augustinian novitiate and seminary were built on the site of the third cloister. The new building is in the colonial style although it is not a reconstruction of the third cloister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Agustin church, as it is popularly known, was dedicated to San Pablo. It consisted of a single nave, flanked by collateral chapels that serve as internal buttresses to the structure. The chapels terminate just outside the sanctuary and the shallow dome, in front of the sanctuary, to form a cruciform plan. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altars</a> in the church range in style from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> to the neoclassical. Outstanding is the trompe l&rsquo;oiel painting of the church and the grille work that leads from the transept to the cloister. Also noteworthy is the church&rsquo;s stone vault, the only such vault that has survived almost intact from the colonial era. The church facade is plain, two stories with a triangular pediment and flanked by bell towers. The tower on the gospel side was damaged by the earthquake of 1872, taken down, and never rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>San Francisco</em></strong> was the popular name of the Franciscan church in Intramuros. Thirteen Franciscans arrived in Manila in 1578, the second religious order to arrive in the Philippines. By 1602, they had built a church of stone dedicated to Our Lady of the Angels. Other churches were built before that. The church, begun in 1739, survived in substance to the 20th century, but was destroyed during World War II, with only its facade remaining. The facade was torn down after the war during the clean-up of Intramuros. It was in the baroque style. The church was tall and narrow, rising to three stories, and capped by a truncated triangular pediment. Over the pediment, the bell tower was built in a style reminiscent of the <strong>espada&ntilde;a</strong> belfry. The facade was divided into five sections, where the corner vertical sections projected beyond the line of the facade forming buttresses <strong>.</strong> The remaining three sections were defined by engaged Corinthian columns, single at the side and double at the central section for the church&rsquo;s main entrance. The facade was divided horizontally by pairs of bands and the walls decorated with niches and windows. Blind hexagonal windows decorated the pediment and the third story of the bays flanking the central section. The second story, corresponding to the choir loft, had arched windows; Roman at the side and trefoil Mudejar arches for the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Venerable Tercera Orden</em></strong> (VOT) church was built perpendicular to San Francisco for members of the lay branch of the Franciscan order or Third Order (tertiaries). The church was dedicated to the Inmaculada Conception and constructed from 1723 to 1734. During World War II, the church suffered the same fate as the San Francisco. It bore striking similarities with the San Francisco, being three stories and divided into five bays. But the differences are obvious at the uppermost story, where the pediment is not truncated but rather triangular and integrated into flanking straight parapets. Over the bays flanking the central entrance are bell towers crowned with spire-like roof reminiscent of neo-Gothic <strong>.</strong> After World War II, the VOT church was not rebuilt, rather the tertiaries of Intramuros merged with the tertiaries of Sampaloc, where a postwar VOT church was built beside the Church of Our Lady of Loreto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Recoletos</em></strong> was the church built by a reformed branch of the Augustinian order that arrived in Manila in 1606. The church was built in the lot presently occupied by <strong><em>The Manila Bulletin</em></strong>. The church that survived to the 20th century, like the San Francisco, rose to three stories. The tall third and uppermost story, which is integrated into the triangular pediment, gave the church extra height equivalent to a four-story building. Blind octagonal oculi decorate the pediment, while niches and windows decorate the three vertical sections of the facade. The bell tower to the left of the facade rested on a tall plinth. Consisting of four stories of diminishing dimensions, it was capped by a bell-shaped stone roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was the church interior, however, that distinguished the church.The main altar was in the baroque style. Divided into niches and stories, the gilded <strong>retablo</strong> alternated images and painted canvases. In this church, the famous Recollect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/820\">organ</a> builder, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\">Fr Diego Cera</a>, who built the Las Pi&ntilde;as bamboo organ, constructed his masterpiece. He built a massive pipe organ, outfitting the nave with pipes, some ingenuously hidden along the sides of the nave so that when sounded, the walls themselves seemed to sing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jesuits built two churches called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\"><strong><em>San Ignacio</em></strong></a>, in honor of their founder Ignatius of Loyola, on two different sites. The first was completed 1632, destroyed by the 1852 earthquake; and the second was completed 1889, destroyed in 1945. The first San Ignacio was baroque, the second was neoclassical. The Italian Jesuit priest-architect, Gianantonio Campioni, designed the first San Ignacio. The construction of the church began in 1626 and was completed in 1632. This was actually the third church built by the Jesuits at the site presently occupied by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. A first church of wood with a tile roof was built in 1587, with donations from the&nbsp;<em>oidor&nbsp;</em>(judge) Don Gabriel de Ribera. A second church of stone, dedicated to Santa Ana, the mother of the Virgin Mary, was built between 1590-96, following plans drawn up by the Jesuit Antonio Sede&ntilde;o. The church was modeled upon Il Ges&uacute;, the Jesuits&rsquo;s mother church in Rome. The church was damaged by the earthquake of 1600. The third church as it came from Campioni may have been more Italianate baroque rather than Spanish. In the 18th century the church was solemnly consecrated after being renovated by the imposition of bas-relief foliage in the voids of the facade making it appear more Plateresque than Italianate. The decorations were not received favorably by all. The church interior was painted by the Jesuit brother Manuel Rodriguez, assisted by Tagalog apprentices, in 1700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines in 1768 and their properties confiscated and placed on public auction. Abandoned from 1768 to 1784, the church deteriorated. In 1771, the archbishop of Manila requested authorization to use the Colegio de Manila, adjacent to the church for the Seminario de San Carlos, but approval was not given immediately. The seminary took possession of the college and church in 1784. The church was damaged beyond repair by the earthquake of 6 Sep 1852.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second San Ignacio was built along Arzobispo St, beside the archbishop&rsquo;s palace. It was designed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>. The wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2290\">interior</a> and statuary were designed and executed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> and his atelier from 1882 onward. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2290\">altars</a> and pulpit by Agustin Saez, who was director of the art academy in Manila and art teacher at the Ateneo Municipal. This church was completed in 1889. The second San Ignacio was in the neoclassical idiom, although its interior with an arcade and elevated galleries running the length of the nave was more Renaissance in style. So was the church&rsquo;s <strong>artesonado</strong> or coffered ceiling. The facade was built of bricks and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>piedra de Visayas</strong></a> (coral or limestone), with white Cararra marble used for the engaged pillars, portals, and windows. The interior was covered with dark hardwood from the forests of Surigao. Wood <strong>relieves</strong> of Jesuit saints decorated the interior. The church survived the fire that ravaged the Ateneo in 1932. When the Ateneo moved to Ermita, the church became a parish. The church was ruined during the liberation of Manila in 1945. The property was acquired by the city of Manila and rented out to different companies. At one time it was the E.J. Neil Warehouse. The ruined walls of San Ignacio still stood after World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After completing the archaeological survey of the site of the church and the adjoining lot, where the Casa Mision or the Jesuit headquarters once stood, the Intramuros Administration (IA) began working on the reconstruction of the church, which would be reused as the IA&rsquo;s museum of ecclesiastical art. The reconstruction is ongoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside San Ignacio stood the <strong><em>Casa Mision</em></strong>, the residence of the Jesuits in Intramuros, which housed both the faculty of the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and the Jesuit superiors of the Philippine Mission. The Casa Mision was built like a typical 19th century <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) with a lower story of stone and an upper story of wood. The city government authorized the construction of a covered bridge above Anda Street linking the Casa Mision with the Ateneo Municipal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Capuchino</em></strong> was built by a branch of the Franciscan order called the Capuchins, who are so named because of the color of their habits. All its members sported full beards, which distinguished them further from the Franciscans. The Capuchins introduced devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes. They built the church along Calle Real del Palacio, which was completed in 1894. It was the last of the Spanish colonial churches to be built. The design was modern in orientation, a simplified version of Romanesque. Planned as a cruciform, with a dome at the transept crossing, the church was characterized by a repetitive and harmonious use of the Roman arch. Its facade was flanked by bell towers, quadrilateral in design and crowned by domes and lanterns. The Roman arches were used in the portals and the windows. The church had three arched portals corresponding to the nave and the lateral aisles. Inside, the space was defined by a colonnade <strong>,</strong> above which were galleries. The faux vault was a semicircular arch. The sanctuary had a neoclassical altar composed of three arch niches. The church was damaged in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church site is now occupied by <strong><em>El Amanecer</em></strong>, which houses Silahis Arts &amp; Artifacts, and the Ilustrado Restaurant. After World War II, the Capuchins transferred their central house to Quezon City, in a lot along Retiro St, where they built a church in honor of Our Lady of Lourdes. Like the Lourdes of Intramuros, the church in Quezon City was Manila&rsquo;s favorite for fashionable weddings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong><em>Santo Domingo</em></strong></a> was built beside the University of Santo Tomas on the northeastern flank of Intramuros, near the Pasig. Four other churches had been built on the site before the fifth, and last of the Santo Domingos was constructed. It was in the neo-Gothic style, designed by Felix Roxas Sr, with construction supervised by Fr Sixto, OP and Fr Ristoro, OP. It was completed in 1865. The church was damaged by Japanese bombardment on 21 Dec 1941, the first church to be destroyed during World War II. Although built to honor Santo Domingo de Guzman, founder of the Dominican order, the church was better known for the Feast of La Naval, celebrated annually on 7 Oct. This feast in honor of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2247\">Our Lady of the Rosary</a> commemorates the victory of the Spanish against the Dutch, who tried to invade Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Roxas-designed church replaced an earlier church, the fourth on the spot, which had just inaugurated a new facade on 15 Jun 1862. It was demolished by the devastating earthquake of 1863. The facade was said to have been patterned after Christopher Wren&rsquo;s plans for St Paul&rsquo;s in London, i.e. it was in the neoclassical idiom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roxas opted for another Revivalist style, the neo-Gothic. But because neo-Gothic was characterized by height, Roxas designed the fifth Santo Domingo such that the upper story was made of wood and metal, resting on a lower story of stone, as a precaution against earthquakes. The neo-Gothic idiom adapted throughout the church was evident in both the exterior and interior&mdash;lancet windows, tracery, even the altars and the furniture were embellished with neo-Gothic motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the church was destroyed in 1941, some of its appurtenances, especially the ivory image of the Santo Rosario, sculpted in 1595, were saved because they had been kept in the church&rsquo;s vault. The site of Santo Domingo is presently occupied by Far East Bank, Tuason-Gonzales Bldg, Beneficial Life, Letr&aacute;n&rsquo;s gym, and a parking lot. After World War II, the Dominicans built a new Santo Domingo, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Maria Zaragoza</a> in the Spanish Moderne style, along Quezon Blvd in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Real Monasterio de Santa Clara</strong> </em>was the monastery of the Clarisas, the female branch of the Franciscan order that traces its origin to Santa Clara de Asis. The royal monastery in Manila was founded by Sor Geronima Asunc&iacute;on, a relative of the Spanish monarch, in 1621. Arriving in April that year, in the same ship taken by Bp Juan de Renteria who was appointed to Nueva Segovia, were 24 Franciscan nuns. After staying for a while in the house owned by Do&ntilde;a Ana de Vera in Sampaloc, they moved to the Franciscan convent in the same village until 31 Oct, when they took possession of two houses in Intramuros owned by De Vera and Maestre de Campo Pedro Chaves. The following year, a church dedicated to the Immaculate Conception was built beside the residence. Fr Diego de la Torre, who had worked as a master builder at the Escorial, supervised its construction. The nuns remained in the convent until 1658, when an earthquake forced them to live in a private house in the walled city until such time as they were able to raise a new convent and church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following their rules of seclusion, the nuns built a 30-foot windowless wall that cut them from the city. Located at the northeastern quadrant of the city, between Plaza Militar and the city walls, the nuns enjoyed seclusion and privacy. Architecturally the monastery compound was simple and undistinguished, in keeping with the austerity of the Poor Clares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Damaged during World War II, the Intramuros monastery was not rebuilt. The Monasterio de Santa Clara transferred to Katipunan Ave&nbsp;in Quezon City, on a site overlooking the Marikina Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Beaterio de la Compa&ntilde;ia</em></strong> was founded by Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo, a mestiza Chinese from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>. The turn of the 19th century beaterio was located along Santa Lucia, near the Colegio de San Ignacio. The beatas went to the Jesuits for spiritual direction and church services. The beaterio was damaged during World War II and the site became a warehouse. The beaterio was restored by the Department of Tourism and became a history museum featuring life-size dioramas. The Spanish colonial beaterio was a long building, sparsely ornamented. Its only distinctive feature was the chapel at the north end of the building, which had a pitched roof. Otherwise the building would have been a plain box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Beaterio de Santa Catalina</em></strong> was founded by the Dominican tertiaries in 1633. Its building was not rebuilt. The Dominican tertiaries transferred to Quezon City, where Sienna College was established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Educational Institutions</strong>. Universidad de Santo Tomas is the oldest continually existing university in the Philippines. It was established by the Dominicans in 1611, and was initially funded by a bequest from Abp Miguel de Benavides, OP, who left his library and 1,000 pesos to the Dominicans in his will. It received the name Colegio de Santo Tomas in 1617 and, in 1619, occupied its own building. In 1623, Philip IV authorized the college to teach grammar, arts, and theology. A papal brief authorized it to confer degrees. In 1680, it was given royal protection and came to be known as a Royal university, hence the honorific title the university bears today &ldquo;Real y pontificia universid&aacute;d&rdquo; (Royal and pontifical university). After the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Philippines in 1768, the Dominicans acquired the abandoned buildings of the Jesuits where they opened the university&rsquo;s college of medicine and pharmacy. They also took charge of the diocesan seminary, housed in what was formerly the Colegio de San Jose. Damaged during World War II, the university reopened at its Sampaloc campus, established in 1940, a year before the war&rsquo;s Pacific campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fernandez de Roxas&rsquo;s map of 1727 depicts Santo Tomas as a simple atrial-type structure near the convent of Santo Domingo. The structure enclosed a garden and was distinguished by a tall tower on its northern flank. From 1625 to 1940, the famous printing press of Santo Tomas was located in the wing nearest the Pasig. The press had moved from the Parian to different provinces, and then to the Hospital de San Gabriel from 1621 to 1625. The 19th century Santo Tomas building was in the style of a bahay na bato, where the upper story overhung the lower story. The facade, built in the 18th century, was remodeled to make it appear more monumental sometime in the 20th century, a few years before the building&rsquo;s destruction in 1945. Except for the main portal, the windows and apertures of the building were quadrilateral. The main entrance, made of adobe, had a semicircular portal flanked by niches with trefoil arches. Pilasters separated the portal from the niches. The central portal led straight to another arch portal, which led to the atrium around which other wings of the university were built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ateneo Municipal de Manila</em></strong> was turned over to Jesuit administration by the city of Manila in 1859. In Dec 1859, the Jesuits began instruction in a modest building along Arzobispo St, near the archbishop&rsquo;s residence. Founded and supported by the city, the school was allowed to bear Manila&rsquo;s coat of arms. The institution began as a boarding school but started accepting day boarders. This school was later expanded with the addition of a preparatory college that prepared students for studies in the university, offering such courses as pre-law, surveying, and mechanics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school was built around an atrium on a lot bounded by Arzobispo, Santa Lucia, and Anda. The school building was two stories and resembled a bahay na bato, with a lower story of stone and an upper one of wood. At the turn of the 19th century, a third floor was added to the school buildings. In the early 20th century, an elaborate entrance was designed and executed by Isabelo Tampinco. After a fire in 1932 that ravaged the southwestern quadrant of Intramuros, and the Ateneo with it, the student boarders moved to a building in Ermita which was built for the Escuela Normal de San Francisco Xavier, a school for teachers which closed in 1902. During World War II, the Ateneo moved its quarters to different parts of the city while trying to maintain a semblance of normality. By the end of the war, the buildings on Ermita, along the road now named after the Jesuit founder of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/336\">Manila Observatory</a>, Fr&nbsp;Federico Faura, were in ruins. In 1951, the Jesuits transferred the Ateneo to Loyola Heights in Quezon City, where it has remained. In 1959, Ateneo became a university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Colegio de Manila</em></strong> (<strong><em>Colegio de San Ignacio</em></strong>) was established by the Jesuits in 1595 for the children of the Spanish community in Manila. The school opened its door to students in 1596. The college building, described as sumptuous and beautiful was damaged by the earthquake of 1645. The building was apparently repaired a number of times, following, for instance, another earthquake in 1658. With the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, the college was dissolved and its buildings sequestered by the government. The archbishop of Manila requested to use the building and the adjacent church for the Seminario de San Carlos in 1771. In 1784, the seminary finally occupied the buildings. In the 19th century, the college and church site were taken over by the military and became the Cuarteles de Espa&ntilde;a. Whatever remained of the ancient building was razed in 1900, when the American 31st Infantry took over from the Spanish. The church site became a basketball court for soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The college building was built around an atrium and rose to three stories in some parts. In the college was the Imprenta de la Compa&ntilde;ia, responsible for publishing the first Tagalog&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\">pasyon</a>&nbsp;</em>in 1703, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2233\">1734 map of Pedro Murillo Velarde</a>, and the dictionaries of Mateo Sanchez and Juan de Noceda and Pedro de San Lucar. Bro Georg Kamel, noted for his botanical studies, kept a garden of Philippine flora and opened a pharmacy there. The site is presently occupied by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Colegio de San Juan de Letran</em></strong>, a school run by the Dominicans, traces its origins to two institutions&mdash;Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Huerfanos, founded by Capit&aacute;n Juan Rodrigo Jeronimo Guerrero in 1620 as a school for orphaned boys, chiefly children of military personnel; and Colegio de Huerfanos de San Jos&eacute; y San Pablo founded by Bro Diego de Sta Maria, OP. Guerrero&rsquo;s school began in a modest house in front of the Hospital de San Juan de Dios and near the Parian gate. Guerrero not only educated the boys but also fed and clothed them. The number of students grew steadily, and Guerrero, who had become a Dominican brother, appealed for public support. King Philip IV placed the school under Royal protection in 1623. Guerrero&rsquo;s school was merged with the Dominicans&rsquo;s foundation in 1640. The Dominicans built a stone building for 200 students for the merged schools near their church. But in 1645 an earthquake destroyed the building so the students were temporarily moved to the Parian until 1668 when a new school building was opened in its present site in Intramuros. (Interestingly, the Mu&ntilde;oz map of 1671 depicts Letr&aacute;n as still occupying a lot in Parian.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fourth structure was built at the corner of the Baluarte de San Gabriel in 1699. Letr&aacute;n has since occupied this site.In 1690, the school was elevated to an ecclesiastical college. In 1865, it was classified as a&nbsp;<em>colegio de primera clase en Filipina</em>s. The turn-of-the-century school building was in the style of the bahay na bato but with the influence of the Victorian gingerbread house style, evident in its delicate wooden tracery and pierced soffit ceiling. That building was apparently replaced by a three-story structure, which was completed in 1937, a few years before the outbreak of war. The school buildings were damaged twice during World War II. First, in 1941 during the initial bombing of Manila, and second in 1945, during the liberation of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rebuilt and renovated after the war, the school occupied the same lot it owned since the late 17th century. The 20th century building alluded to Spanish colonial style in ornamentation but is basically a modern building. When the Colegio de Santa Catalina transferred to Quezon City, Letran acquired its site and blocked off the street that separated Letr&aacute;n from Santa Catalina, forming one large lot. A street perpendicular to the school site is named San Juan de Letr&aacute;n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Colegio de San Jose</em></strong> was founded in 1586 by a royal decree for candidates to the priesthood and for Spanish boys and mestizos. In 1595, Gov-Gen Gomez Perez de Dasmari&ntilde;as set aside 1,000 pesos for 10 scholars, and in 1596, Esteban de Figueroa, encomendero of Oton, bequeathed his fortune toward the foundation of the school. The Jesuits inaugurated the college in 1601; but by 1605 its buildings were recorded as needing repair.In 1610, the college was reorganized as an endowed school (funds from Figueroa&rsquo;s estate) and&nbsp;<em>obras pias</em>. In 1641, Gov-Gen Hurtado de Corcuera ordered the street separating San Jos&eacute; and the Colegio de Manila closed, creating one large compound for the Jesuit institutions. The earthquakes of 1645 and 1648 damaged the college building. The building was apparently being repaired or renovated when the Jesuits were expelled in 1768. The building was then acquired by the archbishop of Manila for the seminarians of the archdiocese. In 1870, a royal decree classified San Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s assets as government property and the college was secularized. In 1875, the secularization decree was repealed, and San Jos&eacute; became a college of medicine under the king and the governor. Day-to-day administration was turned over to the Dominicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Jos&eacute; was planned as a two-story E-shaped building enclosing two gardens. The longest wing was parallel to Muralla, and the westernmost wing apparently housed a stable. The college building was destroyed during World War II. The site is presently occupied by the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Near the college, the Jesuits opened a school for boys and girls but its precise location is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Beaterio y Colegio de Santa Catalina</em></strong> has a long history. In 1633, female Dominican tertiaries, under Mother Francisca del Espiritu Santo and companions requested permission to establish a&nbsp;<em>beaterio&nbsp;</em>and a college. The request was met with opposition from the Franciscan tertiaries who claimed that there were already too many beaterios. But Carlos II authorized the foundation, which was known as the Dominican sisters of the tertiary order.In 1696, a house was opened behind Letr&aacute;n, at the corner of Beaterio and Cerrada (now San Juan de Letr&aacute;n). In 1706, a college for girls was established and in 1716 was placed under royal patronage. By the mid-19th century, it was a college of note and was converted to the Escuela Normal de Maestras. In 1863, it was authorized to offer teacher-training, and starting in 1881 conferred the academic degree of&nbsp;<em>maestra normal</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The college buildings in the style of an oversized bahay na bato were damaged in the earthquake of 1863 and 1880, but by 1883 had been rebuilt. In 1894, the building was expanded and, in 1939, another story and a new facade were added. Damaged in World War II by Japanese bombs, the buildings were no longer usable, so the tertiaries moved the college to Legarda St, while the tertiaries&rsquo;s convent was moved to Sampaloc. The college building was not rebuilt after the war and San Juan de Letr&aacute;n acquired the school site. After the war, the&nbsp;<em>beatas&nbsp;</em>were reorganized as the Congregation of St Catherine of Siena. In 1962, the school transferred to Quezon City and is now known as Siena College (shortened from Santa Catalina de Siena).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Colegio de Santa Isabel</em></strong> was established in 1594 by the Hermandad de la Santa Misericordia with the sole purpose of aiding the Hospital de San Juan de Dios. Later, the brotherhood took on the burden of being the patron of a school founded in 1632 for the daughters of military personnel who died leaving no inheritance for their children. The college was initially housed in a private residence until a lot was found near San Agustin, along Real del Palacio corner of Recogida. In 1733, the college received Royal protection. In 1800 the college boasted of capacious and sumptuous buildings. It was a two-story structure which was built longitudinally. It was very similar to a bahay na bato. Damaged by the 1863 earthquake, the school was rebuilt. The following year administration transferred to the Daughters of Charity and, in 1866, the Colegio de Santa Potenciana was merged with it. In 1882, the offices of Monte de Piedad were opened in the college building. Because of the numerous donations and endowments, the college was perhaps the most important institution for women. Under the Daughters of Charity, the school was modernized, achieving a level similar to that in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1945, the college buildings were completely destroyed. The sisters transferred the school to a new site along <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave</a> where it continues in its task of education. The ancient college had a miraculous crucifix called Cristo del Tesoro, because it belonged to the Royal treasury. The crucifix is in the chapel of the modern school edifice. The site of Santa Isabel in Intramuros is now occupied by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Real Colegio de Santa Potenciana</em></strong>, the oldest school for young girls, was established in 1589 by Philip II, upon the urging of Manila bishop Domingo de Salazar, OP and the Franciscans.In 1592, the school drew up its charter. The same year, Capit&aacute;n Luis de Vivanco donated the original site for the college, where a wooden house was built as dwelling and school for orphaned girls. The college had apparently improved its buildings subsequently because it was reported that in 1645 an earthquake had destroyed the college, now apparently made of stone. By the 17th century, the school had transferred to the corner of Cabildo and Santa Potenciana, according to the Mu&ntilde;oz map of 1671. By the end of the 18th century, a new structure had to be constructed, as the school building was in ruins because, according to Zu&ntilde;iga, it was poorly built in the first place. By the 19th century, Santa Potenciana had transferred its site to the corner of Real del Palacio and Santa Potenciana. The exact year is uncertain, although a map of Manila published in <strong><em>Buzeta</em></strong>, 1851, indicates the school still occupied its old site at this time. On the new site, a new structure may have been built by the first half of the 19th century because after the 1863 earthquake had destroyed the Palacio, government offices were moved to this building in 1866. By this time enrollment in the school had considerably dropped and the handful of student boarders were made to transfer to the Colegio de Santa Isabel. Merging the two institutions of learning resulted in the dissolution of the Colegio de Santa Potenciana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Veterans Bank and the Red Cross building presently occupy the old site of Santa Potenciana and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Colegio de Santa Rosa</em></strong>, also known as <strong><em>Colegio de Madre Paula</em></strong>, was initially known as <strong><em>Beaterio y Casa de Ense&ntilde;anza</em></strong>. Colegio de Santa Rosa was established for the education of orphaned girls by Madre Paula de Santisima Trinidad in 1750. The college occupied a lot in front of the UST. In 1739, this lot was occupied by a small residence, which had to be demolished to make way for the school building. Beside the school, a beaterio was built. In 1774, the school and beaterio were placed under royal patronage. Both institutions were later turned to the care of the Dominican friars, but passed to the Royal Audiencia in 1784, and then to a junta of alumnae and matrons of the city until 1886, when administration was transferred to the Daughters of Charity (Paules sisters), who renamed the school Colegio de Santa Rosa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although damaged in 1863 by an earthquake and by another one in 1880, a new and bigger structure was built in place of the ruins. By the turn of the century, the college was one of the more important institutions of learning for women .The building was destroyed by the initial bombing of Manila in 1941, forcing the sisters to transfer the school to Santa Mesa. In 1949, the school returned to Intramuros, but under new administrators&mdash;the sisters of the Siervas de San Jose. In 1981, the sisters transferred administration to the Augustinian Recollect sisters who run the school today. Although the postwar school buildings followed the modern style, the buildings have recently undergone a facelift and the turn-of-the-century facade of Santa Rosa has been recreated in concrete rather than in wood, which was used in the original. This was characterized by a chamfered corner, where the building facade was located. This was a tall and narrow structure crowned by a semicircular pediment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals<em>.&nbsp;</em><em>San Juan de Dios</em></strong>, the first hospital in Intramuros, was established by Fr Juan Clemente, OFM, in 1578. A modest structure of nipa and bamboo consisting of two wards was built facing the Franciscan <strong>porteria</strong> or porter&rsquo;s lodge of the Franciscan <strong>convento</strong>. In 1596, it was placed under the patronage of the Misericordia. Administration was given to the brothers of San Juan de Dios in 1656. Nothing remains of the hospital, but plans and turn-of-the-19th-century photographs show the hospital to be a plain building of two stories, functional and bereft of much ornamentation. An 18th-century plan of the San Juan de Dios church shows it to be baroque in style. It was cruciform with the main altar with multiple niches and side altars at the transept ends. Its interior had a raised gallery running the length of the nave, beneath that were smaller altars. The facade was flanked by bell towers capped by a pointed roof. The facade was divided into vertical and horizontal sections with niches for statues, reminiscent of a retablo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monuments</strong>. Monuments to honor important persons were part of the urban plan of Intramuros. The <strong><em>Monumento de Magallanes</em></strong>, built to honor Ferdinand Magellan, originally stood in front of Puerta Isabel II, but was moved behind the Intendencia building after part of the wall was demolished in 1904. The monument, which was an obelisk crowned with an armillary sphere and adorned by ships prows at the pedestal, was completely damaged by war and collapsed into the Pasig River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Monument to Isabel II</em></strong><em>,&nbsp;</em>formerly at Plaza Arroceros, was transferred in front of Malate church, but was damaged by a typhoon. The restored bronze statue was placed in front of Puerta Isabel II in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Monument to Carlos IV</em></strong> was erected in 1824, to honor the king for sending cholera vaccine to the Philippines. The bronze statue was cast in the Herrerias or royal foundry at Intramuros, and placed on a pedestal in the Plaza Mayor of Manila, an open space surrounded by the Manila Cathedral, the Palacio del Gobernador, the Real Audiencia, and the Ayuntamiento. In 1886, a fountain at the base of the statue was added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Monument to Abp Benavides</em></strong> was originally in Plaza Santo Tomas, facing the university. The bronze statue of Benavides is dressed as a Dominican, but with a pectoral cross and skull cap, which are symbols of a bishop. It was cast in Paris by Tony Noel in 1889. It was erected on a marble pedestal and unveiled on 2 Jul 1891. The statue was blown off its base when the pedestal was hit by artillery in 1945. On 12 Nov 1946, the statue was transferred to and re-erected in the Sampaloc campus of the university, together with the principal entrance of the university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Monument to Legazpi and Urdaneta</em></strong> was cast at the turn of the century in Spain, but the monument was not completed until 1904. It visually summarizes the close ties between Church and State. While Miguel Lopez de Legazpi holds a flag, Fr Andres Urdaneta, OSA raises a cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although located outside Intramuros in a rotunda along Bonifacio Drive, the <strong><em>Monument to Simon de Anda</em></strong> is considered as within the boundaries of Intramuros as a historical district. The monument honors Anda who, from a base in Bulacan, continued the resistance against the British, so much so that the British were confined to occupying Manila and little else beyond. Anda served as governor for a government in exile from 1762 to 1764. At the end of the British occupation, Anda became governor-general (1770-76). The monument is an obelisk resting on tall plinth. The obelisk is topped by a mace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Residences</strong>. Residences, owned by private individuals, clustered in and near Barrio San Luis, located east of San Agustin monastery. Hardly any of the pre-World War II residences, many in the style of the bahay na bato, survived the bombardment of Intramuros in Feb 1945 at the end of the war. Fronting San Agustin church and convento, <strong><em>Casa Manila</em></strong>, a house museum, as well as the adjacent period houses were erected using old plans. They attempt to evoke the memory of the Spanish colonial era residences in Intramuros. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

In 1768, when the Jesuits were expelled from Bohol, the Recollects took charge of the island.

But in 1822, the <strong><em>Santisima Trinidad Church</em></strong>, made of stone rubble, <strong>de mamposteria</strong>, was completed. The convento followed in 1838. Redondo (Ibid) describes the church as being made of rubble, in cruciform, in good condition, with a roof of galvanized iron.

		"text": "<p><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 13th century, a Chinese chronicler Chao Ju Kua referred to a place called Li-han, which was known for its fertile lands. Later identified by Ferdinand Blumentritt as Malolos, this center was also an important trading base for the Japanese, and most likely, other foreign traders as well. Politically, this community was governed by native leaders like the Gatsalian and Gatmaytan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1580, Diego Ordonez de Vivar, OSA arrived by boat from Calumpit and set up a small chapel in Canalate. Converts to the Catholic religion increased and a succession of bamboo and nipa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> were built to accommodate them. Finally, in 1817, Melchor Fernandez, OSA, using donations and forced labor, started the construction of a bigger church of stone and mortar, now known as the Malolos cathedral. A huge convento was also erected beside it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>With the arrival of the Spanish colonizers, Malolos became the encomienda of a certain Tirado, with 900 tributes. Justice was initially administered by the&nbsp;<em>alcalde mayor&nbsp;</em>(governor) of Bulacan, while the native chiefs continued to rule, but under Spanish control. For the offices of government, a stone<em>casa real&nbsp;</em>was completed in 1843, through the contributions of the&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>(wealthy inhabitants). In the 18th century, the natives of the town were subjected to the&nbsp;<em>vandala&nbsp;</em>(compulsory selling of rice to the governor). The oppressive practice was later abolished and eventually replaced by the&nbsp;<em>cedula personal&nbsp;</em>or personal taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the decades, Malolos grew in size with the addition of barrios like Bulihan, Longos, Dakila, Caniugan, Sumapa, Tikay, Santor, Matimbo, and Ligas, which were linked to each other and to other barrios of Malolos through paved roads and stone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a> erected in the late 18th and early 19th century. As the boundaries of Malolos expanded, so did its population which at 33,547 was the largest in Bulacan in 1848. By then, the inhabitants of Malolos included not only the natives but the Chinese mestizos, mostly descendants of Chinese merchants who married native women and settled in Malolos in the 18th and 19th centuries. These native and mestizo entrepreneurs worked the land, producing rice, indigo, and sugar, as well as nipa shingles, baskets, lime, and all kinds of fruits. These products were sold to buyers from Pampanga, Manila, and Bulacan itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the flourishing of commerce in the 19th century, a new land-owning elite rose to prominence. This included the Chinese mestizo families, like the Buison, Chichioco, Chiong, Cojuangco, Jacinto, Santos, Reyes, Tanchanco, Tantoco, Tanjosoy, Tengco, and Tiongson as well as native families like the Aldaba, Borlongan, Buendia, Crisostomo, Dimagiba, Gatchalian, Gatmaitan, Lakindanum, Lugo, Maclang, Pulumbarit, Robles, and Victoria. Later, intermarriages between the mestizos and Indios erased the division between these two racial groups and made possible united action against the friars. With their economic ascendancy, the members of the new elite assumed the leadership in town governance, as&nbsp;<em>gobernadorcillos&nbsp;</em>(mayors),&nbsp;<em>delegados&nbsp;</em>(delegates), and&nbsp;<em>cabezas de barangay&nbsp;</em>(barrio heads).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the marked increase in the population of Malolos, which posed problems for both secular and religious administration by the Spaniards, the central government divided the town into three separate pueblos with their own local officials in 1859. These three towns, which now functioned as separate parishes with their own Augustinian parish priests and churches, were Malolos, Barasoain (named after a town in Spain), and Santa Isabel, whose borders followed the natural divisions created by the rivers and esteros that ran through or around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With friar abuses mounting from the 1840s to the 1890s, the principalia of Malolos launched a movement for reforms, working for the expulsion of the friar orders from the parishes, independence of the secular officials from friar control, reform of the system of taxation, and the advancement of education, among others. First led by Marcelo H. del Pilar who had close relatives in Malolos, the reformists managed to have their own leaders elected.&nbsp;Among these were Manuel Crisostomo and Vicente Gatmaytan, who defied the frailocracy by implementing the government rule on immediate burial of cholera victims and by rejecting the tax list of the&nbsp;<em>cura&nbsp;</em>(parish priest), which the friars deliberately bloated to increase their 12 percent share from actual taxes collected. Confrontations with the friars and threats of imprisonment from the&nbsp;<em>alcalde mayor&nbsp;</em>only served to intensify the campaign for reforms, even after the departure of del Pilar for Spain in 1888.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support of the movement, 20 young women of Malolos, closest relatives of the leading reformists, signed a letter (written by Teodoro Sandico) asking permission from the newly appointed Gov-Gen&nbsp;Valeriano Weyler to open a night school to be financed by them, where they could learn the Spanish language. The women personally presented the letter to Weyler when the latter visited Malolos on 12 Dec 1888. But the friars, correctly reading the letter as a political move, later convinced him to turn it down. The women persisted and finally opened their school in Feb 1889 under the progressive Guadalupe Reyes. But it lasted only till May 1889 when Sandico had to flee the country to avoid arrest. The courage of the women, who belonged to the Reyes, Tanchanco, Tantoco, and Tiongson clans, was lauded by <strong><em>La Solidaridad</em></strong> and prompted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> to write his famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1656\">&ldquo;To My Young Countrywomen of Malolos&rdquo;</a> dated 22 Feb 1889, which encouraged women to educate themselves, follow their consciences instead of the friars, and be partners of their male relatives in the struggle for reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the frailocracy becoming even more paranoid and punitive in the 1890s, many reformists joined the masonic lodge Kupang starting in 1892. Knowing this, the cura Moises Santos, OSA denounced the reformists as masons out to destroy the Church and overthrow the government. On 25 May 1895, the eight &ldquo;maginoo&rdquo; (gentlemen) of Malolos were arrested and exiled to Mindanao, Sulu or Palawan: Manuel Crisostomo, Ceferino, Valentin, and Juan Aldaba, Vicente Gatmaytan, Justo Teodoro, Saturnino Buendia, and Luis H. del Pilar. All their associates like Antonio and Ponciano Tiongson, Jose, Florentino, and Graciano Reyes, Anastacio Crisostomo, Padre Rafael Canlapan, Silvino Torralba, Jose and Felix Bautista, and Felipe Estrella, were harassed with raids and interrogations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the progressives there was no turning back. In Mar 1896, Isidoro Torres, Ramon de Leon, and Victorino Gatmaytan were initiated into the Katipunan in Manila and authorized to open a branch in Malolos called Balangay Apuy. The latter was headed by Luis Gatmaytan. In the same year was founded the Katipunan del Norte with Fr Agustin Tantoco, coadjutor of Calumpit, as head, and supported by his brother Gabino and the latter&rsquo;s sons Juan, Antonio, and Ezequiel. With the arrest and torture of the brothers Luis and Victorino Gatmaytan, Torres became president of the Balangay Apuy, and headed the revolutionary forces in Malolos after the outbreak of the revolution in Aug 1896.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of the former reformists and other progressive citizens of Malolos, the Katipunan forces under Torres and Anacleto Enriquez were able to defeat the Spanish forces decisively in the Battle of Malolos on 1 Jun 1897. And even after Aguinaldo and other revolutionary leaders were exiled to Hong Kong in Dec 1897, Torres continued to lead the revolutionary forces in Malolos. When Aguinaldo returned in May 1898 to launch the second phase of the revolution, Torres and his forces readily responded to his call to action. After the surrender of the Spanish forces to the Americans on 13 Aug 1898, Aguinaldo decided to move his headquarters to Malolos&mdash;because of the town&rsquo;s invitation for him to move there, the churches and houses that could be used as offices of the revolutionary government, and the town&rsquo;s accessibility to the new rail system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Sep 1898 to Mar 1899, some of the most momentous events in Philippine history happened in Malolos. On 15 Sep 1898, the first ever Philippine congress opened at the Barasoain church and immediately set about its task of writing the very first democratic constitution in Asia. On the 18th, Aguinaldo proclaimed Malolos as the capital of the Philippines. On the 29th of the same month, the ratification by Congress of the 12 June declaration of independence was celebrated in grand manner with parades, and balls. On 21 Jan 1899, the Malolos constitution was promulgated. On the 23rd, the first Philippine Republic was inaugurated with Aguinaldo as president and a new cabinet headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a> and composed of Teodoro Sandico, Baldomero Aguinaldo, Mariano Trias, and Gracio Gonzaga. The Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was inaugurated and housed in the Barasoain convento from 1898 to 1899. On 17 Feb 1899, the first Cruz Roja or Red Cross organization was founded at the Malolos convento, with Aguinaldo&rsquo;s wife, Hilaria del Rosario, as president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the advance of the American forces toward Malolos, Aguinaldo left the town two days before the American soldiers arrived on 31 Mar 1899. About 7,000 citizens, fearing violence from the invaders, went on a mass exodus with Aguinaldo. Gen Torres, now politico-military governor of Malolos and Bulacan, and his forces tried to block the American entry into the capital but after two hours, the Americans, led by Gen. Arthur MacArthur, hoisted their flag at the Malolos plaza and placed the town under military rule. Underground activities against the Americans continued, waged by a revolutionary shadow government. Two of the guerillas, Santiago Lucero of Santa Isabel and Fr. Gregorio Crisostomo, then parish priest of Malolos, were arrested and exiled to Cabanatuan. But weeks after, most citizens came back to town, and after the fall of the revolutionary leaders, including Aguinaldo, resigned themselves to American rule. In Feb 1901, the Americans appointed their own municipal president and later made Malolos the capital of the whole province. By 1903, Malolos, Barasoain, and Santa Isabel were unified into one town once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>, many changes were instituted in Malolos. As in most towns that fell under America, the new colonizers immediately set up elementary schools where children of both sexes could be taught English and other subjects by American soldiers, and later, the Thomasites. With the coming of foreign films around 1913 and radio in the 1920s and with the sending of Malolos&nbsp;<em>pensionados&nbsp;</em>(government scholars) to the United States, the process of Americanization was well under way in Malolos. Many former revolutionaries assumed government positions under the new dispensation, while others joined the Iglesia Filipina Independiente and supported the movement for independence either through the Partido Nacionalista or the Independence missions. In the first and second decades, some of the women of Malolos continued to be active in community affairs, joining the Asociacion Feminista Filipina in 1906 and its local counterpart the Club de Mujeres, helping to establish the Centro de Puericultura in 1917, and working for women&rsquo;s suffrage in the 1930s. By the time the Japanese occupied the country in 1942, most of those who figured in the movements for reform and independence at the turn of the century were gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Historic Center and Heritage Structures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individual buildings in Malolos had been marked by the government since the 1950s but it was only on 15 Aug 2001 that the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a>, by virtue of the powers vested in it by Presidential Decree (PD) 260, officially declared the historic town center of Malolos as a National Historical Landmark and a Heritage Town. This historic center covers two general areas: a part of Barasoain and the old Malolos <strong>poblacion</strong> (town center).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Barasoain, the major heritage structures are linked by the old road called <strong><em>Paseo del Congreso</em></strong>, so named because here passed the parade from the Malolos convento to the Barasoain church for the opening of the Malolos Congress. Most important historical building here is <strong><em>Barasoain Church</em></strong>, which was already marked by the National Historical Committee in 1940 and later declared a National Landmark through PD 260 on 1 Aug 1973 because it was the site of the first Philippine Congress convened by Emilio Aguinaldo on 15 Sep 1898. Here met 92 delegates, both elected and appointed, who put together and approved the first democratic constitution of the country. Here too, the same congress ratified the &ldquo;Act of Declaration of Independence&rdquo; proclaimed in Kawit on 12 Jun 1898. On the other hand, the <strong><em>Barasoain Convento</em></strong> was marked by the National Historical Commission in 1969 because it housed the offices of the Malolos Congress as well as the first secular university of the country, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas from 1898 to 1899.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1885 by a <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder) M. Magpayo under the supervision of Juan Giron, OSA, the church has a facade that can be divided into three vertical sections and three horizontal levels. On the first level are three arched entrances separated by flat pilasters decorated with fluted ovals. Over the two side entrances are <strong>media naranja</strong> (semi-circular) capiz-covered windows, while on top of the larger main entrance is a big rose window also fluted and covered with capiz window. Half of the rose window occupies the second level, where it is flanked by pilasters like those of the first level and topped by a small niche for a santo. On either side of the central panel on the second level, the two side wall panels rise in matching graceful curves from the left and right ends toward the center, connecting to the media naranja pediment on the third level, which is surmounted by a cross, and marked at center with the words &ldquo;J. Giron dirigio / Magpayo construyo / 1885.&rdquo; The media naranja is flanked by two stone finials, matching those on the left and right sides of the second level.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has a wide central nave separated by columns from two wide aisles on either side. The aisles lead up to simple <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-classical</a> <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">retablos</a> of carved stone with a single niche for life-size&nbsp;<em>santos&nbsp;</em>on the epistle and the gospel sides. The central nave leads up to the sanctuary which has the same width as the nave. Raised a few steps from the nave floor, it is dominated by a stone retablo with two levels, the first of which has three niches, with the central and bigger niche being occupied by the patroness Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Carmen. On top of the central niche is a small niche with the image of the Santa Cruz. The retablo, altar, and sanctuary are naturally lighted by three pairs of arched windows on either side. These are similar to but smaller than the arched windows carved out of the church&rsquo;s thick adobe walls along the two aisles, which provide light and ventilation to the whole church, as do the two side doors. Over the main entrance of the church is the <strong>koro</strong> (choirloft). The black and white cement tiles of the original church were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a>, but the original wooden trusses and galvanized iron roofing were replaced with iron trusses and a tile roof when it was &ldquo;restored&rdquo; for the 1898 centennial of the Malolos Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the gospel side of the church is a simple <strong>kampanaryo</strong> only a few meters higher than the facade. The bell tower of stone has a tall square base, on which rise three progressively smaller hexagonal drums, decorated with six blind arched windows. The third and smallest drum, which is made of bricks, has six open arched and balustraded windows. Patterned after the original, the present roof is an inverted cone. To the epistle side of the church and aligned with its facade is a long, two-story convento with six Roman arches supporting the long <strong>volada</strong> (overhang) on the second level, which has sliding capiz windows resting on <strong>pasamanos</strong> (window sills) under which are <strong>ventanillas</strong> (sliding window panels) framed by sets of wooden panels. On the first floor of the convento is a <strong>zaguan</strong> (first floor entrance area) for storage, now divided into offices and exhibit areas. A stone and wooden staircase leads to the second floor which has a long continuous <strong>sala</strong> (receiving room) and three big rooms overlooking the plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the plaza in front of the convento is a historical <strong>glorieta</strong> of stone. It is an octagonal platform with two entrances with a few steps on either side. The platform is dominated by an obelisk which contains the names of the Congress delegates and above it a relief of Congress president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>&rsquo;s face. It was inaugurated in 1931 by Emilio Aguinaldo, Gregoria de Jesus, and other dignitaries to memorialize the Malolos Congress. In the 1980s, a statue of Emilio Aguinaldo, first president of the Malolos Republic wearing a formal frac and carrying a cane and top hat, was installed facing this obelisk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Cojuangco-Chichioco&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) on the Paseo del Congreso, was built in the 19th century by Melecio Cojuangco and his wife Tecla Chichioco. Here lived their children Jose, Juan, Eduardo and Antonio, and Melecio&rsquo;s sister Isidra Cojuangco who was allegedly wooed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\">Gen Antonio Luna</a>. The house used to stand right next to the street but when it was renovated in the 1980s, it was pushed back a few meters away from the street and made higher than it actually was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located right on the corner of Paseo del Congreso and Burgos St is the <strong><em>Tanjosoy-Bautista-de los Santos House</em></strong> built in 1812 by Pedro Tanjosoy and Geronima Villanueva. The oldest surviving Spanish period bahay na bato in Malolos, the house has a big sala with windows looking out onto the two streets; two bedrooms adjacent to the sala; a large <strong>komedor</strong> (dining room) that runs along Burgos St; and at the back a <strong>kusina</strong> (kitchen) and <strong>azotea</strong> (open terrace on the second floor) with stone stairs leading to the garden. In 1906 a smaller version of the house was attached to the right side, for extra bedrooms, a <strong>caida</strong> (landing) for an exterior wooden and stone staircase, and a garage under the bedrooms. In 1910, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a> was commissioned by Antonio Bautista to renovate the house. He used an indigenized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Art Nouveau</a> style for the new wooden chandeliers, picture frames, curtain valances, furniture, and wall paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the street from this house and at the foot of the bridge is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong><em>Casa Real</em></strong></a>, which was also known as the&nbsp;<em><strong>Casa Presidencia Municipal</strong> </em>during the American colonial period. It was declared a National Shrine through Executive Order 173 on 4 Oct 1965 and marked by the National Historical Institute in 1990, because it housed the office of the gobernadorcillo in Spanish times and the&nbsp;<em>presidente municipal&nbsp;</em>or mayor in the American era. And when Malolos was the seat of the Republic, the revolutionary publications <strong><em>La <strong>Independencia</strong></em></strong> and <strong><em>El Heraldo de la Revolucion</em></strong> were printed here in 1898 and 1899.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Casa Real, which was completed in 1843, was a two-level box-like structure of adobe with a tiled roof. Its main entrance was on the first level, flanked by square windows with iron grills and <strong>media aguas</strong> (awnings). On the second floor were three windows which had media aguas and balustrades. There were similar windows at the two sides and at the back. The main entrance led to a small lobby and then at center to a stone-and-wooden staircase leading up to the second floor. Over the years, the spaces on the first and second floors were divided into different configurations of halls and rooms according to the needs of its many occupants. In 1918, the building was renovated. Two big open balconies with balustrades, all in concrete, were attached to the left and right sides of the building. One window on each side of the building was converted into large doors to connect the balconies to the second floor hall. The balconies were supported on the first floor by independently standing concrete posts on the front and a concrete structure with windows to the back. Over the main entrance was also built a smaller balustraded balcony of concrete resting on two posts, protecting the main entrance from the elements. Art deco motifs were carved atop the doorways leading to and from the balconies. The building degenerated over the years and was almost completely demolished in the 1950s but for the timely intervention of heritage advocates like Jose P.W. Tantoco. It was practically reconstructed in 1981 following the general dimensions of the original building and reproducing the balconies added in 1918. Today it serves as a museum of Malolos history under the management of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connecting Barasoain to the Malolos poblacion is a stone bridge called <strong><em>Gen Felipe Estrella Bridge</em></strong>. Built in 1810, it was renovated in 1926 and provided with concrete balustrades, lamp posts, and sidewalks on both sides. Named in honor of Gen Felipe Estrella who was killed in the battle of San Ildefonso, the bridge is seen prominently in the picture of the parade held in Malolos on 29 Sep 1898. Over it has passed all important personalities that had something to do with the history of Malolos as a town and as the seat of the Malolos Republic. It spans the Tampoy river, which used to be an important artery of transportation and commerce for the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one descends the bridge, the road divides right where stands the <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\"><strong>Francisco Baltazar</strong></a></strong> Monument</em></strong>, featuring a cement bust of the Bulacan poet by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3802\">Guillermo E. Tolentino</a>, commissioned and installed by the Panulat at Wika, the local group of poets and writers in 1959. About 50 meters behind the monument is the center of the Malolos poblacion&shy;&mdash;the cathedral, convento, and plaza, the latter enclosed by a fence with several pedestrian and vehicular gates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much larger than Barasoain church, the <strong><em>Malolos Cathedral</em></strong>, now also known as the Basilica Minore of the Immaculate Conception and the original convento on the gospel side, were built in 1817-19. In the convento transpired many historical events, like the confrontation of the friar curate with the cabezas who refused to follow the friar&rsquo;s tax list and the presentation of the letter to Weyler by the Women of Malolos in 1888. Markers from the National Historical Institute installed in the mid-1950s underscores the convento&rsquo;s historical importance, having served as the <strong>presidencia</strong> or <strong>palacio presidencial</strong> during the Malolos Republic. Here Aguinaldo and his wife Hilaria del Rosario lived, here the president held meetings and formal balls, and here too his wife and other women of Malolos founded the first Cruz Roja or Red Cross in 1899. On the first floor were printed the official seals of the president and the Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has a facade that can be divided, like that of Barasoain, into three vertical sections and three horizontal levels. On the first level is the main entrance with the date 1817 above it, flanked originally by two arched windows which were converted into arched portals in the 1950s. The main entrance is separated from the two side entrances by two pairs of classical columns standing on tall square bases decorated with <strong>bandeja</strong> (square) motifs. Two classical columns of the same design stand one each on the left and right sides of the first level. On the second level are three arched windows, aligned with the windows/portals below. The same number and design of classical columns, but a little shorter, are used on the second level, perfectly corresponding to the columns below. Over the central window on the second level is a niche with a very old image of the Immaculate Conception. On the third level is a triangular pediment with a cross on top of it. The pediment is flanked by two urn finials, which perfectly match two other finials located at the ends of the second level walls, on the right and left sides. On the epistle side of the church is the kampanaryo which has four progressively smaller hexagonal drums forming one tower, all decorated with blind arches except the topmost which has six arched and balustraded windows so that the sound of the bells can be heard. The kampanaryo had an inverted cone roof with a weather vane before it was replaced in the 1970s by a gigantic sculpture of the Immaculate Conception a la Murillo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church has one wide nave which ends in a transept, whose left and right wings have their own newly made retablos. The original 19th century retablos burned down when the church and convento were put to the torch by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s men on 31 Mar 1899 so that the buildings would be of no use to the invading Americans. On the slightly elevated sanctuary today is the single niche retablo for the Image of the Inmaculada Concepcion with Baroque and Regency influence designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2644\">Alejandro Caudal</a> in the pre-World War II era. After Vatican II, the wooden altar in front of the retablo was demolished and an elevated altar of marble was built several meters away from it. With the removal of the altar, the retablo lost its aesthetic base. In the 1950s, the high arched windows with capiz panels were extended downward to allow more light and air into the church and fitted with steel frames and colored glass, later with stained glass windows. The old koro still survives though it is no longer used as often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the gospel side, the church used to be connected to the long convento which had six wide Roman arches supporting the volada on the second floor, which in turn had an assemblage of pasamanos with sliding capiz windows on the top and sliding ventanillas underneath. The entire roof was covered with tiles. Entrance was through the second arch (from the right) and led to a zaguan with stone floor and the staircase which had <strong>piedra china</strong> (granite blocks from China) on the first ascent and then wooden steps and balustrades on the second. The second floor, which was of wood, had an enormous sala and commodious rooms, and a kitchen at the back. In 1835, a clock tower four levels high was added at the end of the convento, perfectly balancing the kampanaryo at the opposite end. Before the clock collapsed in the earthquake of 1863, the Malolos church was considered one of the grandest in the country. Nothing remains of the old convento. The present convento and bishop&rsquo;s palace was built in the 1960s, after Malolos became the seat of the new diocese of Bulacan, and further extended in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Estrella bridge a road runs around the church block, connecting the large plaza to three poblacion barrios: San Vicente on the clocktower&rsquo;s side, Santo Rosario at the back of the church block, and Santo Ni&ntilde;o or Pariancillo on the kampanaryo side. The barrio of Santo Ni&ntilde;o is also called Kamestisuhan or &ldquo;place where mestizos live,&rdquo; because here were found the houses of the mestizos sangleyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the San Vicente side and on the road beside the former clocktower are found the <strong>aguas potables</strong> or water cistern, erected in 1923, which is an 80-foot high depository of clean water which served the town for decades. On the small plaza in front of it and at the crossing of three roads stands the <strong><em>Gen Isidoro Torres Monument</em></strong> erected in the pre-World War II period. Standing on a high pedestal, the hero of Malolos is shown in military uniform with saber, beside a broken wheel symbolic of death and next to an upside down small canon signifying the end of the Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the San Vicente side and next to the Estrella bridge to the left stand the remains of what was once the <strong><em>Tanchanco-Mendoza House</em></strong>. In this bahay na bato lived former gobernadorcillo Tomas Tantoco Tanchanco and Rosenda Macalanda Mendoza, prominent leaders of the reform movement in Malolos, and parents of two of the Women of Malolos, Eugenia and Aurea. The main entrance faced the plaza and it had a long balcony running the length of its komedor, an enormous sala, several rooms, and a <strong>caballeriza</strong> (horse stable) below and near the river. To this house came Fr Jose Burgos in 1869 to stand as godfather to the Tanchanco first born, Francisco. In this house, the Tanchancos hosted Jose Rizal when he came home to visit in 1888. During the period of the Revolution, the house served as the intelligence center for military operations, under the protection of and with the support of Rosenda, then already a widow. In 1905, Rosenda hosted a lunch here for William Jennings Bryant, democrat who favored independence for the colony. After Rosenda died in 1925, the house was partitioned among her five children. What remains of the house are a few zaguan walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the right of the bridge is the <strong><em>Malolos <strong>Munisipyo</strong></em></strong>, which faces the cathedral. It was built on what used to be an open space with an artesian well, beside the old river landing. Completed in 1940, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">munisipyo</a> is a two-level structure of steel and cement elevated by about ten steps from the street level. The higher central portion juts out a few meters from the two sides of the facade. The stairs lead up to the entrance which has a portico with two square pillars. Atop these pillars is a wide panel on which two Philippine Commonwealth seals flank the words &ldquo;Pamahalaang Bayan / Malolos, Bulakan / 1940.&rdquo; The portico has one main door between two large art deco grilled windows, while the second floor has three smaller windows perfectly aligned with the windows and door below. The same proportion and alignment of windows are seen on the two sides of the facade. Inside, there is a lobby which is flanked by offices on either side and leads to a staircase with art deco grills. On the second floor are a small sala and two large rooms for offices. Sometime in the 1960s, a third floor, also of concrete, was added on what used to be a roof garden. In front of the munisipyo stands the <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a> Monument</em></strong>. Dated 1905, the bust of del Pilar, leader of the Malolos reformists, stands on a pedestal in the middle of the 25 sqm plaza officially named after the hero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notable and rare is the <strong><em>Ramon de Leon House</em></strong> on Tampoy or Cigarillera St overlooking the Tampoy river to the back and left side of the munisipyo. This well-preserved&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\">tsalet</a>&nbsp;</em>(chalet, in English) was built by the former Katipunero, mayor, and civic leader, in the early American period. Elevated above the ground by more than two meters, the one-level art deco house is rectangular in shape. In front, its graceful stone stairs lead up to the open veranda. While the front veranda is common to many tsalet, unique is the house&rsquo;s veranda because it continues to the left of the entrance, turns right at the corner, and runs all the way to the back of the house, wrapping two thirds of the front and the entire left side of the house with an extended balcony with a wooden floor. The main door opens to the main sala, which are directly connected by three pairs of wooden doors to the three bedrooms of the house. To the left of the sala and running down to the back of the house is a <strong>komedor</strong>. At the back is an azotea overlooking the Tampoy river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Santo Ni&ntilde;o side and right across from the epistle side of the church stood until a few years ago the <strong><em>Reyes-Tantoco House</em></strong>, a 19th century bahay na bato owned by Lino Santos Reyes and his second wife Maria Tiongson Tantoco, one of the women of Malolos. During the Malolos Republic, the house served as the office of Apolinario Mabini, in his capacity as secretary of foreign affairs and prime minister. The house was sold a few years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the same street but nearer the patio of the church is the low <strong><em>Reyes-Tantoco House</em></strong>, owned by reformist leader and former gobernadorcillo Jose Tiongson Reyes and Catalina Tengco Tantoco. In this 19th-century bahay na bato, the two raised their four children, two of whom were Elisea and Juana, who belonged to the&nbsp;<em>barkada&nbsp;</em>(ship crew) of the 20 women of Malolos. What remains of the house can no longer be seen, as it has been engulfed by commercial establishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the corner of Estrella and Pariancillo Sts stood the magnificent 19th century <strong><em>Jose Villanueva Tiongson House</em></strong>. This is the bahay na bato that looms large behind Aguinaldo and his carriage in the photo of the parade for the proclamation of the Malolos Republic in 1899. The house was owned by landowner and local official Jose, whose grandson Judge Arcadio Tiongson Ejercito inherited it. Since the 19th century, the lower floor of this house had shops in it so that the main entrance was at the left. On the second floor, the huge sala which had the usual set of capiz windows, pasamanos and ventanillas overlooked the main street as well as Pariancillo St. Rooms were on the Pariancillo side. In this side, Aguinaldo allegedly signed the Malolos Constitution. What remains of the Jose Tiongson house are parts of the first level stone walls on which has been built a modern structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jose Tiongson house is the first of many houses on Pariancillo St, whose original owners belonged to the Tiongson clan. Right next to the Jose Tiongson house on Pariancillo is the 19th-century <strong><em>Antonio Chichioco Tiongson House</em></strong>. The second floor facade has three vertical sections, with their own sets of sliding capiz windows, pasamanos, ventanillas, and wooden panels with exquisite carvings and one continuous media agua running above the top of the capiz windows. On the <strong>silong</strong> or ground floor of this house, Antonio&rsquo;s grandaughter Asuncion, ran a store and restaurant, so two entrances were created on the first level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right next to this house still stands the 19th century <strong><em>Cervantes</em></strong> bahay na bato where the church composer Erastro Cervantes used to live and which became the property of Rafael Chiong, and now of Faustino Chiong. The latter house hosted the Secretaria del Interior during the Malolos Republic. Like the house beside it, the second floor facade of this house also has three vertical sections, with three sets of capiz windows, pasamanos, ventanillas, wooden bandejas, and atop the windows a continuous media agua of galvanized iron. The entrance is on the left side of the first floor, but the rest of the ground floor seems to have been opened up for a store at the time the house was built. Over the lintel of this store area is carved the year 1892, which could be the date of the houses&rsquo;s construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost opposite this building used to stand the <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tiongson</em>-<em><strong>Crisostomo</strong> </em><strong><em>House</em></strong> of former gobernadorcillo Manuel Pulumbarit Crisostomo and his wife Laureana Tiongson. In the 1950s, their son Aurelio constructed on this lot a new house in the 1950s style, designed and built by Engr. Alfredo T. Aldaba. The 1950s <strong><em>Aurelio Tiongson Crisostomo House</em></strong>, which is interesting for its combinations of many modern motifs, was inherited by his children and still stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two lots away from this house was the magnificent <strong><em>Ponciano Santiago Tiongson House</em></strong>. Wealthy businessman and land-owner Ponciano probably built this bahay na bato in the 1870s. The house was used as the office of the Comisaria de Guerra during the period of the Malolos Republic and also served as living quarters for American officers during the occupation of Malolos in 1899. This house was notable and unique for its decorative neo-gothic arches at the caida and at the two sides of the big sala. Similarly, the fine filigree carving of the <strong>calados</strong> atop its wide hardwood doors are outstanding, as well as its floor which had dark and light colored hardwoods alternating to form stripe patterns on the floor. At the back, next to the kitchen, was a huge azotea which had a stone staircase leading down to the garden. Still strong and standing, it was sold for its wood in the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to the Ponciano Tiongson house is the <strong><em>Vicente Tantoco Tiongson House</em></strong> designed and built by Emilio Alvero in 1923. The house proper was already finished when Vicente died in 1925 but the original exterior staircase was never completed, because Vicente&rsquo;s widow, Salud Tanchanco Reyes, and her five young children left the house after his death. When the family returned to live in the house after the war, the facade was completed but no longer according to the original 1920s design of Alvero. Instead, Engr. Alfredo Aldaba, who married a daughter of the house, designed and built a 1950s facade and a fence to match it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite the Vicente T. Tiongson House is the magnificent <strong><em>Adriano-Vasquez Mansion</em></strong> owned by Ignacio Adriano and his Tiongson-descended wife. Built in 1923, it is still a bahay na bato with first floor of stone and upper floor of wood but it has introduced innovations on the bahay na bato. In the absence of a volada, the front part of the house facade is supported by four ionic columns to form an open space underneath, that serves as caida and foyer to the main entrance. From the left and right corners of the house, two curving staircases of stone lead the visitor from the ground level to the porch entrance on the first floor. The first floor is no longer a dark stone-covered zaguan but a large area with warm wooden floors that could be used for big parties. Designed in the art deco style, it has deco plant motifs carved onto the balustrade of the staircase, which leads up to the second floor. The second floor landing connects to a huge sala. At one end of the sala toward the front of the house are the three bedrooms. At the other end of the sala is a beautiful art deco arch-divider of wood and colored glass which separates the sala from a corridor flanked by rooms. In the sala, staircase, and bathrooms may be seen beautiful glass works by the Manila-based German stained glass maker, Kraut. The original Puyat furniture for the sala and bedrooms, now gone, were all in a matching art deco design. Because the lot extends to the next street, a big azotea at the back is furnished with a cement staircase leading to the paved backyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to the Vicente Tiongson house on Pariancillo is the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>casa tribunal</strong></a>. In the 19th century, it served as the hall of justice and a jail. During the Malolos Republic, it was the headquarters of Isidoro Torres in his capacity as <strong>gobernador militar de la plaza</strong>. It had a facade which had an arched entrance on the first floor, and on the second level three semi-circular cup-shaped stone balconies with iron grills and wooden pasamanos. Over the balconies were semi-circular cup-shaped stone canopies which matched the balconies in size and in the style of their intricately carved decorations. Perpendicular to the right and back side of this rectangular building was another building whose sides also had the same balconies and canopies. In the 1950s, all the openings of the building were cemented (except for one) when it was turned into a bodega by its owner Ignacio Adriano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the road from the casa tribunal is the <strong><em>Tantoco-Santos House</em></strong> built by Teresa Tiongson Tantoco, one of the Women of Malolos, for her daughter Anita when she got married to Gonzalo Uitangcoy Santos in 1931. Typical of the 1930s, the two-story house has a central portion jutting out of what basically is a square box. Elevated from the ground, the entrance on the first floor of the covered entrance is accessed through a low stone staircase in front. Like a foyer, the entrance area is protected from the elements by the upper floor, but its two sides are open, except for low, grilled pasamanos on either side. Upon entering the house, one steps into a small lobby with wooden floor which connects immediately to a wooden staircase leading to the second floor. On either side of the staircase on the first floor are rooms which can be used as living spaces or offices. On the second floor is a wide sala, which extends to the central portion above the entrance area, and rooms on either side of the staircase landing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farther down, Pariancillo St ends on the bridge over the canal that is the boundary of barrio Santo Ni&ntilde;o and the poblacion. About 100 meters before the bridge, Pariancillo connects perpendicularly to Santo Ni&ntilde;o St (formerly Agapita Tiongson St). On this corner stood three important bahay na bato in the 19th century. On the corner of Pariancillo and Santo Ni&ntilde;o itself was the <strong><em>Antonio Morales Tiongson House</em></strong>. Antonio was a leading reformist who held several public offices. He and his wife Juliana Reyes had several children, five of whom&mdash;Basilia, Paz, Aleja, Mercedes, and Agapita&mdash;were part of the 20 Women of Malolos, with Mercedes acting as one of the three leaders of the group. Mercedes eventually married Teodoro Sandico, a&nbsp;<em>profesor de latinidad</em>. The first floor of the house was made of stone and housed the zaguan. The entrance was on the left side of the house. On the second floor, the sala overlooked both the Pariancillo and Santo Ni&ntilde;o. On the Santo Ni&ntilde;o side, the sala connected to the komedor and a long corridor that ended up in the kitchen. The azotea at the back had stairs going down to the garden. It is said that the sala was decorated with half body portraits of Antonio and Juliana, while on either side of the piano hung full-body portraits of Mercedes and Agapita. Only the stone steps of the azotea and the two posts of the exterior gate remain of the house, which burned down in 1934.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite this house on Pariancillo was the <strong><em>Marcos Ramos Tiongson House</em></strong>. This bahay na bato was owned by Antonio&rsquo;s second cousin Marcos and his wife Juana B. Oliveros, whose daughters Filomena, Cecilia, and Feliciana, also belonged to the group of the Women of Malolos. It was in this house that the friar Agustin Fernandez came to convince the sisters to come to the church more often. The house and its kamalig burned down in 1914 and the siblings decided to build another house farther into the huge property. This was a two story house with a <strong>mirador</strong> (look-out) on the third level, all in art deco style. A stone staircase outside went up to the second floor. The first floor had its own side entrance, below the stone staircase. This was the house where the Rizal sisters, Trinidad and Maria, used to stay when Maria had to have her eyes treated by Dr. Luis U. Santos, pioneering eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) specialist, in prewar era. The house was demolished when the property was sold in the 1960s to the Iglesia ni Cristo who built a huge <strong>kapilya</strong> on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite the house of Antonio Morales Tiongson on Santo Ni&ntilde;o was the <strong><em>Fabian Morales Tiongson House</em></strong>. Fabian, Antonio&rsquo;s brother, had two famous children by his first marriage to Norberta Tantoco Maclang, namely, Vicente and Anastacia Tiongson, the latter being one of the Women of Malolos. After the Philippine-American war, Fabian and his family migrated to Dagupan City where they engaged in different businesses with much success. In the American period, the present two-story house was built, probably using parts of the old house. The present house has a two-part staircase going all the way up to the entrance porch which juts out of the square box of the house. The second floor has a sala, three rooms, a komedor, and azotea. The first floor, which is elevated from the ground and has its own entrance has living quarters independent of the upper floor. The house, which is in the art deco style, is now occupied by the Crisostomo and Vinluan families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Santo Ni&ntilde;o was the <strong><em>Reyes-Tengco House</em></strong>. This bahay na bato was owned by Clemente Tiongson Reyes and Maria Tengco, whose daughter Rufina Tengco Reyes was one of the Women of Malolos. In this bahay na bato the women attended classes under the&nbsp;<em>maestra&nbsp;</em>Guadalupe Reyes from Feb to May 1889. The house was replaced in the 1930s by one built by Rufina&rsquo;s sister Segunda when the latter married Francisco Gatchalian. All that remains of the first house is one stone wall perpendicular to the street, on which the National Historical Institute put its marker in 1961 to commemorate the Women of Malolos and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1656\">Rizal&rsquo;s letter</a> to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Santo Ni&ntilde;o turns the corner, one finds the American period <strong><em>Jacinto-Lomotan House</em></strong>. This house was built by Clara Santos Jacinto, who volunteered to work for the Cruz Roja (Red Cross) in 1899, and her husband Cipriano Chico Lomotan, who held positions in local government. Like other American period houses in Malolos, its central portion protrudes, in this case with an open balcony-foyer-entrance accessed through an open stone stairway ascending in front of the right side of the facade. The lower floor is for storage while the second floor has several rooms, the komedor, kusina, and banyos (bathrooms).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to the Jacinto-Lomotan house on Santo Ni&ntilde;o is the <strong><em>Tantoco-Reyes House</em></strong>. Inherited by Vicenta Tiongson Tantoco who married Epifanio San Agustin Reyes, the 19th-century bahay na bato was originally owned by Ana Morales Tiongson (sister of Fabian and Antonio). This is where Ana and her husband Hermogenes Tengco Tantoco lived with their four daughters, Teresa, Maria, Vicenta, and Teodora. Teresa and Maria signed the letter to Weyler. The house has a stone kamalig with arches in front supporting an open roof garden on top. The original house burned down in 1974 and was not replaced till 2011 when two of Vicenta&rsquo;s grandchildren&mdash;Lydia R. Balatbat-Echauz and Oscar Reyes decided to reconstruct. In the reconstruction, the lower floor of the house was raised by several meters to accommodate the&nbsp;<em>karos&nbsp;</em>that would be kept under the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to this house is the 19th-century <strong><em>Santos-Tantoco House</em></strong> of Barbara Reyes Santos and Hermogenes Tengco Tantoco. (After Hermogenes&rsquo;s first wife Ana died, he married Barbara.) This low bahay na bato, which still stands, has storage spaces on the first level and living quarters on the second. The house has several rooms and a sala that overlooks the street. It used to house the half body portraits of Barbara&rsquo;s parents, now with the Casa Manila Museum. The house is now owned by a direct descendant, Ching Tantoco-Lopez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite the Santos-Tantoco house is one of the most distinguished houses of Malolos, the <strong><em>Santos-Bautista House</em></strong> built by Rufina Capistrano Santos and Jose A. Bautista. In this house, Rizal met with Jose Bautista, Vicente Gatmaytan, and Manuel Crisostomo in 1892 to tell them about La Liga Filipina that he was forming. The house was inherited by Antonio Santos Bautista, revolutionary leader, former mayor, and civic leader, who also inherited the Tanjosoy-Bautista house in Barasoain. Built in 1877, the house has its main entrance on the first floor, under the second floor volada, and flanked by two <strong>buntis na rehas</strong> (pregnant grills) windows. On the second level of the facade are the usual two sets of sliding glass and <strong>persiana</strong> (wooden louvers) windows, pasamanos, and ventanillas. But unique are the four Grecian caryatids which are evenly distributed across the facade: two at each corner of the house, and the other two placed at equal distances between them. To the left side of the zaguan, an entresuelo stands, right next to the staircase which leads to the second floor. The main sala overlooks the street and connects to two bedrooms on the side of the garden. The house was later expanded with the addition of another wing, attached perpendicularly to the side of the house parallel to Felix T. Reyes St. Here is found the komedor which leads to the kitchen and more rooms at the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Felix T. Reyes St are several important bahay na bato. First on the right is the <strong><em>Reyes-Tantoco House</em></strong> owned by Hermogenes San Agustin Reyes, former magistrate, and his wife Teodora Tiongson Tantoco. According to their daughter Leonor T. Reyes, the house was bought and transported piece by piece from Bulacan, Bulacan to Malolos. Assembled in the American period (the date over the entrance says 1904), it has a central portion jutting out of the box-like house. The first floor has its own entrance, while access to the second floor is provided by a red stone staircase on the right side of the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next to this house is the <strong><em>Santos-Uitangcoy House</em></strong>, built in 1914 by Paulino Reyes Santos and his wife Alberta Santos Uitangcoy, one of the leaders of the Women of Malolos. Originally in the shape of a bahay na bato, this house acquired an additional structure on its left side when the couple&rsquo;s son, the famous EENT doctor Luis Santos, decided to open a clinic in the <strong>silong</strong> or first floor, which had a wooden floor. The concrete structure, which added one azotea (later converted into a bedroom) to the second floor, housed a pharmacy on the first floor managed by Luis&rsquo;s sibling Elisa, and in front a waiting room with benches for patients. The additional building followed the style of the original house whose staircase balusters, <strong>calados</strong> on top of room dividers, and arch dividers, were all in the art deco style. The house has a huge sala with a set of art deco furniture. A corridor leads from the sala to the rooms on either side. The house was restored through the efforts of the Women of Malolos Foundation Inc, which has converted it into a museum on the Women of Malolos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farther down the road is the magnificent <strong><em>Dr. Luis U. Santos Mansion</em></strong>, which is a gem of the Philippine art deco period. Designed and built by Alejandro Caudal in 1930-33, the house follows the template of the American period houses&mdash;the central portion juts out from the left and right side of the facade. Accessed through a stone staircase (the whole house is sitting on a raised platform), the entrance on the lower floor of the central portion is open on all sides and is roofed by the balcony on the second floor. The first floor which has wooden floors has a long room on the left side which used to have beds for eye patients of Dr. Santos. A corridor divides this area from the private section of the house which is enclosed by a wall and has a grilled gate of its own. After entering this section of the house, one ascends the beautifully carved art deco stairs to the first landing which has a high wall of colored glass on one side, and then to the second floor sala which is dominated by a carved art deco ceiling with lights, with a round <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> mural showing allegorical figures amidst clouds. On the right side of the sala, toward the back of the house, are two rooms with intricately carved art deco calados atop their walls. Against one wall stands a piano, above which used to hang the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a> painting <strong><em>Afternoon Tertulia</em></strong> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2216\"><strong><em>El</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em><strong><strong>Kundiman</strong></strong></em></strong></a> showing Dr Santos on a chair listening to a female singer in terno probably singing a kundiman beside the piano. (De la Rosa came to Dr. Santos for treatment of his eyes.) On the front side of the house is the balcony overlooking the street, which is decorated with Kraut stained-glass pieces showing the muses of arts and of sciences, and other motifs. To the right of this balcony is a room which serves as an <strong>oratorio</strong> (oratory). Next to this room and adjacent to the sala is the arch-divider showing images of a bountiful rice harvest, which leads to the komedor. All the furniture in the house, including the ambassador-style sala set and the upright chairs at the komedor, were designed by Caudal to match the rest of the house. The motifs of waves, flowers, fruits, and peacocks were carved by masters from Bulacan and Pampanga. In front of the house is a garden dominated by a fountain designed and executed by Guillermo Tolentino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another notable structure, located on Estrella St in barrio Santo Rosario next to Santo Ni&ntilde;o is the <strong><em>Malolos</em></strong> <em><strong>Central School</strong> </em>or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\"><strong><em>Gabaldon School</em></strong></a>, and more recently, the <strong><em>City of Malolos Integrated School</em></strong> when it opened a high school. The building was financed by the Gabaldon fund and the contributions of the townspeople and completed in 1913. Aside from being the first elementary school in Malolos, the school also served as the headquarters of the Japanese soldiers in 1942-45 and as the hospital of the Americans in 1945. Elevated from the ground by about two meters, this one-level building follows the shape of a U, with the bottom of the U forming the facade and longest side of the structure. The facade has a long central section flanked by two walls with swing-out capiz windows and a framed four-petal design on top of them. The central section has three pairs of flat columns evenly dividing the five-step staircase going up to the lobby-corridor. Along this lobby-coridor are three sets of hardwood doors that open into a big auditorium. The same corridor connects the central section to the two long corridors perpendicular to it on the left and right sides, which give access to the classrooms lined up at the two parallel wings, which still have operable swinging capiz windows. On the small plaza in front of the school are old monuments of Jose Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and a public school teacher dressed in a 1930s dress, holding a book in her left hand and gesturing with her right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malolos had many more structures with historical or artistic significance but many of them have since been demolished. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

For the offices of government, a stone<em>casa real&#xA0;</em>was completed in 1843, through the contributions of the&#xA0;<em>principalia&#xA0;</em>(wealthy inhabitants). In the 18th century, the natives of the town were subjected to the&#xA0;<em>vandala&#xA0;</em>(compulsory selling of rice to the governor).

As the boundaries of Malolos expanded, so did its population which at 33,547 was the largest in Bulacan in 1848. By then, the inhabitants of Malolos included not only the natives but the Chinese mestizos, mostly descendants of Chinese merchants who married native women and settled in Malolos in the 18th and 19th centuries.

First led by Marcelo H. del Pilar who had close relatives in Malolos, the reformists managed to have their own leaders elected.&#xA0;Among these were Manuel Crisostomo and Vicente Gatmaytan, who defied the frailocracy by implementing the government rule on immediate burial of cholera victims and by rejecting the tax list of the&#xA0;<em>cura&#xA0;</em>(parish priest), which the friars deliberately bloated to increase their 12 percent share from actual taxes collected.

The women personally presented the letter to Weyler when the latter visited Malolos on 12 Dec 1888. But the friars, correctly reading the letter as a political move, later convinced him to turn it down. The women persisted and finally opened their school in Feb 1889 under the progressive Guadalupe Reyes. But it lasted only till May 1889 when Sandico had to flee the country to avoid arrest. The courage of the women, who belonged to the Reyes, Tanchanco, Tantoco, and Tiongson clans, was lauded by <strong><em>La Solidaridad</em></strong> and prompted <a href=\"/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> to write his famous <a href=\"/9/76/1656\">&#x201C;To My Young Countrywomen of Malolos&#x201D;</a> dated 22 Feb 1889, which encouraged women to educate themselves, follow their consciences instead of the friars, and be partners of their male relatives in the struggle for reforms."

When Aguinaldo returned in May 1898 to launch the second phase of the revolution, Torres and his forces readily responded to his call to action. After the surrender of the Spanish forces to the Americans on 13 Aug 1898, Aguinaldo decided to move his headquarters to Malolos&#x2014;because of the town&#x2019;s invitation for him to move there, the churches and houses that could be used as offices of the revolutionary government, and the town&#x2019;s accessibility to the new rail system."

Arthur MacArthur, hoisted their flag at the Malolos plaza and placed the town under military rule. Underground activities against the Americans continued, waged by a revolutionary shadow government. Two of the guerillas, Santiago Lucero of Santa Isabel and Fr. Gregorio Crisostomo, then parish priest of Malolos, were arrested and exiled to Cabanatuan. But weeks after, most citizens came back to town, and after the fall of the revolutionary leaders, including Aguinaldo, resigned themselves to American rule. In Feb 1901, the Americans appointed their own municipal president and later made Malolos the capital of the whole province.

Many former revolutionaries assumed government positions under the new dispensation, while others joined the Iglesia Filipina Independiente and supported the movement for independence either through the Partido Nacionalista or the Independence missions. In the first and second decades, some of the women of Malolos continued to be active in community affairs, joining the Asociacion Feminista Filipina in 1906 and its local counterpart the Club de Mujeres, helping to establish the Centro de Puericultura in 1917, and working for women&#x2019;s suffrage in the 1930s.

		"text": "<p>The town of Pila in the province of Laguna is said to be the ancient Pailah mentioned in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI), the oldest written document in the country, which dates back to 900 CE. The original site of Pailah has been identified as today&rsquo;s Pinagbayanan, just north of the Pila River, while &ldquo;Puliran,&rdquo; also mentioned in the LCI, is just south of the same river.&nbsp;<em>Pila&nbsp;</em>is an old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> word meaning&nbsp;<em>piedra blanda</em>, the soft stone underlying much of the land. Ancient Pila was one of the largest population and trade centers in precolonial Philippines, ruled by a local chief who was also the regional datu. Although larger than neighboring Bae (Bay), it nevertheless formed part of the Bae geographical area, referred to as Ma&rsquo;I in Chinese accounts of the late 9th century AD. The towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Jala-Jala, Pililla (small Pila), and Talim Island across Laguna de Bay in the province of Rizal used to pertain to old Pila under Gat Salian Maguinto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archaeological excavations in Pinagbayanan/Pailah yielded quantities of exquisite Chinese porcelain, gold beads and ornaments, equine bones, stone phallic objects, and the only pre-Hispanic crematorium in the country. These led archaeologists to hypothesize four pre-Hispanic cultural periods. In Period II (Lower Sung), the site was primarily a burial place. In Period III (Upper Sung/Yuan), the site was well-inhabited, as deduced from numerous post-holes. The community lived on fishing and weaving cotton as witnessed by clay fishnet sinkers and spindle whorls, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1375, Pailah was abandoned, possibly due to severe flooding; it was then referred to as Pinagbayanan, the original community. A resettlement was established on higher ground further west, called Pagalangan. The site, in present-day Victoria, is claimed to be the only pre-Hispanic private estate equivalent to the Spanish hacienda because the datu farmed out its arable land to nobles and freemen in exchange for an annual rent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1571, the Spanish conquistadores led by Juan de Salcedo reached Pagalangan. The same year, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi awarded the Pagalangan encomienda and other Laguna villages to a councilman of Manila.

Ancient Pila was one of the largest population and trade centers in precolonial Philippines, ruled by a local chief who was also the regional datu. Although larger than neighboring Bae (Bay), it nevertheless formed part of the Bae geographical area, referred to as Ma&#x2019;I in Chinese accounts of the late 9th century AD. The towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Jala-Jala, Pililla (small Pila), and Talim Island across Laguna de Bay in the province of Rizal used to pertain to old Pila under Gat Salian Maguinto."

These led archaeologists to hypothesize four pre-Hispanic cultural periods. In Period II (Lower Sung), the site was primarily a burial place. In Period III (Upper Sung/Yuan), the site was well-inhabited, as deduced from numerous post-holes. The community lived on fishing and weaving cotton as witnessed by clay fishnet sinkers and spindle whorls, respectively."

		"text": "<p>Located 19.5 kms north of Bacolod, <strong><em>Silay</em></strong> <em><strong>Poblacion</strong> </em>is popularly and informally known as &ldquo;Silay Heritage Zone.&rdquo; The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\" icon-epa-sun=\"\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a>, has officially recognized this popular designation by listing Silay City under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage zone</a>. The poblacion has many heritage buildings and structures; a number had already been officially recognized as &ldquo;heritage houses&rdquo; through NHI resolutions authorizing local government units to install historical markers on these houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silay&rsquo;s cultural importance and economic growth hinged on the development of the sugar industry in the Visayas, which went from a being backyard enterprise to an international industry with the introduction of steam-powered sugar mills. These mills were brought by businessman and British vice-consul, Nicholas Loney, born 1826, Plymouth, UK, and died 1869, Mt Kanlaon, Negros. Loney began his enterprise in Iloilo, which through most of the 19th and early 20th century dominated the sugar trade because it had a deep-sea port that could accommodate international shipping. Interisland shipping was handled by wooden, round-bottomed, cargo sailboats called&nbsp;<em>batel</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1760, Silay was already recognized as a town; its inhabitants were refugees from other places who sought safety from sea-borne slave raiders and found it in a site between Matagoy and Panaogao Rivers, which they fortified with a palisade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 19th century, it was a major sugar-producing area because of the&nbsp;<em>horno economico</em>, introduced by Frenchman Yves Leopold Germain Gaston in 1846. The horno produced raw sugar or&nbsp;<em>muscovado</em>, which then had to be shipped to Iloilo&rsquo;s deep-water port at the mouth of the Iloilo River. Here, international vessels docked to haul sugar for export. Silay&rsquo;s economic ties with Iloilo were strong because Silay had a good port from which the batel could sail in an almost straight line to Iloilo. Although Bacolod was Negros&rsquo;s capital, boats from there had to sail around Guimaras before reaching Iloilo. It was more efficient to transport sugar and other produce by land to Silay port for transshipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silay&rsquo;s heyday was between the end of the 19th century and the four decades before World War II. The coming of the Americans proved to be beneficial to Silay because sugar was one of the principal exports to the United States, along with coconut, abaca, tropical hardwood, and metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, Silay built its own port designed by Italian architect Lucio Verasconi, who also designed the San Diego Church. Stretching 1.7 kms, the port was claimed to be the longest wharf in Asia at that time. The wharf could accommodate foreign ships, breaking Negros&rsquo;s dependence on Iloilo for international shipping. This boosted Silay&rsquo;s economic growth further. During this era, Silay earned the nickname &ldquo;Paris of Negros&rdquo; for its fine homes, schools, public buildings, and the level of artistic and cultural sophistication of its residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silay&rsquo;s heritage structures include the port, which was unfortunately ruined by bombs during World War II and never repaired. It is often bypassed by visitors who know nothing of its existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Parish Church of San Diego</em></strong> is also a heritage structure. It was built beside the ruins of a Spanish colonial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, which was made of rubble and coral, and which was razed by a fire in 1926. The present church stands perpendicular to the ruins. Also designed by Verasconi, the church was almost totally funded by the Ledesma family and completed in the 1930s. The church served as a provisional cathedral after the war because Bacolod&rsquo;s church was destroyed, hence the reference to the church as &ldquo;pro-cathedral.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church is an interpretation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Romanesque</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a> designs. The prominent Roman arch of the facade is Romanesque, however, the twin bell towers and the dome over the transept crossing is Renaissance. The single-nave, cruciform church is flanked by aisles separated from the nave by a colonnade. Varnished hardwood altars decorate the interior. Floral elements decorate the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>, which are a harmonious blending of arches and niches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of ancestral houses in Silay were declared heritage houses in accordance with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> board resolutions in 1993 and 1994. Another NHI resolution in 1994 authorized the local government unit of Silay to install historical markers in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The declared heritage houses are the 1933 <strong><em>Angel Araneta Ledesma Heritage House</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Green House</em></strong> which is now the Culture and Arts Office of the city, the <strong><em>Bernardino and Ysabel Lopez-Jalandoni Ancestral House</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Pink House</em></strong> which is now a lifestyle museum. The Jalandoni-Pink house has a wide overhang supported by pillars. The area underneath the overhang serves a covered walkway similar to those found in Iloilo&rsquo;s business district or in Malaysia&rsquo;s Penang Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Cesar Lacson Locsin Ancestral House</em></strong> houses El Ideal Bakery, famous for its wood-fired ovens and baked products and pastries made according to heritage recipes. It is a typical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) with overhanging <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows), glass window shutters, and wide <strong>media aguas</strong> (metal awnings).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Maria Ledesma Golez Heritage House</em></strong> was originally part of the Don Jose &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; del Rosario Ledesma House. The residence was planned as a town house, which combines living space on the upper floor with commercial spaces on the lower floor. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Art deco</a> elements, especially in the archways, and the corner entrance and classical motifs are evident. Masques and caryatids and lion heads also decorate this house. It was purchased by the RCBC Bank in 1992 and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> the following year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also included are the 1897 <strong><em>Victor Fernandez Gaston Heritage House</em></strong> or <strong><em>Balay Negrense</em></strong>, the restored residence of Victor F. Gaston, son of Yves Leopold Germaine Gaston. Left unused by the family and reused a number of times, the house deteriorated until a group from Silay decided to restore it. By the time restoration began, parts of the house had fallen and its furnishings dispersed. The house is a later, more airy, version of the bahay na bato. The first floor, raised from the damp earth, is pierced by windows that make the interior brighter than older houses. The first floor is no longer just a storage space but a large foyer which leads to rooms and offices. The lower floor connects to the upper story through a grand staircase. The upper floor has bedrooms flanking the living room. To the rear is the dining hall and kitchen. The upper story is made of wood with generous ventanillas that allow air to circulate throughout the house. The house has been furnished with furniture and appurtenances donated by various persons. Arranged as a lifestyle museum, Balay Negrense is also available for social functions, like wedding receptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Jose Benedicto Gamboa Ancestral House</em></strong> was used for interior scenes in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a>&rsquo;s movie,&nbsp;<em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1256\">Oro, Plata, Mata</a> </strong> </em>(Gold, Silver, Death), 1982. This two-story bahay na bato has a wide balcony on one side and is divided into three symmetrical bays. The balcony&rsquo;s colonnade ends in a stepped corbel evoking art deco motifs. The facade, where the staircase leading to the first floor is located, is four bays wide. The upper floor has tall windows, the sliding capiz windows and persianas run from the transom to the window sill and immediately below is the grilled ventanilla. When both are opened, the window aperture runs from transom to floor. The house is white-washed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Manuel Severino Hofile&ntilde;a</em></strong> house is an all-wood structure characterized by a porch at the center that juts out from the facade. Beneath the porch is the raised cement entrance to the house. Another entrance on the side is for cars and the balcony covering the entrance serves as a porte cochere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Completing the list for the declared houses are: the <strong><em>Alejandro Amechazura House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Amelia Hilado <strong>Flores</strong></em></strong> <em><strong>House</strong> </em>owned by the Jison-Alano family, <strong><em>Antonio <strong>Novel</strong>a Sian House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Arsenio Lopez Jison House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Carlos Arceo Ledesma House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Delfin Ledesma House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Digna Locsin Consing House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Generoso Reyes Gamboa House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Germain Lacson Gaston House</em></strong>, <strong><em>German Locsin Unson House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jose &ldquo;Pitong&rdquo; Ledesma House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jose Corteza Locsin House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Josefita Tionko Lacson House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Juana Coloso Ledesma House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Kapitan Marciano Montelibano Lacson House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Leandro de la Rama Locsin House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Manuel de la Rama Locsin House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Modesto Ramirez Hojilla House</em></strong> owned by Carlos Javelosa Jalandoni, <strong><em>Lino Lope Severino</em></strong> or <strong><em>Severino Building</em></strong>, <strong><em><strong>Soledad</strong> and <strong><strong>Maria Montelibano</strong></strong> Lacson House</em></strong>, <strong><em>Teodoro Morada House</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Vicente Conlu Montelibano House</em></strong>. The <strong><em>Nicolas Armin Jalandoni</em></strong> or the <strong><em>Benita Jara Heritage House</em></strong> was likewise declared such by the Silay City council. It is used by the Sangguniang Panlungsod.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Those declared but demolished by the owners were the <strong><em>Augusto Hilado Severino House</em></strong> which was bought by the Iglesia ni Cristo, and the <strong><em>Claudio Hilado Akol Heritage House</em></strong>, now owned by the Locsin Genealogy Foundation.

Here, international vessels docked to haul sugar for export. Silay&#x2019;s economic ties with Iloilo were strong because Silay had a good port from which the batel could sail in an almost straight line to Iloilo. Although Bacolod was Negros&#x2019;s capital, boats from there had to sail around Guimaras before reaching Iloilo.

		"text": "<p>Although designated National Historical Landmark by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a>, Taal, formerly known as Bonbon or Bombon, has not yet been designated a Heritage Zone according to the provisions of the National Cultural Heritage Law of 2009. Notwithstanding all this, Taal&rsquo;s center or <strong><em><strong>Taal Poblacion</strong></em></strong> houses a host of buildings and open spaces that mark it as a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage area</a>,&rdquo; as heritage advocates, the townspeople, visitors, and tourism stakeholders refer to Taal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taal Volcano and Taal Lake dominate Taal&rsquo;s history. In fact, Taal and the neighboring towns of Lemery and Talisay, and others around the lake are located in what is the collapsed caldera of a supervolcano that dominated the southern <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> region. Before 1754, the towns of Tanauan near Talisay, Sala, and Lipa at Barangay Lumang Lipa, like Taal were lakeshore towns also within the caldera. Tagaytay, the scenic ridge in neighboring Cavite, is part of the remaining slope or side of the volcano. Part of the ancient caldera has been filled with water; this is what is now called Taal Lake. In the center of the lake is Volcano Island, whose crater is also water-filled.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Taal Volcano has caused the transfer of Taal town to different sites along the lakeshore&mdash;from San Nicolas and Santa Teresita, where there are ruins of earlier churches and settlements; to a site now submerged under water, where stone structures called <strong>sapao</strong> by the fisher folk can be seen some 150 m from the lakeshore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taal has had 33 recorded eruptions since 1572, when Augustinians founded the town in San Nicolas. There were eruptions from 1605 to 1611, prompting Fr Torna de Abreu, OSA to erect a cross of anubing hardwood on the lip of the crater. Between 1707 and 1731, the volcano was once more active, but eruptions occurred not on the main crater but on other parts of Volcano Island. The eruption of 1701 and 1731 occurred in the cinder cone, called Binintiang Malaki, then eruptions shifted to the island&rsquo;s westernmost tip at Binintiang Munti in 1709 and 1729. Other recorded eruptions were in 1716 and 1731.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr Buencuchillo, OSA, a priest assigned to Taal, reported that when Taal erupted in the mid-1700, he mistook the sound it made as the customary volley of canon shots of a Manila-Acapulco galleon announcing its approach. The canon shots were in honor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2246\">Virgin of Caysasay</a>, whose shrine is by the Pansipit channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1732, Taal was named capital of Batangas. Then the Pansipit River was still a wide and navigable channel that ships could enter for trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 18th century, Taal Volcano would change the town&rsquo;s history. While the eruption of 1749 was recorded as its most violent eruption, the eruption of 1754 is considered Taal&rsquo;s greatest eruption. The 1754 eruption began in May and lasted until December, with the volcano spewing ash continually for 200 days. These two eruptions, occurring within six years of each other, deposited so much ash that it created a virtual dam that severed the connection between Taal Lake and Pansipit River, which drains into Balayan Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before 1749 and 1754, Pansipit was a much wider channel, making Taal Lake an extension of Balayan Bay. Every year, the lake&rsquo;s water level would rise as more ash was deposited beginning in 1749 and during the long eruption of 1754 and as more rainwater filled the lake. The Augustinians tried to save the town and church, which was being inundated. The friars organized the people to build protective dikes, which is what the sapao are believed to be. But it was futile, in the end there was no option but to evacuate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geological history of Taal has left the town an unexpected benefit&mdash;the local delicacies of&nbsp;<em>tawilis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>maliputo</em>. The rising waters of the lake changed it from salty then brackish and then fresh. The endemic&nbsp;<em>tawilis</em>, a type of sardine, and&nbsp;<em>maliputo</em>, a type of mackerel, are conjectured to have been marine fish but adapted to the increasingly fresh water of the lake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the eruptions of the mid-1700s, the lakeshore towns mentioned earlier moved to higher grounds and more distant sites. Sala completely disappeared and was amalgamated with Tanauan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to transfer Taal to its present site, facing Balayan Bay, was made in the midst of the eruptive phase of Taal. In May 1754, Fr Buencuchillo asked the people to evacuate for safety. They moved to a hill facing away from Taal Lake and beside the site where in 1611 a shrine to Our Lady of Caysasay had been built. When it was safe to visit the abandoned townsite, the friar along with some of the townspeople returned to survey the damage and salvage what they could. So serious was the devastation that the decision was made to abandon the site completely, and to rebuild near the Caysasay shrine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taal&rsquo;s volcanic environment was beneficial for agriculture because it rendered the land fertile. Vegetables, fruits, and flowers from the highlands flourished. Coconut and cacao were grown in Taal along with coffee, a cash crop that made Taal&rsquo;s income rise in the 19th century. The ash fall resulting from Taal&rsquo;s frequent eruptions made the Batangas Province an ideal place for the cultivation of coffee. The cool climate of the uplands on the slopes of Taal and neighboring Mt. Malarayat was ideal for the signature coffee produce of Batangas,&nbsp;<em>barako&nbsp;</em>or Liberica coffee. Its fragrance, strong earthy taste, and its &ldquo;kick,&rdquo; because of higher caffeine content, was sought after. The first cutting of the barako came from Brazil in the 1800s and was planted in Pinagtung-Ulan, Lipa City by the Macasaet family. From there, coffee planting spread to other towns of Batangas. Taal&rsquo;s ideal location helped its coffee plantations prosper. But toward the end of the century, in 1888, coffee rust fungus hit the plantations of Batangas. The coffee rust infestation hit Taal&rsquo;s economy badly and farmers had to cultivate other crops to stay afloat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during the coffee boom in the half of the 19th century&mdash;although it was much decreased by the early 20th&mdash;when the construction of the many ancestral homes in Taal, as well as public buildings like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> and <strong>convento</strong>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a>, took place. Taal&rsquo;s barrio Balisong came to be known for metalcraft, and its fan knife named after the barrio. Taal was also known for exquisitely embroidered pi&ntilde;a cloth, which bolstered Taal&rsquo;s economy as it tottered with the coffee blight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the heritage structures of Taal, the most important is the centerpiece of the town, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\"><strong><em>San Martin de Tours Basilica</em></strong></a>, which has a long history. After the town was effectively settled near Caysasay, Fr Martin Aguirre, OSA began construction of a church of reef or coral stones in 1756. Completed in 1782, the church and its adjoining convento were again ruined by Taal&rsquo;s eruption in 1852.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1858, Fr Marcos Anton, OSA with the help of the government architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>, started the construction of the present church of Taal. Although inaugurated in 1865, the church was only completed in 1878. Fr Agapito Aparicio, OSA added a main altar and paved the baptistery with tiles from Europe. It was elevated to a basilica minore on 22 Oct 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The church stands majestically on top of a hill and is unobstructed by any edifice. Its facade has been described as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>, i.e., it is a single mass of stone shaped according to complex, rich, and dynamic designs. Paired Ionic and Corinthian columns contrast sharply with the massive facade creating &ldquo;a dramatic vertical movement broken by the roundness of fenestration aligned horizontally&rdquo; (Galende 1987).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After years of neglect, the church was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> in 1972 to commemorate the quadricentennial of the town&rsquo;s foundation. In 1974, it was declared a &ldquo;national shrine.&rdquo; It was designated as a National Historical Landmark by the NHI in 1972, and again in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>casa real</strong> is also known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>tribunal</strong></a> and <strong>casa consistorial</strong>. Although the date 1572 is plastered on the facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">municipal hall</a> of Taal, the date represents the founding of the town of Taal by the Augustinians, not the date of construction of the edifice, which is 1845. Designed in a straightforward version of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style, an arcade at the lower story supports a balcony on the upper floor, which is designed as a quadrilateral crowned by a triangular pediment. It has been designated as a National Historical Landmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 19th century, in a drive to improve public education, the government enlisted the cooperation of the Church which had been running primary schools in the parishes. Often these schools did not have its own building but used either the parish convento, the teacher&rsquo;s house or a makeshift structures made usually of nipa and bamboo. The stone <strong>escuela</strong> or school was built in the 19th century. If funds allowed it, the school had separate buildings for boys (<strong>escuela de ni&ntilde;os</strong>) and for girls (<strong>escuela de ni&ntilde;as</strong>). But often, there was only one building with an interior division to separate boys from girls, the former taught by a&nbsp;<em>maestro</em>, a male teacher, and the latter by a&nbsp;<em>maestra</em>, female teacher. The school was called&nbsp;<em>pia&nbsp;</em>because it was supported partially by donations or pious offerings called&nbsp;<em>obras pias</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1853, the <strong><em>Escuela Pia</em></strong> of Taal was built. In it was housed the image of the Virgin Mary, and Masses were celebrated in the school while the Taal church was under construction. The escuela later housed Colegio de la Sagrada Familia<em>,&nbsp;</em>a school dedicated to the moral formation of the youth. Having been restored, it is now used as Taal&rsquo;s cultural center&mdash;a venue for exhibits, cultural events, and receptions. It has been declared a National Historical Landmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in Barangay Labac near the Pansipit, the <strong><em>Shrine of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de</em></strong> <em><strong>Caysasay</strong> </em>is built out of coral stones. According to oral tradition, the history of the church dates back to 1603 when a pious fisherman, Juan Maningkad, found an image of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception caught in his fishnet while fishing at the Pansipit River. Juan kept the image in his house and it became an object of devotion as miracles were attributed to it. The image was placed under the care of Maria Espiritu, who had an&nbsp;<em>urna&nbsp;</em>or glass enclosed shrine made for it. But the stories circulated that the statue would disappear and then mysteriously return. After investigating the matter, the priest decided to take the image and bring it to Taal church at San Nicolas, for safekeeping. But the image kept disappearing and reappearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, it disappeared and was not to be found for many years until two girls, Maria Bagohin and Maria Talain, discovered it. The two girls were gathering firewood some distance from the site of old Taal, when they saw the statue of the Virgin as they were about to drink water from a spring that feeds into the Pansipit River. The statue was said to be on top of a sampaguita bush, with lighted candles by her side and guarded by&nbsp;<em>casay-casay&nbsp;</em>birds or kingfishers. Reporting the matter to the Augustinians, the conclusion was reached that the Virgin wanted a chapel built at the site where the image was found. A makeshift chapel was constructed and the image became popularly known as Virgen de Caysasay, a corruption of the Tagalog term for kingfisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing more than a century later, the historian and cartographer, Fr Pedro Murillo Velarde, SJ, said in 1611 that in the same year that the provisional chapel was built, there were reports of miraculous occurrences near the spot where the image was found. A canonical investigation on these reported miracles was conducted in 1619. The miracles did not stop and continued to be reported. One of the more famous miracles attributed to the image supposedly happened in 1639, when a dead Chinese man whose body was found hacked into pieces at Pansipit was resurrected. That year, the Chinese had risen in revolt against the Spaniards and the man may have been killed in retaliation for the revolt. But as the story has it, the Virgin of Caysasay restored the man to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A stone church was eventually built to house the Virgin of Caysasay. Most likely the present church is from the 19th century because it has a portico, characteristic of 19th century neoclassical construction. By tradition, the Virgin&rsquo;s statue stays in the church for half of the week and is transferred to the Basilica of San Martin over the weekend to accommodate pilgrims who come to visit Taal. In recognition of the importance of the shrine, Bernard Francis Cardinal Law of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome granted a plenary indulgence to pilgrims to the shrine, similar to that received by those who visit Maria Maggiore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Balon ni Santa Lucia</em></strong> or the Well of Santa Lucia is fed by underground springs. An elaborate wall resembling a church facade with an arched entrance and a curving pediment decorated with an image of the Virgin Mary and floral reliefs has been built like an entrance to the well. This has led to the hypothesis that the facade may be a remnant of a ruined church. But investigation in the area, overgrown with underbrush, has not recovered any evidence of such. It might then have been simply an embellishment for a well believed to have healing waters. When the wall was constructed is uncertain, but the style suggests the 17th century. Floral bas-relief flank the image of the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presently named <strong><em>San Lorenzo Ruiz Steps</em></strong>, in honor of the first Filipino saint, the <strong>hagdan-hagdan</strong> or staircase links the Caysasay Church with the town center. Originally made of adobe, the steps were replaced with <strong>piedra de china</strong> or granite from China, known locally as <strong>batong song-song</strong>, by Fr&nbsp;Celestino Mayordomo in 1850.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taal has many ancestral houses which exist to this day. Some have been recognized by the NHI as significant structures and have been awarded with a historical plaque. Representative of these houses are the few listed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Formerly the ancestral home of Leon and Matilde Apacible, the <strong><em>Don Leon Apacible</em></strong> <em><strong>Museum</strong> </em>stands on Taal&rsquo;s main street. Leon Apacible figured in the independence movement of the Philippines. He was appointed Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s finance officer and was a delegate to the Malolos Congress of 1898, held at the church of Barasoain. The house is now a museum, where family heirlooms and memorabilia, such as blue and white Ming pottery, gilded wine decanters from Florence, Venetian dinner service, gilt-edged and hand-painted, and 19th-century chandeliers from M.F. Rachals of Hamburg, Germany, are displayed. The house has been declared a National Historical Landmark by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a>. It is run by NHCP as a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In what is now the <strong><em>Do</em></strong><strong><em>&ntilde;a Marcela Agoncillo Museum</em></strong>, Marcela Agoncillo hand-stitched the first Philippine flag used by the Philippine Republic. One of Taal&rsquo;s oldest houses, it was built by Marcela&rsquo;s grandfather Andres Mari&ntilde;o. Presently maintained by the Department of Tourism, the house was donated by the heirs to the national government. In 1955, NHI declared it as a National Historical Landmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Gregorio Agoncillo Mansion</em></strong> is another house of the Agoncillo clan, the home of Gregorio. In the front garden is a bronze statue of Felipe Agoncillo, who was also born in this house. Felipe was a lawyer, son of Ramon Agoncillo and Gregoria Encarnacion. He completed law at University of Santo Tomas. Known for his diplomatic skills, he worked with the Aguinaldo government and represented the Philippines in the Treaty of Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gregorio married Mariquita Villavicencio, daughter of Gliceria Marella Villavicencio. His sister, Maria, was the second wife of Gen Emilio Aguinaldo, first president of the Philippine Republic. Presently owned by the Villavicencio family, the house is administered through the Gregorio Agoncillo Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ancestral house is impeccably painted in white with a green steep roof. The house has a representative collection of locally made furniture from the 1800s and the early 1900s in the Edwardian style and Spanish colonial style. Well-preserved chandeliers, statues, and an assortment of collectibles inside the display cabinets are interesting to note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built by Eulalio Villavicencio, a wealthy ship&rsquo;s captain, the <strong><em>Villavicencio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>Bahay na Bato</strong></a></em></strong> (stone house) was built before the 1850s. It incorporates elements of Victorian design and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> architecture, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">gothic</a> design of the main door&rsquo;s <strong>postigo</strong>. The walls were painted with floral designs in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art nouveau</a> style by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a> for the one-night visit of Gov-Gen Francis Burton Harrison in 1919. The upper floor of the house breathes lightness with the use of wide <strong>capiz</strong> windows and pierced and decorative transoms demarcating space. The house was restored fully in 1996 by heir Ernesto Villavicencio and his wife Ria Benedicto, an architect. This house is the first of the Villavicencio&rsquo;s houses. The second one, which is attached to it, is from the 1870s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as the <strong><em>Gift House</em></strong>, Eulalio Villavicencio built a house for his young bride, Gliceria Marella, in 1871. This all-stone house was connected by a bridge to the older house. The adjoining house was for the extended family and guests, among whom were revolutionary generals in need of lodging. The Villavicencio&rsquo;s support for the Philippine revolution, especially Do&ntilde;a Gliceria&rsquo;s, earned for her the title Godmother of the Revolutionary Forces from Gen Emilio Aguinaldo himself. Like the adjoining house, the interior of the second floor is lavishly painted with floral forms. It stands out for its present bold use of color: yellow and blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the Casa Villavicencio, two houses adjoining each other were built by the patriarch Francisco Paulino Gahol in the late 19th century. The <strong><em>Gahol Houses</em></strong> adjoined each other at the dining area until 1929, when rifts split the family. This resulted in the permanent closure of the door between the two houses. The Gahol clan used the houses for family gatherings and was occupied by a spinster aunt until her passing in 2006. In 2011, the family, heirs of the fifth generation, worked together to restore the house and prepare it for adaptive reuse. Sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\">Ramon Orlina</a>, who belongs to the family, opened a gallery at the <strong>silong</strong> or ground floor of the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next-door house was rented in 2007 by designer Lito Perez, who turned the house to a bed-and-breakfast inn named <strong><em>Villa Tortuga</em></strong>. Perez furnished the house with period decor. Villa Tortuga welcomes day guests and offers traditional Batangas meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other outstanding ancestral houses in Taal are: <strong><em>Gen Ananias Diokno House</em></strong>; <strong><em>Goco Ancestral House</em></strong>, declared as a Heritage House by NHI Resolution No 03, S. 2000; <strong><em>Ylagan-De la Rosa Ancestral House</em></strong>, declared Heritage House by NHI Resolution No 9, S. 1998 and marked with a marker dated 30 May 1999; and the so-called <strong><em>Tres Marias</em></strong>. These three contiguous houses, built by Salustiano Atienza Montenegro in the geometric style catches the attention because they face the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal Basilica</a>. The houses are narrow but tall, some reaching three stories. They all have wide expanses of capiz windows and transoms, also using capiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taal has two more churches from the colonial era; they are the satellite churches or visitas found in Bagumbayan and Balisong. Located about two kilometers from the town center, <strong><em>Bagumbayan Church</em></strong> dates back to the 1700s. The church facade betrays its early vintage being a simple structure of one tall story, capped by a triangular pediment. It is divided into three sections by pilasters. The central section which is the widest, is where the main door is located. The flanking sections have niches. The fenestrations on the facade are small round windows called oeil-de-boeuf or ox-eye window, popular in French baroque but also well-known in the Philippines. It is used in such churches as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also about two kilometers from the town center is <strong><em>Balisong Church</em></strong>, in the barangay noted for its fan knives. Like the Bagumbayan church, it is one-story with the pediment designed like a low second story which is divided from the first by a horizontal bar. Like Bagumbayan, the center section, where the door is located, is wider than the flanking sections demarcated by pilasters. The upper section of the pilasters terminate in pyramidal finials. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The 1754 eruption began in May and lasted until December, with the volcano spewing ash continually for 200 days.

But as the story has it, the Virgin of Caysasay restored the man to life."

Most likely the present church is from the 19th century because it has a portico, characteristic of 19th century neoclassical construction. By tradition, the Virgin&#x2019;s statue stays in the church for half of the week and is transferred to the Basilica of San Martin over the weekend to accommodate pilgrims who come to visit Taal. In recognition of the importance of the shrine, Bernard Francis Cardinal Law of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome granted a plenary indulgence to pilgrims to the shrine, similar to that received by those who visit Maria Maggiore."

An elaborate wall resembling a church facade with an arched entrance and a curving pediment decorated with an image of the Virgin Mary and floral reliefs has been built like an entrance to the well. This has led to the hypothesis that the facade may be a remnant of a ruined church. But investigation in the area, overgrown with underbrush, has not recovered any evidence of such. It might then have been simply an embellishment for a well believed to have healing waters. When the wall was constructed is uncertain, but the style suggests the 17th century.

		"text": "<p>Bounded roughly by the Pasig River to the north, by San Marcelino and Leon Guinto (formerly Pennsylvania) to the east, by Pablo Ocampo (formerly Vito Cruz) to the south, by Roxas Blvd (formerly Dewey), Luneta Park, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> to the west, the Taft Avenue area of Manila is associated with urban development during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>. Named after the first American civil governor of the Philippines, William Howard Taft, the avenue runs roughly at the center of this corridor. It is marked at its north end by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> Central Post Office and at its south by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. These two styles, introduced during the American colonial era, were emblems of the range of architectural styles that appeared from 1901, when civil rule was established, to 1946, when the Philippines ceased to be a colony of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of this area, covering three districts of Manila&mdash;Ermita, Malate, and Paco&mdash;falls within the general urban plan of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a>, who arrived in the Philippines in 1905 to advise the American government how best to develop Manila. In his plan, the area south of Intramuros was to be developed as a mix of government buildings and privately built structures. He proposed developing Luneta along the lines of Washington, DC, where the Legislative building, to rise near the sea, would be the centerpiece and guide the subsequent development. The Legislature and Luneta Park, which would be an open field similar to the Washington, DC Mall, was supposed to be the principal spine. The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals would then be built perpendicular to the Legislature and the Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Burnham&rsquo;s plan, Taft Ave would be the main road that would link the southern side of Manila, from the Pasig River, to Pasay. This avenue was developed such that its center islands, planted with acacia trees, would provide a shady and picturesque avenue. Those trees have been removed in the post-World War II era because of the expansion of Taft, the construction of an underpass beside the Manila City Hall, and the construction of the Light Rail Transit (LRT), between 1981 and 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the exception of church complexes and some houses, Ermita and Malate were open spaces, while Paco had a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">public cemetery</a>. The area south of Luneta was a swampland dotted by a few dwellings of bamboo and nipa along M.H. del Pilar (Calle Real), T. M. Kalaw (San Luis), Alhambra, and the bay. But immediately south of Intramuros was Plaza Militar in Ermita, used for military drills and as the site of many expositions and fairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also open spaces on the Paco side, where the occupying American troops encamped in the early 1900s. The old name of the streets in the area like Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Virginia, and Colorado, recalled the troops who encamped in this area during the Philippine-American War (1898-1901). In the Burnham plan, these streets formed a grid&mdash;the streets perpendicular to Taft reached up to Dewey Blvd. The person responsible for naming these new streets was Henry M. Jones, an American entrepreneur who founded the American Hardware and Plumbing Company. He bought most of the area of Malate and Paco, drained the swamps, did his own reclamation, and sold lots from one to two pesos a square meter. He found a ready market with the Americans who migrated to Manila and with the wealthy Filipinos from the provinces who were sending their children to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> being established in Malate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duplex houses, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">row houses</a>, multilevel apartments, single detached houses&mdash;especially <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> (chalet) types&mdash;and hotels for transients were built in the newly developed area. Some of the houses were already built and ready for occupancy when sold, a departure from a long tradition of local construction where residences were a one-of-a-kind works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heritage structures in this area may be organized according to location, citing the principal north-south street as an orientation point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Roxas Blvd Corridor.</strong> Roxas Blvd, formerly Dewey Blvd, was built by the Bureau of Public Works. It was implementing Burnham&rsquo;s plan to reclaim land at Manila&rsquo;s foreshore to build a scenic boulevard that was wide, well lighted, and dotted with palms and tropical trees. The boulevard was to extend from Luneta to Cavite City, and was originally named Cavite. But the project was not completed. When World War II broke out, Dewey Blvd had just reached Baclaran in Pasay City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The section of the city around Luneta and Dewey Blvd was a prime location for leisure-oriented buildings like exclusive clubs, hotels, and stylish mansions of the rich. From Luneta to Pablo Ocampo, there were four structures from the Spanish colonial era that survived to the early 20th century. They were Ermita Church, the temporary buildings on Plaza Militar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\">Malate Church</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/299\">Fort San Antonio Abad</a>, near Pablo Ocampo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three buildings around Rizal Park were designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William E. Parsons</a>, consulting architect of the Bureau of Public Works from 1906 to 1914, namely <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army Navy</a>, Elks, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons, who returned to the United States (US) in 1914, worked with two styles: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Mission revival</a>. But he was an innovator that tropicalized these styles with the use of <strong>capiz</strong> shells instead of glass for windows, large windows and openings for cross ventilation, high ceilings to allow hot air to rise, and transoms over doors and walls to vent hot air. He deliberately shielded rooms from heat and rain by adding wide, covered corridors and loggias. He insisted on covered walkways under commercial buildings for the convenience of pedestrians, an innovation already introduced in the Philippines towards the end of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial era</a>. These walkways are similar to the&nbsp;<em>lima kaki&nbsp;</em>(five-foot covered corridors) in the British Strait colonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He advocated the use of concrete instead of stone, the use of monochromatic wall colors&mdash;usually white or cream&mdash;and tropical landscaping to act as a foil for the whitewashed building. Parsons also imported improved construction materials and techniques, like the Kahn Truss system, concrete hollow blocks, and adoption of modular and standardized plans. He persuaded the government to stop importing Oregon pine, replacing these instead with decay-resistant tropical hardwood. These innovations brought down costs while improving quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> style had its origins in Europe and the United States. Neoclassicism appeared in Europe in the mid-18th century as a reaction to the excesses of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a>. It was brought to the US, where Thomas Jefferson, who designed and built his home Montecello in the style, endorsed it as the most appropriate for a government center. French architect, L&rsquo;Enfant, designed Washington, DC in a monumental neoclassical style called Federal. Neoclassical got a major boost with the Chicago Columbian Exposition, meant to commemorate the fourth centennial of Columbus&rsquo;s voyage to America. Daniel H. Burnham, who designed the exposition, created what was known as the Great White City. He brought this experience to the Philippines when he was called to make plans for the cities of Manila and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mission Revival also had its major boost in an exposition at Balboa Park, San Diego. Named after Spanish explorer, Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez de Balboa, the park had already been established at the turn of the 19th century. An extensive unbuilt area, it easily hosted the 1915-16 Panama-California Exposition and the 1935-36 California Pacific International Exposition. The 1915 San Diego Exposition coincided with the opening of the Panama Canal, an undertaking funded and engineered by the Americans. The exposition architects were Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Windslow, who chose the Mission Revival Style, then popular in California, but borrowed heavily from Churrigueresque and Plateresque for detailing. They created a variant style, Spanish Colonial Revival Style. While the building of the 1915 San Diego Exposition still stands, the only remaining building in San Francisco is the Palace of Fine Arts. San Francisco likewise held a Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915. Bernard Maybeck, the designer of the San Franciso expo, chose to draw inspiration from Roman and Greek architecture. In contrast to San Diego, San Francisco&rsquo;s buildings were neoclassical and built to evoke a ruin. Unlike San Diego, the San Francisco buildings were not permanent. They were made of steel and wood frames covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber. The central rotunda of the Palace was in disrepair, so it was torn down and recreated in 1964 in lightweight, poured-in- place concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons drew from these two styles as he designed buildings in Manila. The three buildings he designed around Luneta were all private commissions. Following the stipulation in his contract with the colonial government, Parsons was allowed to take on private commissions to augment his 6,000 dollars per annum salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\"><strong>Army and Navy Club</strong></a></em></strong> on South Road, the southern boundary of Luneta, was built in 1909. Built for 300,000 pesos, the building was set on a two-hectare lot and was composed of three structures: the club house, the dance hall, and the kitchen and staff quarters. These three structures are all laid out in an H. The building is made of reinforced concrete and has a flat roof. The building utilizes the <strong>Kahn system</strong>, named after Albert Kahn (1869-1943), an American industrial architect who pioneered the use of reinforced concrete for structure, floor, wall, and roof. Kahn first used the technique in Packard Motors Co.&rsquo;s factory in 1903. The Kahn system allowed for a wider span of free space, unobstructed by supports. High ceilings, large windows stretching from column to column, and deep loggias surrounded the ground floor. The building is in the process of being redeveloped at the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Elks Club</em></strong> on Roxas Blvd was built in 1911, and is presently the <strong><em>Museong Pambata</em></strong>. Founded in 1868 in the US as the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, this social club established a branch in the Philippines. Parsons designed the building as the Manila headquarters of the Elks. It was in the same neoclassical idiom as neighboring Army Navy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Manila Hotel</em></strong> on Katigbak Parkway, the northern boundary of Luneta, was built from 1909 to 1912. It was renovated in 1935, expanded and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restored</a> in 1976 with the addition of a tower, and was once more renovated in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Manila Hotel&rsquo;s inauguration on 4 Jul 1912 was meant to coincide with the US Independence Day. From its inception, the hotel, which stood on 3.5 ha of reclaimed land, was considered a prestigious hotel. From 1935 to 1941, its penthouse was used as the headquarters of Gen Douglas MacArthur, during his tenure as Military Advisor of the Philippine Commonwealth. Aside from providing hotel rooms, several foreign organizations, such as <strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong>, held offices at the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons designed the Manila Hotel in the Mission Revival style, but adapted to the tropics. This is visible in the wide, overhanging pitched roof supported by corbels. The original plan was shaped as an H, with well-ventilated rooms on the two lateral wings that opened to a grand vista of the Manila Bay, Luneta, and Intramuros. The building had four stories and an additional top floor, which was a roofed viewing deck. In 1935, Pres Manuel Quezon commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a> to renovate the building. He converted the roof deck to a penthouse and expanded the west wing northward, building an air-conditioned annex and the Fiesta Pavilion. Gen MacArthur would occupy the penthouse and the festivities for the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth were held in the hotel in Nov 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Marcos era, the former Manila Hotel Company ceased to exist and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) took over. Remodeling began in 1975, with the addition of a building tower, increasing the hotel&rsquo;s capacity to 570 rooms. Renovations were headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2699\">Ildefonso Santos</a>, and a foreign design firm, Dale Keller and Associates. The sparse Mission style gave way to more lavish furnishing. The renovated hotel re-opened on 6 Oct 1977. The hotel was again renovated in 2008 to prepare for the 2012 centennial of the hotel. By this time, ownership passed from government to the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>American Embassy Chancery</em></strong> on 1201 Roxas Blvd was built around 1935. Its architect, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2633\">Juan N. Arellano</a>, designed in a severe neoclassical style. The US Chancery was formerly the residence for the high commissioner of the Philippines. This position was created during the Commonwealth era (1935-46) and replaced the position of governor-general. The work of the high commissioner was to expedite a smooth transition from the Commonwealth to an independent Philippine Republic and to represent the United States in the Philippines. When <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> was turned over to the Pres Quezon, the new residence had to be built. While the Chancery was being constructed, the high commissioner moved to Mansion House in Baguio City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chancery was built on reclaimed land along Roxas Blvd set aside by the Philippine government. To raise the building, 600 concrete piles were sunk about 20 m into the ground. The wings of the building were arranged around an open atrium that allows for maximum light and ventilation in all the areas. The facade is approached through a wide driveway that connects to a landscaped oval rotunda where the American flag flies. The facade&rsquo;s center is slightly recessed and is flanked by bays with windows corresponding to the three stories of the building. These windows are devoid of ornament. Eight Tuscan pillars, rising to two stories define the central section. The middle three sections are covered with a canopy and leads to the triple entrance of the building. The flanking sections have windows. The third floor rests on the lower colonnade and has rectangular windows beneath are grilled faux windows, reminiscent of the <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). The rear of the building has a semicircular colonnade, reminiscent of the White House in Washington, DC. Unlike the rear colonnade of the White House, which faces a garden, the Chancery faces Manila Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Luneta Hotel</em></strong> at T. M. Kalaw (formerly San Luis) was built in 1918. It was designed by architect Salvador Farre in the French Renaissance style so that tenants would have a view of Luneta and Manila Bay&rsquo;s famous sunset. In Jul 1941, the hotel was converted to a non-commissioned officers club. The hotel had 60 rooms with private baths, two suites, telephones in all rooms, a restaurant, a coffee shop, and lanais or veranda. Typical of the French Renaissance style, the hotel has a Mansard roof, not often found in Philippine architecture. Gargoyles in the form of lions, crocodiles, griffins, and other mythical creatures support the wrought iron balconies. After World War II, it fell into disuse, but it has been recently restored and run by its present owner, Beaumont Holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Ynchausti Residence</em></strong> on M.H. del Pilar (formerly Real) was built in the early 1900s. This was the residence of Jose McMicking and Angelina Ynchausti, whose family founded J.J. Ynchausti y Cia, a shipping and trading firm in 1816 and the Banco Espa&ntilde;ol-Filipino. The company built the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/363\">Puente Colgante</a> which linked the Parian with Quiapo, owned Tanduay Distillery, a paint company YCO Paints and Floor Wax, and had business interests in sugar and abaca. The Ynchausti residence&rsquo;s facade faced M.H. del Pilar, while its back faced Manila Bay. The house is a two-story structure in the tradition of the bahay na bato, but with neoclassical ornamentation, such as those found in the multiple columns that support the upper story, which overhangs a covered corridor at the ground floor. The upper floor has arched windows divided by columns into three segments. The roof is ornamented in the manner of Victorian gingerbread houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Admiral <strong>Apartment</strong>s</em></strong> on Roxas Blvd was built from 1938 to 1939. Its architect was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>. The hotel was constructed at the cost of 400,000 pesos. Its function rooms and dining rooms were a favorite among Manile&ntilde;os. The Admiral named these rooms: the Blue Room, which was for private dining; the Spanish Room, which was the reception room; the Malayan Court, which was the main dining room; and the Coconut Grove, the cocktail lounge. In Malayan Court hung an oil painting by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3528\">Antonio Dumlao</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Admiral was inaugurated on 8 Jul 1939 with Pres Quezon as guest of honor. For many years, the Admiral was the tallest building in Manila and served as a seafarer&rsquo;s landmark. Among the distinguished guests that visited the Admiral were Clare Booth Luce, the American Ambassador to Italy and wife of media mogul, Henry Luce, and Prince Louis Mountbatten, uncle of Prince Philip of England. During World War II, the Japanese navy, under Admiral Iwabuchi Sanji, commandeered the hotel and turned it into its office. The building escaped damage during the liberation of Manila. In the years immediately after the war the American High Command stayed at the Admiral, with the exception of Gen MacArthur, who had his own suite at the Manila Hotel. The Admiral Hotel was demolished in 2014, to make way for a 52-story hotel, despite the protest of heritage advocates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two churches stand on M. H. del Pilar St, parallel to Roxas Blvd. They are the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia of Ermita, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\">Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Remedios</a> of Malate. These two churches, while not located along Roxas Blvd, are best viewed from the boulevard because the Spanish-era plazas located before these churches have been preserved. The Ermita plaza, bearing the same name as the church, is a narrow longitudinal plaza planted with trees and shrubs that runs from Del Pilar to Roxas Blvd. The Malate plaza, presently named <strong><em>Rajah Sulayman Park</em></strong>, is also planted with trees, but its middle section, where a monument to Rajah Sulayman by the sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a> stands, has been paved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Ermita Church</em></strong> on Del Pilar cor Antonio Flores was built in the 1950s and designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2698\">Carlos Antonio Santos-Viola</a>. The present church is a post-World War II structure, which replaced older structures built during the Spanish era. The church and the parish origins are from a hermitage built in 1606, hence the name Ermita. The hermitage housed the image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2245\">Our Lady of Guidance</a>), which was found by the invading troops of Legazpi on 19 May 1571 on a pandan plant. It was being worshipped by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image was brought to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, but was returned to the area when a hermitage made of wood, bamboo, and nipa thatch was built there. Since the late 16th century, a number of churches were built on the area, each church replacing the previous one. The history of the constructions is uncertain, but there is evidence of a baroque structure built in the 18th century, which replaced the 17th century structure. In 1885, a church designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\">Lorenzo Guerrero</a>, an artist and architect, was built on the site. Guerrero died in 1904 and was buried in the church. This church had the marks of revivalist architecture in the tall and slender arched windows of neo-Romanesque, the rose window and spires of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 19th century church was destroyed during World War II, and the present church rose on its site. Designed by Santos-Viola, the church is a modern interpretation of the late 19th century revivalist style with straight functional lines, large windows that allow light to filter in, and a wide, tall space to house a congregation. It quotes historic styles, like the Romanesque, with its use of arched windows and a bell tower decorated with narrow and tall windows terminating in an arch on the upper floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Malate Church</em></strong> occupies a block bounded by Del Pilar, Remedios, Mabini, and San Andres. Dedicated to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Remedios, the first church was built in 1591. A parish of the Augustinians, the 1591 church was ordered demolished by Gov-Gen Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, for fear that it might be used by the Chinese pirate Limahong to stage an attack on Intramuros. The church was torn down in 1667.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A decade later, from 1677 to 1679, Fr Dionisio Suarez, OSA, built a new church. The British occupied the church and adjacent convent in 1762. After it was damaged by an earthquake and typhoon in 1863, the church was rebuilt by Fr Francisco Cuadro. The present church is most likely the fifth church built on the spot. There is evidence that after 1863, the church was made taller by integrating the original triangular pediment with the flanking bell towers, while preserving the earlier facade. The church is basically baroque with Mudejar ornamentation, evident in the use of trefoil arches for both open and blind windows. The 19th century church survived to the 20th century but was damaged by fire during World War II. The Columban fathers, who had succeeded the Augustinians in administering the parish, rebuilt the church in 1950. The church underwent retrofitting in 1992, following an earthquake in 1990. It was restored recently, in 2014. The church is cruciform, characterized by a rounded apse and transept end. A faux dome graces the transept crossing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Fort San Antonio Abad</em></strong> aka <strong><em>Polverin</em></strong> is located on Roxas Blvd, north of Pablo Ocampo. Presently, the fort is hidden from Roxas Blvd by the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. Built in 1764 as bastioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> after the British occupation of Manila, it was located at the site of an earlier fort built in 1584 to guard the route between Cavite and Manila, and to act as a rear guard for the city. The fort was used as gunpowder storage or&nbsp;<em>polverin</em>, hence its other name. For fear that gunpowder, originally stored in Intramuros beside the Bastion de San Diego, posed a danger to the city should it ignite, the polverin was built. In 1762, the British occupied the polverin and used it to stage an assault on Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1764, the polverin was renovated and renamed San Antonio Abad. On 13 Aug 1898, Americans occupied the fort and during World War II, the Japanese built a cement bunker on the eastern side of the fort and mounted a canon on it. This indestructible bunker still stands. After World War II, the fort and the land surrounding it were given to the navy until it was turned over to the Central Bank, to serve as its central headquarters. This triangular fort with two bastions was restored, with the construction in the 1970s of a new Central Bank Complex along Roxas Blvd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fort San Antonio was declared a national cultural treasure by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taft Ave Corridor.</strong> The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\"><strong><em>Central Post Office</em></strong></a> on Liwasang Bonifacio was built in 1926 and designed by architects Juan Arellano and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a> in the neoclassical style. This building at the end of Taft Ave and along the Pasig River gives a visual terminus to the principal road of this heritage area. Its location makes the Post Office more imposing than Arellano&rsquo;s other building, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative building</a> along P. Burgos. The neoclassical design consists of a monumental rectangular block buttressed at each end by semicircular volumes. What makes the central block distinctive are the 14 fluted Ionic columns, raised on a podium approached by wide stairs. The podium leads to an open and tall portico defined by the columns, and then to the main hall where rows of counters are located. The workshop of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> and his son, Vidal, worked on the decorative elements of the building, including the large precast cement flowerpots that decorate the staircase leading to the vestibule. The building was destroyed in 1945, but it was restored in 1946 with the interior simplified. The decorated coffered ceiling of the pre-World War II building was not recreated. With the automation of mail and the increasing popularity of email, there are plans are to reuse the building for other purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Insular Ice Plant and Cold Storage</em></strong> was located in Parian along the Pasig River&rsquo;s southern bank. Built in 1902, its architect was the American Edgar Ketchum Bourne, who opted for the Mission revivalist style. On 10 Dec 1901, the Philippine Commission, through Act No 315, authorized the construction of an ice plant and cold storage facility for the army commissary. Criticized for being unnecessarily huge, it had the distinction of being the first permanent building constructed by the Americans. It had a massive, windowless brick wall in the refrigeration area, which was divided from the more open area by the main entrance. The main entrance had a generous pedimented portal, wide and one and a half stories tall, to allow easy access by freight vehicles. It had low relief false arches at the cold storage section, and windowed arches at the rest. Aside from the bricks, Oregon pine was used for the floor, columns, and interior structural members. Its slender smoke stack rose to about 10 stories. Steam coming from the stacks was diverted to a loud horn that signaled time for the city at 6:00 a.m., noon, and 6:00 p.m. The smoke stack was visible from a long distance around and served as a vertical landmark. An underground pipe brought cold air to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> to keep it cool when the theater was constructed in 1931. The ice plant was demolished in the early 1980s to make way for the superstructure of the LRT 1, which ran from Baclaran to Central Station. LRT 1 was inaugurated 1 Dec 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Metropolitan Theater</em></strong> located facing Liwasang Bonifacio (formerly Plaza Lawton) was built in 1931 and restored in 1978 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2634\">Otilio Arellano</a>. Its architects were Juan and Otilio Arellano and ornamentation was by Isabelo Tampinco. Its style combined <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art noveau</a> and art deco. Inaugurated on 10 Dec 1931, with a mixed program of music, theater, and film, the Metropolitan Theater was hailed as a masterpiece of Arellano, who deviated from the neoclassical style, which had been his idiom for public buildings. The Metropolitan stood in contrast to the Legislative and Post Office buildings, for being colorful and festive. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theater</a> was built for one million pesos, which was raised through public subscription. To prepare for the theater, Arellano studied under Thomas Lamb in the US, who was an expert in theater design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Metropolitan&rsquo;s front was designed as a proscenium with an Art Noveau stained glass signage. The theater was flanked by garden courts and two-story wings for a ballroom, restaurants, offices, and shops. The complex was crowned by curving parapets with pinnacles. Otilio Arellano designed the bas-relief and statuary, which Isabelo Tampinco executed. Otilio supervised the restoration in 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abandoned for a number of years, since its closure in 1996, the Metropolitan&rsquo;s future looked uncertain. But in 2015, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a> took charge of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traveling south from the Central Post office, on the eastern side of Taft Ave is <strong><em>Manila City Hall</em></strong>. It was built in 1941 and designed by architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\">Antonio Ma&ntilde;alac Toledo</a> in the neoclassical style. The city hall has an irregular quadrilateral plan that conforms to the lot bound by P. Burgos Ave to west, and A Villegas to the east. Burgos merges with Taft Ave and Villegas crosses it on a diagonal. The building is planned around two atriums. At the northern section of the building stands the 10-story clock tower a distinct feature of the Manila City Hall. From the tower building, wings radiate like spokes of half a wheel. The buildings house the different departments of the city hall. The facade is on the south end and its main entrance is marked by a pedimented section. The north entrance is similar in design to the facade. This facade entrance is mostly ceremonial because the more common entrances to the city hall are through the entrances facing Burgos Ave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>East of the Manila City Hall is the <strong><em>Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association (YMCA)</em></strong> building. William E. Parsons was commissioned to design the building in 1909. The building was located at a lot now bounded by Natividad Lopez St. Parsons designed a cluster of three buildings connected by a covered corridor. Facing the facade, to the right, was the athletic building, at the center was the main building, and to the left was the kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The main building was 45 x 13.5 meters. It housed private offices, lecture hall, library, and a billiard hall. The rear veranda ran the length of the main building and opened to the tennis courts. The second and third floors had rooms for rent, for men only. Each room had a balcony, but tenants shared common toilets and baths, parlor, and lecture halls. It could accommodate 65 guests. The athletic building was 20 x 25 meters. It had locker rooms, a shower, a 6 x 18-meter swimming pool, and a four-lane bowling alley. The second floor had a gym, the director&rsquo;s office, and committee rooms. The athletic building was originally planned to have a roof garden, but Parsons changed it for the more practical hip roof. The project cost 170,000 pesos. The YMCA property was sold to SM Property Holdings, which demolished the YMCA building, which had been reconstructed and expanded after the war. Its location is now occupied by SM Manila mall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Near the Manila City Hall, on the western side of Taft Ave, is the <strong><em>National Museum of the Philippines Complex</em></strong>. Presently the National Museum is composed of three buildings. The main building, which is now the National Museum of Fine Arts and the museum&rsquo;s main office, the National Museum of Anthropology, and the National Museum of Natural History.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>National Museum of Fine Arts</em></strong> and main building, formerly known as the <strong><em>National Art Gallery</em></strong>, has had many uses. It was formerly the <strong><em><strong>Legislative Building</strong></em></strong>, which housed the upper and lower chambers of Congress (1935-45). It was the Office of the Vice President during martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on P. Burgos Drive, the main building&rsquo;s architects were Ralph Harrington Doane of the Bureau of Public Works, Antonio Toledo, and Juan Arellano. It is in the neoclassical and Greek revival styles. Construction of the main building began in 1918, but it was suspended several times because of lack of funding. The building was originally planned as the building for the National Library. When it was decided that the building would be used by the Legislature, the revision of the building plans was entrusted to Juan Arellano, then supervising architect of the Bureau. The building was inaugurated on 16 Jul 1926. By then, the construction had cost four million pesos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building was used for the 1934 Constitutional Convention. It was damaged during World War II. Since the war, the building has gone through different occupants. It was renamed Congress of the Philippines in the early years of the Republic. It housed the Senate, the Sandiganbayan and Tanod Bayan or Office of the Ombudsman. It was renamed the Executive House during the martial law years (1972-86), when it served as the office of the Prime Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Greek revival building is noted for its columns that allude to Greek temples. The statues of the pediment, most of those in the Senate Hall, were by German sculptors Otto Fisher Credo and Walter Strauss. The statues at the pediment depicted the three regions of the Philippines&mdash;Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao&mdash;as allegorical female figures, similar to an earlier work, <strong><em>Madre Filipinas</em></strong>, formerly mounted on Jones Bridge. Other sculptural pieces were by Vidal Tampinco and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3655\">Ramon Martinez</a>. The murals in the Senate Hall were painted by Juan Arellano and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a>. In the postwar reconstruction, only the main entrance at the center retained the detached columns, those at the sides were replaced with pilasters of the Corinthian order. In 1996, the Senate moved out of the building and it was turned over to the National Museum, which in 2003 began a restoration and architectural reuse of the historic building. Work on the Legislative building continues as more rooms are outfitted as galleries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former <strong><em>Department of Agriculture and Commerce Building</em></strong>, now the <strong><em>National Museum of Natural History</em></strong>, and the former <strong><em>Department of Finance Building</em></strong>, now the <strong><em>National Museum of Anthropology</em></strong>, on Agrifina Circle were built in 1934. Its architect, Antonio Ma&ntilde;alac Toledo, planned it in the neoclassical style with Greek Revival characteristics, same as the main building. The two buildings, which face each other, are actually mirror images of each other. Both use a convex Greek temple facade type that conforms to the Agrifina Circle or rotunda. The wide flights of stairs before both buildings are likewise convex. Six fluted Corinthian columns flanked by engaged and fluted pilasters rise to three stories creating a colonnade that leads to the entrance of the buildings. Four portals with semicircular lead doors lead to the interior, which is arranged around an open-air atrium that allows light to enter the building and flood the corridors that open to it. The atrium serves to ventilate the building better. A fourth story is in the attic of this building. Greek revival ornaments like dentils and wreathes and garlands decorate the building. Iron grille work relates the building to the bahay na bato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Department of Finance Building</em></strong> was turned over to the National Museum and was renovated and refurbished to become the anthropology, ethnography, history, and archaeology museum of the museum complex. Formerly the <strong><em>Museum of the Filipino People</em></strong>, it is now named the <strong><em>National Museum of Anthropology</em></strong>, and houses exhibits of different indigenous groups in the Philippines, major archaeological finds, and the wreck of the galleon San Diego.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently undergoing renovation, the <strong><em>Department of Agriculture Building</em></strong> will house the botany and zoology divisions of the museum and is now known as the <strong><em>National Museum of Natural History</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>South of the main building of the National Museum, and across from Rizal Park, in Taft Avenue&rsquo;s eastern side is <strong><em>Santa Isabel College</em></strong> (210 Taft Ave), which was established on 24 Oct 1632 in Intramuros. It was originally a school for orphaned Spanish girls, but soon after it accepted non-orphans. In 1733, the original school, which was built along Real del Palacio (its site is presently occupied by the Catholic Bishop&rsquo;s Conference of the Philippines), received Royal Patronage and came to be known as the Real Colegio de Santa Isabel. On 22 Jul 1862, fifteen Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul (Madres Paules) took charge of the school. To the school had been aggregated Colegio de Santa Potenciana, which by then had few enrollees. The college buildings were totally destroyed in the shelling of Intramuros during World War II. The sisters took refuge in Santa Rita&rsquo;s College, along Taft Ave. In the postwar years, the sisters taught at Santa Rita and the former students of Santa Isabel enrolled in Santa Rita. The sisters acquired Santa Rita and changed its name to Santa Isabel College. By the 1950s, they had expanded the facilities of the school, adding an auditorium in 1953. Although the building is a postwar construction, its chapel houses an important cultural treasure, the Santo Cristo de Tesoro, formerly housed in the chapel of the treasury in Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Jai-Alai</em></strong> was built in 1940, following the designs of American architects Welton Becket and Walter Wurdemann. It was in Streamline Moderne art deco. The building was demolished in 2000 after it had been closed and not used for three decades. Becket, known for his design of the Los Angeles Airport, built a building considered as one of Asia&rsquo;s finest art deco buildings. Four stories tall, with a central section covered with structural glass blocks which housed the Sky Club, it was Manila&rsquo;s place to be seen in its heyday. The building housed the courts for a Basque ball game, using a wicker scoop or pelota and a hard rubber ball, which was bounced against a wall. The game was visible to spectators. On the upper stories of the building was a restaurant and dance club, which was frequented by Manila&rsquo;s high society. The building fell into disuse during the martial law years because Pres Ferdinand Marcos had banned the game. The building was deteriorating when it was demolished during the incumbency of Mayor Lito Atienza to make way for Hall of Justice. But nothing has been built on the site since the demolition. Behind the now empty lot, and between San Marcelino Church, is the site for the 43-story Torre de Manila condominum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ayala Blvd Crossroad.</strong> The Philippine Normal School (PNS) complex, presently, <strong><em>Philippine Normal University</em></strong> on Taft Ave and Ayala Blvd was built 1915, following the design William E. Parsons, who used elements from Mission revival and neoclassical styles. Created by Philippine Commission Act No 74, PNS was established as a teacher-training school for the public school system that the American colonial government was organizing. PNS formally opened on 1 Sep 1901, with Elmer B. Bryan as its first superintendent. It was elevated to a college in 1948, and then a university in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buildings of PNS both designed by Parsons were separated from each other by Ayala Blvd. The school building follows a V-plan to conform to the layout of the street where Ayala Blvd runs diagonally from Taft Ave. The corner of the building is gracefully rounded. Characteristic of the Mission style, as adapted by Parsons, is the wide overhang of the pitched roof. The entrance facing Ayala Blvd has a flat wall terminating in a rounded parapet. Arches decorate the front, as well as the inner corridors, of the school. The corridors lead to classrooms and arcaded corridors open to an inner courtyard. The dormitory across the main building is more classical in design, but the covered roof deck and the combination of wood and cement for the facade&rsquo;s triple arched fenestrations, plus the wide overhang of the roof, make it akin to the Mission Revival style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T. M. Kalaw Crossroad, Western Side of Taft.</strong> The <strong><em>Central Methodist Church</em></strong> on T. M. Kalaw (formerly San Luis) was built in 1906, following the design of C.B. Ripley. The original church structure was in the vernacular neo-Gothic, which simply meant it was built with wood. In 1932, this earlier structure was demolished and a new church of reinforced concrete was built. The new building was designed by Juan N. Arellano who, like Ripley, followed the neo-Gothic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Methodist Church is the first Protestant church in the Philippines, founded 5 Mar 1899. Initially established to minister to American troops and migrants, the church grew in membership, so a lot was purchased on T. M. Kalaw, and a temporary chapel with a seating capacity of 150 was dedicated on 23 Dec 1901. As membership grew, the original church was built. It had a lower story of rusticated stone with external buttresses, and a gable floor with walls of wood planks. Its roof was steep and shingled, while the windows were lancet and had awning-type shutters. At the gable were oculi. This original structure lasted for three decades before it was finally replaced by the all-cement church designed by Arellano, which was inaugurated on the birth anniversary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Dr&nbsp;Jose Rizal</a>, on 19 Jun 1932.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like its predecessor this new structure is cruciform. The church suffered damage in 1945. Its roof hadcompletely collapsed, and its walls were singed by fire and riddled with bullet holes. On 21 Feb 1949, reconstruction work on the church began with funds raised with the assistance of the Council of Bishops in the US, the Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions, the Bishop of Manila Central, and contributions from individual members. It took almost five months to rebuild the church, and it finally reopened on Christmas Day 1949. It was formally re-dedicated on 10 Feb 1950. A large lancet window at the facade brought light into the church and a smaller window, with stained glass decorated the apse. From the facade&rsquo;s left radiated a cloister walk that connected the church to other structures in the compound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Padre Faura Crossroad.</strong> The <strong><em>Supreme Court</em></strong> on Taft Ave cor Padre Faura was built in 1913. Architect William Parsons used the neoclassical (Federal) style. This was originally part of the University of the Philippines (UP) campus. The Supreme Court, which was established in 1901, was housed in a number of locations before finally settling into its own building. The structure is characterized by its porches, which are decorated with Corinthian colonnades at the facade and Ionic colonnades at the sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Escuela Normal de San Francisco Xavier</em></strong> on Padre Faura St was built in 1865 in the neoclassical style. Established in 1865 for the training of teachers for the newly opened primary schools supported by the government. It was closed in 1905, when Philippine Normal was opened by the government. In 1906, it became the first home of the reopened San Jose Seminary. After the 1932 fire that destroyed the Ateneo buildings in Intramuros, Ateneo was transferred to Ermita and shared facilities with San Jose. San Jose occupied a wing of the building until the seminary transferred to Santa Ana. The neoclassical building had a central arch portal at the center. The rest of the building was ornamented with pilasters alternating with windows, arched at the ground floor and rectangular at the upper floors. The building was destroyed because of heavy bombardment and fire in 1945. It was never rebuilt because Ateneo de Manila had transferred to Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Observatorio de Manila</em></strong> on Padre Faura was built in 1886, and an astronomical observatory was added in 1891. Architect Ruperto Iba&ntilde;ez designed it in the neo-Renaissance style. Begun in the Jesuits&rsquo; Casa Mision in Intramuros by Federico Faura when he was still a seminarian, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/336\">Manila Observatory</a> transferred to Padre Faura in 1884, where the Jesuits had earlier built the Escuela Normal de San Francisco. The successful forecast and tracking of typhoons in 1879 brought the support of merchants to the project. In 1880, the Observatory began sending its predictions to Hong Kong via cable. The Observatory became an important institution in the region as a result. In 1884, it received government support, which allowed it to build bigger quarters in Ermita, which were inaugurated in 1886. The same year, Fr Faura designed a home version of the barometer, which was popular among seafarers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1891, an astronomical department was added, but it was housed in a separate building. On 13 Jun 1894, an 18-inch astronomical lens arrived from Mertz of Switzerland for the observatory. This simple neoclassical building was destroyed in 1945. In the 1950s, the Observatory re-opened at Mirador Hill, Baguio. In 1961, it transferred to the Ateneo de Manila University Campus in Loyola Heights, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Philippine General Hospital (PGH)</strong> </em>on Taft Ave was built in 1910. Its initial architect was Edgar Bourne, but he was succeeded by William Parsons. The building style is mission revival. The PGH was established through Philippine Commission Act No 1668, which set aside 780,000 pesos for its construction. The cornerstone was laid on 28 Feb 1908. As designed by Parsons, PGH runs almost a whole block of Taft Ave, from Padre Faura to Pedro Gil. The southern end of the block is occupied by University of the Philippines (UP) Manila, whose College of Medicine has PGH as its partner hospital, where its medical interns train. PGH was designed as a light-filled and airy space where cross-ventilation allowed air to flow efficiently and well, as the assumption was that stale air was inimical to human health. Like the tsalet built during the era, the building was raised above the damp earth. The original building had two high-ceiling floors. The central wing housed the central administration, and it led to a central area for common facilities. From this central core branched out pavilions with separate courtyards. Each pavilion housed a department&mdash;surgical, orthopedic, medical, and maternity. Connecting the pavilions with administration were wide arcaded galleries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1981, then First Lady Imelda Marcos commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2695\">Jorge Ramos</a> to create a master plan for the renovation and expansion of PGH. An additional eight-story tower block was built behind the 1910 building. It was completed in 1990. PGH continued adding facilities so that by 2011, it had more than 13 departments and specialized units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Nurses Home</em></strong> on Taft Ave cor Padre Faura was built in 1915. Architect Tomas Mapua designed it in neorennaissance style. Built beside PGH, it was a dormitory for nurses assigned to PGH and for those in training. Designed as three stories, the ground floor was recessed and taller than the second and third floors. The facade was defined by an arcade at the ground floor, and by the repetition of the arches in the balustraded third floor. The second floor had rectangular windows. Both ends of the building stood in contrast to the rest by being more enclosed and ornamented with rustication at the corner. Entrance to the building was through a grand arch flanked by engaged columns surmounted by classicist statuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UP was established through a charter in 1908, and its first building was supposed to be located on the corner of Padre Faura and Taft Ave, but it now houses the Supreme Court. Architect William E. Parsons designed the building in the neoclassical style. The <strong><em>UP Manila</em></strong> campus on Pedro Gil (formerly Herran), as it is known now, was acquired soon after the university moved from Malecon (now Bonifacio Drive). The new campus was built in 1910, and integrated the previously existing College of Medicine (now Calderon Hall) and the School of Fine Arts and Conservatory of Music (Villamor Hall), both of which were established in 1905, predating UP. Architect Juan Arellano designed Calderon and Villamor Hall, using neoclassical and neorenaissance styles respectively. The sculptures of the muses of music and art which flank the entrance to Villamor Hall were done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The location of the UP campus placed it next door to the PGH, which was soon placed under a joint administration with UP, as PGH served as the teaching <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospital</a> for the university&rsquo;s College of Medicine. The building of the college is now named Calderon Hall, in honor of its first dean, Fernando Calderon. The college functioned all throughout World War II, though its building suffered damage during the war. It was rehabilitated in 1951. A monumental version of Jose Rizal&rsquo;s <strong><em>Science Conquering Death</em></strong> stands in front of the college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pedro Gil (formerly Herran) Crossroad, Western Side of Taft<em>.&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Ellinwood Church</em></strong> on Vasquez, near Pedro Gil was built in 1932 in the neo-Gothic style favored by Protestant churches. Ellinwood Church was one of a few structures that survived World War II, despite heavy bombing and fighting in the Malate district in 1945, during the liberation of Manila. The church began in the summer of 1899 when Rev Dr James B. Rodgers arrived in Manila to begin the American Presbyterian mission in the Philippines. The first Presbyterian areas of the mission were Binondo and the Ermita-Malate area. From there, missions were opened in Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Bicol, the Visayas and Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two structures were built on Vasquez: Ellinwood Boy&rsquo;s Dormitory and the Ellinwood Bible School for Girls. Sunday services in English were held at the dormitory. A separate Tagalog service for those living in the Ermita-Malate area was also held. The need for a bigger church became crucial as the congregation grew. In 1927, plans were made to build a bigger sanctuary, realized five years later with Rev Catalino Paulino, Ellinwood&rsquo;s first Filipino pastor. Spared from the war, Ellinwood reopened in 1945, with the return of the Americans. Rev. Bousman briefly resumed his pastoral duties, followed by Rev. Christie until 1946. The church is in the neo-Gothic style preferred by Protestant churches. Its facade has large lancet windows with tracery filled with glass. Its hammer beam ceiling gives it a distinctive look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Saint Paul&rsquo;s College</em></strong> on Pedro Gil has the <strong><em>Chapel of the Crucified Christ</em></strong> by Andres Luna de San Pedro built in the art deco style in 1927. On 25 Jun 1911, the Sisters of St Paul of Chartres, a congregation of nuns from France, opened a novitiate on Pedro Gil (Herran) in the Malate district. Responding to requests to open a school for girls from families in the neighborhood, the sisters began with a kindergarten department in 1912. This was followed by Grade 1, with one higher grade opening each successive year. Male students were accepted up to Grade 2. By 1919, the school had a complete grade school department, and earned recognition as a school. The high school department opened in 1924, and had its first graduates in 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 24 Jan 1927, a chapel was built on school grounds, through the efforts of Mother Saint Xavier, the Provincial Superior. The chapel has the general silhouette of the zigzag style and smooth angular lines of art deco, but it adds large lancet windows over which is a cement cast crucifix in the art deco style of Beuron, surrounded by a ray of light. A pair of angels in the art deco style kneels at the bottom of the monumental crucifix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, the prewar school buildings were modest structures of wood because on 27 Feb 1945, Japanese troops obliterated the compound by fire, leaving only the facade of the chapel standing but scorched. On 27 Jun 1948, the restored chapel was blessed by Most Rev Michael J. O&rsquo;Doherty, Archbishop of Manila. The rest of the school building was rebuilt, but in modern style, beginning with the administration building in 1952. The school&rsquo;s chapel was marked by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Assumption College</em></strong> on Pedro Gil cor Adriatico (formerly Dakota) was built in the neo-Gothic style. In 1892, the Congregation of the Religious of the Assumption founded on 30 Apr 1839 by St Marie-Eugenie de Jesus (1817-98) arrived in the Philippines to run the Superior Normal School for Women in Intramuros. At the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, the Assumption sisters returned to Europe and ceased operating the school. But in 1904, at the request of Pope St Pius X, the sisters returned to Manila, where they opened an elementary and secondary school, adding a college department in 1940. Before the outbreak of the war, the sisters had built a school along the lines of collegiate gothic, in which gothic motifs like lancet windows and gothic-type cloisters were added to a functional structure. These prewar buildings occupied a campus adjacent to the Ateneo de Manila, which had a gate at Adriatico and a main entrance facing Padre Faura. Damaged in 1945, during the liberation of Manila like its neighbor Ateneo, Assumption re-opened classes in quonset huts and in its ruined auditorium. Under mother superior Rosa Maria, one of the pioneers who arrived in 1904, the buildings were rebuilt in 1947 and by 1948 were ready for occupancy. In 1973, Assumption, which had campuses in San Lorenzo and Antipolo, moved out of the Pedro Gil Campus. The property was sold to a developer and the buildings have been demolished to make way for Robinson&rsquo;s Place Manila. The Assumption Herran campus is best remembered for its manicured garden, which had a small lagoon, and for the high-ceiling room and arcaded corridors with lancet arches, decorated at the springing with fleur de lys medallions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Between Malvar and Nakpil, Eastern Side of Taft.&nbsp;<em>Philippine Women&rsquo;s University</em></strong> (PWU) was founded in 1919 by Clara Aragon, Concepcion Aragon, Francisca Tirona Benitez, Paz Marquez Benitez, Carolina Ocampo Palma, Mercedes Rivera and Socorro Marquez Zaballero with the assistance of lawyer Jose Abad Santos, who would be appointed by Pres Manuel Quezon as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court just before World War II. In 1932, the school became a university. PWU was the first all-women&rsquo;s school founded to empower women. The university building occupied a whole block along Taft Ave, bounded by Malvar to the north, Nakpil to the south, and Leon Guinto to the east. The university building is built around an enclosed open space with the buildings forming the perimeter of the compound. The building in the neoclassical style continued to function intermittently during the war, and was converted to a hospital, the Pagamutan ng Maynila. Damaged during the war, the buildings were restored. In the 1970s, extra floors were added to the buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Between Nakpil and Remedios.&nbsp;<em>Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge</em></strong>, <strong><em>Macario R. Ramos Memorial Lodge No 355</em></strong> on Taft Ave. was built in the art deco geometric style. Masonry made its way to the Philippines during the 19th century. Many heroes, like Dr. Jose Rizal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">M.H. del Pilar</a>, were masons. The lodge belongs to the Scottish rite. The temple is divided into three parts. The central section rises above the flanks, and is projected forward. Three bays of narrow but tall windows separated by flat walls bring light into the buildings flanks, while a similar arrangement is also found in the central section. The ground floor of the central section is the entrance to the temple. This entrance is covered by a canopy. The corners of the building and the projected central section are also projected outwards even more to form decorative terminations for the sections. Geometrically stylized garlands decorate the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pablo Ocampo (formerly Vito Cruz) Crossroad, Western Side of Taft<em>.&nbsp;</em><em>De La Salle University&rsquo;s Main Building</em></strong> on Taft Ave was built in 1936. Its architect, Tomas Mapua, designed it in the neoclassical style. As planned by Mapua, De La Salle has an H-shaped building. The central entrance located at the center of the main wing and the ends of the buildings perpendicular to the main wing had a Greek-temple-type facade. The lower floor was arcaded but the upper floor, which had generous corridors leading to classrooms were ornamented with engaged Corinthian pilasters, which contrasted with the free standing columns of the main entrance and the facades of the flanking wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Rizal Memorial Stadium</strong> </em>on Pablo Ocampo was built in 1934 and was designed by architects of the Bureau of Public Works in the art deco style. Built on land donated by the Vito Cruz Family, which was formerly known as Carnival Ground, the main stadium was originally built as the Rizal Memorial Tennis Stadium. The fully developed complex had a soccer field, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a baseball diamond, track files, and a covered area for basketball. It was used for the Far Eastern Championship Games, a precursor to the ASEAN Games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The complex was a theater of World War II atrocities, when Japanese herded civilians to the area to be massacred. Damaged by war, the sports complex was rehabilitated and continues to function. The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), which manages the complex, has announced that the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex (RMSC) as it is now called, will be sold soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eastern Side of Taft.</strong> The Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing sent five sisters to the Philippines who arrived on 14 Sep 1906. The sisters opened a school in a wagon-shed along Moriones St, Tondo, where they had an initial enrollment of 58 boys and girls in total. The following year they transferred to San Marcelino, in a lot donated by Abp Jeremias Harty of Manila. In 1909, the school gained government recognition, and in 1914, school buildings rose on Church property in Singalong along Leon Guinto (formerly Pennsylvania) that would become <strong><em>Saint Scholastica&rsquo;s College</em></strong>. The buildings were in the neo-Romanesque style, especially the school chapel whose open vestibule had columns in the medieval style. The use of arches characterized the chapel and school complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1909, the Conservatory of Music was established by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3901\">Sr Baptista Battig, OSB</a>, a pupil of the German composer and pianist Franz Listz. In 1932, the art deco Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s Hall was built for the conservatory. Its fine acoustics made it very suitable to concert performances. Damaged in 1945 by American bombardment, architect Roberto Novenario and engineer Ramon del Rosario undertook its restoration. The hall reopened in 1955. From 1998 to 2000, the hall underwent extensive restoration and upgrading, re-opening on 16 Jul 2000. In 1999, the NHI declared Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s Hall a National Cultural Landmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>San Marcelino-Leon Guinto (formerly Pennsylvania) Corridor<em>.</em></strong> San Marcelino and Leon Guinto, the main north to south artery, east and parallel to Taft Ave, developed as a planned community, an antecedent of the gated communities of the post-World War II era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\"><strong>Paco Cemetery</strong></a></em></strong> on San Marcelino&rsquo;s eastern side was built in 1823 in the neoclassical style. During the 19th century, with the growing awareness of the spread of disease, cemeteries were constructed at the outskirts of cities and towns, away from the populated centers. The cemetery at Dilao, as Paco was called back then, was no sooner completed when it became the burial grounds of many cholera victims. The cemetery was planned as two concentric circular stonewalls enclosing a patio, into which were built niches for the dead: the inner wall for Spaniards, and the outer wall for Filipinos. The cemetery has a special place for children called <strong>Angelitos</strong> and for exhumed bones, the <strong>Ossario</strong>. National hero Dr Jose Rizal was temporarily interred in the Paco Cemetery, from 30 Dec 1896 to 17 Aug 1898, when his remains were exhumed to be eventually buried in the Rizal Monument at Luneta on 29 Dec 1912. The cemetery has been restored and reused as a park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Philippine School of Arts and Trade</em></strong>, presently known as the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP), on Ayala Blvd and San Marcelino St, was built in 1914 in Mission revival style. Built to professionalize the trades and crafts, the school had counterparts in other places in the Philippines, which were established to foment the growth of industry in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1932, George Adamson, a Greek chemist from Athens, and his brother Alex established <strong><em>Adamson School of Industrial Chemistry and Engineering</em></strong> (ASICE, now simply <strong><em>Adamson University</em></strong>) at the Paterno Bldg (FEATI) at Plaza Goiti. It moved to various locations as the student population grew. From Plaza Goiti, it moved to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/304\">Goldenberg Mansion</a> on Gen Solano St, San Miguel from 1933 to 1939. Then it moved to the Augustinian treasury and Asian headquarters on Arsobispo and Real del Parian in Intramuros. The school was raised to university status in 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1946, after World War II, Adamson University transferred to 900 San Marcelino. In 1964, administration transferred to the Vincentians, who ran the San Marcelino Parish of St Vincent de Paul, located next to Adamson. From 1964 to 1967, George Lucas Adamson served as transitional president. In 1968, Adamson acquired the Meralco Bldg and, in 1977, St Theresa&rsquo;s College Manila. The 1946 building of Adamson is in the neoclassical style characterized by arched windows on the lower two floors and double arches on the second. The main entrance is in the Greek temple style with flanking Corinthian pilasters and a triangular plain pediment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Saint Theresa&rsquo;s College</em></strong> on 920 San Marcelino stood directly in front of Adamson. It was a school established by Mother Louise de Meester from Belgium. She first landed in Ilocos Sur where she began her missionary work. In 1915, she went to Manila to establish Saint Theresa&rsquo;s in response to the invitation of Manila archbishop Jeremiah James Harty. The Saint Theresa&rsquo;s building was functional and straightforward. The main building was built around two atriums and the three-story facade was flanked by towers. An additional building south of the main building also enclosed an atrium. The three-story main building has an arcaded ground floor. The upper two stories have rectangular windows distributed following a modular plan where the windows were separated by pillars. Facing the atrium is an arcaded corridor, which leads to the classrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Meralco</em></strong> <em><strong>Bldg</strong> </em>on San Marcelino was built in 1936. Its architect, Andres Luna de San Pedro, designed it in art deco. Its facade was decorated by a sculpture by Francesco Ricardo Monti titled <strong><em>The Furies</em></strong>. The building belongs to the Streamline moderne type of art deco. The northern end is taller than the rest of the building. Above the doorway rises a plinth with a four-story narrow window. Above the plinth, in script, is the word &ldquo;Meralco.&rdquo; The plinth cascades northwards ending in a graceful arch. Composed on a diagonal to the arch is Monti&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Furies</em></strong>. The rest of the building running south is lower than the plinth. The lower floor is a covered walkway over which hangs the second story and supported by pillars. The canopy of the building is decorated with a frieze that has been interpreted as stylized railroad tracks or eyes. Its wrought iron grilles have stylized foliage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The art deco head office of Meralco, the biggest electric distribution company in Luzon, survived World War II only to be demolished by the wrecking crew of a redeveloper that plans to build a 32-story high-rise. The building was demolished in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>San Marcelino Church</em></strong> or&nbsp;<em><strong>Parish Church of Saint Vincent de Paul</strong> </em>was built in 1926. Architect Andres Luna de San Pedro designed it in neoromanesque style. Originally part of San Fernando de Dilao (Paco), the parish was established on 6 Dec 1909 by Abp Jeremiah J. Harty of Manila. In 1872, the Vincentians bought land at Barrio San Marcelino, which was mostly rice fields, to house seminarians and Vincentians whose dwelling at the San Carlos Seminary in Intramuros was damaged by an 1880 earthquake, which almost leveled Intramuros. The Vincentians built a central house and chapel. During the Philippine revolution (1896-98), the Vincentians fled for safety and left San Marcelino. Abp Bernardino Nozaleda asked the Vincentians after the Philippine-American War to take charge of Paco parish, but because the Americans had destroyed the church and convent during the hostilities, the parish was temporarily housed in San Marcelino. The chapel of the central house became the parish church. After a decade, Paco was entrusted to the Belgian Fathers (CICM), who built the present church and convento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to bishop Harty&rsquo;s creation of the San Marcelino parish, the Vincentians took charge of the parish and it has been under them since. The church built around the time of the creation of the parish was a simplified version of the neoclassical. Its pilasters were ornamented with simplified Tuscan columns. Its windows and doors used rounded arches. Distinct features of the facade were a rose window and flanking quadrilateral towers. Its uppermost floor was of a smaller dimension than the lower floors and opened to a balustraded balcony. A conical roof crowned the bell tower. The church had rounded transept ends and at the crossing rose a dome, sheathed in galvanized iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1935, a port cochere embellished with engaged Corinthian capitals was added to the church as a convenience to the many who chose San Marcelino as a site for weddings. The area that had developed as a fashionable and upscale place to live in. In 1945, the church was badly damaged by the bombing. In 1946, the dome, bell towers, and roof were restored and stained glass windows installed. Repairs continued in the years that followed. The latest repairs were done in 2007 and 2008, when the church was retrofitted, wooden roof trusses replaced with steel, and a blue-colored long-span galvanized roof replaced the old roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Maryknoll College</em></strong> (reused) was built around 1940 in the art deco style. In 1926, Manila Abp Michael O&rsquo;Doherty invited the Sisters of the Maryknoll Congregation to run a teacher-training program for women. Under the archbishop and with his support, the Malabon Normal School was established in the old Augustinian convento of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/329\">San Bartolome Parish</a>. Because the archbishop was unable to support the school, the sisters assumed full financial control of the school and transferred it to Isaac Peral (United Nations Ave). The Malabon school became St James Academy. Damaged by war, the school buildings were no longer useable so the sisters rented a private house on Fernando Rein St, adding quonset huts to accommodate an increasing student population. After World War II, Maryknoll opened new buildings at Leon Guinto and Josefa Llanes Escoda (Pennsylvania and California). The Manila campus main building was two stories with designs borrowed from art deco, characterized by chamfered lintels. A wooden two-story annex was stylistically similar to the stick houses of the American period. The sisters managed Saint Mary&rsquo;s Hall, a dormitory for women at 602 Pennsylvania. In 1953, Maryknoll College opened a campus on Katipunan Ave, Loyola Heights, Quezon City. The Manila campus was closed. In 1977, Maryknoll was turned over to lay ownership and administration and renamed Miriam College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Manila Club</em></strong> on San Marcelino was built in 1908. Architect William E. Parsons designed the club in the neoclassical style. Referred to as the British Club, English Club, European Club or Club de los Ingleses, the club was in existence as early as 1877 and had been housed in different places, including a location at Calle Nagtahan and Estero Valencia (presently a narrow estero parallel to Valencia St in Santa Mesa). From there the club moved to Ermita in 1896, to the house once occupied by Enrique Zobel. It moved to a four-hectare property on San Marcelino and Marquis de Comillas (now Romualdez). The American period Manila Club was a severe neoclassical building with an arcade at the ground floor and a recessed upper story with a balustraded balcony in front. It had guest rooms, bowling alley, billiard rooms, library, lounge, tennis court, and a bar named The Snake Pit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an exclusive club for British men and had a sign saying &ldquo;No women and no dogs.&rdquo; The club sponsored team sports like lawn tennis, soccer, and cricket. The club was destroyed during World War II but was restored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a> in 1948, who modified Parson&rsquo;s severe plan to make it more welcoming. In 1968, the club sold its building to the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

In his plan, the area south of Intramuros was to be developed as a mix of government buildings and privately built structures. He proposed developing Luneta along the lines of Washington, DC, where the Legislative building, to rise near the sea, would be the centerpiece and guide the subsequent development. The Legislature and Luneta Park, which would be an open field similar to the Washington, DC Mall, was supposed to be the principal spine. The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals would then be built perpendicular to the Legislature and the Park."

The 1915 San Diego Exposition coincided with the opening of the Panama Canal, an undertaking funded and engineered by the Americans. The exposition architects were Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Windslow, who chose the Mission Revival Style, then popular in California, but borrowed heavily from Churrigueresque and Plateresque for detailing. They created a variant style, Spanish Colonial Revival Style. While the building of the 1915 San Diego Exposition still stands, the only remaining building in San Francisco is the Palace of Fine Arts. San Francisco likewise held a Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915. Bernard Maybeck, the designer of the San Franciso expo, chose to draw inspiration from Roman and Greek architecture. In contrast to San Diego, San Francisco&#x2019;s buildings were neoclassical and built to evoke a ruin. Unlike San Diego, the San Francisco buildings were not permanent. They were made of steel and wood frames covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber.

Kahn first used the technique in Packard Motors Co.&#x2019;s factory in 1903. The Kahn system allowed for a wider span of free space, unobstructed by supports.

There is evidence that after 1863, the church was made taller by integrating the original triangular pediment with the flanking bell towers, while preserving the earlier facade. The church is basically baroque with Mudejar ornamentation, evident in the use of trefoil arches for both open and blind windows. The 19th century church survived to the 20th century but was damaged by fire during World War II. The Columban fathers, who had succeeded the Augustinians in administering the parish, rebuilt the church in 1950. The church underwent retrofitting in 1992, following an earthquake in 1990.

In 1892, the Congregation of the Religious of the Assumption founded on 30 Apr 1839 by St Marie-Eugenie de Jesus (1817-98) arrived in the Philippines to run the Superior Normal School for Women in Intramuros. At the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, the Assumption sisters returned to Europe and ceased operating the school. But in 1904, at the request of Pope St Pius X, the sisters returned to Manila, where they opened an elementary and secondary school, adding a college department in 1940. Before the outbreak of the war, the sisters had built a school along the lines of collegiate gothic, in which gothic motifs like lancet windows and gothic-type cloisters were added to a functional structure. These prewar buildings occupied a campus adjacent to the Ateneo de Manila, which had a gate at Adriatico and a main entrance facing Padre Faura. Damaged in 1945, during the liberation of Manila like its neighbor Ateneo, Assumption re-opened classes in quonset huts and in its ruined auditorium. Under mother superior Rosa Maria, one of the pioneers who arrived in 1904, the buildings were rebuilt in 1947 and by 1948 were ready for occupancy. In 1973, Assumption, which had campuses in San Lorenzo and Antipolo, moved out of the Pedro Gil Campus. The property was sold to a developer and the buildings have been demolished to make way for Robinson&#x2019;s Place Manila. The Assumption Herran campus is best remembered for its manicured garden, which had a small lagoon, and for the high-ceiling room and arcaded corridors with lancet arches, decorated at the springing with fleur de lys medallions."

After World War II, Maryknoll opened new buildings at Leon Guinto and Josefa Llanes Escoda (Pennsylvania and California). The Manila campus main building was two stories with designs borrowed from art deco, characterized by chamfered lintels.

		"text": "<p>Today&rsquo;s Tayabas was once capital of the province of the same name. The earlier capital, a coastal town fronting Marinduque, known then as Calilaya or Caliraya, and now as Unisan, was destroyed by a pirate raid in 1605. Tayabas served as&nbsp;<em>cabecera&nbsp;</em>or capital of the province for the rest of the Spanish period. In 1901 the Americans transferred the capital to Lucena, a former coastal barrio of Tayabas known as Cota (fort). Tayabas province was renamed after Manuel L. Quezon, first president of the Philippine Commonwealth, who hailed from that province, on 7 Sep 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tayabas, situated on the southern slope of Mt Banahaw, was a natural confluence point along the Bicol-Manila route. Its inhabitants, who built <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice terraces</a> akin to those in the Cordillera, spoke a type of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> known as Tayabasin. The area was ministered to by the Franciscans throughout the Spanish period. First to evangelize in the area in 1578 were Frs Diego de Oropesa and Juan de la Plasencia, who is credited with the draft of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1600\"><strong><em>Doctrina Cristiana</em></strong></a>, the first printed book in the Philippines in 1593.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The town, with the rest of the province, pertained to the Diocese of Nueva Caceres. By 1700, Tayabas boasted the title &ldquo;La Muy Noble Villa de Tayabas&rdquo; (The Most Noble Villa of Tayabas). Such title appeared in Fr Domingo de los Santos&rsquo;s <strong><em>Vocabulario de la lengua tagala</em></strong>, published when the Franciscans briefly ran their printing press in Tayabas in 1703.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this day,&nbsp;<em>Santacruzan&nbsp;</em>processions are accompanied by chanting in front of chiseled stone crosses in the barrios. Some of the crosses are as high as 2.10 m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1860s the poblacion had about 500 houses, all of wood and roofed with&nbsp;<em>cabonegro</em>, a vine. Bandits set the cabecera on fire in 1877, destroying, among others, the Casa de Comunidad, the archives and the telegraph station. Tayabas was again reduced to ashes by the bombings of the Allied Air Forces on 15 and 22 Mar 1945, ironically to liberate the town from the hands of the Japanese soldiers. Only 32 houses were left intact and 618 residential and commercial buildings were totally destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tayabas was declared a component city in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tayabas poblacion has a good number of existing heritage sites, beginning with those at the approaches to the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present roads that lead in and out of the cabecera go back to the Spanish colonial era. Increased commerce in the province prompted the construction and improvement in the 1850s of five major roads. The eastern road with a southern branch to Pagbilao and to the Bicol region, and the northeast one to Mauban on the Pacific coast, were completed under the supervision of Gov Jose Maria de la O.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the other roads&mdash;two leading to barrio Cota on the southern coast, now Lucena, and two others leading west to Lucban and Sariaya respectively&mdash;are attributed to intrepid Franciscans who hacked their way through the forests on Banahaw&rsquo;s flanks. Over the Aritao river alone, on the way to Sariaya, 17 culverts and a bridge of four arches were built under the direction of Fr Bartolome Galan from 1826 onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 19 stone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a> constructed between the 1840s and 1850s, only 11 are still standing. All use the Roman arch and are of cut stone. The most significant, also the longest and tallest colonial masonry bridge in the Philippines is the graceful, five-arched <strong><em>Puente de Malagonlong</em></strong>. Spanning the Dumacaa River on the eastward route to Mauban and Pagbilao, its construction was directed by Fr Antonio Mateos beginning in 1841. It survived the flood of 1845 and was inaugurated in 1850 as inscribed on a resting place in the middle of the bridge. The inner sides of the stone arches are inscribed with letters and symbols, probably the marks of stonesmiths or stone suppliers. The bridge was apparently breached but repaired in 1872.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the transfer of the provincial capital from Tayabas to Lucena in 1901, the old&nbsp;<em>camino principal&nbsp;</em>(main highway) was diverted and the bridge almost forgotten. Malagonlong Bridge was one of the first casualties of World War II when, on 26 Dec 1941, US soldiers tried to blast the bridge to deter the coming of Japanese troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, a Tayabas ordinance disallowed the construction of new structures near the more than 10 surviving stone bridges. However, the integrity and visual setting of Malagonlong bridge were affected when a new concrete bridge was built a few meters away. In 2004, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> declared the bridge as a historical site. In 2011, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> collectively declared the stone bridges of Tayabas as a National Cultural Treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Puente de Alitao</em></strong>, a few meters away from the Church of San Miguel on the Tayabas-Sariaya road, was built of wood by Fr Jose Medio in 1798, and then of stone in 1823. It is also known as <strong><em>Puente Antigua</em></strong> or <strong><em>Puente de Munting Bayan</em></strong><em>. <strong>Puente de Don Francisco de Asis</strong> </em>, also on the Sariaya-Tayabas road at Barangay Domoit, was completed on 15 Oct 1854 and named after the husband of Isabela II of Spain. <strong><em>Puente de Bai</em></strong> or <strong><em>Puente de Tumloy</em></strong> was more intact than other bridges when it was replaced in the 1850s by the <strong><em>Puente de Ese</em></strong>, <strong><em>Puente de Despedidas</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Puente de la Princesa</em></strong> on a new road to Lucban. Unlike most of the bridges which were made of adobe, <strong><em>Puente de Mate</em></strong> and <strong><em>Puente de Lakawan</em></strong> are made of sandstone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other bridges which are still passable by vehicle as of 2014 include the <strong><em>Puente de Isabel II</em></strong> and <strong><em>Puente de Gibanga</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All roads lead to the poblacion or town center where the two most important and iconic buildings in Tayabas are located.

In response to the directive of the provincial Pedro Bautista, later martyr of Japan and canonized saint, a stone church was constructed there after 1600. In 1721, the church roof was repaired, and in 1736 a wall was built around the complex. Earthquakes that shook Mt Banahaw in 1743 ruined the church, which was described at this time as very artistic, made of cut stone, and decorated with beautiful and gilded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a>. Destroyed by the earthquakes were the facade and tower, including the choirloft, organ, and baptistry. The <strong>convento</strong>, said to date from 1649, supposedly also lost its well-stocked pharmacy during the earthquake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structures were subsequently rebuilt on a grander scale on the same site, as evidenced by the <strong>troneras</strong> or gun emplacements on walls built during the era of pirate raids. In 1746, the wall was fortified by adding a meter more of mortar. Four years later its height was once again increased. Major constructions followed in the 1760s: in 1761, a two-story facade crowned by a triangular pediment; in 1768, a tile roof replacing the one of nipa, and a dome over the main altar; and in 1771, a wooden barrel vault.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1855 to 1860, a rotunda crossing with a round-ended transept was added to the church, under the direction of Fr Benito de la Pila. This made the church plan resemble a key. In 1858, the construction of the quadrangular cupola over the crossing began, and the facade was capped with a third story and semicircular pediment. The completed church was blessed on 11 Nov 1860. In 1864, the interior walls were covered with stucco as a ground for decorative painting. The next year, a pipe organ was installed by Telesforo de Lavarez from Pasay. In 1873, a new sacristy was added to the transept. In 1894, the church&rsquo;s tile roof was replaced by galvanized iron. With its 103-meter-long nave, Tayabas is considered one of the longest 19th century churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, the church interior received another set of decorative paintings done under the supervision of Victor Flores. World War II left the church unscathed, although the convento, converted into a garrison by the Japanese, was damaged by bomb shrapnel. In 1946, a wooden communion rail was built for the main altar. In 1964, the wooden barrel vault was covered by a second ceiling of&nbsp;<em>lawanit&nbsp;</em>to prevent old paint and debris from falling. In 1984, Fr Froilan Zalameda began supervising repair and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a> work on the church. The ceiling was repainted in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having undergone many renovations, the facade style is best described as eclectic. The older triangular pediment can still be discerned where the new and old facades meet. The three-story arrangement is unusual for Philippine facades, which tend to have just two levels. The trilobed main entrance in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Mudejar</a> style, similar to the entrance of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Santo Ni&ntilde;o Basilica</a> in Cebu, is crowned by an angel that unusually &ldquo;deflates&rdquo; into the wall. The divisions between stories are marked by pairs of horizontal bands. The niches contain images of angels, San Francisco, Santo Domingo, and San Diego de Alcala, whose ancient image and relic in the church drew numerous pilgrims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wooden barrel vault and cupola of the church are painted with blue, maroon, beige, and white depicting symbols of the Passion and mystical titles of Mary. The oldest retablo is in the sacristy; in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a> style, possibly from the 1770s, it is similar to those in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>. The other seven altars are in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style, possibly dating from the 1850s. The main retablo, dedicated to San Miguel, is crowned by symbols of theological and cardinal virtues. The central portion bulges outwards, an echo of the rounded transepts. The altars on the gospel side are for San Jose, the Mater Dolorosa, and Maria Assumpta; those on the epistle side are for the Inmaculada Concepcion, San Diego, and Navidad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church <strong>patio</strong>, a former <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\"><strong>cemetery</strong></a>, is enclosed by a low wall. Adjoining the length of the church nave is the stone-and-wood convento that encloses an inner court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sensible restoration, especially of the ceiling, has made Tayabas a resplendent example of a colonial church. However, the construction of two contemporary edifices along the flanks of the church destroys the vista of the nave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church was elevated to a basilica on 11 Oct 1988. The Basilica of San Miguel Arcangel was declared a National Cultural Treasure on 31 Jul 2001 by the National Museum. A Diocesan Museum adjacent to the church was reorganized in 2010. In 2014, work began on replacing the deteriorated wood planks on the ceiling with new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a number of historic chapels elsewhere in the poblacion. The <strong><em>Ermita de San Diego de Alcala</em></strong>, said to have been established in 1683, is now a private residence. Its old stone walls may still be seen adjacent to the Alitao Bridge. The <strong><em>Ermita de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de las Angustias</em></strong>, said to have been established in 1728, is a single nave structure with a facade embellished with engaged pilasters, niches and an <strong>espada&ntilde;a</strong> pediment. It was damaged in 1945 but eventually reconstructed through the efforts of the Tayabas Elite Club, an association of Tayabasin women. A&nbsp;<em>turumba&nbsp;</em>procession, similar to that in Pakil, Laguna, is held here annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Ermita de <strong>San Roque</strong></em></strong>, said to date from 1755, is the chapel for what was known as the <strong><em>Camposanto para los Espa&ntilde;oles</em></strong>, the old cemetery. Its facade is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> with volutes defining the sides of the pediment and the apex curved rather angled. Since the transfer of the niches to the new cemetery, it was also called <strong><em>Santuario de las Almas</em></strong> (Sanctuary of the Souls) and more recently, Santuario de San Jose. In the <strong><em>Camposanto para los Indios</em></strong> or <strong><em>Cementerio Catolico</em></strong> at Munting Bayan is another chapel built in 1887. It is a mixture of styles. While the triple arch over the pediment is Mudejar in influence, the flanking tower uses a Roman arch, and the main door is in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Casa de Comunidad</em></strong>, also known as casa tribunal or hall of justice was the civil counterpart of the church and convento. In early times, the Hall of Justice was customarily in the house of the local leader. A permanent space was designated for it in 1773; a stone structure rose in 1810. The present grand structure of cut stone was begun in 1831, according to a marker on its keystone. It was officially inaugurated in 1835 and was named Casa de Comunidad. Historically, this building housed various offices of civil government, such as the office of the gobernadorcillo or mayor, <strong>carcel</strong> or detention cells, <strong>archivo</strong> or archives, storage room for weapons, guest rooms, and the <strong>juzgado</strong> or <strong>Sala de Justicia</strong> or Hall of Justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building was repainted in 1837 for the arrival of Abp Jose Segui of Manila and the bishop of Nueva Caceres, who came to administer the sacrament of confirmation to around 1,000 people. In 1841, the tribunal was the place of trial of hero Apolinario de la Cruz, who was thereafter shot in the adjacent plaza. Burned in 1877, the building was restored in 1886. It served as headquarters for Spanish&mdash;and later Japanese&mdash;troops, as a school and as a wartime hospital. In the early 1980s, the Tayabas-Manila Association and the NHI spearheaded the restoration of the building. In 1988, the NHI declared the Casa de Comunidad a National Historical Landmark. Today it houses the public library, display areas, function halls, and offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em><strong>Casa Real</strong></em></strong> or Provincial Capitol was erected in 1858, but it was totally destroyed in 1945. It is now the City Hall, popularly known as the &ldquo;Tahanang Bayan,&rdquo; and faces a park dedicated in 1858 to Prince Alfonso, son of Queen Isabel II. The park would be later renamed Rizal Park, after the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">national hero</a>. Its facade was patterned after a two-story elementary school in Tayabas which was destroyed by fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Carcel Publica</em></strong> or Public Jail had adobe walls that are still standing. The interior houses several private entities, including the office of the Free and Accepted Masons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Escuela de Ni&ntilde;os</em></strong> or primary school was formerly the province&rsquo;s administrative building. It was won in a public auction by a secular priest, Juan Huelva, then subsequently bought by Fr Manuel Gonzales, parish priest 1852-55 and concurrent vicar forane, who turned it into a school. Unfortunately, the escuela has been demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Large underground tunnels are rumored to connect key buildings with one another, such that the&nbsp;<em>fraile&nbsp;</em>(friar) would always emerge from the chapel of the Camposanto para los Espa&ntilde;oles or Santuario de la Almas to give the final blessing way ahead of the mourners. Thus, Tayabas&rsquo; built heritage is linked through legend. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Tayabas served as&#xA0;<em>cabecera&#xA0;</em>or capital of the province for the rest of the Spanish period. In 1901 the Americans transferred the capital to Lucena, a former coastal barrio of Tayabas known as Cota (fort). Tayabas province was renamed after Manuel L.

It survived the flood of 1845 and was inaugurated in 1850 as inscribed on a resting place in the middle of the bridge.

A&#xA0;<em>turumba&#xA0;</em>procession, similar to that in Pakil, Laguna, is held here annually."

The present grand structure of cut stone was begun in 1831, according to a marker on its keystone. It was officially inaugurated in 1835 and was named Casa de Comunidad. Historically, this building housed various offices of civil government, such as the office of the gobernadorcillo or mayor, <strong>carcel</strong> or detention cells, <strong>archivo</strong> or archives, storage room for weapons, guest rooms, and the <strong>juzgado</strong> or <strong>Sala de Justicia</strong> or Hall of Justice."

It served as headquarters for Spanish&#x2014;and later Japanese&#x2014;troops, as a school and as a wartime hospital. In the early 1980s, the Tayabas-Manila Association and the NHI spearheaded the restoration of the building. In 1988, the NHI declared the Casa de Comunidad a National Historical Landmark.

		"text": "<p>Located on a delta of the Abra River, and named after the&nbsp;<em>gabi&nbsp;</em>or taro plant known locally as&nbsp;<em>biga</em>, Vigan in Ilocos Sur was established as <strong><em>Villa Fernandina</em></strong> by Juan de Salcedo, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&rsquo;s nephew, in 1572.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the colonial era, Spanish established separate enclaves for the Spanish and for other ethnicities. The Spanish enclave was called <strong>villa</strong>. The Fernandina was the villa for the north. For the south they were: Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in Cebu, 1565; the area around <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\">Fuerza de San Pedro</a>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Basilica of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">Cebu Cathedral</a>; and Villa Arevalo in Iloilo, 1569.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vigan is the only Philippine town inscribed in UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">World Heritage List</a>, where it is called the &ldquo;Historic Town of Vigan.&rdquo; The 1992 inscription cites Vigan as the best-preserved planned Spanish colonial town in the whole of Asia. It also notes that the architecture of Vigan reflects the mixture of local, Chinese, and European cultural elements resulting in a one-of-a-kind townscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The municipality is divided into nine urban districts and 30 rural villages, with close to half the total area still being used for agriculture. The historic core zone or heritage zone is defined by the Govantes and Mestizo Rivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salcedo was assigned to the Ilocos as its encomendero. Salcedo&rsquo;s choice was based on the potential of Vigan as an entr&ecirc;pot or trading center for vessels coming from China. It was to serve as an alternate harbor to Manila, a backup in case Manila was compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salcedo came upon an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">indigenous settlement</a> of bamboo and wood houses on stilts. He chose the site and designated it as the capital of the entire Ilocos. It was the northernmost city established by the Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the end of the 17th century, the typical colonial dwelling made of a lower floor of stone and an upper floor of wood was brought to Vigan from Manila, where the first experiments on this mixed type of architecture, <strong>arquitectura mestiza</strong>, were made. The Augustinians, assigned to evangelize Ilocos, introduced bricks for their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> and <strong>conventos</strong> and others followed their example. A local brick-making industry developed as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of its growth as a trading center, Villa Fernandina was raised in status to a <strong>ciudad</strong> or city in 1778. Decades earlier, in 1758, the diocese of the north, Nueva Segovia, which had been in Lal-lo, Cagayan since 1595, was moved to Vigan at the request of Bp Juan de la Fuente Yepes, during the pontificate of Benedict XIV. Vigan was far more accessible to Manila by boat than Lal-lo, which could only be reached by sailing to Aparri and then navigating southward through the Rio Grande de Cagayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it is no longer navigable due to siltation, from the 16th to the 19th century, the Mestizo River allowed large sea vessels to berth in the delta, which was virtually an island. Direct trade with China developed and Vigan became an important waypoint in the Manila-Acapulco trade. While the Asian trade was the vehicle for Vigan&rsquo;s progress, in the 19th century the extensive cultivation of tobacco, brought from the Americas, pushed Vigan&rsquo;s economy to high gear. Ilocos-grown tobacco, cured in the fields, was brought to Vigan to be consolidated for shipment to Manila where they were hand rolled in <strong>fabricas de puros</strong> (cigar factories) like Tabacalera in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> and the vast Fabrica de Puros de Malabon. The government controlled the purchase of tobacco and manufacture of cigars, assuring a steady but reliable price for raw tobacco. This steady source of income made many&nbsp;<em>mestizo chino&nbsp;</em>middlemen quite wealthy. With the wealth they built their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) in Vigan. Here they lived on the upper story and used the ground floor for storage of tobacco and merchandise, like clothing and farm equipment, which was sold to tobacco planters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vigan&rsquo;s historic core is defined as an L-shape. The longer arm, with Plaza Salcedo in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Cathedral of San Pablo</a>, is defined by the cathedral to the east, the episcopal palace to the northeast and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\"><strong>munisipyo</strong></a> or municipal hall to the southwest and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\"><strong>kapitolyo</strong></a> or provincial capitol to the west. Behind the capitol, and still part of the core is Burgos House, where one of the three martyred priests, Fr Jose Burgos, a Filipino secular priest executed for alleged complicity in the Cavite Revolt of 1872, was born. The shorter arm which begins with Plaza Burgos opens to the Kamestisuhan district, named after the mestizos chinos or Chinese rather than Spanish halfbreeds, who in the 19th century built Vigan through trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both branches of the L-plan are laid out following the <strong>cuadricula</strong> or the Renaissance grid plan of the <strong><em>Leyes de las Indias</em></strong>, a codification of Spanish urbanization laws beginning with the <strong><em>Leyes de Burgos</em></strong> in 1512, and the new laws of Carlos I in 1545. The plan called for a grid pattern of streets, which defined town lots. These lots were designated as open space or built space, and as private or public lots. In the areas designed as public were the Church and civic structures. While the plan of Vigan followed the Leyes, the dwellings and buildings fuse hispanic traditions and techniques with Asian traditions. Wood, <strong>capiz</strong> shells, bamboo, stone and lime, all procured from the surrounding area, were used in construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plaza Salcedo Zone, East-West Arm</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Large, open spaces such as <strong><em>Plaza Salcedo</em></strong> was standard in the Spanish colonial plan. Plazas were a concourse intended for public recreation, and an area for large assemblies. In 1763, Plaza Salcedo was the site of the execution of Josefa Gabriela Silang (1730-63), wife of Diego Silang y Andaya. She succeeded Diego after his death as the leader of a revolt against taxation and Spanish abuse and injustice. Diego took advantage of the British Occupation of the Philippines from 1762 to 1764 to launch his revolt. But his close companions, Miguel Vicos and Pedro Bebec, were bribed by the Spanish to assassinate him. Diego&rsquo;s wife Gabriela was executed on 20 Sep 1763.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the plaza is a late 19th-century obelisk commemorating Juan de Salcedo, which replaced an obelisk erected a century earlier but apparently damaged by earthquake. In the 1970s, a reflecting pool was built around the obelisk, which had the added function of a water container for use in emergencies. Fountains were added to the pool. More recent additions to the plaza are the monuments of national hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> and former president Elpidio Quirino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The <strong>Vigan Cathedral</strong> Complex</em></strong> is unusual for having two plazas: Plaza Salcedo, which is directly in front of the cathedral; and Plaza Burgos to its epistle or south side. Complementing these open spaces are the built spaces for the cathedral, the detached bell tower,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">arsobispado</a>&nbsp;</em>or episcopal palace, and the diocesan seminary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What began as an Augustinian mission became the seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia, when the center of the diocese was moved from Lal-lo to Vigan. The present <strong><em>Cathedral of San Pablo</em></strong> began construction on 31 Jun 1790. Work continued for a decade more or less. A report sent to Spain in 1799 contained sketches of the cathedral indicating that the construction was almost done at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most likely built at the same time as the cathedral is the detached <strong>campanario</strong> or bell tower, built at the epistle side of the church and near the facade. Bell towers as separate structures are found throughout the Ilocos. Believed to be a precaution in times of an earthquake, the bell tower is placed at a distance from the church so that should it topple, falling stone, bricks, or tiles will not hit the church. This practice is also seen in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laoag_Cathedral\"><strong><em>San Guillermo Cathedral</em></strong></a>, <strong><em>Laoag</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Bantay</em></strong> church, which is next-door neighbor to Vigan, located on the northern bank of Govantes River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Arsobispado de Nueva Segovia</em></strong><em>,&nbsp;</em>Vigan&rsquo;s episcopal palace, is an oversized bahay na bato. Its date of construction is uncertain but it was most likely built around the same time as the cathedral. It functions as archdiocesan office, museum, and residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diocesan <strong>seminario</strong> or seminary of Vigan occupied a lot across the episcopal palace. It was, for a long time, unused after it was burnt. The diocesan seminary transferred to the outskirts of the city: the major seminary north to Burgos St, near the Govantes River and the minor seminary south to Katipunan St. The seminary ruins were razed and Plaza Maestro Commercial Complex, rented by Grupo Bonito, was built. This strip mall is in the ersatz colonial-style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em><strong>Munisipyo</strong></em></strong> or <strong><em>Vigan City Hall</em></strong>, along Burgos St is an American period building. It has undergone renovations and repainting and at one time blue. It is now a light ochre, a color preferred in Vigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Kapitoloyo</em></strong><em>,&nbsp;</em>aka the <strong><em>Ilocos Sur Executive Government Offices of the Provincial Capitol</em></strong>, is an American period building in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> or Federal style. Its center is accentuated by a colonnade, through which the building is entered. From the central bay are flanking bays. In the Kapitolyo area is the provincial jail which has now been turned into a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martyred priest Fr Jose Burgos was born in the bahay na bato now known as the <strong><em>Padre Jose A. Burgos House</em></strong>. Characterized by austerity in style, the house has no eye-catching features but all speak of functionality, practicality, and solidity&mdash;characteristics of the Ilocos colonial house. Presently a branch of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>, the house went through extensive restoration in 2014. The 14 panel paintings depicting the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2142\">Basi Revolt</a> painted in 1807 by local artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3823\">Esteban Pichay Villanueva</a>, which were donated to the house after being purchased from the descendants of Villanueva, were restored by the National Museum and have been returned to the house upon the completion of the restoration. The paintings were temporarily housed at the National Museum in Manila for the duration of the restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house has a historical marker from 1939. It is classified by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute (NHI)</a> as a Level II historic site (with marker).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kamestisuhan (North-South zone) Plaza Burgos Zone</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the area that in popular imagination is conjured when the name Vigan is mentioned. Dedicated to the memory of Fr Burgos, <strong><em>Plaza Burgos</em></strong> is located next to the bell tower. It has a statue of Padre Burgos on a plinth. The plaza leads to the Kamestisuhan zone, enclave of the mestizo-chino, the Filipino-Chinese whose enterprising ways built Vigan as an economic force, a trading center, and an engine for the economic growth of Ilocos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this area is a collection of some 120 bahay na bato. Most are two stories, the lower story used as storage space, offices or stores. A few are one story; these are usually a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>kamalig</strong></a> or <strong>camarin</strong>, a storehouse for rice or tobacco. There are also three-story structures. Because of their number, only a few houses will be cited as representative of the Vigan colonial house. These are also generally open to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restored by Julie Singson-Manahan, a descendant of the clan, the <strong><em>Pedro Singson</em></strong> <em><strong>House</strong> </em>is now called the <strong><em>Vigan Heritage Mansion</em></strong>. It was built in 1885 as a two-story structure with a tower. In this house, Pedro Singson was born on 5 Feb 1904. Popularly known as Apo Pedring, he was governor of Ilocos Sur in 1937-41, 1945-46, and 1956-59. He also became a representative of the first district of Ilocos Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1830 by Justo Angco, the <strong><em>Syquia Mansion Museum</em></strong> was given by Angco as dowry for his daughter Estefania who was to marry Gregorio R. Syquia, a landowner. Tomas Syquia descended from this couple, and Tomas and his wife Conchita Mijares-Jimenez, a Spaniard, in turn begot Alicia who married Elpidio Quirino, sixth president of the Philippines. Alicia died during World War II and Quirino did not remarry, choosing instead his daughter Victoria &ldquo;Vicky&rdquo; as First Lady. When traveling to Ilocos, the house was the president&rsquo;s official residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the outside, the Syquia Mansion is a typical bahay na bato with a lower floor of masonry and an upper floor of wood. Its <strong>volada</strong> (protruding galleries) cantilevers over the stone on the first story, giving it distinction, while providing shade from rain and sun for pedestrians. The house is embellished in the neoclassical manner with arched windows on the ground floor and Tuscan pilasters defining the vertical sweep. The house is externally ochre and white but its lower story was, at one time, light blue rather than ochre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, this house is furnished with local and European decor. Noteworthy are three smaller copies of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>&rsquo;s works: <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong></em></strong><em>,&nbsp;</em>the original now in the National Museum in Manila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2253\"><strong><em>El&nbsp;Pacto de Sangre</em></strong></a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>, and the vanished canvas with the subject, &ldquo;The People and the King.&rdquo; These are the works of Juan Luna&rsquo;s Spanish assistant Respal, who came to the Philippines in the early 1900s. NHI marked the house as a heritage house through Board Resolution No 1, of 18 Jan 2002. The house had earlier received in 1951 a historical marker in Spanish from the Philippine Historical Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in the early 1830s by descendants of mestizo-chino traders, the <strong><em>Quema House</em></strong> is in classic, austere bahay-na-bato style, characterized by stateliness, sobriety, and restraint. The interior is likewise styled&mdash;straightforward and simple. It has a good collection of 18th and 19th century furniture, among them the<em>butaca</em>or lounging chair, the high chair used beside an open window to view the street scene, Viennese bentwood chairs and rockers, and divans with rattan caning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now a museum, the <strong><em>Crisologo House</em></strong> was the residence of politician Floro Crisologo. The house keeps his memorabilia, and that of his family.

It includes two other important heritage sites: Campo Santo and Burnayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Campo Santo</em></strong> aka the <strong><em>Catholic Cemetery of Vigan</em></strong> is located at the end of Quezon Ave, a few blocks southwest of Kamestisuhan. The location of this <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a> was dictated by law in the 19th century, when burial within a church or its immediate vicinity was prohibited because of a better understanding of disease and how it spreads. Many outstanding cemeteries were built in the 19th century, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/315\">La Loma</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">Paco</a> in Manila, and the cemeteries in Iloilo Province. A typical cemetery has a grand entrance, a perimeter wall which also serves as niches, and a mortuary chapel. There are two types of niches in a cemetery, one for the newly buried and one for secondary burials of bones known as&nbsp;<em>osario&nbsp;</em>or ossuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mortuary chapel of the Catholic cemetery is known as&nbsp;<em><strong>Simbaan a Bassit</strong> </em>or the small church, and it functions as a church with regular services. It was blessed on 9 Nov 1852 by Fr Vicente Barreiro y Perez, OSA, bishop of Vigan 1848-56, with the assistance of the&nbsp;<em>juez provisor&nbsp;</em>or ecclesiastical judge and rector of the cathedral, the secular priest, Bachiller Pedro Vicente Abaya. The townspeople of Vigan were in attendance during the blessing. Represented were the guilds of the Filipinos by Pedro Alcantara de la Cruz, and of the mestizos sangleyes by Estanislao Singson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The facade of Simbaan a Bassit is one of a handful of the type called <strong>espada&ntilde;a</strong>. This refers to a facade where the highest register serves as a bell tower. The facade combines elements from the neoclassical, like the simplified Tuscan pilaster, and the baroque like the volute and ornamental cherubs. Divided into three parts, by pilasters, the central part for the main portal being the widest, each of the three parts terminate in arches where bells are hung. All in all there are four bells for the espada&ntilde;a, two in the center and one each on the flanking sides. Graceful volutes connect the outer pilasters with the gates flanking the facade; these are the entrances to the cemetery. The facade has been painted a brilliant yellow ochre with the embellishments in white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although outside the historic district of Vigan, and located along Liberation Blvd, southwest of Plaza Salcedo, <strong><em>Burnayan</em></strong> is an important area in Vigan. There are several factories here that make pots of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">terra cotta</a> or stoneware.&nbsp;<em>Burnay&nbsp;</em>is the Ilocano word for pottery and refers specifically to the large, dark brown or black, stoneware jar, used for storage. It is uncertain when the burnay pottery began in Vigan, although it is assumed to have started during the Spanish colonial era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes Burnayan truly part of Vigan&rsquo;s heritage is the uniqueness of the burnay as the only local stoneware pottery, as well as the kiln used to fire it. Both pottery and kiln show Chinese influence. The pots are fired in a dragon kiln, which is a longitudinal kiln of Chinese origin. It is usually built on a natural slope so that one end is higher than the other. On the higher end is the chimney, on the slope are the stacking floor covered with silica sand. The lower end is for stacking fuel, traditionally wood. The body of the kiln is a series of vaults or shallow domes made from refractory bricks. The sides of the kiln are pierced by doors used for stacking bone-dry pottery and for controlling the flow of air, hence, the temperature of the kiln. This kind of kiln is known throughout Asia; in Japan, it is called&nbsp;<em>anagama</em>. Its longitudinal plan has earned it the name &ldquo;dragon.&rdquo; The shape and clay composition of the Ilocos burnay are similar to the large Chinese storage jars called dragon jars because they usually have a dragon design, or to the Martaban-made in Indochina. Burnayan also manufactures floor tiles similar to those used in colonial construction. These are marketed as Vigan tiles. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

While the Asian trade was the vehicle for Vigan&#x2019;s progress, in the 19th century the extensive cultivation of tobacco, brought from the Americas, pushed Vigan&#x2019;s economy to high gear. Ilocos-grown tobacco, cured in the fields, was brought to Vigan to be consolidated for shipment to Manila where they were hand rolled in <strong>fabricas de puros</strong> (cigar factories) like Tabacalera in <a href=\"/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> and the vast Fabrica de Puros de Malabon. The government controlled the purchase of tobacco and manufacture of cigars, assuring a steady but reliable price for raw tobacco. This steady source of income made many&#xA0;<em>mestizo chino&#xA0;</em>middlemen quite wealthy. With the wealth they built their <a href=\"/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) in Vigan.

Divided into three parts, by pilasters, the central part for the main portal being the widest, each of the three parts terminate in arches where bells are hung. All in all there are four bells for the espada&#xF1;a, two in the center and one each on the flanking sides. Graceful volutes connect the outer pilasters with the gates flanking the facade; these are the entrances to the cemetery. The facade has been painted a brilliant yellow ochre with the embellishments in white."

It is uncertain when the burnay pottery began in Vigan, although it is assumed to have started during the Spanish colonial era."

				"value": "What makes Burnayan truly part of Vigan&#x2019;s heritage is the uniqueness of the burnay as the only local stoneware pottery, as well as the kiln used to fire it. Both pottery and kiln show Chinese influence. The pots are fired in a dragon kiln, which is a longitudinal kiln of Chinese origin. It is usually built on a natural slope so that one end is higher than the other. On the higher end is the chimney, on the slope are the stacking floor covered with silica sand. The lower end is for stacking fuel, traditionally wood. The body of the kiln is a series of vaults or shallow domes made from refractory bricks. The sides of the kiln are pierced by doors used for stacking bone-dry pottery and for controlling the flow of air, hence, the temperature of the kiln. This kind of kiln is known throughout Asia; in Japan, it is called&#xA0;<em>anagama</em>. Its longitudinal plan has earned it the name &#x201C;dragon.&#x201D; The shape and clay composition of the Ilocos burnay are similar to the large Chinese storage jars called dragon jars because they usually have a dragon design, or to the Martaban-made in Indochina. Burnayan also manufactures floor tiles similar to those used in colonial construction. These are marketed as Vigan tiles. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/2/2/2663\">Ren&#xE9; B. Javellana</a></strong><a href=\"/2/2/2663\"> </a></em>"

		"text": "<p>The Zamboanga peninsula is the traditional home of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a>, but by the 16th century, migrants from Sulu like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Badjao</a> made their moorings and established villages on stilts along the southern tip of the peninsula. In 1593, the Spanish sent troops to secure the area. A palisade was built at La Caldera (presently Recodo), 15 km northwest of Zamboanga City, in the direction of Ayala. The palisade was built to garrison troops to protect the trading route and to serve as an advanced station for the ambitious plan to conquer Sabah, whose sultans were trading competitors of the Spaniards. The Sabah plan failed, and La Caldera was abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new center of Spanish presence was established in what was to become Zamboanga City&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage area</a>. The area is today defined by the city hall and Plaza Pershing to the northwest and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a> to the southeast. It is roughly demarcated by three parallel streets, Legionaire, Rizal, and N.S. Valderosa and perpendicular to these, Calle Guardia Nacional, Don Pablo Lorenzo, and Lustre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1635, Jesuit missionaries began evangelizing this district. While the Spaniards hesitated to settle in the area, Fr Melchor de Vera, SJ, a builder who had fortified Jesuit churches in Leyte, built Fort San Jose that same year. Troops were garrisoned there and Spaniards eventually settled in the area. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> contained threats from slave raiders and protected the community of Lutao (Christianized Badjao) who had gravitated toward the area now known as Rio Hondo and the former site of Pettit Barracks outside the fort. The fort was abandoned in 1663, when the troops were pulled out and sent to Manila to prepare for an attack by Koxinga, which never materialized.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Demolished in 1663, the fort was rebuilt in 1719 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2651\">Juan de Ciscara</a>, a military engineer, and renamed Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar de Zaragosa. To the north of the fort was a palisaded area protected by bastions, one of which was called Santa Barbara, the name also given to the area. With the reconstruction of the fort, the Jesuits returned to Zamboanga and built a church and college at the palisaded area, roughly the area presently defined by N.S. Valderosa, Legionaire, and Santa Barbara streets, where Plaza Pilar and the adjoining areas are located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1768, when the Jesuits were expelled from the Philippines, all of Mindanao was turned over to the Augustinian Recollects, who were already in charge of the eastern half of Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Americans arrived in Zamboanga, they laid claim to the fort and the formerly palisaded area of Santa Barbara. By the 1900s the palisade was gone. At an adjoining site the Americans built Pettit Barracks and a water system for Zamboanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area around the Zamboanga city hall on N.S. Valderosa St and Plaza Pershing were developed as a new urban center. Around and near Plaza Pershing was the Jesuit-built Immaculate Conception Church and Ateneo de Zamboanga, established in 1912. The Ateneo moved north to a developing district called Jardin de Chino and the church followed. The church was raised to a cathedral in 1910, when the Diocese of Zamboanga was established. Michael James O&rsquo;Doherty served as the first bishop in 1911-1916.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heritage Structures in the Urban Center</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Fort Pilar</em></strong>, built in 1719 by Juan de Ciscara, follows a typical bastioned fort plan of the 18th century. Three bastions have straight walls while a fourth bastion, on the south and facing the sea is in the ace of spade shape, known as <strong>orillon</strong> or <strong>orejon.</strong> The original gate faced east but was sealed by the early 20th century and is presently a shrine to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar. Fort Pilar was repaired and remodeled a number of times. The latest remodeling, which gave the fort its present appearance, was done by the Americans who had earlier taken control of it. The fort is currently under the administration of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>, which has opened a southern branch of the National Museum featuring the peoples of the south, trading routes of the south, and the artifacts from the trading ship,&nbsp;<em>Griffin</em>, discovered in southern Philippines. The barracks inside the fort are undergoing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a> to slow down the erosion of the brick substructure that has been exposed with the deterioration of the wall&rsquo;s lime plaster finish or <strong>palitada</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Zamboanga City Hall</em></strong> was built in 1905 and completed in 1907, as the seat of the Moro Province. It became the seat of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914 and served as capitol of the region. American governors of the region included Leonard Wood, Tasker H. Bliss, Ralph W. Hoyt, and Major John Pershing. When Zamboanga became a chartered city on 26 Feb 1937, it became the city hall. The building is in Spanish-colonial style, popularized by the American architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>. Its center was demarcated by a tall tower crowned by a hip roof with decorative corbels and cantilevered wooden balconies. The tower had a clock at the topmost floor. The ground floor with an arched entrance leads to the stairwell leading to the upper story. Flanking the tower are the wings, which have rusticated stone blocks, carved corbels, and cantilevered balconies. The wings end in faux facades with windows shielded by <strong>media aguas</strong> (awnings). These faux facades are the front of two wings perpendicular to the main wing and forming the u-shaped plan of the city hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) Zamboanga Office</em></strong> on N.S. Valderosa corner Corcuera St was formerly the residence of Don Francisco Barrios, a businessman, appointed as Chinese Consul and holding the rank of Mandarin. It was built around the 1860s. During the American era, the house was the official residence of Maj John Pershing, who expanded and remodeled it. In 1912, at Pershing&rsquo;s encouragement, BPI opened a branch on the ground floor of this house. It was appointed the official depository of the government in Zamboanga. The heritage house has been restored and appropriated for architectural reuse. The lower floor serves as a bank. Meanwhile, the upper story, which had long ceased to be a residence and had been used for storage, has been restored to the time of Maj Pershing and is used for BPI&rsquo;s company affairs. Stars adorn the transoms of the house alluding to the stars and stripes of the United States (US). In 2014, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines</a> marked the BPI building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Plaza Pershing</em></strong> was named after Maj John Joseph &ldquo;Black Jack&rdquo; Pershing (1860-1948). On 17 Aug 1899, Pershing volunteered for an assignment in Mindanao and Jolo. He was raised to the rank of major. Later, as a general, he led the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. A controversial figure for his firm and harsh attitude toward Muslims, American confreres honored him with a small park in Zamboanga. Shaped as triangle, the park has an octagonal gazebo at the northeastern apex of the triangle and roofed entrances, all from the American era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in the area adjacent to Santa Barbara, <strong><em>Pettit Barracks</em></strong> was built for the US Army&rsquo;s 43rd Infantry Regiment. The site was formerly occupied by Spanish troops, but the Americans took over on 16 Nov 1899, when they captured Zamboanga. The barracks were named after Col James S. Pettit (1856- 1906), 31st Infantry US Volunteer Commanding Officer Inspector General and in-charge of Civil Affairs of Zamboanga from 1899-1901. The barracks fell under Japanese control from 1942 to 1945, and was recaptured by the Americans on 10 Mar 1945. The barracks was turned over to the Philippine government on 4 Jul 1946. The barracks was surrounded by a picket fence and its main gate had an arched cement entrance flanked by sentry posts. Inside the enclosed area were the quarters of the commanding officer, the subordinate officers and the soldiers. There was a two-story wooden building of the YMCA, a parade ground, and an octagonal kiosk at its perimeter for viewing parades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quarters of the commanding officer was a two-story structure, very much like a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). Beside it was a two-story watchtower. Those of subordinate officers&rsquo; quarters were one-story <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> (chalet) types, raised above the ground by about a meter. A balcony was built in front of the house. Like other American-era military installations elsewhere, for instance Camp John Hay in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>, the buildings in Pettit Barracks were mostly wooden with a galvanized iron roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heritage Structures Outside the Urban Center</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 17th century, <strong><em>Rio Hondo</em></strong> was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) mooring place. It is now a village inhabited mostly by migrants from Jolo and Sulu. Migration accelerated beginning in 1974 when a massive encounter between Philippine military and the Mindanao National Liberation Front (MNLF) occurred in the town center of Jolo. The ensuing battle from 7-8 Feb resulted in the devastation of Jolo and a death toll placed at 20,000. Fleeing from the aftermath of battle, many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> from Sulu migrated to Zamboanga. Eventually, the Sama Dilaut were eased out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the houses at Rio Hondo use modern materials like galvanized iron roofing, plywood, and reinforced cement posts instead of more traditional materials like thatch, bamboo, wood planks for walls, and tree trunks for posts, these more modern houses still retain the basic form of dwellings built on stilts over the shallows of the sea. Typical is Maharlika Hall, the village center. Although made of modern material it rests on cement stilts anchored to the sea floor. Several mosques in the area are also on stilts over water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rio Hondo suffered major destruction of houses and buildings because of a military encounter between the Philippine Army and the MNLF in Sep 2013 to date (2015). Rio Hondo has not yet fully recovered from this, and many residents who fled the area are still homeless or in temporary shelters. The site of the battle of 2013 is popularly called &ldquo;Ground Zero.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\"><strong><em>Gabaldon schools</em></strong></a> are known in Zamboanga as &ldquo;Burleigh schools,&rdquo; after Pvt Albert L. Burleigh, a pioneer teacher-soldier, killed while detailed in Jolo. Its two remaining buildings are presently called East and West Central Schools. The Gabaldon school was named after Rep Isauro Gabaldon (1875-1942), representative of Nueva Ecija (1907-11), and senator (1916-19). He authored Philippine Assembly Act No 1801, allotting one million pesos annually from 1907 to 1915 for the construction of school buildings. These buildings followed a template put together by the Bureau of Public Works. The typical Gabaldon school was raised from the ground by a meter or so. It has a galvanized iron roof, walls made of wood, and generous openings to let in air and light. Its windows were awning-type and were made of wooden slats and Capiz shell panes. The typical classrooms opened to a wide corridor. On the corridor side, the walls had operable transoms to allow a free flow of air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Zamboanga Normal School</em></strong> building on Normal Road was constructed between 1917 and 1921 for teacher training. It was to become the permanent home of Provincial Normal School which was established in 1914. This building is now the College of Teacher Education, and part of the Western Mindanao State University. The school building, costing 200,000 pesos in 1917, followed the design by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>. In typical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style, it is characterized by the use of rounded arches for windows and doors, which define both the first and second stories. This longitudinal building has its center section, where the main door is placed, jutting forward, thus mitigating the block-like effect of the building. Softening the severity of the plain neoclassical designs are transoms and windowpanes, which are covered with glass bounded by wooden lattices, and wooden corbels that support the roof in the style of mission architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ateneo de Zamboanga</em></strong> was established by Spanish Jesuits in 1912 and officially and formally named Escuela Catolica. It was a parochial school attached to Immaculate Conception Church. Its first director was Fr Manuel Sauras, SJ. It held its classes in a wooden building opposite the cathedral, which also housed a barber shop and the garage of Mindanao Transit. In 1916, the Escuela Catolica was renamed Ateneo de Zamboanga. Because its old wooden building was being torn down, the school moved to the <strong><em>convento</em></strong> of the cathedral, occupying the ground floor. The building, which the school had previously occupied, was replaced by a plain, straightforward, three-story structure, named Mindanao Theater Inc. In 1928, the Ateneo opened a high school department in this building, which had been purchased by Bp Jose Clos y Pages, SJ, (bishop of Zamboanga, 1920-31) for 80,000 pesos and renamed Knights of Columbus. By 1932, the school, now under the American Jesuits (who had replaced the Spanish Jesuits in 1930) and with Fr Thomas Murray, SJ, as director, had its first high school graduates. The school buildings located downtown were bombed during the liberation of the city on 8 and 9 Mar 1945. In 1947, the high school reopened at the Jardin de Chino along Camino Nuevo (presently La Purisima St), where Fr Eusebio Salvador, SJ, had bought 18 adjoining lots before the war. In 1948, the school was officially recognized as a Jesuit school separate from the parish. The school became a university in 2001. Nothing of the prewar structures has remained. Before the war, the school was at two sites, beside the Church of the Immaculate Conception (near present-day Sunken Garden), and the Knights of Columbus building, now the site of the City Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception</em></strong> is a new structure built between 1998 and 2002, and was designed by Abarro and Associates. It replaced an earlier structure built in 1956 which had been badly damaged by termites. This 1956 structure hewed closely to the pre-World War II design, which was shaped like a barn, with the central nave rising higher than the flanking aisles. A colonnade of hardwood separated the aisles from the central nave. The facade, which rose to two stories terminated in a triangular pediment. It was flanked by twin towers; the Epistle side tower had a clock. In front of the main entrance was a porte cochere. Like all the Jesuit built churches of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the structure was made of wood and roofed in galvanized iron sheets. It rested on a foundation of concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located 18 km northeast of Fort Pilar and outside the Zamboanga City center, <strong><em>Talaksungay Mosque</em></strong> is an important landmark, being the oldest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\">mosque</a> established near Zamboanga poblacion. The mosque dates back to 1885, when Hadji Abdullah Maas Nu&ntilde;o built it for the Sama converts to Islam. The mosque was a center of learning and jurisprudence that catalyzed the spread of Islam in Zamboanga, Basilan, and the Sulu archipelago. It was recognized as a center of Islam by Islamic countries like Turkey, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Borneo. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2683\">National Historical Institute</a> marked it in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years the mosque has been remodeled and expanded. The present mosque is in the Arabic style with onion-shaped domes, not in the traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\"><strong>langgal</strong></a> style, which is a boxlike structure with a pitched roof, capped by a small turret with the crescent moon and star of Islam. The langgal style prevailed in Mindanao until it was gradually replaced by the Arabic style, characterized by onion-shaped domes. The present mosque has two minarets of unequal height in front. The&nbsp;<em>mihrab</em>, the niche that marks the&nbsp;<em>qiblat&nbsp;</em>or the direction of Mecca, is right under an onion dome surmounted by the crescent moon and star of Islam. The main hall and the minarets are likewise crowned by domes and crescent moons. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The building is in Spanish-colonial style, popularized by the American architect <a href=\"/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>. Its center was demarcated by a tall tower crowned by a hip roof with decorative corbels and cantilevered wooden balconies. The tower had a clock at the topmost floor. The ground floor with an arched entrance leads to the stairwell leading to the upper story. Flanking the tower are the wings, which have rusticated stone blocks, carved corbels, and cantilevered balconies. The wings end in faux facades with windows shielded by <strong>media aguas</strong> (awnings). These faux facades are the front of two wings perpendicular to the main wing and forming the u-shaped plan of the city hall."

It held its classes in a wooden building opposite the cathedral, which also housed a barber shop and the garage of Mindanao Transit. In 1916, the Escuela Catolica was renamed Ateneo de Zamboanga. Because its old wooden building was being torn down, the school moved to the <strong><em>convento</em></strong> of the cathedral, occupying the ground floor. The building, which the school had previously occupied, was replaced by a plain, straightforward, three-story structure, named Mindanao Theater Inc. In 1928, the Ateneo opened a high school department in this building, which had been purchased by Bp Jose Clos y Pages, SJ, (bishop of Zamboanga, 1920-31) for 80,000 pesos and renamed Knights of Columbus. By 1932, the school, now under the American Jesuits (who had replaced the Spanish Jesuits in 1930) and with Fr Thomas Murray, SJ, as director, had its first high school graduates. The school buildings located downtown were bombed during the liberation of the city on 8 and 9 Mar 1945. In 1947, the high school reopened at the Jardin de Chino along Camino Nuevo (presently La Purisima St), where Fr Eusebio Salvador, SJ, had bought 18 adjoining lots before the war. In 1948, the school was officially recognized as a Jesuit school separate from the parish. The school became a university in 2001. Nothing of the prewar structures has remained. Before the war, the school was at two sites, beside the Church of the Immaculate Conception (near present-day Sunken Garden), and the Knights of Columbus building, now the site of the City Theater."
