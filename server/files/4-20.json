That is long enough for an art form to reach a high level of maturity and relevance. That the Filipino film industry has produced only a handful of works of enduring interest and value may disappoint the film historian who approaches the industry without understanding the relevant context. It is therefore important to note that the beginnings of the industry arose not from a local felt need but from the initiative of foreign entrepreneurs. In this way, the problems of the Filipino film industry vis-&agrave;-vis its counterpart in the West, particularly the United States, can be better appreciated. Two Swiss entrepreneurs introduced film shows in Manila as early as 1897, regaling audiences with documentary film clips showing recent events and natural calamities in Europe. At this time, the Filipinos were waging a revolutionary war against the colonial rule of Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">But film clips can hold the attention of audiences only for the duration of their novelty. Thus, the making of the first feature films boosted the dwindling interest in film showings. In 1912, two more foreign entrepreneurs, this time Americans, created a sensation in Manila when they put on film the story of Jose P. Rizal&rsquo;s execution. Here was material close to Filipinos, subject matter guaranteeing ticket sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The role of foreign business in the introduction of filmmaking in the Philippines highlights the dependency that was to limit the growth of the industry in terms of technological competence and artistic quality. It was a time of rapid growth in the technology of filmmaking. Enormous capital was needed so the industry could keep up with Hollywood in the employment of new equipment. Investors with the required capital were hard to come by. Consequently, up-to-date technical polish in local films was an ideal all but impossible to attain. Similarly, generous investment was needed to make quality pictures, and in the absence of unlimited capital, filmmakers had to be content with what was deemed <i>puwede na </i>(passable). These two problems&mdash;expensive technology and inadequate capital&mdash;haunted the early producers and continue to haunt present-day filmmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">One of the first Filipinos to make movies was a photographer who sold his profitable photo studio so he could go into filmmaking. His name was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, whom historians of the Filipino film industry were to tag as &ldquo;the father of Philippine movies.&rdquo; Nepomuceno&rsquo;s first film was based on a highly acclaimed musical play of the day, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Country Maiden) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>. Since sound had not yet been incorporated into motion pictures in 1919 even in the United States, Nepomuceno had to resort to what must have been quite a novelty at the time. During screenings of the movie, the singer-actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a> stood behind the screen to sing the theme song &ldquo;Nabasag ang Banga&rdquo; (The Clay Pot Broke) to the accompaniment of a three-person band consisting of a violinist, a trumpet player, and a pianist.</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In those early years of filmmaking, Hollywood invariably provided the examples local directors could learn from. Thus, it ought not surprise anyone that genres and trends in the local industry had been set by American feature films. But working with outmoded equipment and hampered by limited budgets, Filipino directors found themselves unable to measure up to the standards set by Hollywood. On the most basic level of all, that of technical polish, local products could not compete against movies made by a giant industry fueled by seemingly inexhaustible funds and reaching out to a worldwide market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There was one advantage that Filipino movies enjoyed over foreign movies. They drew their narratives and themes from the lives of Filipinos themselves. For instance, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>, a contemporary of Nepomuceno who had spent some years working in Hollywood, was assured of audience appeal for his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1238\"><strong>Miracles of Love</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1925, where he portrayed young upper-class Filipinos rebelling against the tyranny of conservative parents. When talking pictures came to the Philippines, the language of Philippine movies gave them another advantage over foreign competition. Tagalog was to allow local movies to reach the vast majority of the population, giving them exclusive access to those Filipinos<span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"> who had not learned </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">English well enough to understand dialogue in Hollywood movies. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"NL\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Another director went back to history and showed the valor and determination of Filipinos who struggled against Spanish colonial rule in the film <em><b>Patria Amore</b> </em>(Beloved Country), 1929. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4526\">Julian Manansala</a> made other movies, but he kept to the example of <em><b>Patria Amore</b></em>, mining history for appealing narratives for such works as <em><b>Dimasalang</b></em>, 1930, <strong><em>Mutya ng Katipunan</em></strong> (Muse of Katipunan), 1939, and <em><b>Tawag ng Bayan</b></em> (Country Call), 1939. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"NL\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Starting with <em><b>Dalagang Bukid</b></em>, early films dug into traditional theater forms for character types, twists in the plot, familiar themes, and conventions in acting. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>, a musical theater form newly introduced at that time but already a favorite among elite theatergoers, yielded many contemporary romantic and comic characters for narratives spiced up with songs and happy endings. The film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><em><b><strong> <strong>Pakiusap</strong> </strong> </b></em></a> (Plea), 1940, is recognizably a movie equivalent of the sarsuwela. From the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><em>sinakulo</em></a> or passion play, many film melodramas have derived a variety of characters based on the Virgin Mary (the all-suffering, all-forgiving Filipino Mother), Mary Magdalene (the &ldquo;prostitute with the golden heart&rdquo;), Judas (the original, unmitigated villain), and, of course, Jesus (the savior of societies under threat, redeemer of all those who have gone wrong). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a>,<i> </i>the typically Filipino <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1059\">aksiyon</a></strong> movie was to develop. The dividing line in the komedya between the good men and the bad men was religion, <span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">with the Christians presented as the forces of good and the Moros as the forces of evil in line with the propaganda of Spanish missionaries. In present-day aksiyon movies, that dividing line has become the law and the two sides could be two families fighting over political power or two factions warring over economic advantage. The hero is as invincible as the gallant warrior-knight of the komedya and the heroine as virtuous as the beauteous princess in the traditional stage play. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"NL\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Especially during the early years of the film industry, Philippine literature was a rich source of subject matter and themes for movies. Two writers from the 19th century have been the chief sources of tradition. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\">Jose Rizal</a>, through the classics for which they are famous, have given the industry situations and character types that continue to this day to give meat to films both great and mediocre. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"NL\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The poem <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><b><i><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</i></b></a><i> </i>(Florante and Laura) provides film scripts with such familiar characters in romantic melodramas as the jealous lover and the ever-faithful lady-love. Aladin and Flerida, the kindhearted Moor and his courageous princess, have served as prototypes of the &ldquo;good people from the other side.&rdquo; A pre-Pacific War version, 1939, and a postwar version, 1950, of Balagtas&rsquo;s masterwork attest to the poet&rsquo;s contribution to the literary tradition that informs the Filipino film industry. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But more than Balagtas, it was Rizal who has enriched the content and theme of Filipino films. Both the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b><i> </i></a>(Touch Me Not) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b></a><i> </i>(Subversion) have been made into movies. Even before movies had begun to &ldquo;talk,&rdquo; a film version of the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>had been made in 1930. It was the master director Gerardo de Leon who gave the two Rizal classics consummate artistic treatment by turning both into award-winning films in the 1960s. Aside from their narratives, the Rizal novels also gave to Filipino movies distinctive character types like Maria Clara, Sisa, Elias, Padre Damaso, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, and, of course, Crisostomo Ibarra and Simon. Indicative of the pervasive influence of Rizal is the fact that each time scriptwriters dip into the Spanish past for themes, the struggle of the Filipinos for reforms under Spanish colonialism as portrayed in the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>and the <b><i>Fili</i></b><i> </i>never fails to be evoked and even recreated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary popular novels, followed from week to week by avid readers of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><b><i><strong>Liwayway</strong> </i></b></a><i> </i>magazine, were ideal materials for mass entertainment. With their own audience following, these novels when transformed into movies drew into the movie houses readers interested in seeing their favorite characters turned into almost flesh-and-blood people moving and talking on the screen. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\"><strong>Punyal na Ginto</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Golden Dagger) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5692\">Antonio G. Sempio</a> was made into the first talking Tagalog movie in 1933. Serialized novels proved to be very profitable materials for movies so that it was not unusual for a film to be built up in advertisements as a movie version of a well-known novel. Many times, the name of the novelist was featured more prominently than the names of the lead stars or of the director. Thus did prewar moviegoers become familiar with the names of Lazaro Francisco who wrote the novels <b><i>Ama</i></b><i> </i>(Father), 1936, <b><i>Sa Paanan ng Krus</i></b><i> </i>(At the Foot of the Cross), 1936, and <b><i>Bago Lumubog ang Araw</i></b><i> </i>(Before the Sun Sets), 1938; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5780\">Teodoro Virrey</a> who penned <b><i>Lihim ni Bathala</i></b><i> </i>(God&rsquo;s Secret), 1931, and <b><i>Gamugamong Naging Lawin</i></b><i> </i>(Winged Ant That Turned into a Hawk), 1937; Fausto Galauran who published <b><i>Lagablab ng Kabataan</i></b><i> </i>(The Raging Fire of Youth), 1936, <b><i>Birheng Walang Dambana</i></b><i> </i>(The Virgin without a Shrine), 1936, and <b><i>Hatol ng Mataas na Langit</i></b><i> </i>(Judgment from Heaven Above), 1938; and I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado who popularized <b><i><strong>Sampaguita</strong> ng Walang Bango</i></b><i> </i>(Jasmine without Fragrance), 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other literary sources were readily available. Folklore familiar to the populace was a mine of character types and situations for comedies and fantasy films. Enchantresses like Maria Makiling and picaresque adventurers like Juan Tamad appeared under different names and guises in films that capitalized on audiences&rsquo; familiarity with folk heroes and heroines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Competing with Hollywood movies for patronage was a tough test for local movies. Hollywood movies enjoyed huge budgets and saturation advertising. That local movies survived was due less to a miracle than to a cultural exigency resulting from the failure of the majority of Filipinos to learn English well enough to appreciate Hollywood films. The industry did not only survive, it flourished with great vitality. Shortly before the outbreak of the Pacific War, no less than six active film companies were making an average of 50 films per year for Filipinos who preferred to watch Filipino movies because these were the movies they could relate to and understand. These were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>, 1934; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a>, 1935; Excelsior Pictures, 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>, 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>, 1939; and X&rsquo;Otic Films, 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A clear sign that the film industry had carved out its own share of audience for movies was the acclaim local movie stars received from the public. In less than 20 years of existence from 1919, the industry had built up its own firmament of stars whose glitter and glamor filled popular magazines and made their photos (as reproduced in magazine covers) standard wall decor in the homes of the moviegoing masses. As the decade of the 1930s came to a close, there was no doubt that moviegoing had established itself as a national pastime among Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Pacific War brought havoc on the industry. The Japanese invasion put a halt to film activity when the invaders commandeered precious film equipment for their own propaganda needs. The Japanese brought their own films to show to Filipino audiences. However, these films failed to exert the same appeal as the Hollywood movies, which continued to circulate among movie houses during the early part of the occupation. Later, the Japanese propaganda office recruited some local filmmakers&mdash;notably <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&mdash;to make movies with propaganda content. <b><i><strong>Tatlong Maria</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Three Marys), 1944, a movie intended to give an idealized picture of the country as it had been purged of corrupting American influence, was conceived as a grand production bringing together in one movie some of the best-known names in the prewar industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">When moviemaking ground to a halt in 1942, movie stars, directors, and technicians found ways of employing themselves in jobs related to their work background. Fortunately, live theater had begun to flourish again. Audiences had tired of watching the same Hollywood movies over and over again. No new films were coming in from abroad and no new ones were being made in the Philippines. &ldquo;Stage shows&rdquo; began to take over as entertainment fare in movie houses in Manila. It was by appearing in these shows that unemployed movie stars found a way of keeping their fans from forgetting them, at the same time that they were trying to survive the hard times. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1945 when the ruins of war still lay in mounds and mountains, the film industry was already staggering to its feet. The entire nation had gone through hell and there were many stories to tell about heroic deeds and dastardly crimes during the three years of Japanese occupation. A Philippine version of the war movie had emerged as a genre in which were recreated narratives of horror and heroism with soldiers and guerrillas as protagonists exacting justice and vengeance from the Japanese invaders. Movies like <b><i>Garrison 13</i></b>,<i> </i>1946, <b><i>Dugo ng Bayan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946, <b><i>Walang Kamatayan</i></b><i> </i>(Deathless), 1946, and <b><i>Guerilyera</i></b> (Lady Guerrilla Fighter),<i> </i>1946, told stories familiar to all who had gone through the occupation years, <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">and audiences hungry for new local movies and still fired up by patriotism and hatred for the foreign enemies did not seem to tire of recalling their experiences of the war. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The 1950s were years of rebuilding and growth for the nation. The decade saw frenetic activity in the film industry, which yielded what might be regarded as the first harvest of distinguished films by Filipinos. Two studios active before the war had reestablished themselves. Sampaguita and LVN had bounced back from losses suffered during the war and were turning out a steady stream of movies. A new studio had been set up, Premiere Productions, and it was earning a reputation for the vigor and freshness of some of its films, particularly the action films. This was the period of the &ldquo;Big Three&rdquo; when the industry operated under the studio system. Each of the three studios&mdash;Sampaguita, LVN, Premiere (a fourth one, Lebran, is also cited as a major studio)&mdash;had its own set of stars and directors, each one engaged in long-range planning, with movie projects lined up for the entire year. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The first harvest of films that would not resist the label &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; might be said to be due in large measure to the workings of the studio system. The system, after all, assured moviegoers a variety of fare during a specific year and allowed stars and directors more room to develop their skills and talents in movies that did not latch on to current trends for audience appeal. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Awards for excellence were first instituted during the decade. First, the Manila Times Publishing Company set up the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4535\">Maria Clara Awards</a>. Two years later, in 1952, newspaper people in the movie beat constituted themselves into what is now known as Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences and handed out the first batch of trophies that have since become in the industry the much-coveted symbols of recognition or achievement. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More than the awards system at home, it was the honors won by Filipino entries in the first years of the Asian Film Festival that endowed the Philippine film industry with respectability insofar as the snobbish intelligentsia was concerned. This sector of educated Filipinos had consistently ignored local movies, preferring American and other imported films that carried with them the sophisticated aura of cultural items approved by media here and abroad. The awards won by Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1954, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> Dalita</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>The Ruins</i></b>), 1956, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1957, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\">Gregorio Fernandez</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1176\"><strong>Higit sa Lahat</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Above All</strong></em>), 1955, established the Philippines as an important filmmaking center in Asia. Earlier, in 1952, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a> had earned celebrity status when <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1950, was accepted for competition at the prestigious Venice Film Festival. In 1953, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4316\">Luciano B. Carlos</a> won the Best Screenplay award at the first Asian Film Festival for <b><i>Ang Asawa Kong Amerikana</i></b><i> </i>(My <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">American Wife). The cumulative effect of these honors won by Filipino directors was to claim for Filipino films their share of attention from Filipinos interested in culture and the arts. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">If the 1950s were an auspicious decade for Filipino movies, the succeeding period was a time of uncertainties. The studio system came under siege when the growing labor movement in Manila organized studio hands, and demands for better pay and working conditions resulted in labor-management conflicts. The first studio to close shop was Lebran, followed soon after by Premiere Productions. Investors in these companies resurfaced afterward as heads of different smaller companies, making way for the beginnings of the independent producers. Sampaguita Pictures and LVN Pictures followed the example of the two studios, and soon enough a new generation of film producers made up the film industry. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Even in a period of decline, however, creative genius would assert itself in the exceptions to the mindless products of mainstream filmmaking. Gerardo de Leon would bring to the screen both of the Rizal novels: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><b><i>Noli Me Tangere</i></b></a><i> </i>in 1961 and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\"><b><i>El Filibusterismo</i></b></a><i> </i>in 1962. Earlier, de Leon and the younger <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4450\">Cesar Gallardo</a> came up with artistically crafted melodramas: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1183\"><strong>Huwag Mo Akong Limutin</strong></a> </i></b>(<em><strong>Never Forget Me</strong></em>), 1960, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1200\"><strong>Kadenang Putik</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Chain of Mud</strong></em>), 1960, both tales of marital infidelity but told with insight and cinematic import. </span></p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The small production companies made movies on a per-picture basis and, to make sure that their investment would bring in profits, they geared their production to what the audiences were gobbling up at any given moment. They took their cue from the foreign films that were drawing crowds in local movie houses. This was the period of the soft-core sex films from Europe, Italian cowboy movies, American James Bond-type thrillers, and Chinese/Japanese martial arts action films. The genres that developed&mdash;the <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\">bomba</a> movies</b> (soft-core sex films), the <b>Pinoy cowboy movies</b>, and the <b>secret agent thrillers</b>&mdash;were local versions of what were then in vogue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The decade also saw a worldwide youth revolt best represented by the Beatles and the outrages on adult-sponsored institutions and conventions that these cheeky pop musicians perpetrated. The popularity at this time of certain established film genres owed much to that revolt. <b>Fan movies</b> or movies aimed at the fans of certain young stars had been part of the output of the industry during the days of the studios. The &ldquo;Tita-Pancho&rdquo; movies of Sampaguita and the &ldquo;Nida-Nestor&rdquo; films of LVN were the forerunners of what were to be the principal youth movies of the new decade. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a>, along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a> and Edgar Mortiz as their respective screen sweethearts, were callow performers during the heyday of fan movies. Young audiences made up of vociferous partisans for &ldquo;Guy and Pip&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vi and Bot&rdquo; were in search of role models who could take the place of elders whom the youth revolt had taught them to distrust. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Related in spirit to the fan movies were the <b>child films</b> of the period. <b><i>Roberta</i></b>,<i> </i>1951, of Sampaguita Pictures was the phenomenal example from an earlier period of the drawing power of movies featuring child stars. In the 1960s, movies of this type seemed to have touched a responsive chord implying rejection of adult corruption and insensitivity as exposed by the innocence and candor of child protagonists. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">As though to chide those claiming to represent &ldquo;normal&rdquo; society, social misfits portrayed by comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4307\">Cachupoy</a> in <b>slapstick comedies</b> invariably put &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people in embarrassing situations. Slapstick comedies have been perennial favorites among mass moviegoers, and it was not unlikely that the reason for their popularity had to do with their social function. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Directly reflective of the disaffection with the status quo were the genres that formed the chief contribution of the 1960s to the development of film in the Philippines. <b>Action movies</b> with Pinoy cowboys and secret agents as central figures depicted a society ravaged by criminality and corruption. These movies connected the make-believe world of movies with the social realities of the times. Institutions and communities that were witnesses to the adventures of these figments of the scriptwriters&rsquo; fantasy worlds suggested a search for heroes that would rid society of hated warlords, avaricious bureaucrats, and money-crazed merchants. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The most notorious genre of the period emerged at the close of the decade. Bomba<b> </b>refers to what was actually melodrama heavily laced with sex. The explicitness with which the sex act was portrayed or problematized came at a time when a social movement had begun to grow beyond the walls of campuses in Manila and surrounding cities. In rallies, demonstrations, and other forms of mass action, the national democratic movement presented its analysis of the problems of Philippine society and posited that only a social revolution could bring genuine change. The bomba film was a direct challenge to the conventions and norms of conduct of the status quo, a rejection of the authority of institutions in regulating the &ldquo;life urge&rdquo; seen as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and its free expression &ldquo;honest&rdquo; and &ldquo;therapeutic.&rdquo; Looking beyond its exploitative intentions as a product of a profit-oriented industry, one may now make a case for the bomba film as a subversive genre in which the narrative pretends to uphold establishment values when it is actually intent on undermining audience support for corrupt and outmoded institutions. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s response to the clamor for change was to place the country under martial rule. In 1972, he sought to contain growing unrest that the youth revolt of the 1960s had fueled. Claiming that all he wanted was to &ldquo;save the Republic,&rdquo; Marcos retooled the liberal-democratic political system into an authoritarian government, which concentrated power in a dictator&rsquo;s hand. To win the population over, mass media was enlisted in the service of the New Society. Film was a key component of the media industry in a society wracked with contradictions within the ruling class and between the sociopolitical elite and the masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Accordingly, Marcos and his technocrats sought to regulate filmmaking. The first step was to control the content of movies by insisting on a form of precensorship. One of the rules promulgated by the Board of Censors for Motion Pictures (BCMP) stipulated submission of a finished script prior to the start of filming. When the annual film festival of the city of Manila was reconstituted to include the other cities in Metro Manila, the censors blatantly insisted that the &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; of the New Society be incorporated into the content of the entries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The requirement of a script prior to the start of filming was actually a welcome innovation in the Philippine film industry, which had practically made a tradition of improvising a screenplay during the filming process. Although compliance with the requirement necessarily meant curtailment of the right of free expression, the BCMP, in effect, caused the film industry to pay attention to the content of a projected film production insofar as such is printed in a finished screenplay. In this way did fresh talents from literature and theater find their way into filmmaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The contribution of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3113\">Orlando Nadres</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F.

To that crop belong outstanding films whose respective directors found in the screenplay plots and characters they could turn into images of human anxieties and achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s saw the ascendancy of young directors who entered the industry in the late years of the previous decade&mdash;specifically, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>. By virtue of his auspicious reentry into the Philippine industry in 1976, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a>, though he properly belongs to an earlier generation of directors, earned the right to be classified among the makers of a new cinema in the Philippines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1166\"><b><i>Ganito Kami Noon&hellip; Paano Kayo Ngayon?</i></b></a><i> </i>(<em><strong>This Was How We Were&hellip; What Happens to You Now?</strong></em>), 1976, left no doubt that Romero was an elder master among the young directors. The succession of films he made in the 1970s showed him preoccupied with grand themes about nationhood, the fallibility of human beings and despair, survival and hope in a corruptible and yet unrenounceable society. <b><i>Sino&rsquo;ng Kapiling, Sino&rsquo;ng Kasiping?</i></b><i> </i>(Housemates, Bedmates?), 1977, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1113\"><strong>Banta ng Kahapon</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Threat from the Past</strong></em>), 1977, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, reveal a breadth of vision hard to equal in the local film industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lino Brocka came into film from theater, and this was immediately obvious in his preference for material that played out vivid conflicts among characters who were all reaching out for a person&rsquo;s share of love and affection in a hostile social setting. The characteristic Brocka film, as delineated by the best of his works, revolves around a victim of oppression by another person or by an institution, culminating in an eruption of revolt by the one who has all along seemed passive and patient. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1305\"><strong>Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Weighed But Found Wanting</strong></em>), 1974, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1976, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1296\"><b><i>Tahan Na, Empoy, Tahan</i></b></a><i> </i>(<em><strong>Stop Crying Now, Empoy</strong></em>), 1977, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1194\"><strong>Jaguar</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Guard</strong></em>), 1979, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1980, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Bayan Ko</strong> </strong> : Kapit sa Patalim</i></b></a><i> </i>(<em><strong>My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge</strong></em>), 1984, are among Brocka&rsquo;s best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Ishmael Bernal entered the industry at about the same time as Brocka. In college, he had majored in literature and this often surfaces in his films where the director shows fondness for carefully worked-out patterns of symbolic details. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1258\"><strong>Pagdating sa Dulo</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>At the Top</strong></em>), 1971, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1252\"><strong>Nunal sa Tubig</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Speck in the Water</strong></em>), 1976, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Pleasure</strong></em>), 1979, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1139\"><b><i>City after Dark</i></b></a>,<i> </i>1980, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Miracle</i></b>), 1982, allow us a glimpse of the intellectuality that is at the heart of Bernal&rsquo;s finest achievements in film. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Celso Ad. Castillo had a penchant for social subject matter, but this was often obscured by a characteristic flamboyance in approach and style. <b><i>Asedillo</i></b>,<i> </i>1970, <b><i><strong>Daluyong</strong> at Habagat</i></b><i> </i>(Tall Waves, Wild Wind), 1975, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1135\"><strong>Burlesk Queen</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Burlesque Queen), 1977, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1260\"><b><i>Pagputi ng Uwak, Pag-itim ng Tagak</i></b></a><i> </i>(When the Crow Turns White, When the Heron Turns Black), 1978, and <b><i>Ang Alamat ni Julian Makabayan</i></b><i> </i>(The Legend of Julian Makabayan), 1979, show Castillo&rsquo;s daring in his choice of subject matter. Revolt, labor unionism, social ostracism, and class division&mdash;these are stuff from which even the most mettlesome directors in the industry would stay away. In his works in the 1970s, adventurousness is the essence of the Castillo style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The surge of creative energy occasioned by the new films encouraged optimism that the industry was ready to gamble on new subject matter, vital themes, and innovative technique. This attracted a new generation of directors. These filmmakers had their start in the industry only in the 1970s, but already each of them had produced works that left no doubt about his/her talent in using the camera to weave a tale or statement about the human condition in the Philippines in our time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The next generation consisted of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a> who did <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a> </i></b>(<em><strong>The R</strong></em><b><i>ites of May</i></b>), 1976, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1202\"><strong>Kakabakaba Ka Ba?</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Will Your Heart Beat Faster?</i></b>), 1980, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1207\"><strong>Kisapmata</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Blink of an Eye), 1981, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1118\"><b><i>Batch &rsquo;81</i></b></a>,<i> </i>1982, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1293\"><b><i>Sister Stella L.</i></b></a>,<i> </i>1984; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\">Marilou Diaz-Abaya</a> who directed <b><i>Tanikala</i></b><i> </i>(Chains), 1979, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1130\"><strong>Brutal</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1980, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1982, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1204\"><strong>Karnal</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Of the Flesh</i></b>), 1983; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4465\">Laurice Guillen</a> who did <b><i>Kasal?</i></b><i> </i>(Marriage?), 1980, <b><i>Kung Ako&rsquo;y Iiwan Mo</i></b><i> </i>(Should You Abandon Me), 1980, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1277\"><strong>Salome</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1981; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a> who directed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1256\"><b><i>Oro, Plata, Mata</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>Gold, Silver, Death</i></b>), 1982, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1314\"><strong>Virgin Forest</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1286\"><strong>Scorpio Nights</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1984; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4332\">Mel Chionglo</a> who did <b><i>Playgirl</i></b>,<i> </i>1981, and <b><i>Sinner or Saint</i></b>,<i> </i>1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this period, Filipino films achieved intellectual respectability among Filipino viewers beyond what they gained in the 1950s. This time, it was not only in Asia that Filipino filmmakers had made a mark; they had been recognized in the West as well. Five of Brocka&rsquo;s films were exhibited at the Cannes Film Festival in France, earning for him an international reputation that brought offers to make films outside the Philippines. Two of Mike de Leon&rsquo;s films were featured at the same festival. The acknowledged master among all Filipino filmmakers, Gerardo de Leon, was accorded posthumous honors at the Nantes Film Festival in France and at the Hong Kong Film Festival. International recognition of the talent of Filipino directors attracted students and young professionals and their families, adding a dynamic component to the crowd that used to be disparaged as an &ldquo;uncultured&rdquo; audience. Their presence in the consciousness of the new filmmakers made possible more quality pictures from the local industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition, the establishment of the critics&rsquo; group known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a> in 1976 further buttressed the newfound status of film as an art form. Over the years, the Gawad Urian, the name of the award given by the Manunuri, has been able to intensify awareness of high artistic and sociocultural standards against which the very best Filipino films have been measured. Reactions pro and con to the annual awards tend to confirm that, indeed, the audience for Filipino films has changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fresh talents and a new audience with them had emerged. The chieftains of the industry, however, have remained unduly cautious, guarding their investments and continuing to assume that the consumers for their products have remained as static as they have. Thus, mainstream cinema in the Philippines continued to thrive on clich&eacute;s and formulas originating in the primeval times of local filmmaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside the industry, talented young filmmakers have held out against the crass commercialism of mainstream cinema. In 1977, news from the Berlin Film Festival about the International Critics&rsquo; Prize for a film from the Philippines with a rather bizarre title <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1218\"><strong>Mababangong Bangungot</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Perfumed Nightmare</i></b>) by a young director with the equally bizarre name of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a> came like a dispatch from the moon. Kidlat Tahimik turned out to be Eric de Guia, a young man with an MBA degree from the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Wharton School of Business, who turned his back on a career in business and industry to make movies. He was a total unknown as far as the Filipino film industry was concerned, but his film had been ranked in the USA among the very best in the contemporary film scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kidlat Tahimik&rsquo;s unheralded rise to international fame underscores the distance between mainstream cinema and what has been termed as independent cinema. Where the former has the potential of reaching a vast audience but is subject to the whims and dictates of profit-oriented producers, independent cinema is free to explore all types of subject matter and approaches but accessible only to a limited though highly discriminating audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Out of the short film festivals sponsored by the University of the Philippines Film Center and by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, young filmmakers joined Kidlat Tahimik in the production of movies that, by their refusal to kowtow to the traditions and conventions of mainstream filmmaking, signified faith in works that tried to probe deeper into the human being and into society. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1222\"><strong>Ang Magpakailanman</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<em><strong>Eternity</strong></em>), 1983, have received their share of international attention in festivals abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1970 to 1979, the film industry produced an average of 166 movies a year; from 1980 to 1989, an average of 142 movies a year. Out of this output, it was reasonable to expect that 10 movies might be picked out at year&rsquo;s end as creative works that said something worthwhile if not necessarily significant. If the number of films up for the annual awards was a reliable index, only about five percent of the industry output passed reasonably high standards of artistic excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The meager yield was itself an indictment of an industry that had been terribly behind its artists in growing up. It pointed to many crimes both of commission and omission that producers, distributors, promotions planners, and others had perpetrated against the paying public. Chief among these crimes was the continuing reification of the audience and then blaming that audience for the industry&rsquo;s own refusal to mature. Fortunately, social realities could not be permanently shut out from products of the film industry. The filmmaker was immersed in the realities of his society whether he was aware of it or not. And film was a voracious medium that took in whatever the camera could record even when the men behind that camera were focusing on something else they would rather project. Consequently, even the most vicious proponents of mindless entertainment for the masses in the industry had not been too successful in editing out social problems and issues from the movies they had produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The martial law years under President Ferdinand Marcos were a period of media repression that saw <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1343\">radio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/63/1343\">television</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a>, and film kept under constant surveillance with the collaboration of media owners and practitioners as well. Nevertheless, some filmmakers were not daunted by the state&rsquo;s veiled terrorism. Realities the martial law government wanted to gloss over or conceal appeared in various guises in a number of feature films, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1181\"><b><i>Hubad na <strong>Bayani</strong> </i></b><i> </i></a>(<em><strong>A Hero Stripped</strong></em>), 1977, about a peasant revolt; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1797\"><strong>Sakada</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Seasonal Cane Workers), 1976, about unrest among sugar workers; <b><i>Batch &rsquo;81</i></b>,<i> </i>an allegory about fascism; <b><i>Manila by Night/City after Dark</i></b>,<i> </i>about the seamy side of Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s &ldquo;City of Man&rdquo;; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1237\"><b><i>Minsa&rsquo;y Isang Gamu-gamo</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>Once a Moth</i></b>), 1976, an exposure of the ill effects of the US bases; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1129\"><strong>Broken Marriage</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, touching on media repression; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><strong>Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim</strong></a></i></b>, focusing on the suppression of workers&rsquo; rights; and <b><i>Sister Stella L.</i></b>,<i> </i>on media repression and violence against striking workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By all indications, since 1974, when Lino Brocka&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1305\"><b><i>Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang</i></b></a><i> </i>appeared, a &ldquo;New Cinema&rdquo; had been in the making. The works that composed its canon had been created under conditions almost prohibitive of artistic quality. Not one of them had escaped certain tell-tale marks of a commercial product. What mattered, however, was that these atypical products of the industry had sharpened the consciousness of audiences that films need not be dull to be relevant nor inaccessible to be artistic and that, above all, films that entertain could also be a source of light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">The achievements of Brocka&rsquo;s generation of filmmakers and the New Cinema of the 1970s ended against the uncontrolled commercialism of the industry. Brocka&rsquo;s fatal car accident in 1991 somewhat indicated the writing on the wall. Nonetheless, some worthwhile films were still made in the 1990s by Brocka&rsquo;s colleagues. Mario O&rsquo;Hara made <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1160\"><strong>The Fatima Buen Story</strong></a></i></b>, 1994, and low-budget films like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1107\"><strong>Babae sa Bubungang Lata</strong></a> </i></b>(Woman on a Tin Roof), 1998, and <b><i>Sisa</i></b>, 1998. Marilou Diaz-Abaya, after her stint on television, made films once more, including <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a></i></b>, 1997, a portrait of a naive, loving woman who changes the lives of a family of men, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b></a>, 1998, her epic biography of the Filipino national hero. Peque Gallaga continued his collaboration with Lore Reyes, doing a variety of films ranging from the action-adventure <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1220\"><strong>Magic Temple</strong></a></i></b>, 1996, to something with a more adult content like <b><i>Deliryo </i></b>(Delirium), 1997, to the violent world of gangs in <b><i>Gangland</i></b>, 1998; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4332\">Mel Chionglo</a> did <b><i>Sibak </i></b>(<b><i>Midnight Dancers</i></b>), 1995, his answer to Brocka&rsquo;s <b><i>Macho Dancer</i></b>, and <b><i>Lahar</i></b>, 1997, the mudflow from Mount Pinatubo that devastated the neighboring towns. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4250\">Tikoy Aguiluz</a> made <b><i>Bagong Bayani </i></b>(<b><i>Unsung Heroine</i></b>), 1995, based on the front-page story of Flor Contemplacion, the overseas contract worker in Singapore who was hanged for killing her ward; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1287\"><strong>Segurista</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Dead Sure</i></b>), 1996, the tragic story of a woman who offers her body to sell life insurance; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1273\"><b><i>Rizal sa</i></b></a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1273\"> </a><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1273\"><strong>Dapit</strong> an</a> </b></i>(Rizal in Dapitan), 1997, a film on Rizal&rsquo;s years of exile on an island in southern Philippines. Gil Portes made his film about a doctor to the barrios, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1240\"><strong>Mulanay: Sa Pusod ng Paraiso</strong></a> </i></b>(Mulanay: Deep in Paradise), 1996. Jose Antonio Perez did <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1241\"><strong>Mumbaki</strong></a></i></b> (Shaman), 1996, about a doctor who is rooted in the culture of the mumbaki<i>.</i> Ishmael Bernal&rsquo;s sporadic filmmaking during this period resulted in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1316\"><strong>Wating</strong></a> </i></b>(Street-smart), 1994, which is set in the exploitative world of the city where one has to be a <i>wating</i>. In 1996, Bernal died of aneurism, another event that signaled the end of the New Cinema of the 1970s.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">A new group of filmmakers made their presence felt in the 1990s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4650\">Chito Ro&ntilde;o</a>, who started doing feature films as early as 1986 with <b><i>Private Show</i></b>, became more active in the 1990s. Among his many films, notable are <b><i>Eskapo: The Sergio Osme&ntilde;a&ndash; <strong>Geny Lopez</strong> Story </i></b>(<em><strong>Fugitive</strong></em>), 1995, a thriller about the lives of two political enemies of Marcos; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1142\"><strong>Curacha: Ang Babaeng Walang Pahinga</strong></a> </i></b>(<em><strong>Curacha: The Woman Without Rest</strong></em>), 1998, in which a live-sex performer goes through life as a military coup makes life uncertain. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a>, who started as an actor for Lino Brocka, made <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1164\"><strong>The Flor Contemplacion Story</strong></a></i></b>, 1995, his take on the tragic story of the Filipina overseas worker in Singapore. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, who started writing for television and film in the late 1970s and early 1980s, became more prolific between 1991 and 1996, writing and directing 21 movies. Among his notable works are the romance drama <b><i>May Minamahal </i></b>(<b><i>Loving Someone</i></b>), 1993, and his teen film <b><i>Pare Ko </i></b>(Hey, Dude), 1995. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4681\">Carlos Siguion-Reyna</a> made melodramas like <b><i>Inagaw Mo ang Lahat sa Akin </i></b>(<b><i><strong>Harvest</strong> Home</i></b>), 1995,<i> </i>a story of incest in a rural setting; and <b><i><strong> <strong>Ligaya</strong> ang Itawag Mo sa Akin</strong> </i> </b>(<b><i>They Call Me Joy</i></b>), 1997, about a prostitute&rsquo;s attempt to lead a new life amidst the hypocrisies of society. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4497\">Olive Lamasan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4612\">Rory Quintos</a> are both in-house directors of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a>. Lamasan made <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1278\"><strong>Sana Maulit Muli</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Second Chances</i></b>), 1995, the story of two lovers who try to recapture the past,<i> </i>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1219\"><strong>Madrasta</strong></a> </i></b>(<em><strong>Stepmother</strong></em>), 1996, about the travails of a stepmother played by &ldquo;megastar&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\">Sharon Cuneta</a>. Quintos directed <b><i>Mangarap Ka </i></b>(Dream On), 1995, a feel-good story of a young man&rsquo;s triumph in track and field against all odds;<b><i>Sa Aking mga Kamay </i></b>(In My Hands), 1996, a thriller involving a serial killer played by matinee idol <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4563\">Aga Muhlach</a>; and <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\">Anak</a></strong> </em> (The Child), 2000, a drama abouta mother&#39;s struggle to reconnect with her children after years of working as a domestic helper in Hong Kong. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4540\">Erik Matti</a>, the most visual director among this group of filmmakers, rode on the success and controversy of Gallaga&rsquo;s 1985 <b><i>Scorpio Nights</i></b> by making <b><i>Scorpio Nights 2</i></b>, 1997, with less daring than the original, while <b><i>Pedro Penduko II, The Return of the Come Back</i></b>, 2000, is a comedic detour from his earlier excursions into the sex movie genre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">During this post-Brocka period, commercialism became more intense. Filmmakers had to compromise more than they had done before. Production companies, because of greater competition from global cinemas, specifically Hollywood, cut down on their risks by drastically reducing their investments. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a>, for example, instituted a program of low-budget movies called <b>pito-pito</b><i> </i>(literally, seven-seven). The idea was to churn out a movie with seven days of shooting and seven days of postproduction at a very low budget of below 100,000 US dollars. Although the seven-day shoot was not strictly followed, new filmmakers who saw an opportunity to break into the industry bought into this scheme, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4485\">Jeffrey Jeturian</a> who came up with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1279\"><strong>Sana Pag-ibig Na</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Enter Love</i></b>), 1998, a simple but sensitive treatment of a young man&rsquo;s discovery of his father&rsquo;s love affair, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a> who did <b><i>Serafin Geronimo: Ang Kriminal ng Barrio Concepcion </i></b>(<b><i>The Criminal of Barrio Concepcion</i></b>), 1998, an exploration into violence, guilt, and love.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">By the 1990s, it was clear that three major companies dominated the industry: Regal, Viva, and Seiko. In 1995, another major company would offer competition&mdash;Star Cinema, an affiliate of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> television network. The dominance of these companies discouraged the entry of other production companies. From 1990 to 1999, the industry produced an average of 141 movies a year. In the first half of the new millennium, the average went down to 82 per year. Later, the industry could hardly produce 50 movies per year. At this time, Star Cinema became the dominant production company, mainly because of its affiliation with the ABS-CBN television network. Seiko disappeared from the scene; Regal and Viva usually co-produced with Star Cinema to take advantage of its television network that they would need to boost the marketing of their films. GMA Films, an affiliate of television network GMA 7, also became a major player in the industry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">There were other filmmakers who worked along the periphery of the industry, if not totally outside the mainstream. Raymond Red, who made waves in international festivals with his experimental Super 8 films in the 1980s, made his presence known with two historical films: <b><i>Bayani</i></b> (Hero), 1992, his take on the inner character of the supremo of the revolutionaries, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1276\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>, 1993, a study on the last of the revolutionaries. Frustrated by developments in the industry, he made another short film, financing the project himself, and came up with <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1105\"><i><strong>Ani</strong>no</i></a> </b>(Shadow), 2000, a 10-minute film that was awarded the Palme d&rsquo;Or in the short film category of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. Nick Deocampo continued to make documentaries, notably <b><i>Private Wars</i></b>, 1997, about his search for a missing father and how he finds himself and the nation&rsquo;s legacy of war. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The experience of Brocka&rsquo;s generation of filmmakers can be summarized simply: freedom can be found away from the center of the mainstream and that is the space where better films can be made. Certainly, commercialism is there to stay. The question, as Ishmael Bernal once posed, is how far is one willing to compromise? Where is the threshold of compromise? The works of the present post-Brocka generation of filmmakers, in general, seem to indicate that they have pushed the boundaries of compromise to the detriment of their art. The lure of commerce seems more and more difficult to refuse. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">The industry went into a slump once again in the 1990s. But the situation was quite different from the tight situations in the past that the industry had gone through. The slump during the post-studio years in the 1960s was more a problem with the quality of the films rather than with economics per se. During that period, there was a mad rush of non-studio producers; production, in fact, increased; theaters, which used to be exclusive for English-language movies, opened their doors to local productions; consequently, a wider audience was developed. The problem during that period was the lack of quality control that was de rigueur under the major studios. On the other hand, the slump in the 1990s was caused by uncertainty and overall economic dislocation after the downfall of the Marcos regime, coupled with the disenchantment with the succeeding administration. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The decline in the industry in the 1990s was caused by a variety of reasons. Hollywood movies offered stronger competition than before with its grand concept films; the country was now wired to cable television that offered nonstop popular movies; piracy had made CDs and DVDs available at low costs, killing the video rental business and drastically cutting down attendance in the movie theaters; movies could be downloaded on the Internet; moreover, most film actors, because of the slump in moviemaking, crossed over to television, making themselves overexposed in a medium that is accessible to erstwhile moviegoers. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Fortunately, the advent of digital filmmaking technology toward the end of the millennium opened a wealth of possibilities outside the industry. With accessible shooting and editing equipment, younger filmmakers were able to do their thing outside the industry, experimenting with the medium, questioning the conventions with their alternative ways of storytelling and dealing with subjects that the mainstream dare not touch. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a> was one prolific filmmaker who did short films at this time with the new digital technology, which he announced as &ldquo;filmless films.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\">Jon Red</a>, brother of Raymond, was able to make feature-length movies, like <b><i>Still Lives</i></b>, 1999, a crime film that experiments with long takes; and <b><i>ASTIGmatism</i></b>, 2004, an experiment on the point-of-view camera, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\">Robin Padilla</a>. Discovering that films with atrociously low budgets could be made, mainstream companies, especially <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>, offered young filmmakers to do bold movies in exchange for the chance to break into the industry. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Balahibong Pusa </i></b>(Cat&rsquo;s Fur), 2001, Quark Henares&rsquo;s <b><i>Gamitan </i></b>(Manipulation), 2002, and Robert Quebral&rsquo;s <b><i>Sex Drive</i></b>, 2003, are some of these films produced cheaply. At this time, Filipino-American filmmakers, like Francisco Aliwalas with <b><i>Disoriented</i></b>, 1999, and Gene Cajayon with <b><i>The Debut</i></b>, 2000, also made their presence felt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">In July 2005, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</a> opened at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>. The festival provided grants to a new breed of filmmakers to make their debut full-length films. Cinemalaya gave a boost to independent filmmaking and focused attention on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/20/1054\"><b>alternative cinema</b></a>. Soon, more festivals opened, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals</a> in late 2005, Cinema Rehiyon Film Festival in 2006, and CineFilipino Film Festival in 2013. Presently, more festivals are held annually in various regions of the country.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">There are so many young, indie filmmakers, too many to enumerate. Some of these filmmakers of the digital age are Adolfo Alix Jr, who did 23 feature films in a span of 10 years after his debut film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1154\"><strong>Donsol</strong></a></i></b>, 2006; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4537\">Raya Martin</a>, whose film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1190\"><strong>Independencia</strong></a> </i></b>(Independence), 2009,<i> </i>made waves in some international film festivals; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5792\">Alvin Yapan</a>, with his literary and literate pieces like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1285\"><strong>Ang Sayaw ng Dalawang Kaliwang Paa</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Dance of Two Left Feet</i></b>), 2011. There are<b><i> </i></b>documentary filmmakers, too&mdash;notably, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4317\">Ditsi Carolino</a>, who is known for her advocacy films like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1235\"><strong>Minsan Lang Sila Bata</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Children Only Once</i></b>), 1996, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1134\"><strong>Bunso</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Youngest</i></b>), 2005; Coreen Jimenez and Mario Cornejo who made the controversial <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1203\"><strong>Kano: An American and His Harem</strong></a></i></b>, 2010; Ramona Diaz, a Fil-American filmmaker, who introduced herself to the Filipino audience with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><b><i>Imelda</i></b></a>, 2003, her portrait of former First Lady Imelda Marcos; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4359\">Sari Dalena</a>, with her experimental documentary portraits like <b><i>The Guerilla Is a Poet</i></b>, 2013,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Dahlin&rsquo; Nick</i></b>, 2015<i>.</i> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\">Digital technology also made possible the rebirth of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/20/1057\">regional cinema</a>&nbsp;from north to south of the country. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>, aka Kanakan Balintagos, returned to his indigenous roots for inspiration with a film like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1136\"><strong>Busong</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Palawan Fate</i></b>), 2011.

The industry survives with outsourcing services. The Animation Council of the Philippines organizes Animahenasyon, the annual animation film festival that provides a venue for the works of Filipino animators.

Diaz and Mendoza are the seniors of this generation of independent filmmakers. Diaz is well-known in international festivals with his long, brooding films like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1157\"><strong>Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Pilipino</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Evolution of a Filipino Family</i></b>), 2004, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1250\">Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan</a> </i></b>(<b><i>Norte, The End of History</i></b>), 2013.

That the Filipino film industry has produced only a handful of works of enduring interest and value may disappoint the film historian who approaches the industry without understanding the relevant context. It is therefore important to note that the beginnings of the industry arose not from a local felt need but from the initiative of foreign entrepreneurs. In this way, the problems of the Filipino film industry vis-&#xE0;-vis its counterpart in the West, particularly the United States, can be better appreciated. Two Swiss entrepreneurs introduced film shows in Manila as early as 1897, regaling audiences with documentary film clips showing recent events and natural calamities in Europe. At this time, the Filipinos were waging a revolutionary war against the colonial rule of Spain."

Here was material close to Filipinos, subject matter guaranteeing ticket sales."

It was a time of rapid growth in the technology of filmmaking. Enormous capital was needed so the industry could keep up with Hollywood in the employment of new equipment. Investors with the required capital were hard to come by. Consequently, up-to-date technical polish in local films was an ideal all but impossible to attain. Similarly, generous investment was needed to make quality pictures, and in the absence of unlimited capital, filmmakers had to be content with what was deemed <i>puwede na </i>(passable). These two problems&#x2014;expensive technology and inadequate capital&#x2014;haunted the early producers and continue to haunt present-day filmmakers."

It was the master director Gerardo de Leon who gave the two Rizal classics consummate artistic treatment by turning both into award-winning films in the 1960s. Aside from their narratives, the Rizal novels also gave to Filipino movies distinctive character types like Maria Clara, Sisa, Elias, Padre Damaso, Do&#xF1;a Victorina, and, of course, Crisostomo Ibarra and Simon. Indicative of the pervasive influence of Rizal is the fact that each time scriptwriters dip into the Spanish past for themes, the struggle of the Filipinos for reforms under Spanish colonialism as portrayed in the <b><i>Noli</i></b><i> </i>and the <b><i>Fili</i></b><i> </i>never fails to be evoked and even recreated."

Among his notable works are the romance drama <b><i>May Minamahal </i></b>(<b><i>Loving Someone</i></b>), 1993, and his teen film <b><i>Pare Ko </i></b>(Hey, Dude), 1995. <a href=\"/4/26/4681\">Carlos Siguion-Reyna</a> made melodramas like <b><i>Inagaw Mo ang Lahat sa Akin </i></b>(<b><i><strong>Harvest</strong> Home</i></b>), 1995,<i> </i>a story of incest in a rural setting; and <b><i><strong> <strong>Ligaya</strong> ang Itawag Mo sa Akin</strong> </i> </b>(<b><i>They Call Me Joy</i></b>), 1997, about a prostitute&#x2019;s attempt to lead a new life amidst the hypocrisies of society. <a href=\"/4/26/4497\">Olive Lamasan</a> and <a href=\"/4/26/4612\">Rory Quintos</a> are both in-house directors of <a href=\"/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a>. Lamasan made <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1278\"><strong>Sana Maulit Muli</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Second Chances</i></b>), 1995, the story of two lovers who try to recapture the past,<i> </i>and <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1219\"><strong>Madrasta</strong></a> </i></b>(<em><strong>Stepmother</strong></em>), 1996, about the travails of a stepmother played by &#x201C;megastar&#x201D; <a href=\"/4/26/4357\">Sharon Cuneta</a>. Quintos directed <b><i>Mangarap Ka </i></b>(Dream On), 1995, a feel-good story of a young man&#x2019;s triumph in track and field against all odds;<b><i>Sa Aking mga Kamay </i></b>(In My Hands), 1996, a thriller involving a serial killer played by matinee idol <a href=\"/4/26/4563\">Aga Muhlach</a>; and <em><strong><a href=\"/4/24/1103\">Anak</a></strong> </em> (The Child), 2000, a drama abouta mother&apos;s struggle to reconnect with her children after years of working as a domestic helper in Hong Kong. <a href=\"/4/26/4540\">Erik Matti</a>, the most visual director among this group of filmmakers, rode on the success and controversy of Gallaga&#x2019;s 1985 <b><i>Scorpio Nights</i></b> by making <b><i>Scorpio Nights 2</i></b>, 1997, with less daring than the original, while <b><i>Pedro Penduko II, The Return of the Come Back</i></b>, 2000, is a comedic detour from his earlier excursions into the sex movie genre.</span>"

Production companies, because of greater competition from global cinemas, specifically Hollywood, cut down on their risks by drastically reducing their investments. <a href=\"/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a>, for example, instituted a program of low-budget movies called <b>pito-pito</b><i> </i>(literally, seven-seven). The idea was to churn out a movie with seven days of shooting and seven days of postproduction at a very low budget of below 100,000 US dollars. Although the seven-day shoot was not strictly followed, new filmmakers who saw an opportunity to break into the industry bought into this scheme, like <a href=\"/4/26/4485\">Jeffrey Jeturian</a> who came up with <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1279\"><strong>Sana Pag-ibig Na</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Enter Love</i></b>), 1998, a simple but sensitive treatment of a young man&#x2019;s discovery of his father&#x2019;s love affair, and <a href=\"/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a> who did <b><i>Serafin Geronimo: Ang Kriminal ng Barrio Concepcion </i></b>(<b><i>The Criminal of Barrio Concepcion</i></b>), 1998, an exploration into violence, guilt, and love.</span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">By the 1990s, it was clear that three major companies dominated the industry: Regal, Viva, and Seiko. In 1995, another major company would offer competition&#x2014;Star Cinema, an affiliate of the <a href=\"/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> television network. The dominance of these companies discouraged the entry of other production companies. From 1990 to 1999, the industry produced an average of 141 movies a year. In the first half of the new millennium, the average went down to 82 per year. Later, the industry could hardly produce 50 movies per year. At this time, Star Cinema became the dominant production company, mainly because of its affiliation with the ABS-CBN television network. Seiko disappeared from the scene; Regal and Viva usually co-produced with Star Cinema to take advantage of its television network that they would need to boost the marketing of their films. GMA Films, an affiliate of television network GMA 7, also became a major player in the industry.</span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">There were other filmmakers who worked along the periphery of the industry, if not totally outside the mainstream. Raymond Red, who made waves in international festivals with his experimental Super 8 films in the 1980s, made his presence known with two historical films: <b><i>Bayani</i></b> (Hero), 1992, his take on the inner character of the supremo of the revolutionaries, and <a href=\"/4/24/1276\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>, 1993, a study on the last of the revolutionaries. Frustrated by developments in the industry, he made another short film, financing the project himself, and came up with <b><a href=\"/4/24/1105\"><i><strong>Ani</strong>no</i></a> </b>(Shadow), 2000, a 10-minute film that was awarded the Palme d&#x2019;Or in the short film category of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. Nick Deocampo continued to make documentaries, notably <b><i>Private Wars</i></b>, 1997, about his search for a missing father and how he finds himself and the nation&#x2019;s legacy of war. </span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The experience of Brocka&#x2019;s generation of filmmakers can be summarized simply: freedom can be found away from the center of the mainstream and that is the space where better films can be made. Certainly, commercialism is there to stay. The question, as Ishmael Bernal once posed, is how far is one willing to compromise? Where is the threshold of compromise? The works of the present post-Brocka generation of filmmakers, in general, seem to indicate that they have pushed the boundaries of compromise to the detriment of their art. The lure of commerce seems more and more difficult to refuse. </span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">The industry went into a slump once again in the 1990s. But the situation was quite different from the tight situations in the past that the industry had gone through. The slump during the post-studio years in the 1960s was more a problem with the quality of the films rather than with economics per se. During that period, there was a mad rush of non-studio producers; production, in fact, increased; theaters, which used to be exclusive for English-language movies, opened their doors to local productions; consequently, a wider audience was developed. The problem during that period was the lack of quality control that was de rigueur under the major studios. On the other hand, the slump in the 1990s was caused by uncertainty and overall economic dislocation after the downfall of the Marcos regime, coupled with the disenchantment with the succeeding administration. </span>"

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The decline in the industry in the 1990s was caused by a variety of reasons. Hollywood movies offered stronger competition than before with its grand concept films; the country was now wired to cable television that offered nonstop popular movies; piracy had made CDs and DVDs available at low costs, killing the video rental business and drastically cutting down attendance in the movie theaters; movies could be downloaded on the Internet; moreover, most film actors, because of the slump in moviemaking, crossed over to television, making themselves overexposed in a medium that is accessible to erstwhile moviegoers. </span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Fortunately, the advent of digital filmmaking technology toward the end of the millennium opened a wealth of possibilities outside the industry. With accessible shooting and editing equipment, younger filmmakers were able to do their thing outside the industry, experimenting with the medium, questioning the conventions with their alternative ways of storytelling and dealing with subjects that the mainstream dare not touch. <a href=\"/4/26/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a> was one prolific filmmaker who did short films at this time with the new digital technology, which he announced as &#x201C;filmless films.&#x201D; <a href=\"/4/26/4622\">Jon Red</a>, brother of Raymond, was able to make feature-length movies, like <b><i>Still Lives</i></b>, 1999, a crime film that experiments with long takes; and <b><i>ASTIGmatism</i></b>, 2004, an experiment on the point-of-view camera, starring <a href=\"/4/26/4583\">Robin Padilla</a>. Discovering that films with atrociously low budgets could be made, mainstream companies, especially <a href=\"/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>, offered young filmmakers to do bold movies in exchange for the chance to break into the industry. <a href=\"/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Balahibong Pusa </i></b>(Cat&#x2019;s Fur), 2001, Quark Henares&#x2019;s <b><i>Gamitan </i></b>(Manipulation), 2002, and Robert Quebral&#x2019;s <b><i>Sex Drive</i></b>, 2003, are some of these films produced cheaply. At this time, Filipino-American filmmakers, like Francisco Aliwalas with <b><i>Disoriented</i></b>, 1999, and Gene Cajayon with <b><i>The Debut</i></b>, 2000, also made their presence felt.</span>"

Since its beginnings in the early 1900s, film has fascinated Filipino audiences, which have grown larger and more appreciative and enthusiastic through the years. When the theater network and the studio system were finally in place, it easily became the most popular medium. Its stars were the arbiters of fashion; its stories were the thoughts and dreams of a country. Its influence was not only in culture but also in politics, business, and the development of a national language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"early\" name=\"early\"></a>The Early Films </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Experimentations in moving pictures were introduced in Europe as early as 1877, but it was only in 1895 that film projection became a reality with the first screening of the Lumi&egrave;re film taken with the cin&eacute;matographe. In that same year, Manila had its first electric plant installed with the help of Japanese technicians. The new energy source prompted astute entrepreneurs to import the electrical contraptions. In 1896, La Estrella del Norte ordered from France a 60mm Gaumont chronophotographe with sound amplifiers for a businessman, a Se&ntilde;or Pertierra. Se&ntilde;or Pertierra presented a program that was billed as <b><i>Espetaculo Cientifico de Pertierra</i></b><i> </i>(Pertierra&rsquo;s Scientific Show) on 8 Jan 1897 in his salon at No. 12 Escolta. However, this turned out to be merely a presentation of stills and chronophotographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first real cinematograph was brought in by two Swiss entrepreneurs, Leibman and Peritz. On 18 Sep 1897, they introduced the Lumi&egrave;re cinematograph along with several Lumi&egrave;re films. Music was provided by a quintet under the direction of Prof Francisco P. de Barbat. As in Pertierra&rsquo;s salon, ticket prices were steep, with first-class seats selling at two pesos and second class at one peso. Only the Spaniards and their wealthy native friends could afford admission; even then, the natives were permitted to buy only the second-class tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Reactions to the films were varied, ranging from awe to consternation, but generally audiences were enthralled by the new invention&rsquo;s ability to record reality. However, because of the Spanish-American War and the absence of a distribution network, the movie business did not flourish. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another exhibitor was Antonio Ramos, a Spanish officer from Barcelona. In 1898, he showed his collection of films to Manila audiences. When he ran out of titles, he decided to shoot Manila street scenes of less than a minute each: <b><i>Escenas Callejeras</i></b><i> </i>(Street Scenes), <b><i>Fiesta de Quiapo</i></b><i> </i>(Quiapo Fiesta), and <b><i>Panorama de Manila</i></b><i> </i>(Manila Panorama). Apparently, he was the first to shoot moving pictures in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Americans sailed into Manila Bay in 1898, Admiral George Dewey brought along not only troops of soldiers but also cameramen to record daily life in a country that was to become an American colony. These early films were copyrighted in the Library of Congress in the form of paper prints (or rolls of photographic paper that had the negative imprint of the films). In the 1950s, a restoration project transferred these paper prints onto celluloid. Thus, we are able to watch these early films about the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Paper Print Collection in the US Library of Congress consists of films that are recreations of scenes of the Philippine-American War and actualities that were shot in the Philippines. These films, mostly running at less than a minute each, were produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. The Edison films in this collection are mostly recreated scenes. The titles include <b><i>US Troops and Red Cross in the Trenches before Caloocan</i></b>,<b><i> Advance of Kansas Volunteers at Caloocan</i></b>,<b><i> Filipinos Retreat from Trenches</i></b>,<b><i> Rout of the Filipinos</i></b>,<b><i> Capture of Trenches at Candaba</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Colonel Funston Swimming the Bagbag River</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>The Biograph films, on the other hand, were actually shot in the Philippines&mdash;for example, <b><i>The Escolta Bridge Traffic</i></b>,<b><i> Unloading Lighters (At the Government Docks)</i></b>, <b><i>Water Buffalo</i></b>,<b><i> A Filipino Cockfight</i></b>,<b><i> 25th Infantry</i></b>,<b><i> Pack Train, Gen. Bell&rsquo;s Expedition</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Battle of Mount Arayat</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>The Biograph Company also made a dramatized film, the three-part <b><i>The American Soldier in Love and War </i></b>in which the natives are represented as savages in the jungle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1905, a visiting cameraman of the Edison Manufacturing Company, Herbert Wyndham, shot a series of scenes at the Manila Fire Department. The short showed the mayor of Manila, a Mr Brown, turning on a fire alarm and the fire trucks responding to the call. Shots of the Tanduay station showed in detail how firemen prepare for a fire. This was the first edited film made in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">However, movies did not prosper until 1909. Except for a brief period in 1905, screenings were too few and far between. </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">If any new films arrived, these were usually shown as the entr&rsquo;acte<i> </i>in vaudeville shows or as carnival sideshows. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At around this time, traveling cinematographs with small electric motors were introduced. Tents were set up similar to those used by circuses while barkers coaxed largely skeptical provincial crowds to watch the show. At that time, since media advertisements were still unknown, publicity was solely the task of these so-called ballyhoo people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1909, a theater network was put in place. With a distribution company based in Singapore, the Path&eacute; Freres supplied films and projectors. There was competition among entrepreneurs to open the first movie house in the Philippines after a lull of many years. Albert Yearsley converted the Orpheum, a pioneer vaudeville house, into the Empire, the first of a theater network. No sooner had he announced its opening than Goullete and Teaque inaugurated the Anda Theater a day before. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a> were also fitted with projectors and, for a time, were operated as movie houses. With a distribution network in place, the next step was the production of local features. Before 1909, only visiting filmmakers shot movies in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Albert Yearsley became the first resident to shoot local films. On 30 Dec 1909, he shot the Rizal Day celebration at the Luneta (later known as Rizal Park), which was shown in April of the following year. This was followed by shots of the Manila Carnival of 1910; the eruption of Taal Volcano in 1911; the first airplane flight over Manila by flyer Bud Mars during the Manila Carnival of 1911; the Tondo, Pandacan, and Paco fires of 1911; the trip of the Igorots to Barcelona; and the Cebu typhoon of 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"silent\" name=\"silent\"></a>The Silent Features</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1912, there was yet another race to film the first feature. Producer Harry Brown, cinematographer Charles Martin, and scenarist Edward Gross organized the Rizalina Photoplay Company and produced <b><i>La Vida de <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b><i> </i>(The Life of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), a film 5,000 ft in length and with 22 scenes. It begins with a view of the Philippines prior to Rizal&rsquo;s birth and traces his career through Europe, his exile in Dapitan, his imprisonment in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, and his martyrdom at Bagumbayan. The film, based on Edward Gross&rsquo;s 1905 stage play, starred his wife <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3104\">Titay Molina</a> as Maria Clara, the famous actor Chananay as Rizal&rsquo;s mother, and Tagalog writer Honorio Lopez as Jose Rizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But just as announcements for its opening were splashed all over the newspapers, Albert Yearsley took <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2973\">Gran Compa&ntilde;ia de la Zarzuela Tagala</a> to the Cementerio del Norte and shot <b><i>El Fusilamiento de Dr. Jose Rizal</i></b><i> </i>(The Shooting of Dr Jose Rizal). Consisting of only one scene of 500 ft and shot in one day, the film was shown on 22 Aug 1912, a day ahead of Gross&rsquo;s film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both films did well at the box office. The two film companies were encouraged to produce other features. Nationalism was running at fever pitch during this period. Events of the previous decade, such as the expulsion of the Spaniards, the ratification of the Malolos Constitution, the Philippine-American War and the massacres of Filipinos, were still fresh in the people&rsquo;s minds. The filmmakers, despite being Americans, cashed in on the prevailing sentiments of the native population and produced films with historical themes. Unfortunately, their efforts met with resistance from the censors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gross, Brown, and Martin shot <b><i>Los Tres Martires</i></b><i> </i>(The Three Martyrs) in 1912, a film on the martyr priests Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora. The censors excised the execution scene on the grounds that it might foment unrest in the Spanish community. Similarly, Albert Yearsley&rsquo;s film of the <i>sarsuwela <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></b> </i>(No Wounds), 1912, was withdrawn after 11 days of screening. Another Gross, Brown, and Martin film, <b><i>La Conquista de Filipinas de Legazpi</i></b><i> </i>(The Conquest of the Philippines by Legazpi), 1913, had more luck; it passed the censors despite the dissenting vote of a Captain Scott who objected to the violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1915, Edward Gross realized his lifelong dream of filming Rizal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b></a><i> </i>(Touch Me Not) and then <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Subversion), 1916, budgeted at 25,000 pesos, a huge sum in those days. Both films ran to over two hours, with <b><i>Fili</i></b><i> </i>composed of two parts. Again Gross&rsquo;s wife, Titay Molina, starred as Maria Clara; in part two of the <b><i>Fili</i></b>,<i> </i>she appeared at every screening and sang the &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; to the accompaniment of a harp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Luis Camas, owner of Sirena Theater, formed the Sirena Moving Company in 1915. He shot newsreels like <b><i>Bullfight in Manila</i></b>,<i> </i>1915; <b><i>Burial of Hon. Benito Legarda</i></b>,<i> </i>1916; and <b><i>The Opening of La Casa de Espa&ntilde;a</i></b>,<i> </i>1917. He experimented with mixing film and live performances. <b><i>The Apache Waltz</i></b>,<i> </i>1917, started with film clips of Manila streets and ended with the Pons quartet on the stage of the theater. Two other such experiments were <b><i>Urgent Telegram</i></b>,<i> </i>1917, and <b><i>La Purga de Suarez</i></b> (The Purge of Suarez),<i> </i>1917.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nonhistorical films finally made their bow in 1916. Gross produced <b><i>Nena la Boxeadora</i></b><i> </i>(Nena the Boxer) with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4712\">Maria Tronqued</a> in the title role. The plot revolves around Nena de la Cruz, a champion athlete, who borrows money <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">from the town usurer when her father gets sick. In case of failure to pay, she pledges her services as a servant. As the debt becomes due, Nena, in desperation, accepts the offer of </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">a boxing match with a Manila champion prizefighter. As an added feature, Gross shot a short, <b><i>Enchong Laway</i></b>,<i> </i>on the life of the famous spit doctor of Para&ntilde;aque. Gross&rsquo;s perennial rival, Albert Yearsley, focused his cinematic efforts on sensational events in the country. In 1914, he shot the trial of noted criminal Eusebio Borja, who was convicted of murder and theft. Yearsley&rsquo;s filming, however, provoked an outcry from the newspapers, and the movie was never shown. The American colonizers found film to be a lucrative investment. Their objective was to make as much money in the islands and then go home. The first features had historical themes, movies that would be considered inimical to any colonial government but sensational in the box office. Despite its success, the first wave of filmmaking soon collapsed as the American filmmakers returned to the United States. By the time the United States entered World War I in 1917, the trauma of the Philippine-American War had run its course. Filipinos began to assert themselves<i> </i>in the political, cultural, and economic spheres and learned the language and art forms of their colonizers. With the American entrepreneurs returning to their home country, the time was ripe for local talent to make its mark. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"made\" name=\"made\"></a>The Early Filipino-Made Films</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first Filipino to try his hand at filmmaking was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, owner of a popular photo studio, the Electro-Parhelio. He bought the equipment of the Rizalina Film Company and first busied himself as a news cameraman, shooting the funeral of Do&ntilde;a Estefania Veloso de Osme&ntilde;a, the first wife of then Speaker of the National Assembly Sergio Osme&ntilde;a; a series on Filipino industries; and the Filipino reaction to Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s victory in the American presidential elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1919, he directed <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Country Maiden), a film version of the <em><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\">sarsuwela</a></em> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>. It starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a>, who, following Titay Molina&rsquo;s example, sang the songs live on the theater stage. The film, which was shot in two parts&mdash;the second part was titled <b><i>La Venganza de Don Silvestre</i></b><i> </i>(The Vengeance of Don Silvestre)&mdash;and shown a month apart, is about a barrio maid who is forced by her parents to marry a rich old man, but she outwits the old man by eloping with her boyfriend, a law student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nepomuceno also directed <b><i>Hoy o Nunca Besame</i></b><i> </i>(Now or Never Kiss Me) and <b><i>Un Capullo Marchito</i></b><i> </i>(A Withered Bud) in 1920. In 1921, a fire swept his studio and he was forced to sell his equipment. Nepomuceno was not the only Filipino drawn to the craft of filmmaking. The attempts of a few made it plain that Filipinos still had a lot of learning to do. Faustino Lichauco started <b><i>Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</i></b><i> </i>but had to stop halfway through the shooting; Claudio Briones and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4532\">Ricardo Marcelino</a> quarreled on the set of <b><i>Piping Saksi</i></b><i> </i>(Mute Witness) and the film was shelved. From 1919 to 1921, two events served to publicize the magic of film and entice more Filipinos to the craft. In 1919, Universal Studios filmed episodes of a Hollywood movie in Intramuros, Para&ntilde;aque, and Pagsanjan. The shooting of &ldquo;The 7th Petal of Lao-Tze,&rdquo;<i> </i>an episode in <b><i>The Dragon&rsquo;s Net</i></b>, 1920,<i> </i>directed by Henry McRae with a top Hollywood star, Marie Walcamp, drew crowds everywhere. In 1922, Elena Jurado came home after appearing in two Hollywood films: <b><i>White Hands</i></b><i> </i>with Hobart Bosworth and <b><i>Four Flushers</i></b><i>. </i>Along with her producers, she was feted by many civic organizations and media groups, including <b><i>The Philippines Herald</i></b>.<i> </i>Plans to shoot a number of films in the Philippines were<i> </i>announced, but these never<i> </i>materialized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">By the 1920s, film had woven its magic on the masses and became the most popular art form. Hollywood beckoned Ricardo Marcelino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>, Eduardo de Castro, Salvador Tinsay, Cecilio Joaquin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4241\">Richard Abelardo</a>, and Nick Osme&ntilde;a, and they either traveled as regular passengers or worked as ship musicians or janitors in order to get to Hollywood. They returned years later to make their mark in Philippine cinema.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1926, fresh from Hollywood, Vicente Salumbides revived Filipino filmmaking with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1238\"><strong>Miracles of Love</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>starring Hermogenes Ilagan, Dimples Cooper, and the director himself. Jose Nepomuceno was his cameraman and laboratory man. <b><i>Miracles of Love</i></b><i> </i>tells the story of a doctor who falls in love with the heroine&rsquo;s picture in a magazine. He enters the service of her family as a servant. The heroine is being forced to marry a rich old man and confides her problems to the servant-doctor, who expresses his love for her. They decide to elope and the family gives chase. All ends well when the hero&rsquo;s true identity is revealed. Encouraged by the success of <b><i>Miracles of Love</i></b>,<i> </i>Jose Nepomuceno directed two films: <b><i>Ang Tatlong Hambog</i></b><i> </i>(The Three Braggarts), 1926, and <b><i>The Miracles of Our Lady of <strong>Antipolo</strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1926. By 1930, he was producing five films a year, more than half the output of local silent cinema. A rich source of Jose Nepomuceno&rsquo;s movies was vernacular novels whose themes delved into Filipino values and problems. In <b><i>Nanay Ko</i></b><i> </i>(My Mother), 1929, a child is oppressed by a cruel stepmother. In <b><i>Sa Landas ng Pag-ibig</i></b><i> </i>(The Path of Love), 1929, a woman chooses between a life of wealth gained through corruption and a poor, simple life with an honest man. In <b><i><strong>Ligaw na Bulaklak</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Wildflower), 1932, an orphan of unknown parentage tries to assert herself amidst the hypocrisies of the times. This proved to be so popular that a sequel followed, <b><i>Lantang Bulaklak</i></b><i> </i>(Withered Flower), 1932, the story of the disgraced mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose Nepomuceno also produced <b><i>Moro Pirates</i></b>,<i> </i>1931, which featured the vinta racing against the wind and clashes between Muslims and Christians. He also directed horror movies using Christian symbols and native folklore like <b><i>Tiyanak </i></b>(Changeling), 1932, and <b><i>Mang Tano: Nuno ng mga Aswang</i></b><i> </i>(Old Man Tano: Aswang Ancestor), 1932, as well as films with nationalist themes like <b><i>Daughters of the Revolution</i></b>,<i> </i>1931.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite a cautious start a decade earlier, Philippine cinema was hitting its stride. Seven films were made in 1929, nine in 1930, nine in 1931, and 23 in 1932, the last year of the silents. The sudden increase can be explained by several factors. Jose Nepomuceno had by this time recovered his losses from the fires that struck his studio and, with the help of stockholder-friends, was producing a film almost every two months. Filipinos who had left to visit or work in Hollywood were returning home and setting up film companies. In addition, Americans who were trying to escape the severe depression in the United States came to the Philippines to seek their fortune in filmmaking.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filmmakers other than Salumbides and Nepomuceno started to appear in 1929. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4526\">Julian Manansala</a> directed <b><i>Patria Amore</i></b><i> </i>(Beloved Country), 1929, and Arthur Matthews did the first filmization of Severino Reyes&rsquo;s popular sarsuwela <b><i>Minda Mora</i></b>,<i> </i>1929. In 1930, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a> made their debuts, followed by Ernesto Lopez in 1931; Salvador Tinsay, Eduardo de Castro, and Agapito Conchu in 1932; and Brigida Perez Villanueva, the first woman filmmaker, in 1933. Also during this time, the star system became more apparent. A newspaper article noted that audiences were beginning to relate to a small group of actors, a trend that culminated in a phenomenon where an actor could singlehandedly determine the box-office success or failure of a movie. Among the first stars of Philippine cinema were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4736\">Mary Walter</a>, Naty Fernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\">Gregorio Fernandez</a>, Maggie Calloway, and Nora Linda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abandoned by the Americans, film production during these years was taken over by Filipinos. However, they did not have the technical sophistication to compete with foreign productions. Several Filipinos went to Hollywood to learn the craft. After a number of fits and starts, silent filmmaking became an industry in the late 1920s. A firmament of stars became recognized. However, this phase would soon be overtaken by a major event&mdash;the advent of sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"talkies\" name=\"talkies\"></a>The Talkies</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sound or what passed for it took Manila by storm in the late 1920s. Ironically, the advent of sound was also silent cinema&rsquo;s most fecund period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 3 Aug 1929, Radio Theater presented the first talkie, Fred Waring&rsquo;s <b><i>Pennsylvanian Syncopation</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>This was achieved by synchronizing phonograph records with the film. The sound was faint and muffled in parts. As expected, the audience complained. The real thing, however, was not long in coming. On 12 Oct 1929, Leon Britton, a British engineer, arrived in Manila with 35 cases of equipment and 35,000 ft of film. The next day, he presented a program of optically recorded sound films at the Lyric Theater: <b><i><strong>Rainbow</strong> Man</i></b>, <b><i>Steamboat Bill</i></b>, <b><i>The Marionettes at the Opera</i></b>, and <b><i>A Trip to the London Zoo</i></b>. Talkie fever gripped Manila at once, thanks to Britton and his films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino films dubbed live behind the screen by stage actors were advertised as talkies. The price of sound equipment was prohibitive by Filipino standards; it would take a few more years to import and master the technology. Despite these limitations, however, Filipino cinema took off and became the country&rsquo;s most popular entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 4 Mar 1930, Carlos Vander Tolosa came out with his first film, <b><i>Collegian Love</i></b>, the first Filipino film to be synchronized with phonograph records. It proved to be immensely popular. By then, the competition to produce the first optically recorded talkie was underway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two years after Tolosa&rsquo;s debut film, filmmakers were still struggling with the new technology. JoseNepomuceno advertised his film <b><i>Sa Pinto ng Langit </i></b>(At Heaven&rsquo;s Gate), 1932, as the first talkie, but this turned out to be mere publicity hype. Then visiting Hollywood director Arthur Thompson announced that he was shooting a sound film with Virginia Spencer, cousin of Hollywood star Belle Bennett. A Filipino-American, Jessie Matthews, who worked with Cecil B. DeMille in Hollywood, set up Paragon Pictures. However, Matthews only got to finish his sound film <b><i>Dinukot </i></b>(Kidnapped) in 1934.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first film made in the Philippines to feature optically recorded sound was George Musser&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Aswang </i></b>(The Vampire). In 1932, Musser imported 50,000 pesos worth of optical sound equipment and turned his house into a studio, with Charles Miller as his cinematographer and William Smith as his sound technician. He spent a year shooting <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b>, which, despite its Tagalog title, was actually a film in Spanish and English. The film finally opened to great acclaim at the Lyric Theater on 1 Jan 1933. Unfortunately, its sound was sometimes out of sync and inaudible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the same year, two Americans, George Harris and Eddie Tait, embarked on a plan to make Manila the film capital of Asia. Using Manila as their base, they would produce films not only for the Philippines but also for Indonesia, Malaysia, and China. Their initial venture, a partnership with Jose Nepomuceno, attached soundtracks to Nepomuceno&rsquo;s half-finished films: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\">Punyal na Ginto</a> </i></b>(Golden Dagger), <b><i>Makata at</i></b> <b><i><strong>Paraluman</strong> </i></b>(The Poet and the Muse), <b><i>Dr. Kuba </i></b>(Dr Hunchback) and <b><i>Children of the Philippines</i></b>, 1933. To help with sound technology, they engaged the services of Leon Britton, the British engineer, who returned to Manila with three technicians: Jack Smith, Louis Morse, and John Lund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Encouraged by the response of the market, Eddie Tait and George Harris set up their own company, FilippineFilms. The duo&rsquo;s vision was grand. Using Hollywood studios as their model, they put up separate departments for each filmmaking stage or operation, set a quota of films to be produced each year, and with the help of Frank Capra brought in a new batch of technicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The company&rsquo;s first film, <b><i>Ang Mga Ulila </i></b>(The Orphans), 1933, about a family shipwrecked in Mindoro, is a takeoff on <b><i>King Kong</i></b>, 1933.<i> </i>It was advertised as having pythons and gorillas, parachute jumps, and other thrills. Their second venture, <b><i>Mag-inang Mahirap </i></b>(Destitute Mother and Child), 1934, employed local talents, including director ManuelSilos who made his sound film debut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All in all, the transition to sound was shaky. Foreign films had optical soundtracks and were drawing away audiences from local cinema. Live dubbing and phonograph records were resorted to but these were considered inadequate. Finally, two American businessmen brought in the sophisticated technology at considerable expense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"studios\" name=\"studios\"></a>The Studios</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 20 Nov 1933, Harris and Tait invited high government officals to the inauguration of the first sound stage. This was the beginning of the studio system in the Philippines. The pair was responsible for other firsts in Philippine cinema. In 1935, they started the first color laboratory with Paul Perry as supervisor. However, the facility was limited to the production of shorts and news features. Also, in the same year, in collaboration with DMHM Radio, they started the first newsreel service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Harris and Tait&rsquo;s ultimate goal, however, was the world market. In 1936, they started the production of a film they hoped would give them a foothold in that market. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> </i></b>was shown all over the United States before its Manila run in 1937. While it achieved a measure of success, no plans were made for a follow-up. Three years later, Harris and Tait sold their interests to Filipino entrepreneur J. Amado Araneta. George Harris died in a car accident in 1940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The success of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a> encouraged Filipino filmmakers and businessmen to compete with Harris and Tait. Jose Nepomuceno reorganized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4524\">Malayan Pictures Corporation</a> into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a> in 1935. Its first film, <b><i>Diwata ng Karagatan</i></b> (Goddess of the Sea), touted as having been edited in Paris, was shown the following year. But trouble was brewing in Parlatone. Before the year was over, Nepomuceno was ousted by Raymundo Navarro in a bitter stockholders&rsquo; battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>, now the country&rsquo;s oldest existing studio, was formed in 1937 by Congressman Pedro Vera, with some prodding from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4574\">Luis Nolasco</a>. Its first film, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Bituing Marikit</strong> </strong> </i></b></a><i> </i>(Beautiful Star), 1937, was a huge success. It also marked the beginning of one of the most fruitful artistic collaborations ever seen in local movies, among scenarist Luis Nolasco, director Carlos Vander Tolosa, and musician <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\">Mike Velarde</a>, who created the most memorable <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><b>musicals</b></a> before the war: <b><i><strong>Nasaan Ka Irog?</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Where Are You, Beloved?), 1937, <b><i>Madaling Araw</i></b><i> </i>(Break of Dawn), 1938, and <b><i>Serenata sa Nayon</i></b><i> </i>(Country Serenade), 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Excelsior Pictures, considered the most modern studio at the time, was founded by Don Ramon Araneta in 1938. Its two sound stages had double walling, and its equipment was highly sophisticated. Its first film, <b><i><strong>Ang Maya</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(The Sparrow), 1938, featured gems from the opera and was directed by Jose Nepomuceno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, another major studio, was formed by three friends&mdash;Do&ntilde;a Narcisa &ldquo;Sisang&rdquo; de Leon, Carmen Villongco, and Eleuterio Navoa Jr&mdash;whose initials made up the name of the company. Its first film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(My Love), 1939, directed by Carlos Vander Tolosa, was a box-office hit. Unfortunately, its succeeding films did not do so well at the box office and Do&ntilde;a Sisang had to buy out the other stockholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose Nepomuceno, after his ouster from Parlatone in 1936, resurfaced with X&rsquo;Otic Films in 1939 with co-founders Jesus Cacho and Julian Salgado. X&rsquo;Otic&rsquo;s first production, <b><i>Punit na Bandila</i></b><i> </i>(Torn Flag), 1939, was a drama on the revolution of 1896 directed by Jose Nepomuceno. After the Pacific War, the firm was reorganized into Movietec. Some of its stockholders later joined forces with Rafael Anton and formed Lebran Films. Other studios that were established during this period were Cervantina Filipina Corporation, Del Monte Pictures, Waling-Waling Pictures, and Acu&ntilde;a-Zaldarriaga Productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Moviemaking proved to be a lucrative investment for cash-rich Filipinos. According to one executive, capitalization of 10,000 pesos brought in 50,000 pesos at the very least. The high return on investment lured more and more of Manila&rsquo;s elite into the new medium. Right before the outbreak of World War II in the country in 1941, the Philippine film industry was producing between 48 and 57 films a year. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">It was one of the great periods of Philippine cinema, with musicals, melodramas, horror movies, <b>South Sea dramas</b>, and films with a nationalist slant finding favor with the moviegoing public. The most outstanding, however, were movies on agrarian problems, folk narratives, revolutionary drama, and the sarsuwela. Two contemporary romances were the period&rsquo;s most successful films: Gregorio Fernandez&rsquo;s <b><i>Se&ntilde;orita</i></b><i> </i>(Young Mistress), 1940, and Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Maestra</i></b><i> </i>(The Teacher), 1941. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">It was also during this period that a new breed of directors who were to dominate the postwar era made their debut films. Former silent-screen star Gregorio Fernandez launched his directorial career with <b><i>Asahar at Kabaong</i></b><i> </i>(Bridal Garland and Casket) in 1937, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>R</strong> amon Estella</a> with <b><i>Bayan at Pag-ibig</i></b><i> </i>(Country and Love), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">Gerardo de Leon</a> with <b><i><strong> <strong>Bahay Kubo</strong> </strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Nipa Hut) in 1938, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1275\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a><i> </i>in 1939, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a> with <b><i>Sawing Gantimpala</i></b><i> </i>(Lost Victory), 1940. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\">Movie stars, too, became fixed in the firmament. With their drawing power, they became major players in the industry. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4577\">Elsa Oria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4464\">Lucita Goyena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4560\">Rosario Moreno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4402\">Mila del Sol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4582\">Jose Padilla Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4421\">Angel Esmeralda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4343\">Rudy Concepcion</a> were the period&rsquo;s top stars, commanding not only their studios&rsquo; solicitousness but also the public&rsquo;s adulation and patronage. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this era, Filipino films had become immensely popular with the moneyed class who invested heavily in the industry. There were several studios that sprang just before the war. Over 50 films were produced each year, making the film industry one of the most prodigious, considering the small population then. A local film culture was developing, which later would extend its reach into other fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"war\" name=\"war\"></a>The War Years </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Pacific War, as historians call that period of the global conflict that pitted Japan against the United States, initially proved to be a minor distraction to the film industry. The first bombs fell on Manila on 8 Dec 1941. Manila was declared an open city a few days before the end of that year. Bataan fell in April 1942, Corregidor early in the following month. But the movie industry continued to flourish until raw stock disappeared from the market. Films in production were ultimately finished and screened during the war. When the raw stock was used up, moviemakers moved on to stage productions. Thus began an important period in the development of Philippine theater. During the Japanese occupation, not a few movie stars of the prewar period used the stage to maintain their celebrity status: Leopoldo Salcedo, Rogelio de la Rosa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4299\">Norma Blancaflor</a>, Rosita Moreno, Ester Magalona, Ben Rubio, Angel Esmeralda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4581\">Carlos Padilla</a>, comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, soprano Elsa Oria, and, of course, Fernando Poe, who also wrote and directed shows for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a>, then known as stage show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese occupation introduced a new player to the industry, the Japanese&mdash;and a new role for film, propaganda. In 1944, the newcomers established Eiga Heikusa, a distribution and production company, and, with the help of Toho Film Company, filmed<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1214\">Dawn of Freedom</a> </i></b>with Abe Yutaka and Gerardo de Leon as directors. In the lead roles were Fernando Poe, Leopoldo Salcedo, Angel Esmeralda, and Norma Blancaflor. The movie focuses on the oppressiveness of the Americans and the new friendship between the Filipinos and the Japanese. Also in 1944, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5198\">Jose Esperanza Cruz</a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i><strong>Tatlong Maria</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Three Marys) was adapted by Tsutomu Sawamura for the screen and directed by Gerardo de Leon. The movie, starring Carmen Rosales, Norma Blancaflor, and literary writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5060\">Liwayway Arceo</a>, extolled the virtues of country living and featured grand musical numbers staged at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> and the Jai Alai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the latter part of the war, the Battle of Manila left a destroyed city. Included in the destruction were some theaters and, more significantly, some booking offices and studios. As a result, there are very few surviving films of the period. At least five films of the pre-World War II period are available. Three are <strong>sarsuwela</strong><b> movies</b>&mdash;<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\">Giliw Ko</a> </i></b>(My Dear), 1939; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a> </i></b>(Real Mother), 1939; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Pakiusap</strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Plea), 1940&mdash;which all manifest the stock characters of the sarsuwela, like the lovers, the authoritative father or aunt, the &ldquo;clowns&rdquo; that provide the laughs, all interplaying in melodramatic situations interspersed with musical numbers. One is a <b>moro-moro movie</b>&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\"><strong><i>Ibong Adarna</i></strong></a><b><i> </i></b>(Adarna Bird), 1941, which is based on a metrical romance about the search for the mythical bird that is the only cure for the ailing king. The fifth one, repatriated by the US Library of Congress, is <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b>, 1937, a film directed by Eduardo de Castro that falls under the South Seas genre and tells of a love affair against the backdrop of traditional practices of a southern cultural minority. It stars Fernando Poe and Rosa del Rosario. Among the films produced during the war, the Japanese-authorized film <b><i>Dawn of Freedom </i></b>is extant because of the efforts of the Toho Film Company that produced the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1945, the country picked itself up from the ruins of war. The movie industry contributed its role toward the return to normalcy and peace. The rise of the studios from the ashes would mark an important stage in the development of cinema in the country.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4693\">Agustin Sotto</a></strong></em>, <em><strong>with notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

When the theater network and the studio system were finally in place, it easily became the most popular medium.

Filipino film talent flowered on the Philippine stage. Some studios were razed to the ground and a large portion of Filipino film heritage was lost forever. However, the film industry was one of the first to rise from the ashes of war. It lost the innocence of the prewar years and was particularly enamored with the war exploits of its soldiers and their adjustment problems. By the end of the 1960s, the Filipino film had a rich diversity of themes and genres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The film industry, though one of the first to rise from the ruins of war, was not impervious to its effects. On 4 Mar 1946, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a> presented the first postwar film, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Orasang Ginto</i></b><i> </i>(The Golden Clock), which delved into the sufferings and heroism of the Filipino guerrilla. A marked change of mood had descended on the industry. Gentle innocence and coyness gave way to hard-boiled realism. Criminality and violence became the more pronounced themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over the next 10 years, the theme of the returning guerrilla and his difficulties in adjusting to a normal life in the mainstream of society dominated Filipino movies. Euphoria marked the first year following the end of the war. The end of hostilities was celebrated in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Victory Joe</i></b>,<i> </i>1946, as it lightheartedly looked at Filipinas embracing American GIs as conquering heroes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>So Long America</i></b>,<i> </i>1946, bade farewell to the American Commonwealth and welcomed the new republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But euphoria soon turned into disillusionment as political corruption and social strife demolished the gains of liberation. In the movie <b><i>Backpay</i></b>,<i> </i>1947, disgruntled guerrillas talk of joining the Communist Hukbalahap movement because of government failure to implement agrarian reforms and the nonpayment of their war benefits. In <b><i>Lupang Pangako</i></b><i> </i>(Promised Land), 1949, and <b><i>Mga <strong>Busabos ng Palad</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Slaves of Destiny), 1948, guerrillas find themselves jobless and are forced to either beg or steal. In <b><i>Palaboy ng <strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(The Tramp of Fate), 1947, a guerrilla pawns his medal so he could buy lunch for himself and a street urchin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"studio\" name=\"studio\"></a>The Studio System</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s three studios emerged as the country&rsquo;s top filmmakers and starbuilders: LVN,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\">Sampaguita</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere</a>. A study of the number of films produced from 1946 to 1960 would show the dominance of the Big Three Studios (see Table 1). From 45 percent of the total output in 1946, the combined production of LVN, Premiere, and Sampaguita steadily increased to 71 percent of the output of the industry by 1949. Even during the years when labor problems slowed down the production of Premiere, from 1952 to 1954, the output of the three studios averaged a little over 60 percent of the industry total. From 1955 to 1960, the trio accounted for not less than one-third of the industry output. The highest percentage of dominance happened in 1956, with 78 percent (or 65 movies) produced by the Big Three against 22 percent (or 18 movies) by the rest of the industry. From 1946 to 1960, the industry produced a total of 1,151 movies. Of this output, the Big Three Studios accounted for 751 movies (or 65 percent) against the 400 movies produced by other companies (or 35 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Big Three Studios had their own stable of stars, directors, scriptwriters, and technicians, all on exclusive contracts. Studio bosses looked over the day&rsquo;s rushes and passed judgment on style and content. Publicists wrote articles on the stars, thought up gimmicks to promote movies, and planned premieres and birthday bashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"popular\" name=\"popular\"></a>The Popular Genres</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In time, each studio developed its own forte and came to be identified with a particular genre. Sampaguita was very successful with so-called <b>women&rsquo;s pictures</b>. LVN had a gold mine in <b>screwball comedies</b> and <b>swordplay</b>. Premiere banked on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1059\"><b>action films</b></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Action films of this period were set in the past and in faraway lands. Adapted from folktales or recreated according to the 19th-century <i>awit </i>and <i>korido </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>) tradition, these films were set in medieval Europe or in South Sea islands. The hero is a romantic figure, handsome, self-effacing, quick-witted, exhibits great skill in sports and the martial arts, and is utterly compassionate toward the oppressed. Although he begins life as nobility, circumstances conspire to rob him of his birthright. He is raised among goats and cattle and endures humiliation. He learns early in life about the hardships of the masses. He is the underdog, and the moviegoers identify with him. But these qualities are not enough to overcome a tyrant or a marauding army of invaders. A kind spirit from heaven appears to reward his steadfastness with an amulet or a magic potion that enables him to vanquish his foes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Prinsipe Te&ntilde;oso</i></b><i> </i>(Prince Te&ntilde;oso), 1954, the handsome prince disobeys his father and offers food to a hungry beggar; he is exiled from the palace. The old man turns out to be a sorcerer who gives him the power to change his form and appearance. As a beggar, he wanders from country to country. One day, a beautiful princess espies him while he is taking a bath in his princely form. When told to pick a husband, she chooses the beggar to the consternation of her father, the king. She is exiled and lives with him in a shack. Still in disguise, he learns that infidels are about to storm her father&rsquo;s palace. As a prince again, he rescues his beloved&rsquo;s father, drives the invaders away, and is reunited with his family. He becomes the ruler of the two kingdoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i><strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1951, an old man offers the hero advice on how to subjugate a band of South Sea warriors who kidnapped his beloved. In <b><i>Nuno sa Punso</i></b><i> </i>(Old Man of the Anthill), 1950, a distraught lover is reduced in size so that he can rescue his betrothed in the secret chambers of the mounds. In <b><i>Haring Kobra</i></b><i> </i>(King Cobra), 1951, a twin brother acquires a magic ring that can summon snakes to his defense. In <b><i>Thor</i></b>,<i> </i>1962, a magic cane helps the hero save his fair lady from her ravishers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This tradition in action films was carried on through the decades starring big action stars, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4582\">Jose Padilla Jr</a> in the 1950s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4435\">Tony Ferrer</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4275\">Jun Aristorenas</a> in the 1960s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\">Ramon Revilla</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4501\">Jess Lapid</a> in the 1970s; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a> for over four decades since the late 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><b><strong>Musical</strong> s</b></a> dramatize the wide gap between the rich and the poor, between landlords and tenants, between city mores and folk customs. Lovers vow undying love to each other in the beginning but are temporarily separated by parental disapproval or the temptations of the city. In <b><i><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong> ?</i></b><i> </i>(Will You Remember?), 1954, two lovers of humble origins sing their vows of eternal devotion and fidelity. Later their engagement is broken up by a wily city entrepreneur. They are reunited several years later by the same song they sang under the mango tree. In <b><i><strong>Paruparong Bukid</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Country Butterfly), 1959, the mother forbids her daughter to be courted by a farmer and forces her to marry a crooked army official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musicals are less preoccupied with feudal realities, but they are not much different from past productions. The stories still retell the trip from rags to riches. The rich and the poor still disagree and clash, and lovers have to overcome familial and societal prejudices before they can be united in holy matrimony. Such are the themes of movies like <b><i>Sa Libis ng Nayon</i></b><i> </i>(On the Outskirts of the Barrio) and <b><i>Batangue&ntilde;a</i></b><i> </i>in the 1950s; <b><i>Stop, Look, Listen</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Susanang Daldal</i></b><i> </i>(Susan the Chatterbox) in the 1960s; <b><i>Gift of Love</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Living Doll</i></b><i> </i>in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1065\"><b>Fantasy films</b></a> use a host of special effects, but like other genres they dramatize the frustrations and heartbreaks of living in an oppressive environment. The early fantasy films are about people born different, people with physical defects who are considered outcasts by an insensitive populace. Only the intervention of deities can save the beleaguered from the evils of societal prejudice and even from imminent death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Cofradia</i></b>,<i> </i>1953, a black girl is discriminated against because of society&rsquo;s preference for Caucasian features. Her kindness to a stranger brings the gift of a candle that allows her to turn white when it is lighted. In <b><i>Tucydides</i></b>, 1954, a man and a woman in a barren marriage pray for a child. Their prayers are answered, but the child that is born to them is incredibly tiny, small enough to fit inside a pocket. They are ashamed of their offspring and often maltreat the poor girl. She finally runs away to Manila, becomes a normal woman, and saves a distraught lover from the schemes of his unfaithful sweetheart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><b><i><strong>Dyesebel</strong> </i></b></a>,<i> </i>1953, a girl with fins is born to a childless couple. She is considered a handiwork of evil, and their neighbors curse and stone her. One day, even her father attempts to kill her. She swims down to the ocean floor and meets other mermaids. For a time, she is happy with her own kind but one day she falls in love with a rich young man whose girlfriend plots his murder. She saves him and asks the wise old sea hag to transform her into a human being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the 1950s, there have been countless remakes of fantasy films. Each generation has its own <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b><i> </i>and its own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Darna</strong> </strong> </i></b></a>.<i> </i>Other important fantasy films are <b><i>Tuko sa Madre Kakaw</i></b><i> </i>(Gecko at Madre Cacao), <b><i>Nagkita si Kerubin at si Tulisang <strong>Pugo</strong> t</i></b><i> </i>(Cherubin Meets the Headless Bandit), <b><i>Kapitan Kidlat</i></b><i> </i>(Captain Lightning), and <b><i>Mambo Dyambo</i></b><i> </i>in the 1950s; <b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> ng Bulkan</i></b><i> </i>(Child of the Volcano) and <b><i>Capt.

Tension-ridden and full of violent gestures, melodramas are cathartic experiences with the viewers closely identifying with the characters. In <b><i>Apat na Taga</i></b><i> </i>(Four Slashes), 1954, a domineering mother destroys the lives of her children. She is punished for her cruelty when she is afflicted with tuberculosis and rejected by society. In <b><i>Busabos</i></b><i> </i>(Slave), 1956, a rich lover is prevented from marrying his fianc&eacute;e by his friends&rsquo; intrigues and his mother&rsquo;s admonition. The girl gets pregnant and is thrown out by her outraged parents. Years later, the lover is made to realize the purity of his sweetheart&rsquo;s intentions. In <b><i>Pagdating ng Takip-silim</i></b><i> </i>(When Twilight Comes), 1956, college students play a prank on an unsuspecting colleague. They place bets on the ability of a pretty coed to win his heart. The ruse works and the trick is exposed. To forget her, the student enlists in the air force and becomes a pilot. The girl is apologetic and this time is really in love with him. However, as she is already engaged to be married, she cannot return his love. On her wedding day, the pilot obliges by dropping flowers from the air. His plane crashes. The bride rushes to the scene of the crash, hears her lover calling her, and she herself falls from the cliff. The two souls are united in heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Roberta</i></b>,<i> </i>1951, the classic melodrama that focuses on child abuse, a philandering husband beats up his wife and children. He leaves them for a bar girl with underworld connections. He returns home from time to time to wrest his wife&rsquo;s meager earnings as a laundrywoman. The children are forced to work and eventually the wife dies. The underworld characters are dissatisfied with the bar girl and kill her. They accuse the widowed husband of murder but there is a witness to the crime: Roberta. She is kidnapped by the goons to keep her away from the trial. She is rescued and offers the testimony that saves her father from the electric chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Surprisingly enough, melodramas in the succeeding decades are remakes of movies of this period. The plots are sometimes more dramatic, more turbulent, bespeaking of present harsh economic conditions. The themes and plot structures are similar. Important melodramas include <b><i>Talipandas</i></b><i> </i>(Wayward) and <b><i>Sino ang Maysala?</i></b><i> </i>(Who Is Guilty?) in the 1950s; <b><i>Sapagkat Kami&rsquo;y Tao Lamang</i></b><i> </i>(For We Are Only Human) and <b><i><strong>Kapantay ay Langit</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(As High as Heaven) in the 1960s; <b><i>Maruja</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Wanted: Perfect Mother</i></b><i> </i>in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contrast, <b>comedy</b> offers relief from the problems of the day. Comedians capitalize on social satire and jokes about physical deformities but in a lighthearted vein. In <b><i>Kambal Tuko </i></b>(Siamese Twins), 1952, Siamese twins, played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, fumble while trying to solve a robbery. In <b><i>Jack and Jill</i></b><i>, </i>1954, a gay character subscribes to a romanticized view of life but this is undermined by his lower-class status. Comedy continues to be an important moneymaker through the decades because of major comedians like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, whose major hits include <b><i>Jack and Jill</i></b>, <b><i>Hootsy-Kootsy</i></b>,<i> </i>1955, and <b><i>Silveria</i></b>,<i> </i>1958. Later, comedians like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4744\">Ramon Zamora</a> continued Dolphy&rsquo;s brand of comedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ang Kandidato</i></b><i> </i>(Candidate), 1949, takes potshots at the country&rsquo;s favorite pastime: politics. Two guerrillas try to free themselves from poverty&rsquo;s grip by providing consultancy services to two rich landlords. Through chicanery and expert double-dealing, the two con men work on the gullibility of their victims. They spend all their money in trying to win the mayoral election. However, it is the third candidate who wins and the two landlords are reduced to poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"standard\" name=\"standard\"></a>Filmmaking Beyond the Standard</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the standardized output of the studio system, individual filmmakers, as in Hollywood, were able to rise above the standard and give their unique signatures to their films. These filmmakers include Manuel Conde, Gerardo de Leon, Manuel Silos,<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>, and<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\">Gregorio Fernandez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lamberto Avellana, collaborating with Manuel de Leon, son of Do&ntilde;a Sisang, the matriarch of LVN Studios, made his major contribution to Philippine cinema at the height of the studio system in the 1950s. Among his significant films is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><strong>Anak Dalita</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Ruins</i></b>), 1956. Based on a screenplay by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4293\">Rolf Bayer</a>, the main character is a Korean War veteran who returns to his country only to be disgruntled with the condition of his life. The film was a major risk. It veered away from the usual LVN musical comedies and costume movies; furthermore, the cast was composed of character actors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4674\">Tony Santos</a> as the war veteran and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4651\">Rosa Rosal</a> as the prostitute. Quite predictably, it failed in the box office but it won the Golden Harvest Award in the 1956 Asian Film Festival. Avellana followed up this project with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a></i></b>, 1957, a view of life in a seafaring community in the South, and <b><i><strong> <strong>Kundiman</strong> </strong> ng Lahi </i></b>(Love Song of the Race), 1959, in which the peaceful life of a rural community is disturbed by the construction of a factory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this period, Gerardo de Leon also directed a number of worthy films for Premiere: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1095\"><strong>48 Oras</strong></a> </i></b>(48 Hours), 1950, a thriller in which a man, wrongly accused of murder, escapes to find the murderer; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><b><i>Sisa</i></b></a>, 1951, a take on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s character in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Touch Me Not) who is driven by misery into insanity; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1284\"><strong>Sawa sa Lumang Simboryo</strong></a></i></b> (Python in the Old Dome), 1952, the legend of a bandit during the Spanish period, in which de Leon uses a ballad that functions like a Greek chorus; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a></i></b>, 1954, an adventure focusing on a Northern tribe, with a memorable opening sequence of decapitation that signals the transition from black and white to color; and <b><i>Kamay ni Cain </i></b>(Hand of Cain), 1957, an action film driven by sibling rivalry and fate, starring Fernando Poe Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4747\">Zaldy Zshornack</a>, popular teen stars then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manuel Silos, whose career spanned two generations, made <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1126\"><strong>Biyaya ng Lupa</strong></a></i></b> (Blessings of the Land), 1959, for LVN. This masterpiece is a warm depiction of the story of a rural family whose hopes depend on the fruits of the earth. Once again, the film stars Tony Santos and Rosa Rosal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gregorio Fernandez also made his notable melodramas at LVN. Most noteworthy is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1224\"><strong>Malvarosa</strong></a></i></b>, 1958, a family drama set in the slums of the city. Manuel Conde, on the other hand, directed a number of <b>moro-moro movies</b> or costume films for LVN&mdash;from his collaboration with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a> in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\">Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></a> </i></b>(Adarna Bird), 1941, to the postwar movies, like <b><i>Ang Principeng Hindi Tumatawa</i></b> (The Prince Who Does Not Laugh), 1946, <b><i>Apat na Alas </i></b>(Four Aces), 1950, and the remake <b><i><strong> <strong><strong>Ibong Adarna</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b>, 1955. Moreover, Conde himself produced and directed some of his memorable films during this period, particularly <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>, 1950, which introduced the country in the 1952 Venice Film Festival. Conde would also be remembered for his satirical films <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1197\"><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Congress</strong></a></i></b>, 1959, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1198\"><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Society</strong></a></i></b>, 1960, the latter produced under LVN, and later <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1290\">Si Juan Tamad at si Juan Masipag sa Pulitikang Walang Hanggan</a> </i></b>(Lazy Juan and Industrious Juan in the Never-Ending Politics), 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It should be noted that Visayan filmmakers from the southern provinces also made their presence felt during this period. In the 1950s, a flowering of sorts happened in the southern movie industry. In 1969, <b><i>Badlis sa Kinabuhi </i></b>(Life Lines), starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4679\">Gloria Sevilla</a>, was nominated for Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences awards and won the Best Actress trophy for the Visayan star. In the 1970s, the Visayan movie industry declined, showing that the region could not sustain moviemaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"decline\" name=\"decline\"></a>Decline of the Studio System</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The studio system declined in the 1960s. The slack in production brought about by the breakup of the studio system resulting from labor problems accelerated the production of films by smaller companies. Of these companies already in existence in the latter years of the 1950s, People&rsquo;s Pictures, Larry Santiago Productions, Cirio H. Santiago Film Organization, Dalisay Pictures, Vera-Perez Productions, and Everlasting Pictures supplied the main bulk of film entertainment. Two companies that later became the biggest producers of movies in the 1960s were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4698\">Tagalog Ilang-Ilang Productions</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4507\">Lea Productions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mainstream moviemaking in the 1960s, in lieu of planning under the studio system, took the cue mainly from movies from the United States. Action movies coming out of Europe and the United States were increasingly dependent on the sensationalism of violence. James Bond films spawned many &ldquo;secret agents&rdquo; similarly licensed to kill, allowed to raise mayhem at any pretext, and given to extremes of violence. Made-in-Italy westerns encouraged Filipino producers to make Made-in-RP <b>cowboy movies</b> in which the hero found himself confronting landowning warlords who terrorized entire towns through their goons and guns. From Hong Kong and Japan came movies about invincible masters of martial arts. Their local counterparts battled crime lords engaged in gunrunning, white slavery, or the drug trade, in countless movies that boosted the stock of certain stuntmen who later became action stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The action films of the 1960s brought into the industry a new savage rhythm that made earlier action films seem polite and stage managed. The pacing of the new action films was fast, for the narrative had been pared down to the minimum to give more time to fight sequences, which had become more realistic and more violent. In the past, dialogue usually functioned as a device for advancing the narrative; in the new action film, the camera took over as storyteller. The result was not always coherent storytelling, but in expert hands like those of<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4450\">Cesar Gallardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4671\">Cirio Santiago</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4628\">Efren Reyes</a>,Pablo Santiago, or Armando Garces, the cinematographer and the editor were coming to the fore as molders of a new experience in viewing Tagalog movies. Thus, it could truly be said that the action picture was the genuinely cinematic contribution of the 1960s to the advancement of filmmaking in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In subsequent years, action pictures were to turn more violent as the special effects department made onscreen explosions more spectacular and destructive and car chases and smashups more dangerous and fearsome. The hero was to become less heroic and purportedly more human as, in the name of greater realism, he abandoned himself to the same sadistic, lethal impulses that his enemies regularly indulged in. However, the original thematic pattern as evolved in the 1960s remained. Justice in its legal expression as policemen and soldiers always prevailed over the forces of corruption and chaos, although one was made aware in the unraveling of the plot that the individual would need to act on his own to make it possible for good to triumph over evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Melodrama during this period would assert itself in two forms. First, there was melodrama that grew out of the sentimental <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a> narratives about faithful wives and faithless husbands, misunderstood maidens and misinformed fianc&eacute;s. In the 1960s, relationships suffered and broke up because the times had ushered in mores touched by Western permissiveness and candor about sexual desire, resulting in destabilized families and amorous liaisons. Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1183\"><strong>Huwag Mo Akong Limutin</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Never Forget Me), 1960, and Cesar Gallardo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1200\"><strong>Kadenang Putik</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Chain of Mud), 1960, were early intimations of domestic disharmony within the Filipino family brought about by tensions between individual desire and social demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other form of melodrama was that species most characteristic of the decade that witnessed the worldwide celebration of the sex urge in the arts as exemplified in the American hippie musical <b><i>Hair</i></b><i> </i>(staged in Manila in the late 1960s). This was to be designated by the comic-erotic term <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\"><b>bomba</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>with a hint of the taunting humor characteristic of the Filipino attitude toward sex. The bomba film was melodrama that was as moralistic as the traditional sarsuwela. Its values were as old-fashioned as those found in earlier forms of popular culture like the soap opera, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a> novel, and the serialized novels of weekly vernacular magazines. What gave it its sensational character was the subject of sexual relations and the frankness with which the camera recorded bed scenes only coyly suggested in earlier movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Uhaw</i></b><i> </i>(Thirsty), 1970, was the first bomba, starring Merle Fernandez. It is about a woman named Lorna, her carnal &ldquo;thirst,&rdquo; and the two men who would quench it: her husband and her husband&rsquo;s friend. The movie was an instant hit, prompting every other producer in town to outdo its sexual acrobatics. The success of <b><i>Uhaw </i></b>was immediately followed by <b><i>Busog </i></b>(Sated) and <b><i>Hayok </i></b>(Starved), 1970, also starring Merle Fernandez. Soon, other bomba stars appeared: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4742\">Yvonne</a> in <b><i>Climax of Love</i></b>, 1970, and <b><i>Naked in the Dark</i></b>, 1971; Rosanna Ortiz in <b><i>Hayok</i></b>, 1970, and <b><i>Saging ni Pacing </i></b>(Pacing&rsquo;s Banana), 1971; Rossana Marquez in <b><i>Gutom </i></b>(Hungry), 1970, and <b><i>Erotica</i></b>, 1971; and Rizza in <b><i>Nympha</i></b>, 1971, which was advertised as an artistic film directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>. This soft-porn trend did not produce anything that could qualify as a classic of the genre, but it was to indicate the social unrest that was reaching a peak with the advent of a new decade. The bomba was a symbolic revolt against the institutions of a corrupt society that were being attacked by young activists demanding immediate social change. Its impact on the form of subsequent Filipino films was to manifest itself in new candor in the handling of sex as an integral part of any true-to-life treatment of love relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shortly before the outbreak of the Pacific War and in the decade of the 1950s, the musical was a form of film entertainment well loved by Filipino audiences. Those were the years when the big Hollywood musicals were popular fare in Manila&rsquo;s movie houses. During those years, the best Filipino composers and the best Filipino poets collaborated to turn out memorable movie theme songs that had become classics of Filipino popular music. The songs recall an era dewy-eyed with innocence and idealism. By the 1960s, the musical had degenerated into what might be characterized as a television variety show passing itself off as a movie. The affinity with television was perhaps inevitable, for the stars&rsquo; audience appeal depended on exposure time on television. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> was boosted to stardom by winning first prize in a radio-television amateur singing contest. She entered the film industry on the shoulders of fanatical young fans won over by her television appearances. So did <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a>, who kept up with rival Aunor in her TV show by compensating for her inadequacies as a singer by being a better dancer. Nonetheless, both were the big teen stars of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970 alone, Nora Aunor topbilled 20 movies, while Vilma Santos starred in 22 movies in supporting and leading roles. Among Nora Aunor&rsquo;s popular films were those she made with her screen partner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a>, like <b><i>Nasaan Ka, Inay? </i></b>(Where Are You, Mother?), 1970, <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971, and <b><i>Winter Holiday</i></b>, 1972. Vilma Santos, on the other hand, made several films with screen partner Edgar Mortiz, like <b><i>My Pledge of Love</i></b>,<b><i> Love Letters</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Edgar Loves Vilma</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><b>horror film</b></a>, which started out as a major genre in the early history of Filipino cinema, had now become an occasional novelty that producers trot out as Halloween or Christmas treat for children. Early in the 1960s, the usual format of the horror picture was that of the anthology. Different segments of the movie were handled by different directors. <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b><i> </i>(Night of Terror), 1960, brought together directors Felix Villar, Tommy David, Pablo Santiago, and Larry Santiago. <b><i>Mga Daing sa Libingan</i></b><i> </i>(Groans from the Grave), 1961, was the product of the combined efforts of Jose Velasco, Jose Miranda Cruz, Gil de Leon, and Armando de Guzman. The format would persist in recent years with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a> production of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1289\"><b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll</i></b></a><i> </i>franchise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"mainstream\" name=\"mainstream\"></a>Filmmaking Against the Mainstream</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s reaffirmed the primacy of purely entertainment films; ironically, however, some of the better works in Philippine cinema were produced during this decade. Gerardo de Leon made <b><i>Huwag Mo Akong Limutin</i></b>, which stirred some controversy for its sexual content; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><b><i>Noli Me Tangere</i></b></a> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\"><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong></a> </i></b>(Subversion), 1962, adaptation of the major works of the country&rsquo;s national hero, Jose Rizal; <b><i>The Moises Padilla Story</i></b>, 1961, based on a headline story of a politician&rsquo;s assassination; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1145\"><b><i>Ang Daigdig ng mga Api </i></b></a>(The World of the Oppressed), 1965, his entry in the first Manila Film Festival, arguably his best work that centers on the need for land reform. Lamberto Avellana, on the other hand, made <b><i>Bus to Bataan</i></b>, 1962, <b><i>Scout Rangers</i></b>, 1964, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1267\"><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></a></i></b>, 1965, his entry in the Manila Film Festival, an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\">stage play</a> of the same title. Cesar Gallardo made his memorable films in the 1960s&mdash;notably, <b><i>Kadenang Putik</i></b>, a domestic drama dealing with infidelity; and Geron Busabos<i> </i>(Geron the Vagabond),<b><i> </i></b>1964, an action-drama starring Joseph Estrada, the popular actor who would become president of the country, as the hoodlum who protects the poor and the weak in the Quiapo milieu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s showed that films with artistic ambition had to continually compete with the more popular commercial movies. During this period, the futility of struggling to make worthy films within the commercial system was all too clear. Crass commercialism that characterized the competition among the numerous &ldquo;independent&rdquo; production companies forced some of the respected filmmakers out of the system. Avellana formed his Documentary Inc, producing sponsored institutional films; Gerardo de Leon engaged in making film and television commercials; Manuel Conde retired prematurely, while others disappeared from the scene or made forgettable movies. By 1970, sex films, soft-core porno films or bomba became the order of the day, together with the shallow musicals of Nora Aunor, Vilma Santos, and other teen stars. Despite the landmark films of the leading filmmakers of the period, the industry produced some of the worst in Philippine cinema. The industry was at the pits artistically when younger filmmakers broke into the industry in the 1970s. By this time, the studio heads were already gone. Do&ntilde;a Sisang of LVN and Do&ntilde;a Adela vda de Santiago of Premiere had already died in the mid-1960s. In 1975, Dr Jose Perez of Sampaguita passed away, signaling the end of the customized dream factory, the assembly line rigorously supervised by a studio head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since its early appearance in the Philippines, film has been seen by the government as a rich source of revenue. That it could be an effective educational tool and developed into an art form second to none in potential audience reach did not touch the consciousness of government policymakers. They continued to see film merely as entertainment for which people paid an admission fee and, therefore, a source of income for the government. Leaders of the film industry repeatedly presented facts and figures to support their appeal for relief from onerous taxation. But for as long as the Philippine government was in desperate financial straits, a situation that showed no signs of taking a good turn, relief seemed to be a far-off dream. But the industry continued to hope. Perhaps the biggest favor ever received by the industry from government was the Manila Film Festival, first sponsored by the City of Manila in 1966 as part of the celebration of the city&rsquo;s Anniversary Day. For a period of 10 days in June, only Filipino movies would be shown in Manila theaters. The festival was to become an annual affair. From 1966 onward, more first-run theaters in the city opened their doors for the exhibition of Filipino films, thus correcting the earlier situation where only four theaters in the entire city showed local movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe increase in the number of reputable venues for Filipino movies broadened the audience for local films. College students and young professionals, who had hitherto stayed away from local movies, began to watch them, at first out of curiosity. This was to develop later into genuine interest. The times, too, were conducive to such a development. The 1960s saw the resurgence of nationalism through a social movement that had begun to popularize among the youth such phrases as &ldquo;national identity,&rdquo; &ldquo;colonial mentality,&rdquo; and &ldquo;national liberation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The imposition of martial law in 1972 marked an era when government employed dual tactics in dealing with media which heretofore had enjoyed a wide latitude of freedom. Government tried to keep media in good humor even as they were being fettered. In the case of the film industry, state help was being dangled at the film producers in the meantime that the Board of Censors for Motion Pictures, later reorganized as the Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television during martial law, was tightening the screws that would keep movies from being &ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo; to the New Society. This was the situation in the 1970s when younger filmmakers, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, broke into the industry.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4693\">Agustin Sotto</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>,</strong> </em><em><strong>with notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In the past, dialogue usually functioned as a device for advancing the narrative; in the new action film, the camera took over as storyteller. The result was not always coherent storytelling, but in expert hands like those of<a href=\"/4/26/4450\">Cesar Gallardo</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4671\">Cirio Santiago</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4628\">Efren Reyes</a>,Pablo Santiago, or Armando Garces, the cinematographer and the editor were coming to the fore as molders of a new experience in viewing Tagalog movies. Thus, it could truly be said that the action picture was the genuinely cinematic contribution of the 1960s to the advancement of filmmaking in the Philippines."

				"value": "In subsequent years, action pictures were to turn more violent as the special effects department made onscreen explosions more spectacular and destructive and car chases and smashups more dangerous and fearsome. The hero was to become less heroic and purportedly more human as, in the name of greater realism, he abandoned himself to the same sadistic, lethal impulses that his enemies regularly indulged in. However, the original thematic pattern as evolved in the 1960s remained. Justice in its legal expression as policemen and soldiers always prevailed over the forces of corruption and chaos, although one was made aware in the unraveling of the plot that the individual would need to act on his own to make it possible for good to triumph over evil."

First, there was melodrama that grew out of the sentimental <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a> narratives about faithful wives and faithless husbands, misunderstood maidens and misinformed fianc&#xE9;s. In the 1960s, relationships suffered and broke up because the times had ushered in mores touched by Western permissiveness and candor about sexual desire, resulting in destabilized families and amorous liaisons. Gerardo de Leon&#x2019;s <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1183\"><strong>Huwag Mo Akong Limutin</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Never Forget Me), 1960, and Cesar Gallardo&#x2019;s <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1200\"><strong>Kadenang Putik</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Chain of Mud), 1960, were early intimations of domestic disharmony within the Filipino family brought about by tensions between individual desire and social demands."

This was to be designated by the comic-erotic term <a href=\"/4/21/1061\"><b>bomba</b></a>,<b>&#xA0;</b>with a hint of the taunting humor characteristic of the Filipino attitude toward sex. The bomba film was melodrama that was as moralistic as the traditional sarsuwela. Its values were as old-fashioned as those found in earlier forms of popular culture like the soap opera, the <a href=\"/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a> novel, and the serialized novels of weekly vernacular magazines. What gave it its sensational character was the subject of sexual relations and the frankness with which the camera recorded bed scenes only coyly suggested in earlier movies."

It is about a woman named Lorna, her carnal &#x201C;thirst,&#x201D; and the two men who would quench it: her husband and her husband&#x2019;s friend. The movie was an instant hit, prompting every other producer in town to outdo its sexual acrobatics. The success of <b><i>Uhaw </i></b>was immediately followed by <b><i>Busog </i></b>(Sated) and <b><i>Hayok </i></b>(Starved), 1970, also starring Merle Fernandez. Soon, other bomba stars appeared: <a href=\"/4/26/4742\">Yvonne</a> in <b><i>Climax of Love</i></b>, 1970, and <b><i>Naked in the Dark</i></b>, 1971; Rosanna Ortiz in <b><i>Hayok</i></b>, 1970, and <b><i>Saging ni Pacing </i></b>(Pacing&#x2019;s Banana), 1971; Rossana Marquez in <b><i>Gutom </i></b>(Hungry), 1970, and <b><i>Erotica</i></b>, 1971; and Rizza in <b><i>Nympha</i></b>, 1971, which was advertised as an artistic film directed by <a href=\"/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>. This soft-porn trend did not produce anything that could qualify as a classic of the genre, but it was to indicate the social unrest that was reaching a peak with the advent of a new decade. The bomba was a symbolic revolt against the institutions of a corrupt society that were being attacked by young activists demanding immediate social change. Its impact on the form of subsequent Filipino films was to manifest itself in new candor in the handling of sex as an integral part of any true-to-life treatment of love relationships."

Those were the years when the big Hollywood musicals were popular fare in Manila&#x2019;s movie houses. During those years, the best Filipino composers and the best Filipino poets collaborated to turn out memorable movie theme songs that had become classics of Filipino popular music. The songs recall an era dewy-eyed with innocence and idealism. By the 1960s, the musical had degenerated into what might be characterized as a television variety show passing itself off as a movie. The affinity with television was perhaps inevitable, for the stars&#x2019; audience appeal depended on exposure time on television. <a href=\"/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> was boosted to stardom by winning first prize in a radio-television amateur singing contest. She entered the film industry on the shoulders of fanatical young fans won over by her television appearances. So did <a href=\"/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a>, who kept up with rival Aunor in her TV show by compensating for her inadequacies as a singer by being a better dancer. Nonetheless, both were the big teen stars of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970 alone, Nora Aunor topbilled 20 movies, while Vilma Santos starred in 22 movies in supporting and leading roles. Among Nora Aunor&#x2019;s popular films were those she made with her screen partner <a href=\"/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a>, like <b><i>Nasaan Ka, Inay? </i></b>(Where Are You, Mother?), 1970, <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971, and <b><i>Winter Holiday</i></b>, 1972.

During this period, the futility of struggling to make worthy films within the commercial system was all too clear. Crass commercialism that characterized the competition among the numerous &#x201C;independent&#x201D; production companies forced some of the respected filmmakers out of the system. Avellana formed his Documentary Inc, producing sponsored institutional films; Gerardo de Leon engaged in making film and television commercials; Manuel Conde retired prematurely, while others disappeared from the scene or made forgettable movies. By 1970, sex films, soft-core porno films or bomba became the order of the day, together with the shallow musicals of Nora Aunor, Vilma Santos, and other teen stars. Despite the landmark films of the leading filmmakers of the period, the industry produced some of the worst in Philippine cinema. The industry was at the pits artistically when younger filmmakers broke into the industry in the 1970s. By this time, the studio heads were already gone. Do&#xF1;a Sisang of LVN and Do&#xF1;a Adela vda de Santiago of Premiere had already died in the mid-1960s. In 1975, Dr Jose Perez of Sampaguita passed away, signaling the end of the customized dream factory, the assembly line rigorously supervised by a studio head."

That it could be an effective educational tool and developed into an art form second to none in potential audience reach did not touch the consciousness of government policymakers. They continued to see film merely as entertainment for which people paid an admission fee and, therefore, a source of income for the government. Leaders of the film industry repeatedly presented facts and figures to support their appeal for relief from onerous taxation. But for as long as the Philippine government was in desperate financial straits, a situation that showed no signs of taking a good turn, relief seemed to be a far-off dream. But the industry continued to hope. Perhaps the biggest favor ever received by the industry from government was the Manila Film Festival, first sponsored by the City of Manila in 1966 as part of the celebration of the city&#x2019;s Anniversary Day. For a period of 10 days in June, only Filipino movies would be shown in Manila theaters. The festival was to become an annual affair. From 1966 onward, more first-run theaters in the city opened their doors for the exhibition of Filipino films, thus correcting the earlier situation where only four theaters in the entire city showed local movies."

The martial law regime brought massive changes in the landscape of Philippine cinema, both for the better and the worse. For the better, filmmakers were granted with seemingly unlimited support from the government through the cultural programs of the First Lady Imelda Marcos. For the worse, the deteriorating condition of Philippine society aggravated the plight of filmmakers from heavy taxation, increasing cost of production, and absurd censorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">Martial law came with its own ideology of a new Philippine Republic. Indeed, barely a year after its declaration, the new 1973 Constitution was ratified by the Citizens Assembly. Under the banner of the New Society, the Marcoses envisioned a national identity that was modern yet traditionally rooted. Crime would be eradicated and discipline among the citizenry instilled. A curfew was imposed and those caught violating it would have to render community service. Stronger censorship was imposed on the broadcast media and film. This reimagined republic would be built in the framework of Imelda&rsquo;s version of the Platonian &ldquo;the true, the good, and the beautiful.&rdquo; Part of the image formation was the prescribed haircut for boys, as sporting long hair was associated with the hippie movement and drug addiction, while girls kept their skirts at a certain length below the knee. To further this campaign, the presidential couple borrowed from folkloric characters to stand as metaphors for their leadership, such as the native Tagalog&rsquo;s first man and woman, Malakas (Strong) and Maganda (Beautiful). Malakas was the virile and hardworking president, and Maganda was his beautiful partner. Meanwhile, protesters continued to rally against the regime&rsquo;s consolidation of power, the increasing number of human rights violations, and the <i>desaparecidos</i> or those who had disappeared. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"star\" name=\"star\"></a>The Star System and the Dominant Genres</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fall of the studio system in the 1960s ushered in the rise of small-time studios that either continued to bank on the formulaic storylines and the same popular genres, without the control of long-term binding contracts and the quality control of the studios. The stars acquired an unprecedented power through their &ldquo;star value&rdquo; and &ldquo;the hysterical fan had become a key player in the production and consumption of texts&rdquo; (Reyes 2014, 14).

With the view that crime can be reflective of society, the bandit who comes from the lowest rung of the social ladder rises up to resist class oppression, the nemesis being the capitalist agent in cahoots with the state (Sidel 2000, 152). Some action films were comical and parodic of the secret-agent genre of the West. <span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">The dwarf Weng Weng rose to fame with <b><i>For Your Height Only,</i></b> 1981, which follows him as a secret agent fighting against crime, the title being a play on <b><i>For Your Eyes Only</i></b>, the James Bond film released that same year. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Comedy is best represented by Dolphy and Ni&ntilde;oMuhlach. The former was an established comedian who made his reputation playing an array of gay roles like <b><i>Fefita Fofonggay viuda de Falayfay</i></b>, 1973, and the latter a child actor who caught the fancy of audiences young and old by portraying a gallery of brattish but loveable kid, like in <b><i>Ang Leon at ang Daga </i></b>(The Lion and the Mouse), 1975, where Muhlach appears with Fernando Poe Jr. Capitalizing on Dolphy&rsquo;s hilarious characterization of gays and Ni&ntilde;o&rsquo;s endearing portraits of smart-alecky little boys, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> brought together the two comedy stars in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1298\"><b><i>Ang Tatay Kong Nanay</i></b></a> (My Father the Mother), 1978, which tells the story of an unwanted child whom a gay beautician takes under his wing and of the difficulties that the beautician experiences for taking on the double task of father and mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical was another popular genre. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a> love team who started as singers became known with <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971. Another musical, <b><i>My Blue Hawaii</i></b>, 1972, is a box-office hit that meanders with its storyline and does very little with production value, drawing viewers instead through the popularity of the Nora-Tirso love team. Another tandem that offered competition to Guy and Pip was the team of Vi and Bot or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> and Edgar Mortiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The melodrama catered to the female moviegoers with films featuring female characters dealing with personal issues, such as a tragic love affair. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4745\">Danny Zialcita</a> depicted the extravagance of the ruling class, using &ldquo;<i>sosyal</i> realism&rdquo; (&ldquo;sosyal&rdquo; is slang for anything fancy), which strikes the irony of glamor amid abject poverty (Dimla 2014). In <b><i>Gaano Kadalas ang Minsan?</i></b> (How Often Is Once?), 1982, the husband Louie pretends to be the father of Lily&rsquo;s dying child at his own wife Elsa&rsquo;s request. Among the three, Elsa dominates because she is in the position of privilege. <b><i>T-Bird at Ako </i></b>(<b><i>Lesbian Love</i></b>), 1982, takes advantage of the popularity of Vilma Santos and Nora Aunor by putting them together in one film about tomboy lawyer Sylvia (played by Aunor) who offers to stand as legal counsel pro bono to nightclub dancer Isabel (Santos). Their nascent affair gets disrupted in the intrusion of Isabel&rsquo;s male lover Dante (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4434\">Dindo Fernando</a>), thus moving Sylvia from her position of power. <span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">These two films end with the assertion that power resides in the institution and that whatever privilege they have remains valid only when it stays under the control of the institution (Dimla 2014, 67).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other form of melodrama, targeting the male audience, was the bomba. Bomba helped regenerate the economically moribund Philippine cinema after studios had closed down and fewer producers took risks investing in big productions. From 1970 to 1972, the genre followed the worldwide trend of sexual revolution, and the films were able to go through the censors. But the martial law regime took a firmer stand in clamping down on such films, prompting those in the industry to create the <b>bold film</b> or &ldquo;<b>wet look</b>&rdquo; (1974-76), which teases with shots of the drenched actresses and sometimes renders unrealistically scenes of women taking a bath in a chemise (Tolentino 2010, 102-3). An example is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Pinakamagandang Hayop sa Balat ng Lupa</i></b> (The Most Beautiful Animal on the Face of the Earth), 1974, starring Gloria Diaz, the 1969 Miss Universe. The second wave of bold films from 1976 to 1982 grew more daring as underage actresses were cast in movies like <b><i>Katorse </i></b>(Fourteen) and <b><i>Problem Child</i></b>, 1980. At that time, the minimum voter&rsquo;s age had been reduced to the world&rsquo;s lowest at 14 (Tolentino 2010, 104). Despite the censors, low-budget genre movies, which production companies exploited and profited from, received approval provided that they were appended with an epilogue explaining that the problems of immorality and violence depicted in them had been resolved in the New Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to the 1970s, the Cebuano film industry had a verdant history that existed in the periphery of, if not parallel with, the Tagalog movies. By the 1970s, the Cebuano movie industry was already in decline and had reduced its production of films, but it was still an optimistic period. A number of films were produced in the early 1970s, including <b><i>Medalyon nga <strong>Bulawan</strong> </i> </b>(Gold Medallion), produced by Annabelle Rama, <b><i>Mayor Andal</i></b>, <b><i>Batul sa Mactan</i> </b>(Battle of Mactan), <b><i><strong>Anino</strong> sa Villa Lagrimas</i></b> (Shadow at Villa Lagrimas), <b><i>Bulawan sa Lapok</i> </b>(Gold<b> </b>in the Mud), <b><i>Antonio Solitaryo</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Mga Milagro sa</i></b><i> <b>Santo Ni&ntilde;o</b></i><b> </b>(Miracles of Sto. Ni&ntilde;o). Other films include <b><i>Aliyana</i> </b>and <b><i>Ikaduhang Bathala</i> </b>(Second God), 1974 (Noriega et al. 1995). <b><i>Gimingaw Ako</i> </b>(I Long for You), 1974, shot entirely in Cebu City and produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4679\">Gloria Sevilla</a> and Amado Cortez, won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> Best Actress award for Gloria Sevilla and Best Supporting Actress award for her daughter Suzette Ranillo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During its decline, many stars of the Cebuano cinema transferred to Manila and made Tagalog films. Some of the producers and filmmakers also did television programs. Ultimately, the Cebuano film industry became dormant. The last of its films are <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1227\"><strong>Ang Manok ni San Pedro</strong></a></i> </b>(Saint Peter&rsquo;s Rooster), 1975, and <b><i>Itlog Manoy Orange</i> </b>(The Orange Egg Vendor), 1976. The regional industry had to fold up because it could not compete with the larger industry based in Manila, whose language was Filipino (del Mundo 2000, 100).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"new\" name=\"new\"></a>New Cinema</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nationalist movement in the 1960s that generated an interest in mass culture influenced Filipino film, and this became apparent later in the works of the younger directors (Lumbera 1983, 23). Informed as well by the French New Wave (Nouvelle Vague), Italian Neorealism, and art cinema from Sweden, Germany, Italy, Japan, and India, this generation of filmmakers of the 1970s would redefine Philippine cinema (del Mundo 2000, 105). Spanning the entire duration of the martial law, this era of filmmaking not only elevated the art but also served as a vehicle to speak against the dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Lino Brocka, the leading figure of this <b>New Cinema</b>, started as an apprentice to director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a> in a number of American movies and then directed movies for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4507\">Lea Productions</a> before founding his own company, CineManila. Its first film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1305\"><strong>Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang</strong></a> </i></b>(<em><strong>Weighed But Found Wanting</strong></em>), 1974, proved that an artistic film could also be a commercial success. Involved in the protest movements, Brocka would also make films critical of the regime. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, introduces the possibility of mass action yielding individual and social transformation. In the film, Julio Madiaga leaves their fishing village for Manila to look for his girlfriend, Ligaya Paraiso, who was forced into prostitution in the city. Replete with stark imagery of poverty in the face of urban progress, the film includes scenes of street protests during a time when it was prohibited (Tolentino 2012, 121-24). <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b>, 1976, about a young woman who gets enmeshed in the life of her mother and her mother&rsquo;s lover, reintroduced Philippine cinema to international audiences through its participation in the Cannes Film Festival.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a> would also make a name for himself as a filmmaker. According to Lumbera, while Brocka explores social realism, Bernal transforms film into a philosophical rumination. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1252\"><strong>Nunal sa Tubig</strong></a></i></b> (Speck in the Water), 1976, unfolds the story of a fishing village that is being destroyed by environmental pollution before the persistent gaze of the camera (Lumbera 1983, 44). The slow progress of the narrative is a sharp contrast to the development that the New Society boasts of (Santiago 2012). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1139\"><b><i>Manila by Night</i></b></a>, 1980, meanwhile, assembles characters who contradict the image of the City of Man, Imelda&rsquo;s purportedly genteel capital. The Interim Board of Censors for Motion Pictures banned this film, despite r<span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">epresentations with Imelda Marcos that the appended voice-over in the epilogue clarifies that each of the characters had eventually reformed. This led Moritz de Hadeln, director-general of Berlin International Film Festival, to criticize the regime&rsquo;s hypocrisy in its so-called benevolent authoritarianism. The film was later approved for local release, but with the issuance of a four-page list of cuts and changes, including the change of the title into <b><i>City after Dark</i></b>. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1271\"><strong>Relasyon</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>An Affair</i></b>), 1982, about a woman who walks away from a relationship, turns on its head the heteronormative perpetuation of the macho man and the dedicated wife, as embodied by the First Couple.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other films followed along the line of realism: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1797\"><strong>Sakada</strong></a> </i></b>(Seasonal Cane Workers),<b> </b>1976, faithfully reflects Philippine society that is in a state of unrest against the old order. In its three interrelated stories of an hacendero family, the family of <i>sakada</i> or migrant workers, and the formation of a labor union, the film conveys the need for solidarity of freedoms (Lumbera 1983, 43-44). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4759\">Lupita Concio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1237\"><b><i>Minsa&rsquo;y Isang Gamu-gamo</i></b></a> (<b><i>Once a Moth</i></b>), 1976, concerns a Filipino nurse who is about to leave for the United States when an American GI shoots down his brother. Written by Marina Feleo-Gonzales, the film criticizes the presence of US military bases in the Philippines (Tiongson 1976). Marcos, incidentally, had also received constant flak for being America&rsquo;s lapdog (Campos 2007, 38).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other filmmakers who broke into the industry during this period include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a>, who decided to direct his own film with the mysterious and brooding <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Rites of May</i></b>), 1976, followed by <b><i>Kung Mangarap Ka&rsquo;t Magising </i></b>(When You Dream and Wake Up), 1977, his tribute to the romance-musicals of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>.

The campy <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1301\"><strong>Temptation Island</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, for example, parodies the Filipino&rsquo;s fascination with beauty pageants (Zafra 2005, 214).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Cinematography was another aspect that was given importance during this period. Most of the cinematographers who emerged in the 1970s and 1980s worked with the great directors of the time. Eventually, some became directors themselves. The most famous among these cinematographers is Mike de<b> </b>Leon who did the cinematography for <b><i>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a></i></b>,<b> </b>1980.

This received a further boost when the Manila Short Film Festival was organized in April 1981 at the University of the Philippines (UP) to encourage the development of short films in the time of government-controlled mass media.

Probably the most celebrated is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1218\"><strong>Mababangong Bangungot</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Perfumed Nightmare</i></b>), 1977, which won the International Federation of Film Critics award at the Berlin Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1060\">animation</a> had already taken a serious turn in 1953, with the pioneering 8mm film by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a> cartoonist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a>, it barely gained traction for lack of funding. However, outsourced projects regenerated interest in animation. Foreign production companies, like Hanna Barbera and Toei, outsourced some projects in the country. The Marcos regime systematized outsourcing projects and labor export, as well, to improve dollar remittances to the country (Tolentino 2001).

Pursuant to Proclamation 1081, President Marcos issued Letter of Instruction 13 on 29 Sep 1972, which extended the powers of the BCMP by banning films with undesirable content from public exhibition &ldquo;in order to safeguard the morality of our society, particularly the youth, against the negative influence of certain motion pictures.&rdquo; Ironically, Marcos himself was a victim of censorship when his biopic <b><i>Iginuhit ng Tadhana: The Ferdinand E. Marcos Story </i></b>(Destined by Fate) was banned from screening. This incident happened during the Macapagal-Marcos presidential elections in 1965. Hernando writes: &ldquo;More than any government official here, therefore, President Marcos deeply understands what it must be like to have one&rsquo;s story censored; he once had a firsthand experience of it as a victim&rdquo; (2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos used censorship as one of the tools to expurgate undesirable images that would hinder his revisionist programs of Philippine history for his Bagong Lipunan (New Society). Through Executive Order 585 (22 Mar 1980), 745<b> </b>(13 Nov 1981), and 757<b> </b>(29 Dec 1981), the BCMP was reconstituted to extend its powers to broadcast television and renamed Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television (BRMPT). Furthermore, Marcos also attempted to extend the jurisdiction of the BRMPT<b> </b>&ldquo;to include, among others, live entertainment [live performances such as theatrical presentations], video tapes and similar media&rdquo; through<b> </b>Executive Order 868<b> </b>(1 Feb 1983) and 876<b> </b>(18 Feb 1983), for the reason that previous provisions under BRMPT &ldquo;could not adequately cope with the problems generated by technological advances in motion pictures, television, video tapes and similar media.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under the chairmanship of Guillermo de Vega, producers were made to submit finished scripts to the BCMP before they could begin to shoot a movie. This directive was based on the new set of <b><i>Guidelines on Film Production and Exhibition</i></b>, stipulating &ldquo;Submission to the Board of three (3) bound copies of the film script including a synopsis, sequence treatment, names of the actors and actresses in the cast and the director.&rdquo; Although improvisation was the notorious tradition in the industry during this period, the producers dutifully complied with the regulation. Producers hired journalists, writers, novelists, poets, and columnists in order to improve their chances of getting their scripts approved. The guidelines, however, also facilitated the butchering of a good screenplay as the board dissected scenes and would not consider their relation to the whole artistic intent of the project. Despite the scrutiny of censors, lewd films, like <b><i>Mga Uhaw na Bulaklak, Part II</i></b> (Thirsty Flowers), 1975, were still produced, prompting newspaper columnist Teodoro Valencia to move for the investigation of the board (del Mundo 1983, 81-82).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These changes in the already oppressive provisions during the later years of the Marcos regime were tested, protested, and challenged. With the Concerned Artists of the Philippines, Brocka questioned these rules under BRMPT as &ldquo;double standard&rdquo; in being tolerant to foreign films against local films; &ldquo;ambiguous&rdquo; with rules like &ldquo;allowing the exposure of one breast&rdquo; of a female but not two breasts; and &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; in being unpredictable with the decisions (Tiongson 2013, 73). Thus, films like <b><i>Ang Babae sa Ulog</i> </b>(The Woman in the Sleeping Quarters), 1981, by Eduardo Palmos and <b><i>Hubad na Gubat</i> </b>(Naked Jungle), 1982, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4701\">Lito Tiongson</a> were allowed public exhibition despite depicting &ldquo;open sexual practices and female breast exposure&rdquo; because they were &ldquo;part of tribal customs and costumes&rdquo; (David 2010, 67-68).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">BRMPT was further tested by the landmark case of Gonzalez vs Katigbak. In 1984, the BRMPT under Maria Kalaw Katigbak attempted to ban the exhibition of Brocka&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><strong> <strong>Bayan Ko</strong> </strong> : Kapit sa Patalim</a> </i></b>(My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge). Katigbak&rsquo;s censorship rulings met protests from filmmakers and artists (Tiongson 2001b, xx). On 22 Jul 1985, the Supreme Court, citing the constitutional right to freedom of expression, ruled that the power of the board was limited to the classification of films and that it did not have the power to restrict the exhibition of films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few months later, Presidential Decree 1986, issued on 5 Oct 1985, abolished the BRMPT, reorganized Executive Order 876-A, and created the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\">Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</a>. The MTRCB, despite its name &ldquo;Review and Classification Board,&rdquo; still had censorship power even though it admitted members from the industry into the board as preparation for eventual self-regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"organizations\" name=\"organizations\"></a>Film Organizations</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP)</a>, through Executive Order 640-A, was established in 1981. The FAP was composed of the Philippine Motion Picture Directors Association; Screenwriters Guild of the Philippines; Katipunan ng mga Artistang Pilipino sa Pelikula at Telebisyon; Production Designers Guild of the Philippines; Filipino Society of Cinematographers; Pilipino Musical Directors Association Inc; Motion Picture Audio Society of the Philippines; United Film Editors Guild for Motion Picture; Assistant Directors, Production Managers Association for Motion Pictures Inc; Independent Movie Producers and Distributors Association of the Philippines; Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association Inc; and Movie Workers Welfare Foundation Inc (FAP 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 29 Jan 1982, the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) was created under Executive Order 770. It was &ldquo;formed under the sponsorship of First Lady Imelda Marcos, the self-appointed art patron of the country&rdquo; (del Mundo 2000, 111). ECP was also created &ldquo;to ease the tension created by artists who have banded together to form Free the Artist Movement and the Concerned Artists of the Philippines&rdquo; (Cruz 2007). The martial law government of Marcos set up the ECP to encourage the film industry to lend support to the fascist regime. ECP, under its offices, was tasked to manage and operate the Manila Film Center<b> </b>(MFC) and the Film Fund<b> </b>(Tiongson 2001b, xxiii); administer a film ratings and classification system under the Film Ratings Board, which also granted tax incentives to films deemed of high quality (del Mundo 2000, 112); hold annual scriptwriting contest, and produce and fund the winning works through its Alternative Cinema Department; establish and operate the National Film Archive; and hold the Manila International Film Festival (Tiongson 2001b, xxiii).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ECP was able to produce five films: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>Miracle</i></b>), 1982, written by Ricardo Lee and directed by Ishmael Bernal; <b><i>Oro, Plata, Mata</i></b>, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a> and directed by Peque Gallaga; <b><i>Soltero</i> </b>(Single), 1984, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega Jr</a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3127\"> </a></strong> and directed by Pio de Castro III; <b><i>Misteryo sa Tuwa</i></b>, written and directed by Abbo de la Cruz and co-produced with Viva Films; and <b><i>Isla</i> </b>(Island), 1985,<b> </b>written by Celso Ad.

The Manila Film Center, built on reclaimed land, was designed to look like the Parthenon and required thousands of laborers working in three shifts round-the-clock. On 17 Nov 1981, the upper scaffolding collapsed and buried workers in wet cement, some impaled with steel bars. A nine-hour news media blackout was ordered until the government released an official statement. The construction continued and the building was finished in time for the festival&rsquo;s opening night on 18 Jan 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since Maria Kalaw Katigbak took over the job of BRMPT chair in 1984, resistance to the dictatorship was growing in militancy. Various artists from different fields, especially the filmmakers, staged rallies against her censorship rules. The Free-the-Artist, Free-the-Media<b> </b>rallies<b> </b>eventually formed the Free-the-Artist Movement (FTA) with LinoBrocka and BehnCervantes at the helm. They challenged Katigbak&rsquo;s board over decisions seen as contrary to the rights of film artists. They held a rally at Liwasang Bonifacio<b> </b>on 11 Feb 1983. A precursor to the 1983 FTA was a 1978<b> </b>rally in support of legislative bills against censorship (Hernando 2001, 8-9). It was during this period that the problems encountered by filmmakers over the exhibition abroad of certain films like <b><i>Insiang</i></b>, <b><i>Manila by Night/City after Dark</i></b>, and <b><i>Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim</i></b>, exposed the arbitrariness and devious logic of the board as a control body for the dictatorial regime of Ferdinand Marcos. FTA would eventually evolve into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos reduced the funding for ECP from 17 million pesos in 1983 to 5 million pesos in 1984 (Tiongson 2001, xxv). This led ECP to look for other means of sustaining its programs by showing sexually explicit films at the Manila Film Center. Films shown at the MFC were exempted from censorship and attracted a large viewership. Through clamors and protests, Executive Order 1051 in 1985 turned ECP into a private foundation, which was eventually abolished in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"academe\" name=\"academe\"></a>Film in the Academe</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film in the academe swelled in the 1970s as the way of experiencing film became more academic, theoretical, and scholarly. More filmmakers were learning the craft from formal education instead of learning on the set. By the 1980s, professionals and institutions, both academic and non-academic, provided film training to young film artists, technicians, and managers (Diaz 1990, 2-5; Tiongson 2010, 28).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first institution to provide a film program was the Department of Cinema and Television of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila in 1970, initiated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4601\">Ben Pinga</a> (Tiongson 2010, 28-29). This was followed in 1972 by the creation of a film animation course by the cartoonist Larry Alcala at the College of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines Diliman. In 1974, De La Salle University and Ateneo de Manila University started offering film courses in their Communication programs. In 1976, the University of the Philippines Film Center was established. By 1981, UP was the first institution to offer a full undergraduate program in film through the Film and Audiovisual Communication Department of the College of Mass Communication, which offered a Bachelor of Arts in Film. It has been turning out potential filmmakers and film scholars to carry on the work that the artists in the industry and the researchers in the academe have started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other colleges, universities, organizations, and institutions followed soon, like the Mowelfund Film Institute, offering filmmaking workshops. Film showings, lectures, and workshops were also held &ldquo;in embassies and foreign cultural centers,&rdquo; like the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center, the Goethe Institut, and the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise (del Mundo 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The various schools offering film courses through their Communication programs add every year to the pool of youths interested in a career in filmmaking. These young would-be filmmakers kept filmmaking alive outside the mainstream of the industry. In the succeeding decades, the products of these schools would figure prominently as directors, writers, cinematographers, or editors of the new wave of Philippine Independent Cinema in the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"assasination\" name=\"assasination\"></a>1983-86: Aquino&rsquo;s Assassination and the 1986 EDSA Revolt</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Martial law was officially lifted on 17 Jan 1981, a month before the papal visit of John Paul II in the country (Santos 2015), but Marcos retained all his legislative powers, including the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. But the assassination of opposition leader Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr on 21 Aug 1983 fueled the increasing protests against the fascist regime and fomented the fence-sitting elite to finally get actively involved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">After the assassination, there was a noticeable decline of output in the 1980s, attributed to the worsening economy and the deteriorating political and economic conditions. But the industry continued to churn out genre movies. Action biopics of criminals continued in Marilou Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s <b><i>Alyas Baby Tsina</i></b><i> </i>(Alias Baby Tsina), 1984. Comedies thrived in the 1980s, with leading comedians like Dolphy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>, Roderick Paulate, and the trio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4968\">Tito, Vic, and Joey</a>, making box-office hits (Tiongson 2001b, xviii). Fantasy also provided an escape, like <b><i>Inday Bote</i></b> (Inday the Bottle Trader), 1985.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Danny Zialcita continued examining the bourgeoisie vis-&agrave;-vis widespread poverty in films like <b><i>Lalakwe</i></b>, 1985, which offers a glimpse of poverty through a painting that depicts the demolition of a shanty (Dimla 2014, 72). Bomba films from 1983 to 1986, however, took on the forms of <b>FF</b> (fighting fish) or pornographic films and <b>penekula</b> (portmanteau of &ldquo;penetration&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>pelikula</i>,&rdquo; which means cinema), with some getting screening time at the Manila Film Center when the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines needed to raise funds for its own maintenance (Tolentino 2010, 105). Sexy stars were underage and exploitatively introduced to the public with catchy names, like the &ldquo;soft drink beauties&rdquo; of talent manager Dr Rey dela Cruz, including Pepsi Paloma, Sarsi Emmanuelle, and Coca Nicolas. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">But even then, there were attempts to go against the mainstream and tackle realities of the time. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1286\"><b><i>Scorpio Nights</i></b></a>, 1985, by PequeGallaga takes the structure of the hard-core porn and casts in it the story of an idle young wife. Her husband, a security guard, works the night shift. A voyeur student boarder who lives on the upper floor is drawn into a lurid affair with the young wife that proves fatal in the end. First-rate production values gave the film the commercial gloss of the mainstream that the usual low-budget bomba film lacked. This was perhaps indicative of a serious effort to explore the boundaries between art and pornography. Historica<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>l</strong></a>ly contextualizing the film, it can be an allegory for inner decay, represented in the tenements, set against the backdrop of the New Order, which happens outside but suggested within the filmic range (Espiritu 2007, 498).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Tikoy Aguiluz&rsquo;s <b><i>Boatman</i></b>, 1984, is another attempt to refurbish the bomba as a vehicle for serious filmic expression. Aguiluz follows the moral decay of a <i>provinciano</i> (country boy) boatman from Pagsanjan. He gives up the rural life and the hand-to-mouth existence there for life in the big city. In Manila, the grinding poverty leads him to accept work as a partner to a young woman who performs in a live sex show. In time, he is reduced to a sex instrument and is eventually destroyed by the moneyed and the powerful. It is <b><i>Boatman</i></b>&rsquo;s socioeconomic perspective, perfunctory though it might be, that somewhat redeems its exploitative intentions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The deterioration in the industry and the conditions of martial law did not deter some filmmakers from making socially and politically relevant films. Mike de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Kisapmata</i></b> is a psychological drama about an incestuous father who controls the married life of his daughter and son-in-law and &ldquo;has been read as an allegory of the dictatorial regime, the house the nation, and the patriarch Marcos&rdquo; (Espiritu 2007, 48). <b><i>Batch &rsquo;81</i></b>, a harrowing account of eager college freshmen initiating themselves in a fraternity hazing, can be read within the nationalist discourse as a microcosm of &ldquo;the characteristic violence that attends fascism, blind obedience, and irrational conformity&rdquo; (ibid.). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">By then other commercial giants bankrolled controversially political films. <b><i>Sister Stella L.</i></b> was produced by Regal Films and starred Vilma Santos. Didactic, it hews close to the conventions of a political film with the sociopolitical tropes of abuse and the awakening to activism. In spite of its overtly anti-regime tone, the film was classified for General Patronage and approved for release without cuts. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Other films with a strong political stance, however, would still undergo prohibitions from the censors. <b><i><strong>Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim</strong> </i></b>, about the dire consequence a man has to suffer under a big systematized oppressive system, even had to be smuggled out for the Cannes Film Festival in France. On 6 Nov 1985, however, three days after the announcement of the snap elections, the film was released in theaters. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The assassination of Sen Benigno Aquino Jr and the subsequent aggressive mass movement in reaction to it spurred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>, under the pseudonym Rosa ng Maynila, to make an equally revolutionary film. After the documentary <strong><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\">Oliver</a></i></strong>, 1983, which pits the transvestite character against the machismo of a militarized society, Deocampo did <b><i>Children of the Regime</i></b>, 1985, which links child prostitution to the military. The third, <b><i>Revolutions Happen Like Refrains in a Song</i></b>, 1987, explores the joy and dismay with the succeeding government. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a> made <b><i>Banlaw</i></b> (Cleansing), 1986, a three-minute film of a man who hangs himself after watching a monk self-immolate on television. Diaz (2007, 64) affirms its subtle protest against martial law. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>&rsquo;s short film, <b><i>Juan Gapang </i></b>(Johnny Crawl), 1986, is about a ghostly white man who crawls from the bustling EDSA to the infamous Manila Film Center in search of his destiny. More explicit political films were made by nongovernment activist groups, like AsiaVisions&rsquo; <b><i>Arrogance of Power</i></b>, 1982, and AlterHorizons&rsquo; <b><i>Edjop</i></b>, 1986.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">To show his presidential legitimacy, that the people still wanted him in power, Marcos declared a snap election to be held on 7 Feb 1986. Running against him was the widow of the assassinated senator, Corazon C. Aquino. Within the 45-day campaign period, the state-controlled media, like Radio Philippines Network and Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation, refused to give the opposition airtime. On the eve of the election, a full-page manifesto by the so-called group Coalition of Writers and Artists for Freedom and Democracy urged voters to choose the status quo &ldquo;to preserve what has already been achieved in terms of cultural advancement and to proceed further under an enlightened and transformed national leadership equipped to face the pressures of change and advance our national and spiritual progress.&rdquo; Among the signatories were prominent directors, writers, and actors. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Marcos supposedly won the elections but the rampant electoral frauds drove the people to take to the street in what would go down in world history as a nonviolent protest for democracy. The 1986 EDSA Revolt marked the end of a nearly 20-year-long period of fascism. After the rush of winning democracy back, the Marcos&rsquo;s excesses would weigh in on the succeeding years with the country&rsquo;s economy in ruins, from which the film industry had to pick itself up.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>, u</strong></em><em><strong>pdated by Jeffrey Javier and Julian de la Cerna</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>BaumgaÌˆrtel, Tilman. 2007. &ldquo;The Sine-Kino-Connection: Philippine-German Cinema Relations.&rdquo; In <em>Kino-Sine: Philippine-German Cinema Relations</em>, edited by Tilman BaumgaÌˆrtel.

The martial law regime brought massive changes in the landscape of Philippine cinema, both for the better and the worse. For the better, filmmakers were granted with seemingly unlimited support from the government through the cultural programs of the First Lady Imelda Marcos. For the worse, the deteriorating condition of Philippine society aggravated the plight of filmmakers from heavy taxation, increasing cost of production, and absurd censorship."

Indeed, barely a year after its declaration, the new 1973 Constitution was ratified by the Citizens Assembly. Under the banner of the New Society, the Marcoses envisioned a national identity that was modern yet traditionally rooted. Crime would be eradicated and discipline among the citizenry instilled. A curfew was imposed and those caught violating it would have to render community service. Stronger censorship was imposed on the broadcast media and film. This reimagined republic would be built in the framework of Imelda&#x2019;s version of the Platonian &#x201C;the true, the good, and the beautiful.&#x201D; Part of the image formation was the prescribed haircut for boys, as sporting long hair was associated with the hippie movement and drug addiction, while girls kept their skirts at a certain length below the knee. To further this campaign, the presidential couple borrowed from folkloric characters to stand as metaphors for their leadership, such as the native Tagalog&#x2019;s first man and woman, Malakas (Strong) and Maganda (Beautiful). Malakas was the virile and hardworking president, and Maganda was his beautiful partner. Meanwhile, protesters continued to rally against the regime&#x2019;s consolidation of power, the increasing number of human rights violations, and the <i>desaparecidos</i> or those who had disappeared. </span>"

Bomba helped regenerate the economically moribund Philippine cinema after studios had closed down and fewer producers took risks investing in big productions. From 1970 to 1972, the genre followed the worldwide trend of sexual revolution, and the films were able to go through the censors. But the martial law regime took a firmer stand in clamping down on such films, prompting those in the industry to create the <b>bold film</b> or &#x201C;<b>wet look</b>&#x201D; (1974-76), which teases with shots of the drenched actresses and sometimes renders unrealistically scenes of women taking a bath in a chemise (Tolentino 2010, 102-3). An example is <a href=\"/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Ang Pinakamagandang Hayop sa Balat ng Lupa</i></b> (The Most Beautiful Animal on the Face of the Earth), 1974, starring Gloria Diaz, the 1969 Miss Universe. The second wave of bold films from 1976 to 1982 grew more daring as underage actresses were cast in movies like <b><i>Katorse </i></b>(Fourteen) and <b><i>Problem Child</i></b>, 1980. At that time, the minimum voter&#x2019;s age had been reduced to the world&#x2019;s lowest at 14 (Tolentino 2010, 104). Despite the censors, low-budget genre movies, which production companies exploited and profited from, received approval provided that they were appended with an epilogue explaining that the problems of immorality and violence depicted in them had been resolved in the New Society."

Bomba films from 1983 to 1986, however, took on the forms of <b>FF</b> (fighting fish) or pornographic films and <b>penekula</b> (portmanteau of &#x201C;penetration&#x201D; and &#x201C;<i>pelikula</i>,&#x201D; which means cinema), with some getting screening time at the Manila Film Center when the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines needed to raise funds for its own maintenance (Tolentino 2010, 105). Sexy stars were underage and exploitatively introduced to the public with catchy names, like the &#x201C;soft drink beauties&#x201D; of talent manager Dr Rey dela Cruz, including Pepsi Paloma, Sarsi Emmanuelle, and Coca Nicolas. </span>"

Her husband, a security guard, works the night shift. A voyeur student boarder who lives on the upper floor is drawn into a lurid affair with the young wife that proves fatal in the end. First-rate production values gave the film the commercial gloss of the mainstream that the usual low-budget bomba film lacked. This was perhaps indicative of a serious effort to explore the boundaries between art and pornography. Historica<a href=\"/4/21/1066\"><strong>l</strong></a>ly contextualizing the film, it can be an allegory for inner decay, represented in the tenements, set against the backdrop of the New Order, which happens outside but suggested within the filmic range (Espiritu 2007, 498).</span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Tikoy Aguiluz&#x2019;s <b><i>Boatman</i></b>, 1984, is another attempt to refurbish the bomba as a vehicle for serious filmic expression. Aguiluz follows the moral decay of a <i>provinciano</i> (country boy) boatman from Pagsanjan. He gives up the rural life and the hand-to-mouth existence there for life in the big city. In Manila, the grinding poverty leads him to accept work as a partner to a young woman who performs in a live sex show. In time, he is reduced to a sex instrument and is eventually destroyed by the moneyed and the powerful. It is <b><i>Boatman</i></b>&#x2019;s socioeconomic perspective, perfunctory though it might be, that somewhat redeems its exploitative intentions.</span>"

Mike de Leon&#x2019;s <b><i>Kisapmata</i></b> is a psychological drama about an incestuous father who controls the married life of his daughter and son-in-law and &#x201C;has been read as an allegory of the dictatorial regime, the house the nation, and the patriarch Marcos&#x201D; (Espiritu 2007, 48). <b><i>Batch &#x2019;81</i></b>, a harrowing account of eager college freshmen initiating themselves in a fraternity hazing, can be read within the nationalist discourse as a microcosm of &#x201C;the characteristic violence that attends fascism, blind obedience, and irrational conformity&#x201D; (ibid.). </span>"

				"value": "<span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">By then other commercial giants bankrolled controversially political films. <b><i>Sister Stella L.</i></b> was produced by Regal Films and starred Vilma Santos. Didactic, it hews close to the conventions of a political film with the sociopolitical tropes of abuse and the awakening to activism. In spite of its overtly anti-regime tone, the film was classified for General Patronage and approved for release without cuts. </span>"

On 6 Nov 1985, however, three days after the announcement of the snap elections, the film was released in theaters. </span>"

After the documentary <strong><i><a href=\"/4/24/1253\">Oliver</a></i></strong>, 1983, which pits the transvestite character against the machismo of a militarized society, Deocampo did <b><i>Children of the Regime</i></b>, 1985, which links child prostitution to the military. The third, <b><i>Revolutions Happen Like Refrains in a Song</i></b>, 1987, explores the joy and dismay with the succeeding government. <a href=\"/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a> made <b><i>Banlaw</i></b> (Cleansing), 1986, a three-minute film of a man who hangs himself after watching a monk self-immolate on television. Diaz (2007, 64) affirms its subtle protest against martial law. <a href=\"/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>&#x2019;s short film, <b><i>Juan Gapang </i></b>(Johnny Crawl), 1986, is about a ghostly white man who crawls from the bustling EDSA to the infamous Manila Film Center in search of his destiny. More explicit political films were made by nongovernment activist groups, like AsiaVisions&#x2019; <b><i>Arrogance of Power</i></b>, 1982, and AlterHorizons&#x2019; <b><i>Edjop</i></b>, 1986.</span>"

Within the 45-day campaign period, the state-controlled media, like Radio Philippines Network and Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation, refused to give the opposition airtime. On the eve of the election, a full-page manifesto by the so-called group Coalition of Writers and Artists for Freedom and Democracy urged voters to choose the status quo &#x201C;to preserve what has already been achieved in terms of cultural advancement and to proceed further under an enlightened and transformed national leadership equipped to face the pressures of change and advance our national and spiritual progress.&#x201D; Among the signatories were prominent directors, writers, and actors. </span>"

Several coup d&rsquo;etat<i> </i>attempts staged by political rivals and members of the armed forces besieged Corazon Aquino&rsquo;s government. Political instability in the late 1980s weakened the already feeble economy after the Marcos dictatorship. As a result, film revenues declined (Tiongson 2001). Moreover, the 1990 earthquake, the 1992 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and the flood in Ormoc, Leyte, obliterated many movie houses all over the country (Lumbera 1994).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New media conglomerates <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> and GMA Films, as well as OctoArts Films, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a>, and Unitel Pictures, somehow sustained the industry in the 1990s. Though a new production outfit borne from media giant <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, Star Cinema joined Viva and Regal as the top producers of the 1990s but would surpass both companies in the 2000s. Several new producers also made low-budget commercial films that rode on trends such as sex comedies and soft-core porn (Tiongson 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">President Fidel V. Ramos declared 1994 &ldquo;The Year of the Filipino Cinema,&rdquo; challenging the industry to produce superior films. However, film critics noted the dearth of quality films during the period. The industry was in such poor shape that in 1994 not one of the six entries in the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) won the Best Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture awards (<i>Mediawatch</i> 1995). Mindless entertainment soon became the MMFF&rsquo;s trademark. The festival that bore some of the finest films in the history of Philippine cinema was yielding mostly mediocre movies year after year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade saw the commemoration of the 75th year of <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b>(Country Maiden), the World Cinema Centennial celebration, the centenaries of the Philippine revolution and independence, and the rise of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Ejercito Estrada</a>, an actor, to the presidency. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4910\">Movie and Television Review and Classification Board</a>, headed by Estrada&rsquo;s appointee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\">Armida Siguion-Reyna</a>, installed members from the film industry and reformed the way it evaluated films. In 2000, after a former ally disclosed that he had received millions of payoff from illegal gambling, Joseph Estrada was tried by an impeachment court and, in 2001, was ousted from the presidency. Estrada&rsquo;s removal became the backdrop of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Hubog</i></b> (<b><i>Wretched Lives</i></b>), 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period was also marred by high-profile arrests of movie stars involved in illegal drugs and firearms possession, and scandals such as the one in which a talent manager manipulated the awarding ceremonies during the now-defunct Manila Film Festival in favor of her clients, both of whom were wrongfully announced as winners in the lead acting categories. These incidents further tarnished the viewing public&rsquo;s faith in local films (Tiongson 2010, 26). Moreover, a fiscal crisis hit Southeast Asian economies in the late 1990s, devaluing the peso and stalling the Philippine economy, which was poised to recover during the Ramos administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino films were rapidly losing audiences to Hollywood spectacles, whose distribution was bolstered by the government&rsquo;s endorsement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, ironically in spite of the state&rsquo;s attempts to support the industry. Moreover, European and Asian art films, made available through special screenings, cable television, and video rental companies, influenced viewers who began to tire of the formulas and poor production values of Filipino movies (Tiongson 2010, 4-6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The deaths of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> in 1991 and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a> in 1996 marked the end of the extraordinary period that began in the 1970s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a> directed only two movies after 1985: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1102\"><strong>Aliw</strong>an Paradise</a> </i></b>(Entertainment Paradise), which is part of <b><i>Southern Winds</i></b>, an anthology of Asian films launched in 1992; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1120\"><b><i><strong>Bayani</strong> ng 3rd World</i></b></a> (Third World Hero) in 1999. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad.

In 2001, films such as <b><i>Ano Bang Meron Ka? </i></b>(What Is It That You Have?), <b><i>Dudurugin Ko Pati ang Buto Mo </i></b>(I Will Crush Even Your Bones), and <b><i>Balahibong Pusa</i></b> (Cat&rsquo;s Fur) typified the mainstream.

The era of the Philippine New Wave <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/20/1054\">independent films</a> began and marshaled a group of young filmmakers who were trained in film schools, received grants from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Foundation</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals</a> among others, and had set their eyes on local and international film festival circuits (Tiongson 2013, 4-16). These new film-educated directors, screenwriters, cinematographers, and producers, like the alternative filmmakers before them, spurned the commercialism of a declining industry to pursue their respective artistic visions. Not only did new grant-giving institutions begin to support young filmmakers, they also helped in forming an educated middle-class audience that patronized digital independent film festivals (Tiongson 2013, 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Digital video cameras that were significantly more affordable and easier to handle than film cameras appeared in the market, thus democratizing filmmaking for young students of film. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\">Jon Red</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Still Lives</i></b>, 1999, a film about a drug syndicate, is considered the first full-length digital film to be produced in the Philippines (Hernandez 2014a, 23). Also shot on digital video cameras are other pioneering independent films like <b><i>Motel</i></b>, 1999, a compendium of three short films by Nonoy Dadivas, Chuck Escasa, and Ed Lejano, which focuses on three different lovers who go to the same motel on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and <b><i>The Twelve</i></b>, 2000, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4380\">Khavn dela Cruz</a>, a contemporary representation of Jesus&rsquo;s apostles. Independent filmmakers found creative means to go about marketing and distribution. Crisaldo Pablo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1155\"><strong>Duda</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Doubt</i></b>), 2003, is the first digital film projected in a commercial theater when it was shown in SM cinemas.

By 2005, support for independent films, both from government and private foundations, reached an unprecedented scale. There were also some independent filmmakers who successfully produced films outside of the model provided by grant-giving institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Major indie film directors produced a number of films with varying styles. Raya Martin, aside from getting grants abroad, collaborated with another filmmaker to produce his films. With Arlene Cuevas, he produced his first movies under Cinematografica (Hernandez 2014b, 176)&mdash;namely, <b><i>Maicling Pelicula na&ntilde;g Ysa&ntilde;g Indio Nacional</i></b> (<b><i>A Short Film about the Indio Nacional</i></b>), 2005, <b><i>Now Showing</i></b>, 2008, <b><i>Next Attraction</i></b>, 2008, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1190\"><strong>Independencia</strong></a> </i></b>(Independence), 2009. An entry in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, <b><i>Independencia</i></b> is set during the early years of the American occupation and tells the story of a family displaced by the invasion. Martin stylistically mimics the period the film evokes by shooting in black and white and using sets resembling those from early American studio photography (Tiongson 2013, 21).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4708\">John Torres</a> ingeniously wove found footage from personal trips, illustrations, text messages, and concert clips to create <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1307\"><strong>Todo Todo Teros</strong></a></i></b>, 2005. Instead of a script, Torres began with found footage and assembled his film from there (Hernandez 2014b, 158). The result is a deeply personal film about a married man who begins a love affair with a Russian woman. Torres used a similar collage-like method with <b><i>Taon Noong Ako&rsquo;y Anak sa Labas</i></b> (Years When I Was a Child Outside), 2008. He incorporated video recording of his house after a typhoon, various found footage, and an interview with Jose Maria Sison of the Communist Party of the Philippines to create a film about reckoning with his father&rsquo;s admission that he has another family (Hernandez 2014b, 165).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two of the independent Filipino filmmakers who have won various awards in major international film festivals are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a> and Brillante Mendoza. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1117\"><strong>Batang West Side</strong></a> </i></b>(West Side Kid), 2001, Lav Diaz&rsquo;s five-hour film about the death of a Filipino teen in New Jersey, signaled his shift to a more audacious and uncompromising cinema. The following year, Diaz released <b><i>Hesus, Rebolusyunaryo</i></b> (Hesus the Revolutionary), a political drama set in the future. This was followed by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1157\"><strong>Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Pilipino</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Evolution of a Filipino Family</i></b>), 2004, a 10-hour epic that condenses the nation&rsquo;s history in a saga about a peasant family. Diaz is known for his social epics characterized by long takes, black-and-white cinematography, and running time of 5 to 10hours. In <em><b>Kagadanan</b></em><b><i>sa <strong>Banwa</strong> an ning mga Engkanto </i></b>(<b><i>Death in the Land of Encantos</i></b>), 2007, a poet returns to his typhoon-ravaged hometown. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1250\"><b><i>Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan</i></b></a> (<b><i>Norte, The End of History</i></b>), 2013, follows the moral descent of a law school dropout. <b><i>Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon</i></b> (<b><i>From What Is Before</i></b>), 2014, describes the events in a remote village days before Ferdinand Marcos declares martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of Brillante Mendoza&rsquo;s films convey a society gripped by a sense of dread and desperation. Mendoza collaborated with writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4500\">Armando Lao</a> to produce some of the most emblematic films of the period. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1288\"><strong>Serbis</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Service</i></b>), 2008, portrays a family in Angeles, Pampanga, living inside a decaying theater that shows soft-core pornography and serves as a venue for prostitution among its male clients. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1206\"><strong>Kinatay</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Execution of P.</i></b>), 2009, for which Mendoza won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival, follows a criminology student who is pulled into a drug syndicate&rsquo;s underworld where he witnesses the abduction, rape, and brutal murder of a prostitute. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1306\"><strong>Tirador</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Slingshot</i></b>), 2007, written by Ralston Jover, presents a grim picture of a shantytown in Quiapo as symptomatic of a larger problem&mdash;the corruption of people in power. Mendoza shifts his focus on a Sama Dilaut midwife searching for a woman who will bear her husband&rsquo;s child in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1303\"><strong>Thy Womb</strong></a></i></b>, 2012. <b><i>Taklub </i></b>(<b><i>Trap</i></b>), 2015, describes the lives of people in Tacloban after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the city in November 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4498\">Jun Lana</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1137\"><strong>Bwakaw</strong></a></i></b>, 2012, is about an elderly gay man who falls in love with a tricycle driver.

Thus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/20/1057\">regional cinema</a> flourished during the New Wave of Philippine independent films.

Major media conglomerates, such as ABS-CBN&rsquo;s Star Cinema, cannot ignore the digital independent film phenomenon. In 2013, Star Cinema partnered with Reality Entertainment to produce <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4540\">Erik Matti</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1254\"><b><i>On the Job</i></b></a>, a crime thriller that combines the polish of mainstream cinema and the grit of independent films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Conclusion </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, Philippine cinema experienced a period of decline that reflected the nation&rsquo;s struggle to restore democracy. The deficiency both in quality and revenue of mainstream cinema in the 1990s signaled the industry&rsquo;s defeat by big-budget global films. A new breed of independent filmmakers rose and seized digital video technology to create audacious, uncompromising, and innovative cinema. Because of its affordability and versatility, independent filmmakers found more freedom with the digital video format. Grant-giving institutions and film festivals sustain the development of independent filmmaking and continue to discover new talents. Independent cinema from the regions reveals various facets of experience rarely seen in mainstream films. Although much still needs to be done, especially in the areas of promotion and distribution of films, the gap between digital independent films and the Filipino audience is starting to shrink. Thus, the future of Philippine film no longer forecasts gloomy conditions but a vast and rich cinematic landscape.&nbsp; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by John Bengan, with notes from Johann Vladimir J.

Several coup d&#x2019;etat<i> </i>attempts staged by political rivals and members of the armed forces besieged Corazon Aquino&#x2019;s government. Political instability in the late 1980s weakened the already feeble economy after the Marcos dictatorship. As a result, film revenues declined (Tiongson 2001). Moreover, the 1990 earthquake, the 1992 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and the flood in Ormoc, Leyte, obliterated many movie houses all over the country (Lumbera 1994)."

These incidents further tarnished the viewing public&#x2019;s faith in local films (Tiongson 2010, 26).

				"value": "After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, Philippine cinema experienced a period of decline that reflected the nation&#x2019;s struggle to restore democracy. The deficiency both in quality and revenue of mainstream cinema in the 1990s signaled the industry&#x2019;s defeat by big-budget global films. A new breed of independent filmmakers rose and seized digital video technology to create audacious, uncompromising, and innovative cinema. Because of its affordability and versatility, independent filmmakers found more freedom with the digital video format. Grant-giving institutions and film festivals sustain the development of independent filmmaking and continue to discover new talents. Independent cinema from the regions reveals various facets of experience rarely seen in mainstream films. Although much still needs to be done, especially in the areas of promotion and distribution of films, the gap between digital independent films and the Filipino audience is starting to shrink. Thus, the future of Philippine film no longer forecasts gloomy conditions but a vast and rich cinematic landscape.&#xA0; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span> <em><strong>Written by John Bengan, with notes from Johann Vladimir J.

It is mainstream, traditional, narrative cinema that is recognized principally by the &ldquo;official&rdquo; version of our film history. Although many independent works contain the living voice and authentic image of the people, this cinema has remained &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; from the public eye due to personal or political reasons. In some instances in contemporary history, it has been suppressed for engaging itself with social and political realities. At other times, it has been marginalized for its uncompromising adherence to cinematic forms so unlike those peddled on the big screens of movie theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many films have been produced outside the movie industry that show actual conditions and processes in society. Valuable as historical documents, they offer forms and images that demand a different consciousness and a repositioning of our beliefs and attitudes toward the subjects brought onscreen. If commercial narratives give visual pleasure, the polemical style of a political documentary or a formalistic display of lights and colors in an experimental film holds our attention even if these films have no story to tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"early\" name=\"early\"></a>Early History </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Independent cinema began when movies were first made in the country, because the first movies were short films produced by artisans. Even with the rise of mainstream cinema, noncommercial films continued to be made. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, founder of the first Filipino film outfit, Malayan Movies, dabbled in films other than those he made for entertainment. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5162\">Celso Al. Carunungan</a> reports that &ldquo;in 1921 and 1922, the Nepomucenos (brothers Jose and Jesus) were commissioned by the United States government to make a series of documentary films showing the most important industries in the Philippines. The purpose was to show the American people the richness of our resources and the Philippines&rsquo; tremendous potentials for industrial development. One of the most impressive of these fourteen films was the one about the hemp industry, which showed all the facets of abaca production, from planting to exportation.&rdquo; In addition, the Nepomucenos became the local correspondents for Paramount News and Pathe News. In fact, in 1923 Pathe News commissioned them to cover the disastrous earthquake that hit Japan in spite of the fact that there were film people in Shanghai, which was nearer to Japan than Manila. Unfortunately, none of the works by the Nepomuceno brothers are extant. Such films, more than <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Country Maiden), 1919, could have offered us insights into the kind of image representation the Nepomucenos made at the time when the US presence was already established in the country.

The films marked the modest resistance of some filmmakers against the onslaught of commercial moviemaking. Fortunately, a 1941 vintage film, <b><i>March of Time Series: The</i> <i>Philippines</i></b><i> </i>by Louis de Rochemont, which is about the Philippines from 1898 to 1940, has survived in the film archives in Washington DC and is now reportedly available for local audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the exigencies of the Japanese Occupation, several documentaries and newsreels were produced during that period. Motoe Terami-Wada mentions the following news features made during the war years: <b><i>Laurel Reviews His Troops</i></b>,<i> </i>Nov 1943; <b><i>First Session of the National Assembly</i></b>,<i> </i>Nov 1943; <b><i>New Cabinet Organized</i></b>,<i> </i>Nov 1943; and <b><i>What Do You Think?</i></b>,<i> </i>Apr 1943.

But the revival offered no room for short films because the industry, to survive, needed to turn out box-office hits. Short films and other forms of independent cinema were not given due attention. The war, however, had brought about a universal awareness of the important role of films as the countries involved in the conflict realized the effectiveness of the medium in military training, propaganda work, and other war-related activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1946, <b><i>Philippine Progress and Philippine Rehabilitation</i></b>,<i> </i>both in 16mm and in black-and- white, were produced by the United States Information Service (USIS). Directed by Charles Tanner of the USIS, <b><i>Philippine Progress</i></b><i> </i>reviewed the country&rsquo;s economic gains during the decade prior to independence. <b><i>Philippine Rehabilitation </i></b>focused on postwar reconstruction and the role of the United States. It was directed by Harold Goodwin, another American with the USIS. When some people asked to view the two films in the USIS film library, they were told that the films had been dumped in Manila Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1950, a film following the documentary concept as we know it today was produced by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Gen Francisco Licuanan, AFP chief signal officer, initiated a production designed to give an insight into the life of young men who had been drafted into the army. However, this film, titled <b><i>I Was a Trainee</i></b>,<i> </i>did not give the necessary impetus to create a short film movement despite the promise it made for innovating the medium. Made under the direction of Lt Col Armando Medel, Maj Dominador Estanislao, and Capt Benedicto G. Pinga, all of the AFP, the film was designed to enhance the recruitment of air force trainees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also in 1950, the USIS produced two 20-minute 16mm shorts in black and white: <b><i>This Is the Philippines </i></b>and<b> <i>Woodcarving in the Philippines</i></b>,<i> </i>both directed by Harold Goodwin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The turning point in the development of noncommercial films came in 1953 when the government information program went full blast. The creation of the National Media Production Center (NMPC) on 1 Jun 1953 was the most significant factor in the upsurge of documentary and short filmmaking in the country after the war. With rural areas as the main target, the information program focused on agricultural and community development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For want of a form and style, the early productions were patterned after the local full-length cinema. In fact, some short feature films depended a great deal on stereotyped plots. They usually had a cast that included a name star or bit player and their stories tended to employ melodrama. In one of these films, however, Fidel de Castro presented the story of two land seekers in a style then considered as employing documentary techniques. The film was <b><i>The</i></b><i> <b>Land Is Free</b></i>,<i> </i>produced by NMPC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1955, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a> made <b><i>Si Mang Anong</i></b><i> </i>for the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, based on the story of the Rice Farmer of the Year. In the same year, a radical departure from local film presentation was <b><i>The Gray Menace</i></b>,<i> </i>another government production, on the control of rodents in the ravaged fields of Mindanao. The film did away with the usual plot, casting, and melodrama. A year later, <b><i>Better Hides and Skins</i></b><i> </i>proved to be another successful attempt at infusing the narrative with documentary technique. In 1957, <b><i>The Fisherman&rsquo;s Bounty </i></b>found its way into the television network of West Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The private sector likewise mixed melodrama and documentary techniques in <b><i>Without Fear of Tomorrow</i></b>,<i> </i>an industrial documentary film that was given an award by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> in 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"independent\" name=\"independent\"></a>The First Independent Film Movement </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The number and frequency of short film production in the Philippines have considerably increased since 1955. Local filmmakers and enthusiasts searched for a more suitable style and form for the specialized films. The documentary was given considerable attention. The 1950s saw what may be considered the first major movement of the country&rsquo;s independent cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the first time, there arose a concerted effort at forging a cinema outside of the movie industry, as evidenced in the steady increase in short film and documentary production, in the creation of film training centers like the Film Institute of the Philippines, in the holding of short film festivals like the National Short Film Festival, and in the promotion abroad of the country&rsquo;s short films and documentaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is worth noting that the Philippines was one of the pioneers in film education in Asia. During the so-called golden age of Philippine cinema, Philippine short films like those made by Avellana were winning in international short film competitions. In all these efforts, a new consciousness was beginning to form outside of the movie industry. These efforts would be curtailed upon the imposition of martial law. The movement was to become part of the establishment, with some short film practitioners making propaganda films for the government, particularly when NMPC became the propaganda arm of the Marcos dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1956, Benedicto Pinga, who had studied film in the City University of New York, founded the Film Society of the Philippines (FSP). In 1962, the FSP held the First National Festival of Short Films. The 24 entries accepted in the competition provided a basis for gauging the status of the local short films as a form distinct from that of the commercial narrative film. The following year, a weekly program of short film classics, followed by a forum entitled &ldquo;Film Appreciation,&rdquo;<i> </i>was shown on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For its initial venture, the FSP organized together with the UP Writers&rsquo; Club the first international film festival held in Manila late in 1956. For the first time a public exhibition of short and long film classics from Europe and Asia was held. Although the FSP was financially handicapped, it was able to conduct film seminars and production workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1964, entries to the Second National Festival of Short Films showed marked improvement. The FSP, newly renamed Film Institute of the Philippines (FIP), began to organize festivals outside the country, with the first ones being held in Cairo, Bangkok, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in 1965. The First Filipino Film Festival in the United States was an eye-opener for filmmakers of independently produced films. Short and feature-length films were shown in Europe and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 1958, Philippine participation in international film festivals has been truly rewarding, due partly to the awards and recognition gained by short films. In 1959, during the Bilbao Short Film and Documentary Festival, Lamberto V. Avellana&rsquo;s <b><i>El Legado</i></b><i> </i>(The Legacy) won the Conde de Foxa Award, a signal honor given only to entries from Latin America and the Philippines. In 1961, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1138\"><b><i>La Campana de <strong>Baler</strong> </i></b><i> </i></a>(The Church Bell of Baler), also by Avellana, got a similar award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Son of the Sea</i></b>,<i> </i>though not a Filipino-produced film, deserves special mention because it is among the few films that have won for the Filipino student international recognition in the field of short films. Made for the Republic of Vietnam by Jose Avellana, Lamberto&rsquo;s brother, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4429\">Higino Fallorina</a> as cameraman, the film won a special award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>The Land Is Free</i></b><i> </i>by Fidel de Castro was cited in the Week of the Asian Films in Frankfurt in 1962. In the same year, <b><i>They Shall Not Want</i></b><i> </i>by Emeterio Ornedo was shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival and at the Agriculture Film Competition in Berlin. <b><i>Brave Little Island</i></b>,<i> </i>produced by Tony Smith, received a certificate of acceptance at the San Francisco Film Festival in 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The year 1964 proved a big year for Filipino independent filmmakers. The main reason for this was that during that year, a documentary film, <b><i>Soul of a Fortress</i></b>,<i> </i>produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4601\">Benedicto Pinga</a> and directed by Ferde Grofe Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4645\">Emmanuel Rojas</a>, participated in nine film festivals in Germany, Spain, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Cambodia. The highest distinction it won was the Silver Prize at the Bilbao Short Film and Documentary Festival. In the same year, <b><i>Mangandingay:</i></b><i> <b>A Place of Happiness </b></i>by Jesus Ramos brought home the Rotary Award for Service to Mankind from the Asian Film Festival in Taipei. In 1965, <b><i>Masinloc</i></b>,<i> </i>a short film also by Ramos, was cited for its participation at the Industrial Film Festival in the Chicago International Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1969, Avellana&rsquo;s <b><i>The Survivor </i></b>garnered the Prix D&rsquo;Honneur at the second Festival International du Film in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. <b><i>The Land of the Sun Returning</i></b>,<i> </i>a Caltex color documentary, earned the Golden Award, the Anvil Award, and the Chris Certificate at the Nineteenth Columbus Film Festival held in Ohio in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Twenty years after its creation, the NMPC in 1973 entered its <b><i>As a Nation Grows</i></b><i> </i>at the Teheran Educational Film Festival. Later, <b><i>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</i></b><i> </i>(History of the Race), a Marcos propaganda film, became the Philippine entry in the Fifth International Cinema Festival in Tashkent, USSR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the country was reaping international recognition with its documentaries, film consciousness started to take shape among local cineastes. Among these was the pioneer Benedicto G. Pinga, the organizer of the short film festivals held in 1962 and 1964. He was one of the founders of the Filipino Society of Cinematographers and the FAMAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"rise\" name=\"rise\"></a>Rise of the Filipino Avant-garde </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the following years and after the windfall of awards bestowed on Philippine documentaries, the situation was anything but clear. While most professional filmmakers subscribed to the making of commercial films, only a few individual talents sprang up to create personal films, which were aimed at a select group of viewers. The urge to make films privately had its beginnings here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early examples are the works of Michael Parsons, an American residing in the Philippines. One of his short works was shown during the Fourth Manila Short Film Festival in 1984 where he and Virgilio &ldquo;Pandy&rdquo; Aviado were honored as pioneers of experimental filmmaking in the Philippines. Parson&rsquo;s works include black-and-white shorts like <b><i>The Wall </i></b>and<b> <i>Las Mu&ntilde;ecas</i></b><i> </i>(The Dolls).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the United States, a Filipino filmmaker made waves on the Greenwich Village film scene with his <b><i>On My Way to India Consciousness I Reached China.</i></b><i> </i>With this 16mm black-and-white work by Henry Francia, Philippine cinema reached a high point in experimental filmmaking. The film was praised highly by the high priest of the American underground, Jonas Mekas. That was the time when the New York film scene was dominated by the likes of Andy Warhol and Kenneth Anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, poet and dramatist Virginia Moreno and photographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4734\">Romy Vitug</a>, now multi-awarded cinematographer in commercial films, teamed up to make <b><i>Orfeo Marino</i></b>.<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4250\">Amable &ldquo;Tikoy&rdquo; Aguiluz VI</a> documented the practices of Rizal cultists in <b><i>Mt.

The feature-length film was premiered at the Young Filmmakers Forum of the Berlin Film Festival on 25 Jun 1977. It was awarded the International Federation of Film Critics jury prize for &ldquo;poesy and humor with which the cineaste describes the discovery of a new world.&rdquo; It also received special mention from the International Catholic Organisation for Cinema and a recommendation from the International Interchurch Film Organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the above filmmakers, however, remained isolated artists, apart even from each other. Remarkable films came from their private visions as artists but did not create a public cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"second\" name=\"second\"></a>The Second Independent Film Movement</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the milieu of social disorder and political confusion ushered in by martial law, the short film was reborn. This time it sought refuge in the volatile world of academe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of factors were responsible for the appearance of short films in the 1970s. Among them were the introduction of film courses in the universities and of workshops like those conducted by the Mowelfund Film Institute, and the communication departments of De La Salle University (DLSU), Ateneo de Manila University, and University of the Philippines (UP); the adoption of lightweight equipment such as Super 8, 16mm, and video; the relatively low cost of such equipment and stocks (as compared to 35mm); the availability of amateur talent; and to some extent, the presence of an audience, which until now remains largely untapped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Along with the events on the local independent film scene, many &ldquo;new&rdquo; cinemas were made available for viewing to the emerging young filmmakers. Foremost among them were New German Cinema through the Goethe-Institut Manila, the Nouvelle Vague<b> </b>screened at the French Embassy, as well as film programs offered by the embassies of Japan, India, Australia, Sweden, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also significant was the introduction and patronage of the Super 8 film by Kodak, introduced into the market in 1964. By the late 1970s, the Super 8 had encouraged practical filmmaking activities in the universities, resulting in the emergence of a new generation of amateur filmmakers. When the supply and processing of Super 8 films were drastically cut in the mid-1980s, many of the young filmmakers moved on to work in bigger film gauges, like those in 16mm and 35mm and also in video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of short films was further boosted when the Manila Short Film Festival was held on 20-24 Apr 1981 at the Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero Theater at the University of the Philippines. In a bid to promote alternative filmmaking, the festival geared itself to the development of short films at a time when the mass media were controlled by the dictatorship. The government&rsquo;s newly organized film outfit, the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP), also held its own short film competition, which helped to increase public recognition of the short film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The short films being turned out by young Filipino filmmakers manifest all the qualities of a new cinema. They employ new cinematic language and technique. Unlike most industry films, they uphold the personal creativity of the filmmakers. They seek new ways of producing and distributing films independent of the commercial systems, and they spawn a new, distinct set of beliefs, both creative and ideological. This was not the situation in the earlier short film movement, when many filmmakers succumbed to the allure of producing for multinational corporations, civic groups, and the dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Herein lies the great difference between the two movements in the independent cinema. The earlier films made in the 1960s were primarily commissioned by Caltex, the Rotary Club, or the NMPC. The short films made in the 1980s, on the other hand, were made through private initiatives, and thus were more radical and daring not only in the choice of their subjects, which were often political, but also in the forms they created for the stories. The film directors who came of age during the 20 years of the Marcos regime made films that were not possible in the early history of cinema in the country. Although they benefited from film courses and the introduction of the Super 8 film in the 1970s, these young film directors produced many of their important works in the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"redefining\" name=\"redefining\"></a>Redefining Philippine Cinema: The Radical Impulse</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1980s came like a double-edged sword for the Filipino people. With the country reeling under the Marcos dictatorship, media became politicized. The emergence of the radical media during a period of intense social tension brought about by the dictatorship led to the creation of alternative models of thinking and praxis outside the state-controlled media. After the 1986 EDSA Revolt that launched Cory Aquino&rsquo;s rise to the presidency, disappointment and frustration crept in when social reforms failed to live up to people&rsquo;s expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Out of the period of struggle soon emerged a new generation of filmmakers who would seek new ways of defining Philippine cinema. Existing outside the mainstream movie industry, they eagerly sought expression in gauges and genres other than those conventionalized by the narrative cinema, which had assumed the popular 35mm format. The struggle in society was expressed in the short, independent films, which were oppositional by nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the films of the mid-1980s, Philippine cinema was reinvented. This happened when Philippine film reached a somewhat productive period in political filmmaking through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a> and accommodated some voices of dissent, then declined as it became totally engulfed by sheer commercialism toward the end of the decade. Soon after the new government was installed, an avalanche of films catered only to the commercial demands of the film market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As life under the new government went on, it became apparent that the state of the country&rsquo;s cinematic art, as it was generally with the country&rsquo;s culture, was no major priority; thus, no clear-cut policies were made for its upliftment. In this scenario of chaos, the short, independent film began in its marginal way to become the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;other&rdquo; cinema, a counter-cinema. Its small, artisanal mode of production, supported mostly by individuals or institutions, made it strikingly different from the huge infrastructure of high finance and power politics governing commercial cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among contemporary short films, the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a> stand out as the epitome of the new Philippine cinema. His <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1222\"><strong>Ang Magpakailanman</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Eternity), 1983, set a standard that would forever recast Philippine cinema in a new mold of filmic creativity. His subsequent work, <b><i>Ang</i></b><i> <b>Hikab</b> </i>(The Yawn), 1984, and his earlier film, <b><i>Sining Ang</i></b><i> </i>(Art), 1983, project his private vision of a world peopled by solitary men and woman. His <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1199\"><strong>Kabaka</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Enemy), 1983, and <b><i>Kamada </i></b>(Mate), 1984, in collaboration with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4984\">Ian Victoriano</a>, explore human relationships against a sterile, if not oppressive, world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two dominant lines of aesthetic significance divide contemporary short filmmakers. One camp adheres to the tenet &ldquo;film as film,&rdquo; affirming that cinema should serve art. The investigation of form, the discovery of cinematic ideas, the application of innovative techniques, and the adoption of styles are the primary considerations of this camp. To this belong the experimental works, animations, and short features that are subjective in approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other camp believes that film must deal with social reality. These filmmakers go beyond the film material as they investigate the world they capture on celluloid. Loosely, the prime consideration is reality in whatever form it may assume, and the camera serves only as a tool to unravel the varied shades of reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The short films by the new generation of young directors won international prestige for the Philippines at a time when commercial cinema was churning out formula movies without regard for quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the Super 8 film trilogy of this writer&mdash;consisting of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, about a gay entertainer supporting his family in Tondo; <b><i>Children of the Regime</i></b>,<i> </i>1985, about abused and prostituted children; and <b><i>Revolutions Happen Like Refrains in a Song</i></b>,<i> </i>1987, about the hopes and frustrations of the 1986 EDSA Revolt&mdash;won the grand prize in the 9th International Super 8 and Video Festival in Brussels, Belgium. The films were also screened in major film festivals in New York, London, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Yamagata (Japan), and several other film capitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Raymond Red&rsquo;s <b><i>Sketches</i></b>,<i> </i>1988, won second prize at the Young Filmmakers Cinema Competition in Montreal, Canada, in 1988. In Kalibia, Tunisia, two animation films won prizes. The Special Jury Prize went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Tronong Puti </i></b>(White Throne), 1983, and the Bronze Prize to Juan and Mike Alcazaren&rsquo;s <b><i>Hari</i></b><i> </i>(King), 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, at the 12th International Super 8 and Video Festival in Belgium, this writer&rsquo;s video documentary <b><i>A Legacy of Violence </i></b>won the Best Documentary award. It was a video production made possible by a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts as part of a series on popular struggle in Asia. Earlier, <b><i>Tatay Na, Nanay Pa</i></b><i> </i>(The Father, Also a Mother) by Rowena Gonzalez won the Best Documentary prize at the same festival in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the 1991 International Video Mondial in Belgium, <b><i>Es</i></b><i> </i>by Juan Pula (aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\">Jon Red</a>) received the Special Jury Prize, and <b>&hellip;</b> <b><i>And Rain Fell in July</i></b><i> </i>by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a> was awarded the Prix de Emile Cantillon for Best Experimental Video. The production of Philippine short films coincided with the rise of cause-oriented groups and nongovernment organizations. Community-based organizations created their own sources of information to counter the falsehood and deception perpetrated by the Marcos-controlled media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Organizations that produced films outside the movie industry and that tried to counter the information dictated by the Marcos government included the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4788\">Communication Foundation for Asia (CFA)</a>, a religious-run media center. Aside from holding communication workshops, the CFA produced media materials, including feature films with topical issues like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sugat sa Ugat</i></b><i> </i>(Wound at the Root), 1980, which depicts the conflict between rural life and modernity as reflected in the antagonism between two generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CFA&rsquo;s greatest contributions are socially relevant documentaries: <b><i>Children of the Regime</i></b>,<i> </i>1985, which is about child prostitution; <b><i>A Spark of Courage</i></b>,<i> </i>1984, with the Goethe-Institut; and<b> <i>People&rsquo;s Power Revolution: The Philippine Experience</i></b>,<i> </i>1986. The CFA also published in 1985 the pioneering book <b><i>Short Film: Emergence of a New Philippine Cinema</i></b>,<i> </i>which chronicles the growth of independent cinema in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">AsiaVision is another nongovernment organization that has produced mainly progressive documentaries. Founded in 1982, AsiaVision documented the struggle for justice and democracy in the last years of the Marcos dictatorship. Its first documentary was <b><i>Sabangan</i></b>,<i> </i>1983, by Joe Cuaresma and Freddie Espiritu. The film discussed the conflict between a minority tribe being evicted to give way to a dam project of the government. Other important works from AsiaVision include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4701\">Lito Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Arrogance of Power</i></b>,<i> </i>1983, and <b><i>No Time for Crying</i></b>,<i> </i>1987 ;and Mike de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Signos </i></b>(Signs), 1983, and <b><i>Lakbayan </i></b>(Journey of the People), 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Super 8 films and videos that came out of academe comprised the main bulk of alternative cinema production. The leading producers of short films in the early 1980s were the Cinema-as-Art and Cinema Direct workshops conducted by the UP Film Center and the communication arts departments of Ateneo and DLSU, and the workshops held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund Film Institute (MFI)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the Super 8 crisis in the mid-1980s, only two institutions, the MFI and DLSU, assumed leadership as the country&rsquo;s main producers of short films and documentaries. Among the important works to come out from the academe were those made at the UP Film Center, like Raymond Red&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Magpakailanman</i></b>;<i> </i>at DLSU, like Nona Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Ka Satur</i></b>,<i> </i>1984; and at Ateneo, like Juan and Mike Alcazaren&rsquo;s claymation work, <b><i>Hari</i></b><i> </i>(King), 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At this time, the MFI maintained its leadership in developing young filmmakers. Headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a>, an actor-turned-politician who was elected vice president of the country in 1992, the MFI offered young filmmakers scholarships for studies abroad. Later it tied up with Ateneo de Manila University. Not until 1985, however, did the MFI assert its leadership when young filmmakers from the UP Film Center conducted workshops at the MFI, which ushered in the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of Philippine independent cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A steady stream of landmark films came out of the MFI workshops, which started out merely as an amateur endeavor in the early 1970s. The markings of a turbulent era, these films brought recognition to the country in various international gatherings. Tying up with the Goethe-Institut, the MFI ventured into 16mm filmmaking that saw the blossoming of a new cinema. Out of these workshops, particularly the ones conducted by Christoph Janetzko and under the directorship of Uwe Schmelter, came a number of now classic works, like Joey Agbayani&rsquo;s <b><i>Kidlat </i></b>(Lightning), 1989; Luis Quirino&rsquo;s <b><i>True Blue</i></b><i> <b>American Coconut Grove</b></i>,<i> </i>1989, and <b><i>Girl from Bikini Island</i></b>,<i> </i>1989; Ricky Orellana, Mike Alcazaren, and Jo Atienza&rsquo;s <b><i>Sa Maynila</i></b><i> </i>(In Manila), 1989; Roxlee&rsquo;s <b><i>Spit/Optik</i></b>,<i> </i>1989; Mario Guzman&rsquo;s <b><i>Dungaw</i></b><i> </i>(Lament), 1990; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4469\">Cesar Hernando</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5355\">Eli Guieb III</a>, and Jimbo Albano&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Kala</strong> wan</i></b><i><strong>g</strong> </i>(Rust), 1990; and other experimental works. With these films, experimental cinema reached a high level never before seen in local film history. Also produced in these German-sponsored workshops were 16mm documentaries, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ynang-Bayan: To Be a Woman Is to Live at a Time of War</i></b>,<i> </i>1990; and <b><i>Masakit sa Mata</i></b><i> </i>(Hurting the Eye), 1990, made by a group of young documentarists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4443\">Joseph Fortin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4317\">Ditsi Carolino</a>, and Cesar Hernando.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kidlat Tahimik has produced some of the most monumental visual works in Philippine alternative cinema. His <b><i>I Am Furious Yellow</i></b>,<i> </i>1989, documents the changes in Philippine society over a period of more than 10 years as seen through the eyes of his children. <b><i>I Am Furious</i></b><i> </i>&hellip; and another Tahimik film, <b><i>Ynang Bayan </i></b>(Motherland),<b> </b>were featured at the 1990 Yamagata International Documentary Festival in Japan. Tahimik has even produced films independent of the independent movement in Manila, because he stays in his Baguio mountain refuge. Aside from his <b><i>Perfumed Nightmare</i></b>,<i> </i>which has given him and the country international honors, he has made other films like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1312\"><strong>Turumba</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, and <b><i>Yanki: Made in Hongkong</i></b>, 1982.<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is also important to note that while young film artists have sought refuge in academe for their creative fulfillment, several other cultural agencies have furthered the gains made in alternative cinema. Foremost among them is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5205\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) which has taken over the work earlier undertaken by the now defunct ECP. The CCP supports young artists in the making of short films through its annual short film and video competition. It also produces such films through film grants and conducts a nationwide outreach program that makes it possible for the short films to be seen outside Manila. Among the short films completed with CCP grants are the following: Raymond Red&rsquo;s <b><i>Pepe</i></b>,<i> </i>1989; Lito Tiongson&rsquo;s <b><i>Isang Munting Lupa</i></b><i> </i>(A Little Land), 1989; Roque Lee&rsquo;s <b><i>Cesar Asar&rsquo;s Box</i></b>,<i> </i>1989; Ian Victoriano&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Bisperas</strong> </i></b>(The Night Before), 1989; and Luis Quirino&rsquo;s <b><i>Naaalala Ko si Dante</i></b><i> </i>(I Remember Dante), 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a sign that alternative cinema has changed the topography of Philippine cinema, major film institutions have saluted works of independent cinema. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a> has instituted the best student award in its annual awards rites, offering both trophies and cash incentives. Awards for short films are now also part of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Gawad Urian</a>, occasionally of the FAMAS and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\">Catholic Mass Media Awards</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indeed, the short film movement that started at UP has gone far in remolding our country&rsquo;s film culture. Since the first works in the 1980s, the young filmmakers have moved on significantly into larger gauges such as 16mm and 35mm films. In doing so, they have sought greater audiences without necessarily compromising their ideals as committed artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A case in point is Raymond Red, who came up with his first full-length feature film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Hero), 1992. Funding for the film came from ZDF, a German television company, while Red was a resident artist in Berlin. Blown up to 35mm, the film was released commercially after its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In no other period in Philippine cinema has there been an array of works as varied in form, style, and vision as now. As this writer noted in 1985, the young filmmakers vividly manifest through their works new ways of regarding the film image: (1) there is a conscious articulation of film as a plastic material that can photograph, or be painted upon, scratched, or anything that the filmmaker wishes to do with the film material; (2) there is a high degree of perception of social reality that brings to light many unrevealed nuances of political, economic, and social life; (3) there emanates from among the works a subjective reality of the filmmakers where the strong recurrence of dreams both as subject and technique informs us of the restless attitude that these young artists have in relation to their society; and (4) there is also a tendency in some works to tread on abstraction using film&rsquo;s formalistic elements to purge cinema of its narrative values while at the same time subverting commonly held attitudes to foster new perceptions and uses of the cinematic art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From these ways of regarding film&mdash;anti-illusion, socially relevant, subjective, abstract&mdash;spring the three dominant properties of the new cinema: experimentation, realism, and independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The independent cinema or the &ldquo;other&rdquo; cinema basks in newfound creative energy. The new short and independent films do not just present the collective unconscious of the young generation but also taps the creative wellsprings from which might someday flow the mainstream of Philippine cinema.&nbsp; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Carunungan</a> reports that &#x201C;in 1921 and 1922, the Nepomucenos (brothers Jose and Jesus) were commissioned by the United States government to make a series of documentary films showing the most important industries in the Philippines. The purpose was to show the American people the richness of our resources and the Philippines&#x2019; tremendous potentials for industrial development. One of the most impressive of these fourteen films was the one about the hemp industry, which showed all the facets of abaca production, from planting to exportation.&#x201D; In addition, the Nepomucenos became the local correspondents for Paramount News and Pathe News. In fact, in 1923 Pathe News commissioned them to cover the disastrous earthquake that hit Japan in spite of the fact that there were film people in Shanghai, which was nearer to Japan than Manila. Unfortunately, none of the works by the Nepomuceno brothers are extant. Such films, more than <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Country Maiden), 1919, could have offered us insights into the kind of image representation the Nepomucenos made at the time when the US presence was already established in the country. Carunungan also cites Faustino Lichauco, who organized Victoria Pictures, one of the first newsreel-and-documentary film outfits in Asia, which concentrated on &#x201C;reviews and views.&#x201D;"

Alternative filmmakers consciously challenge the normative modes of mainstream filmmaking. Thus, alternative films are, quite literally, an alternative to the standardized and rather predictable films produced by the movie industry. These films&mdash;whether in the form of a full-length feature film, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1071\"><b>short film</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1060\"><b>animated film</b></a>, music video, film or video art installation, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1062\"><b>documentary film</b></a>&mdash;are produced outside or within the peripheries of the movie industry where the filmmaker has more freedom to experiment either with the film&rsquo;s &ldquo;content&rdquo; (structurally idiosyncratic stories/characters), &ldquo;form&rdquo; (unconventional approach to cinematography, art direction, music, editing), or both. Hence, alternative cinema is traditionally synonymous with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\"><b>experimental</b></a>, <b>avant-garde</b>, or <b>art house cinema</b> and appeals to a niche audience rather than a mass audience. Alternative films are viewed as serious artistic works and are primarily made for aesthetic and/or personal reasons rather than commercial profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, certain developments within the last 20 years have widened the scope of alternative cinema in the Philippines and made it accessible even to mainstream audiences. The entry in the consumer market of a relatively affordable set of new technologies related to film production, such as high-definition digital video cameras and nonlinear video editing, has drastically reduced the cost of film production, thus giving other aspiring filmmakers the option to go into independent, or &ldquo;indie,&rdquo; film production where they are not subservient to the whims of studio executives and movie stars and they have more room to create original and nonformulaic stories. Thus, alternative cinema today is more synonymous with <b>independent </b>or<b> &ldquo;indie&rdquo; cinema</b>, whether or not a certain independent film is classified as experimental or avant-garde. Its emphasis is no longer confined to the film&rsquo;s conceptualization (content/form) but extends as well to its production (independently financed) and distribution (alternative means of screening and marketing).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the starting points of alternative cinema in the Philippines is often credited to Eric de Guia, or famously known by his artist name&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a>. His 1977 debut film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1218\"><strong>Mababangong Bangungot</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Perfumed Nightmare</i></b>), set the tone for avant-garde filmmaking, Filipino style. It won theF&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de la Presse Cin&eacute;matographique (FIPRESCI) Award at the 1977 Berlin Film Festival. By the 1980s, more filmmakers followed in Tahimik&rsquo;s path. The most recognized among them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a>, Roque Lee (aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>. Deocampo would later spearhead the annual filmmaking workshop at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund Film Institute (MFI)</a>. By the 1990s, the MFI workshops, where Red and Roxlee routinely served as guest lecturers, turned into the most sought-after summer workshop for aspiring filmmakers and cineastes. Over the years, participants in the MFI workshops would become recognized names in Philippine alternative cinema; some have even successfully crossed over into the mainstream. These include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4542\">Mark Meily</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a>, Topel Lee, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4500\">Armando &ldquo;Bing&rdquo; Lao</a>, Aloy Adlawan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\">Jon Red</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4469\">Cesar Hernando</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4367\">Neil Daza</a>, Robert Quebral, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4442\">Odyssey Flores</a>, Joey Agbayani, Ricky Orellana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4730\">Paolo Villaluna</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4615\">Ellen Ramos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4317\">Ditsi Carolino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4359\">Sari Dalena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3497\">Kiri Dalena</a>, Ellen Ongkeko-Marfil, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\">Lavrente &quot;Lav&quot; Diaz</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"cinema\" name=\"cinema\"></a>Cinema in the 1990s </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s saw the unexpected death of two of Philippine cinema&rsquo;s great masters. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> died in a car accident on 21 May 1991 at the age of 52, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a> would pass away five years later on 2 Jun 1996 at the age of 57. The death of these two great artists was a big loss to the movie industry, as they were still actively making movies at the time of their passing. The younger <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a>, the last of the Second Golden Age&rsquo;s triumvirate of great directors, went into hibernation in the 1990s, producing only two films: the short film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1102\"><b><i><strong>Aliw</strong>an Paradise</i></b></a> (Entertainment Paradise), 1992, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1120\"><b><i><strong>Bayani</strong>ng 3rd World</i></b> </a>(Third World Hero), 1999. Despite de Leon&rsquo;s meager output, <b><i><strong>Aliwan Paradise</strong> </i></b> and <b><i><strong>Bayaning 3rd World</strong> </i></b>, which he co-wrote with Clodualdo del Mundo Jr, were produced outside of the mainstream (with de Leon personally financing <b><i>Bayaning 3rd World</i></b>) and remain to be his most successful experimental films to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thus, the 1990s was a dismal period for the movie industry, despite its substantial output. It became a decade dominated once again by the same formulaic and inane stories shot in a relatively short time and modest budget, with the expectation of making a quick return on the producer&rsquo;s investment. This was an era of the usual titillating films, unrealistic action movies, over-the-top dramas, and movies with absolutely meaningless titles&mdash;for example, <b><i>Manchichiritchit</i></b>, 1993; <b><i>Haba-baba-doo! Puti-puti-poo!</i></b>, 1998; <b><i>Tiktaktoys: My Kolokotoys</i></b>, 1999; <b><i>Isprikitik: Walastik Kung Pumitik</i></b>,<i> </i>1999, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Probably the most significant development in the 1990s that directly affected Philippine cinema was the rise of television as the most accessible source of entertainment and information for the masses. The two biggest television networks in the country, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4842\">GMA</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, became bitter rivals in the fight for ratings. Attracted by the prospect of a more steady income, movie actors flocked to television and began starring in soap operas and appearing in variety shows. Soon, the networks started developing, grooming, and promoting their own stable of talents. Soap operas and variety shows became the network&rsquo;s main attraction and were assigned to primetime slots. Broadcast programming became centralized in order to ensure that primetime programs are constantly promoted in almost every show. In their quest for total domination of the Philippine mediascape, both networks also established their own film production outfits&mdash;GMA Films for GMA and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> for ABS-CBN&mdash;overshadowing the once dominant <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>. In order to survive, both Regal and Viva Films began co-producing with either GMA Films or Star Cinema in almost all their succeeding projects. Because film production became a mere appendage of the networks and more and more people chose to stay home and watch television, the movie industry&rsquo;s output would be significantly reduced by the end of the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, probably as a reaction to the spate of mindless films manufactured by the industry and the ascendance of television as the new dominant entertainment medium, alternative film practice continued to flourish in the 1990s. Raymond Red finally went into full-length production with the psychological historical drama <b><i>Bayani</i></b> (Hero), 1992, a film about the life of revolutionary leader <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> (played by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4406\">Julio Diaz</a>). Funded by ZDF, a German television company, <b><i>Bayani</i></b> became an early alternative film to be screened commercially, albeit for a short period and in a limited number of theaters. A quick follow-up came in the revisionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1276\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>,<b> </b>1993, a film about Macario Sakay (again played by Julio Diaz), a former member of the Katipunan who became the last Filipino rebel leader to surrender to the Americans. As if acknowledging the importance of television in reaching a wider audience, Red was even persuaded by GMA Network to direct a made-for-TV movie. The result was <b><i>Kamada</i> </b>(Companion), 1997, an adaptation of a 1984 short film which Red made in collaboration with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4984\">Ian Victoriano</a>. Red ended the decade by becoming the first Filipino to win the coveted Cannes Film Festival Palme d&rsquo;Or for his short film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1105\"><b><i><strong>Ani</strong>no</i></b> </a>(Shadow), 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the main problems of alternative filmmakers in the 1990s was the lack of venues where they could showcase their works since these were generally perceived by major theater owners as appealing only to a small select audience and thus with low commercial prospects. There was also minimal support coming from government agencies and the movie industry. A few film festivals, particularly the Quezon City International Super 8 Film Festival, were organized in the 1980s but these proved to be short-lived. Only the yearly MFI film workshops continued, culminating in a public screening of the films produced by the participants. Unfortunately while the event took place in a major movie theater, the screening only happened in one evening, severely limiting the potential of these films to reach a bigger audience. As a result, filmmakers were forced to bring their films to international festivals abroad where audiences and critics were more open to alternative films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"advent\" name=\"advent\"></a>The Advent of Digital Technology</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Mowelfund Film Institute started giving workshops in the 1980s, the films produced by their participants were shot in 8mm film. By the 1990s, through sponsorship from Kodak Philippines and the Philippine Information Agency, MFI shifted to the slightly bigger 16mm format, making it the standard format for alternative films. The 16mm film stock is considered much closer in scope to the 35mm format used in commercial filmmaking and can actually be &ldquo;blown up&rdquo; to 35mm&mdash;that is, optically re-photographing the film in order to produce a 35mm print&mdash;for possible theatrical release. However, by the end of the decade, a new technology would emerge that would challenge the supremacy of celluloid film&mdash;the digital video camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the video camcorder was first released by the Japanese electronics company Sony in 1983 for the general consumer, it quickly set the standard for recording home footage. The first-generation camcorder typically rested on the shoulder of the user and used a Betamax cassette for recording, but what made it so popular was that it was virtually a portable television studio with the ability to offer instant playback. With just the push of a button, users could easily watch the footage they just shot. They could also use a video cassette player and watch the footage on their television sets. Subsequent modifications by Sony led to smaller and more portable cameras but with improved image quality, such as the compact video cassette (Video8) and the Hi8 in the early 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the mid-1980s, Sony started developing high-definition cameras but it was met with little enthusiasm by consumers. However, in 1997, with the introduction of the Sony&nbsp;<span style=\"text-underline:none\">HD CAM</span> (high-definition camera) recorders and professional video cameras based on&nbsp;<span style=\"text-underline:none\">CCD</span> (charge-coupled device) technology, the idea, now re-branded as &ldquo;digital cinematography,&rdquo; began to attract the attention of alternative filmmakers. The &ldquo;main attraction&rdquo; of these high-definition digital video cameras was that the images were so sharp and the sound so clear that its overall quality already approximated that of celluloid film. Furthermore, digital video cameras were cheaper and therefore more accessible compared to film. The same applied to the ancillary tools that were compatible with <b>digital video</b>, such as nonlinear editing, digital sound design and mixing, and a host of other tools used for filmmaking and animation. Thus, with digital video, the cost of production became noticeably lower compared to that of celluloid film. It now became the &ldquo;medium of choice&rdquo; for alternative filmmakers working outside of the movie industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Interestingly, the first significant filmmaker to experiment with video was actually from an earlier generation. During the video explosion in the 1980s, Mike de Leon tried his hand at making a film using this new medium. The result was <b><i>Bilanggo sa Dilim</i></b><i> </i>(Prisoner in the Dark), 1986, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4706\">Joel Torre</a> and inspired by John Fowles&rsquo;s novel <b><i>The Collector</i></b>. Unfortunately, probably due to the difficulty in adjusting to a new and seldom-used medium (for feature films at the time), no other notable filmmaker in the 1980s followed in de Leon&rsquo;s footsteps. By the 1990s, Kidlat Tahimik also made the shift to video. His decision to use video seems to suit his style as an avant-garde filmmaker. His short film <b><i>Orbit 50: Letter to My Three Sons</i></b>, 1992, celebrates his 50th birthday, or, in Tahimik&rsquo;s view, his 50th orbit around the sun. The film is a collection of home video footage of his three sons: Kidlat, Kawayan, and Kabunyan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first notable independent filmmakers to use digital video were Jon Red (brother of Raymond Red), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a>, and Lav Diaz. Jon Red&rsquo;s first foray into video was a short film he shot using a camcorder. <b><i>Es</i></b>, 1988, is a 12-minute video that won 1st Prize in the Experimental Video Category at the 2nd Gawad CCP para sa Alternatibong Pelikula at Video in 1988 and a Special Jury Prize at the 1991 Mondiale de la Video in Brussels, Belgium. When digital video was introduced in the mid-1990s, Red was among the first to use digital video for a full-length feature film. <b><i>Still Lives</i></b>, 1999, stars industry veteran Joel Torre together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2804\">Nonie Buencamino</a>, Alan Paule, and Ynez Veneracion. It screened as an official selection in the 2000 Singapore International Film Festival. He followed this up with <b><i>ASTIGmatism</i></b>, 2004, featuring a more mainstream cast of actors led by action superstar <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\">Robin Padilla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4538\">Albert Martinez</a>, Francis Magalona, Jeffrey Quizon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4394\">Alessandra de Rossi</a>. It won the Silver DV (Digital Video) Award at the 28th Hong Kong International Film Festival. The fact that Red was able to get the likes of Robin Padilla and Albert Martinez for his film is proof that alternative films are getting the attention of mainstream viewers and the movie industry itself. Over the years, Red&rsquo;s use of well-known mainstream actors in his films would serve as a template for the next generation of alternative filmmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Khavn de la Cruz is a prolific filmmaker who made as many as 11 short films in one year. However, he is not known for one specific film but by the sheer volume of his body of work, not to mention the fact that he is also a literary writer (he has published a collection of poems, short stories, and a novel) and musician (he is a pianist who writes the music for his own films and fronts a radical punk rock band called The Brockas). More importantly, unlike other alternative filmmakers who still dream of shooting in celluloid film, de la Cruz really started with video and has used video ever since. He is a true pioneer in digital filmmaking in the Philippines. He does not only promote the use of digital video but, because he is an astute writer and essayist, he also theorizes about its role in the development of Philippine cinema. He wrote a manifesto, entitled &ldquo;Digital Dekalogo: A Manifesto for a Filmless Philippines,&rdquo; and posted it in his own website. Part of it reads: &ldquo;Digital film, with its qualities of mobility, flexibility, intimacy, and accessibility, is the apt medium for a Third World country like the Philippines&hellip; The digital revolution has reduced the emphasis on technology and has reasserted the centrality of the filmmaker, the importance of the human condition over visual junk food&rdquo; (de la Cruz 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The familiar &ldquo;Filmless Films presents &hellip; This is not a film by Khavn&rdquo; that appears in the credits of almost all of de la Cruz&rsquo;s films was inspired by the famous painting of Belgian artist Ren&eacute; Magritte entitled <b><i>La Trahison des Images</i></b> (The Treachery of Images), 1928-29. The painting shows a pipe, and below it Magritte painted &ldquo;<i>Ceci n&rsquo;est pas une pipe</i>&rdquo;<i> </i>(This is not a pipe), which means that it really is not a pipe but simply an image (or painting) of a pipe. For de la Cruz to say &ldquo;This is not a film by Khavn&rdquo; suggests a difference in the medium used. His films are still called &ldquo;film&rdquo; simply because it is a general term people use to refer to any cinematographic work, but, at the same time, it is no longer a film in the sense that the format or medium used is no longer celluloid film but digital video. Hence, &ldquo;filmless&rdquo; film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, the elder Lav Diaz started making feature films for Regal Films in the late 1990s. He was part of the so-called pito-pito (seven-seven) films that Regal Films matriarch Lily Monteverde developed as a means of discovering new talent but with less financial risk. Pito-pito refers to seven days of principal photography and seven days of postproduction, though it really means that the film should be shot, edited, and ready for theatrical release in less than a month. Despite the seemingly disadvantageous setup, Monteverde was able to provide an opportunity to a lot of aspiring filmmakers including the then-unknown Diaz and another equally noteworthy filmmaker, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4485\">Jeffrey Jeturian</a>, who made the standout film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1279\"><strong>Sana Pag-ibig Na</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Enter Love</i></b>), 1998, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1265\"><strong>Pila Balde</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Fetch a Pail of Water</i></b>), 1999. Jeturian went on to make the internationally acclaimed independent digital film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1208\"><strong>Kubrador</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Bet Collector</i></b>), 2006, and <b><i>Ekstra</i></b> (<b><i>The Bit Player</i></b>), 2013, which won the Audience Award, Special Jury Prize, the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema Award, Best Screenplay, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actress in the Directors Showcase of the 2013 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Between 1998 and 1999, Diaz made three films for Regal Films. His debut work, <b><i>Serafin Geronimo: Kriminal ng Barrio Concepcion</i></b> (<b><i>The Criminal of Barrio Concepcion</i></b>), 1998, already showed that Diaz&rsquo;s narrative is not common in the mainstream. He followed this up with the more experimental <b><i>Burger Boys</i></b>, 1999, and the visually splendid <b><i>Hubad sa Ilalim ng Buwan</i></b> (<b><i>Naked under the Moon</i></b>), 1999. However, he discovered the true nature of his cinema when he converted to digital video beginning with his five-hour independently produced opus <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1117\"><strong>Batang West Side</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>West Side Kid</i></b>), 2001. Since then he has been challenging the way audiences watch films by coming up with unusually lengthy narratives, such as the 10-hour <b><i>Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Filipino</i></b> (<b><i>Evolution of a Filipino Family</i></b>), 2004, a chronicle of a peasant family&rsquo;s struggle for survival through the dementia of the Marcos regime&rsquo;s martial law years; <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1201\">Kagadanan sa <strong>Banwa</strong> an ning mga Engkanto</a>&nbsp;</strong></i></b>(<b><i>Death in the Land of Encantos</i></b>), 2007, a nine-hour film about a leftist poet who returns to his hometown in a Bicol province after years of living in exile in metropolitan Russia; and <b><i>Melancholia</i></b>, 2008, a seven-and-a-half-hour film that tells the story of three people engaged in a strange therapy to get away from their agonies. His four-hour film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1250\"><b><i>Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan</i></b></a> (<b><i>Norte, The End of History</i></b>), 2013, explores themes of crime, class, and family. It was included in the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. It also won the Best Director award in the international section of the 2013 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4337\">Cinemanila International Film Festival</a>. Diaz&rsquo;s belief in digital video&rsquo;s ability to revolutionize the way films are made and, to a certain extent, exhibited led him to boldly declare in an interview: &ldquo;Digital changes everything &hellip; This is liberation cinema now. Digital is liberation theology&rdquo; (Baumg&auml;rtel 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"rise\" name=\"rise\"></a>The Rise of Indie Films</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As if to acknowledge that digital filmmaking has indeed arrived, two film festivals dedicated solely to digital films opened in 2005. First was the Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, which was organized by the Cinemalaya Foundation and supported by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. Its aim is to select 10 aspiring filmmakers with the most original or unique idea and give them the chance to make it into a film by providing each filmmaker a seed grant of 500,000 pesos. Cinemalaya really ushered in the Philippine New Wave Cinema of the 21st century. In its first year, Cinemalaya gave the Best Picture award to <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1264\"><strong>Pepot Artista</strong></a></i></b> (Pepot Superstar), written and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a>. Coincidentally, del Mundo also wrote the screenplay exactly 30 years earlier for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, the Lino Brocka film which in turn signaled the beginning of a new wave in Filipino movies in the 1970s, later referred to as Philippine cinema&rsquo;s Second Golden Age. Another standout film from the first Cinemalaya was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1257\"><b><i><strong>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo <strong>Oliver</strong>os</strong> </i></b></a> (<b><i>The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros</i></b>), written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4737\">Michiko Yamamoto</a> and directed by Auraeus Solito, which won the Special Jury Prize and was later awarded Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing in the 2006 Gawad Urian. The film went on to win the Swarovski Trophy for Best Film at the 2005 Asian Film Festival. It also won in three categories&mdash;Crystal Bear&ndash;Special Mention (for Best Feature Film), the Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk Grand Prix (for Best Feature Film), and the Teddy (for Best Feature Film)&mdash;at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second digital film festival/competition to come out in 2005 was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals</a>, a pet project of Cinema One, the cable channel owned by ABS-CBN, the country&rsquo;s largest television network. The festival boasts of a bigger seed money (beginning at 700,000 pesos and later raised to one million pesos) and because it is an ABS-CBN project, it somehow puts the filmmakers a step closer to the mainstream especially since they get to use the actors from ABS-CBN&rsquo;s pool of talents. Some of the notable films from Cinema One Originals are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a> and Ruel Dahis Antipuesto&rsquo;s <b><i>Confessional</i></b>, 2007, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1188\"><strong>Imburnal</strong></a></i></b> (Sewer), 2008, and Jet Leyco&rsquo;s <b><i>Bukas Na Lang Sapagkat Gabi Na</i></b> (<b><i>Leave It for Tomorrow for Night Has Fallen</i></b>), 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Realizing the vast potential of digital films in cinema&rsquo;s future, even the Cinemanila International Film Festival (founded by filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4250\">Amable &ldquo;Tikoy&rdquo; Aguiluz</a> in 1999) added a Digital Lokal section beginning in 2006. This is where internationally acclaimed indie filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4537\">Raya Martin</a> was first recognized. His 2007 entry <b><i>Autohystoria</i></b> won the Lino Brocka Award (Best Picture) and Best Director Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another major contribution of Cinemalaya and Cinema One is that they opened their doors to filmmakers from other regions. The sudden surge in film activity from the provinces has challenged the dominance of Metro Manila as the sole center of film activity in the past decades. Films from this new breed include Davao-based filmmaker Sherad Anthony Sanchez&rsquo;s Cinema One entry&nbsp;<b><i><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Huling Balyan ng Buhi o Ang Sinalirap nga Asoy Nila</span></i></b> (<b><i>The Last Priestess of Buhi or Woven <strong>Stories</strong> of the Other</i></b>), 2006;<b> </b>Jay Abello&rsquo;s Cinemalaya entry <b><i>Namets!</i></b> (Delicious), 2008, which was written in Hiligaynon and shot entirely in Negros Occidental; Mindanao-based and MFI alumnus <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4528\">Gutierrez Mangansakan II</a>&rsquo;s Cinemalaya entry <b><i>Limbunan</i></b> (<b><i>The Bridal Quarters</i></b>), 2010, and Cinema One Originals entry <b><i>Cartas de <strong>Soledad</strong> </i></b> (<b><i>Letters of Solitude</i></b>), 2011; and the Palawan-born Auraeus Solito&rsquo;s Cinemalaya entry <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1136\"><strong>Busong</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Palawan Fate</i></b>), 2011, and Cinema One Originals entry <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1121\"><strong>Baybayin</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Palawan Script</i></b>), 2012. The rise of so-called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/20/1057\"><b>regional films</b></a> led the Cinema Committee of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a> to organize the annual Cinema Rehiyon, a film festival that began in 2008 and travels to different provinces in the Philippines to showcase films from various regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Independent filmmaking also gave rise to another important filmmaker: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4543\">Brillante Mendoza</a>. Mendoza began his career as a production designer for Chito Ro&ntilde;o and Tata Esteban in the late 1980s. By the 1990s, he left the movie industry to pursue a very successful career in television commercials. He returned to the film scene in 2005 as an independent filmmaker with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1229\"><strong>Masahista</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>The Masseur</i></b>). The film won the Golden Leopard for Video at Locarno International Film Festival, the Audience Award at Torino International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival, and the Interfaith Award at Brisbane International Film Festival. Mendoza would then make eight more feature films within the next five years. More importantly, he would indeed live up to his name (Brillante means &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; in English) by being nominated for the Palme d&rsquo;Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival for his movie <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1288\"><strong>Serbis</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Service), 2008, and eventually winning the Best Director award at Cannes the following year for his unapologetically brutal <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1206\"><strong>Kinatay</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Execution of P.</i></b>). With that victory, Mendoza was able to once again secure a place for Philippine cinema in the world stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finally, the relative easiness of using digital film inspired more independently produced documentary films. A pioneer in this kind of cinema is Ditsi Carolino. Her <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1235\"><strong>Minsan Lang Sila Bata</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Children Only Once</i></b>), 1996, which she co-directed with Sadhana Buxani, exposes the harsh conditions of child labor in the Philippines and was even shown on local television.

With the worldwide success of some alternative films in the last 10 years and the fact that alternative films are attracting more and more mainstream audiences, one can say that Philippine cinema is probably going through its third golden age. Even movie industry stalwarts, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4540\">Erik Matti</a>, Joyce Bernal, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4590\">Piolo Pascual</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4748\">Dawn Zulueta</a>, have also been inspired to independently produce movies that the mainstream might consider commercially not feasible. In recent years, mainstream movie companies have even agreed to co-produce with smaller independent companies, resulting in notable films such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4324\">Jade Castro</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Zombadings: Patayin sa Shokot si Remington</i></b> (<b><i>Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings</i></b>), 2011, a co-production of Origin8 Media and Reality Entertainment (a film company co-founded by Erik Matti and Dondon Monteverde, son of Regal Films matriarch Lily Monteverde), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1108\"><strong>Ang Babae sa Septic Tank</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Woman in the Septic Tank</i></b>), 2011, which was later distributed commercially by Star Cinema. Thus, one important trend now is the merging of mainstream and independent companies to produce films that are different from the usual mainstream fare but still accessible to a wide audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, this merging might also mean that some indie filmmakers have been co-opted by the industry. Some filmmakers even use indie filmmaking simply as a way to be noticed by the mainstream. This may not come as a surprise since a major studio means a bigger budget and the assurance that the film will be better promoted and shown in major movie theaters. However, the presence of a major studio also puts into question the integrity of the indie filmmaker. How much creative control will the indie filmmaker give up now that he or she has to answer to producers whose primary interest is to make profit? Up to what extent will the indie filmmaker give in to the demands of movie stars? And finally, with major studio backing, can the indie filmmaker still challenge the conventions of mainstream filmmaking and produce a film that serves as an alternative to commercial cinema?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"purpose\" name=\"purpose\"></a>A Purpose for the Future</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With this ongoing trend, what does the future hold for alternative cinema? Will alternative cinema be fully co-opted by the movie industry and become just another label?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps, some answers may be gathered from the development of alternative cinema thus far. First, while some indie filmmakers would rather join the mainstream and give up their independence in exchange for bigger budgets and movie stars, there remain a good number of film artists who operate and even flourish outside the commercial system. They are the true independent-alternative filmmakers. The films of Lav Diaz, Raymond Red, Brillante Mendoza, Khavn de la Cruz, Raya Martin, Ditsi Carolino, Gutierrez Mangansakan II, and Auraeus Solito, just to name a few, continue to defy cinematic conventions and make us rethink the way we look at movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Second, the nature and purpose of alternative cinema is to challenge the normative modes of mainstream filmmaking and offer audiences an &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; to the standardized and predictable fare produced by the industry. While mainstream movies offer audiences a temporary escape from real life, alternative films often confront societal problems head-on. Thus, the stories alternative filmmakers tell are more variegated precisely because they are drawn from everyday life. They represent our collective experiences as Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Third, the steady rise in regional filmmaking is also something to look forward to because it signifies a decentralization of film activity that has been focused solely on Metro Manila for the past decades. After all, if alternative cinema is indeed an alternative to mainstream cinema, then it ought to include filmmakers from other regions and promote diversity in film production. Regional filmmakers who create stories situated in their home province and written in their own dialect also pose a challenge to the dominant narrative forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finally, alternative cinema may never have an audience as big as mainstream cinema. Its budget may never come close to commercial films and it will probably never earn as much (despite the fact that many alternative films have brought honor to our country). Most of the major movie stars of the day will continue to shy away from appearing in alternative films. In spite of all this, alternative cinema will continue to exist and flourish if only to remind audiences that there is more to cinema than mere mindless entertainment. The cinema can also be used as a mirror by which we can examine our individual and collective experiences.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Elvin Valerio</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>BaumgaÌˆrtel, Tilman. 2007. &ldquo;Lav Diaz: Digital Is Liberation Theology.&rdquo; <em>Green Cine Daily Blogs</em>, 7 Sep. www.greencine.com/central/ lavdiaz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>de la Cruz, Khavn [with Dodo Dayao and Mabie Alagbate], ed. 2010. <em>Philippine New Wave: This Is Not a Film Movement</em>.

The entry in the consumer market of a relatively affordable set of new technologies related to film production, such as high-definition digital video cameras and nonlinear video editing, has drastically reduced the cost of film production, thus giving other aspiring filmmakers the option to go into independent, or &#x201C;indie,&#x201D; film production where they are not subservient to the whims of studio executives and movie stars and they have more room to create original and nonformulaic stories. Thus, alternative cinema today is more synonymous with <b>independent </b>or<b> &#x201C;indie&#x201D; cinema</b>, whether or not a certain independent film is classified as experimental or avant-garde. Its emphasis is no longer confined to the film&#x2019;s conceptualization (content/form) but extends as well to its production (independently financed) and distribution (alternative means of screening and marketing)."

His 1977 debut film, <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1218\"><strong>Mababangong Bangungot</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Perfumed Nightmare</i></b>), set the tone for avant-garde filmmaking, Filipino style. It won theF&#xE9;d&#xE9;ration Internationale de la Presse Cin&#xE9;matographique (FIPRESCI) Award at the 1977 Berlin Film Festival. By the 1980s, more filmmakers followed in Tahimik&#x2019;s path. The most recognized among them were <a href=\"/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a>, Roque Lee (aka <a href=\"/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>), and <a href=\"/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>. Deocampo would later spearhead the annual filmmaking workshop at the <a href=\"/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund Film Institute (MFI)</a>. By the 1990s, the MFI workshops, where Red and Roxlee routinely served as guest lecturers, turned into the most sought-after summer workshop for aspiring filmmakers and cineastes. Over the years, participants in the MFI workshops would become recognized names in Philippine alternative cinema; some have even successfully crossed over into the mainstream.

The two biggest television networks in the country, <a href=\"/8/69/4842\">GMA</a> and <a href=\"/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, became bitter rivals in the fight for ratings. Attracted by the prospect of a more steady income, movie actors flocked to television and began starring in soap operas and appearing in variety shows. Soon, the networks started developing, grooming, and promoting their own stable of talents. Soap operas and variety shows became the network&#x2019;s main attraction and were assigned to primetime slots. Broadcast programming became centralized in order to ensure that primetime programs are constantly promoted in almost every show. In their quest for total domination of the Philippine mediascape, both networks also established their own film production outfits&#x2014;GMA Films for GMA and <a href=\"/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> for ABS-CBN&#x2014;overshadowing the once dominant <a href=\"/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a> and <a href=\"/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>. In order to survive, both Regal and Viva Films began co-producing with either GMA Films or Star Cinema in almost all their succeeding projects.

There was also minimal support coming from government agencies and the movie industry. A few film festivals, particularly the Quezon City International Super 8 Film Festival, were organized in the 1980s but these proved to be short-lived. Only the yearly MFI film workshops continued, culminating in a public screening of the films produced by the participants. Unfortunately while the event took place in a major movie theater, the screening only happened in one evening, severely limiting the potential of these films to reach a bigger audience. As a result, filmmakers were forced to bring their films to international festivals abroad where audiences and critics were more open to alternative films."

With just the push of a button, users could easily watch the footage they just shot. They could also use a video cassette player and watch the footage on their television sets. Subsequent modifications by Sony led to smaller and more portable cameras but with improved image quality, such as the compact video cassette (Video8) and the Hi8 in the early 1990s."

The &#x201C;main attraction&#x201D; of these high-definition digital video cameras was that the images were so sharp and the sound so clear that its overall quality already approximated that of celluloid film. Furthermore, digital video cameras were cheaper and therefore more accessible compared to film. The same applied to the ancillary tools that were compatible with <b>digital video</b>, such as nonlinear editing, digital sound design and mixing, and a host of other tools used for filmmaking and animation.

By the 1990s, Kidlat Tahimik also made the shift to video. His decision to use video seems to suit his style as an avant-garde filmmaker.

More importantly, unlike other alternative filmmakers who still dream of shooting in celluloid film, de la Cruz really started with video and has used video ever since. He is a true pioneer in digital filmmaking in the Philippines. He does not only promote the use of digital video but, because he is an astute writer and essayist, he also theorizes about its role in the development of Philippine cinema. He wrote a manifesto, entitled &#x201C;Digital Dekalogo: A Manifesto for a Filmless Philippines,&#x201D; and posted it in his own website. Part of it reads: &#x201C;Digital film, with its qualities of mobility, flexibility, intimacy, and accessibility, is the apt medium for a Third World country like the Philippines&#x2026; The digital revolution has reduced the emphasis on technology and has reasserted the centrality of the filmmaker, the importance of the human condition over visual junk food&#x201D; (de la Cruz 2014)."

The painting shows a pipe, and below it Magritte painted &#x201C;<i>Ceci n&#x2019;est pas une pipe</i>&#x201D;<i> </i>(This is not a pipe), which means that it really is not a pipe but simply an image (or painting) of a pipe. For de la Cruz to say &#x201C;This is not a film by Khavn&#x201D; suggests a difference in the medium used. His films are still called &#x201C;film&#x201D; simply because it is a general term people use to refer to any cinematographic work, but, at the same time, it is no longer a film in the sense that the format or medium used is no longer celluloid film but digital video. Hence, &#x201C;filmless&#x201D; film."

He was part of the so-called pito-pito (seven-seven) films that Regal Films matriarch Lily Monteverde developed as a means of discovering new talent but with less financial risk. Pito-pito refers to seven days of principal photography and seven days of postproduction, though it really means that the film should be shot, edited, and ready for theatrical release in less than a month. Despite the seemingly disadvantageous setup, Monteverde was able to provide an opportunity to a lot of aspiring filmmakers including the then-unknown Diaz and another equally noteworthy filmmaker, <a href=\"/4/26/4485\">Jeffrey Jeturian</a>, who made the standout film <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1279\"><strong>Sana Pag-ibig Na</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Enter Love</i></b>), 1998, and <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1265\"><strong>Pila Balde</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Fetch a Pail of Water</i></b>), 1999. Jeturian went on to make the internationally acclaimed independent digital film <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1208\"><strong>Kubrador</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Bet Collector</i></b>), 2006, and <b><i>Ekstra</i></b> (<b><i>The Bit Player</i></b>), 2013, which won the Audience Award, Special Jury Prize, the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema Award, Best Screenplay, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actress in the Directors Showcase of the 2013 <a href=\"/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</a>."

His debut work, <b><i>Serafin Geronimo: Kriminal ng Barrio Concepcion</i></b> (<b><i>The Criminal of Barrio Concepcion</i></b>), 1998, already showed that Diaz&#x2019;s narrative is not common in the mainstream. He followed this up with the more experimental <b><i>Burger Boys</i></b>, 1999, and the visually splendid <b><i>Hubad sa Ilalim ng Buwan</i></b> (<b><i>Naked under the Moon</i></b>), 1999. However, he discovered the true nature of his cinema when he converted to digital video beginning with his five-hour independently produced opus <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1117\"><strong>Batang West Side</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>West Side Kid</i></b>), 2001. Since then he has been challenging the way audiences watch films by coming up with unusually lengthy narratives, such as the 10-hour <b><i>Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Filipino</i></b> (<b><i>Evolution of a Filipino Family</i></b>), 2004, a chronicle of a peasant family&#x2019;s struggle for survival through the dementia of the Marcos regime&#x2019;s martial law years; <b><i><strong><a href=\"/4/24/1201\">Kagadanan sa <strong>Banwa</strong> an ning mga Engkanto</a>&#xA0;</strong></i></b>(<b><i>Death in the Land of Encantos</i></b>), 2007, a nine-hour film about a leftist poet who returns to his hometown in a Bicol province after years of living in exile in metropolitan Russia; and <b><i>Melancholia</i></b>, 2008, a seven-and-a-half-hour film that tells the story of three people engaged in a strange therapy to get away from their agonies. His four-hour film <a href=\"/4/24/1250\"><b><i>Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan</i></b></a> (<b><i>Norte, The End of History</i></b>), 2013, explores themes of crime, class, and family. It was included in the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. It also won the Best Director award in the international section of the 2013 <a href=\"/4/26/4337\">Cinemanila International Film Festival</a>. Diaz&#x2019;s belief in digital video&#x2019;s ability to revolutionize the way films are made and, to a certain extent, exhibited led him to boldly declare in an interview: &#x201C;Digital changes everything &#x2026; This is liberation cinema now.

First was the Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival, which was organized by the Cinemalaya Foundation and supported by the <a href=\"/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. Its aim is to select 10 aspiring filmmakers with the most original or unique idea and give them the chance to make it into a film by providing each filmmaker a seed grant of 500,000 pesos. Cinemalaya really ushered in the Philippine New Wave Cinema of the 21st century. In its first year, Cinemalaya gave the Best Picture award to <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1264\"><strong>Pepot Artista</strong></a></i></b> (Pepot Superstar), written and directed by <a href=\"/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a>.

Another standout film from the first Cinemalaya was <a href=\"/4/24/1257\"><b><i><strong>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo <strong>Oliver</strong>os</strong> </i></b></a> (<b><i>The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros</i></b>), written by <a href=\"/4/26/4737\">Michiko Yamamoto</a> and directed by Auraeus Solito, which won the Special Jury Prize and was later awarded Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing in the 2006 Gawad Urian. The film went on to win the Swarovski Trophy for Best Film at the 2005 Asian Film Festival. It also won in three categories&#x2014;Crystal Bear&#x2013;Special Mention (for Best Feature Film), the Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk Grand Prix (for Best Feature Film), and the Teddy (for Best Feature Film)&#x2014;at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival."

The festival boasts of a bigger seed money (beginning at 700,000 pesos and later raised to one million pesos) and because it is an ABS-CBN project, it somehow puts the filmmakers a step closer to the mainstream especially since they get to use the actors from ABS-CBN&#x2019;s pool of talents. Some of the notable films from Cinema One Originals are <a href=\"/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a> and Ruel Dahis Antipuesto&#x2019;s <b><i>Confessional</i></b>, 2007, <a href=\"/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a>&#x2019;s <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1188\"><strong>Imburnal</strong></a></i></b> (Sewer), 2008, and Jet Leyco&#x2019;s <b><i>Bukas Na Lang Sapagkat Gabi Na</i></b> (<b><i>Leave It for Tomorrow for Night Has Fallen</i></b>), 2013."

With the worldwide success of some alternative films in the last 10 years and the fact that alternative films are attracting more and more mainstream audiences, one can say that Philippine cinema is probably going through its third golden age. Even movie industry stalwarts, such as <a href=\"/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4540\">Erik Matti</a>, Joyce Bernal, <a href=\"/4/26/4590\">Piolo Pascual</a>, and <a href=\"/4/26/4748\">Dawn Zulueta</a>, have also been inspired to independently produce movies that the mainstream might consider commercially not feasible. In recent years, mainstream movie companies have even agreed to co-produce with smaller independent companies, resulting in notable films such as <a href=\"/4/26/4324\">Jade Castro</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Zombadings: Patayin sa Shokot si Remington</i></b> (<b><i>Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings</i></b>), 2011, a co-production of Origin8 Media and Reality Entertainment (a film company co-founded by Erik Matti and Dondon Monteverde, son of Regal Films matriarch Lily Monteverde), and <a href=\"/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>&#x2019;s <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1108\"><strong>Ang Babae sa Septic Tank</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Woman in the Septic Tank</i></b>), 2011, which was later distributed commercially by Star Cinema.

However, the presence of a major studio also puts into question the integrity of the indie filmmaker. How much creative control will the indie filmmaker give up now that he or she has to answer to producers whose primary interest is to make profit? Up to what extent will the indie filmmaker give in to the demands of movie stars?

First, while some indie filmmakers would rather join the mainstream and give up their independence in exchange for bigger budgets and movie stars, there remain a good number of film artists who operate and even flourish outside the commercial system. They are the true independent-alternative filmmakers. The films of Lav Diaz, Raymond Red, Brillante Mendoza, Khavn de la Cruz, Raya Martin, Ditsi Carolino, Gutierrez Mangansakan II, and Auraeus Solito, just to name a few, continue to defy cinematic conventions and make us rethink the way we look at movies."

While mainstream movies offer audiences a temporary escape from real life, alternative films often confront societal problems head-on. Thus, the stories alternative filmmakers tell are more variegated precisely because they are drawn from everyday life. They represent our collective experiences as Filipinos."

Regional filmmakers who create stories situated in their home province and written in their own dialect also pose a challenge to the dominant narrative forms."

Its budget may never come close to commercial films and it will probably never earn as much (despite the fact that many alternative films have brought honor to our country). Most of the major movie stars of the day will continue to shy away from appearing in alternative films. In spite of all this, alternative cinema will continue to exist and flourish if only to remind audiences that there is more to cinema than mere mindless entertainment.

Thus, gay and lesbian cinema refers to films about, by, or for gays and lesbians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Historically, gay and lesbian cinema in the Philippines has been predominantly about gays, though both types of homosexuals are marked as the Other of the idealized heterosexual male and female, the so-called <i>tunay na lalaki/babae</i> (real male/female) in Philippine society. Gay functions as a synonym for <i>bakla</i>, although theoretically gay refers to both masculine and effeminate homosexuals while bakla in its inception as a sexual category denoted effeminacy and cross-dressing tendencies (Garcia 1998). A homosexual is a person who has &quot;emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one&#39;s own sex&quot;; heterosexual, to the opposite sex; and bisexual, to both sexes(APA 2008, 1). While bakla and homosexual are theoretically not exact equivalents since these categories come from two different epistemic regimes (Garcia 1998), the bakla can be construed as a type of homosexual because he desires the &quot;same&quot; sex. Because of the bakla&#39;s ubiquity, Filipinos tend to associate male homosexuality with effeminacy. &quot;Lesbian,&quot; on the other hand, refers to both butch (masculine) and femme (feminine) female homosexuals. The dominant image of lesbians in the Philippines is the masculine tomboy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are individuals &quot;whose core gender identity is other than that of their biological sex&quot; and, for this reason, some of them wish to change their sex and &quot;undergo&quot; a gender change operation; these individuals are called transsexuals (Blumenfeld and Raymond 1988, 75). Transgender, on the other hand, &quot;is an umbrella term for persons whose <i>gender identity</i>, <i>gender expression</i>, or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth&quot;(APA 2011, 1, emphasis in original). Transsexuals and cross-dressers can be considered examples of transgender identities (1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the longest time, Philippine gay and lesbian (GL) cinema has been about&mdash;not by or for&mdash;gays and lesbians, and it has usually been produced by and disseminated for the heteropatriarchal culture. It is no wonder then that from the 1950s onward, many GL films have featured gays and lesbians not only as effeminate and masculine, respectively, but also as objects of ridicule and sources of laughter, and as individuals whose identity is unnatural, mutable, or something to be apologetic for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the pioneers of Philippine gay and lesbian cinema is Mar S. Torres&#39;s <b><i>Jack and Jill</i></b>, 1954, whose main characters are the tomboyish jeepney driver Benita (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4644\">Lolita Rodriguez</a>) and her effeminate brother Gorio (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>).

Gay functions as a synonym for <i>bakla</i>, although theoretically gay refers to both masculine and effeminate homosexuals while bakla in its inception as a sexual category denoted effeminacy and cross-dressing tendencies (Garcia 1998). A homosexual is a person who has &quot;emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one&apos;s own sex&quot;; heterosexual, to the opposite sex; and bisexual, to both sexes(APA 2008, 1). While bakla and homosexual are theoretically not exact equivalents since these categories come from two different epistemic regimes (Garcia 1998), the bakla can be construed as a type of homosexual because he desires the &quot;same&quot; sex. Because of the bakla&apos;s ubiquity, Filipinos tend to associate male homosexuality with effeminacy. &quot;Lesbian,&quot; on the other hand, refers to both butch (masculine) and femme (feminine) female homosexuals. The dominant image of lesbians in the Philippines is the masculine tomboy."

Transgender, on the other hand, &quot;is an umbrella term for persons whose <i>gender identity</i>, <i>gender expression</i>, or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth&quot;(APA 2011, 1, emphasis in original).

A co-advocate of AsiaVisions in political filmmaking, AlterHorizons started in 1986 as a media collective composed of filmmakers, writers, photographers, and visual artists before becoming a duly recognized cooperative in 1988 by the Cooperative Development Authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">AlterHorizons&rsquo; key works include the documentaries <b><i>Edjop</i></b> (Ed Jopson) and <b><i>Kaigorotan</i></b> (The Igorot), 1986. Remarkable was its work with foreign production groups, like Mask Productions (Australia), CKVU and Global Network (Vancouver, Canada), TVE (Spain), Stoney Desert Productions (Australia), North-South Films (Montreal, Canada), Betlem Films (Netherlands), Save the Children Project (USA), Radio Quebec (Canada), Multi-Monde Productions (Montreal, Canada), and Market Street Films (Melbourne, Australia).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The film tradition of AsiaVisions and the people&rsquo;s cinema that it represents are carried on by the current crop of film collectives that flourished since the advent of digital filmmaking in the country. In Luzon, the need to document the historic unfolding of the broad democratic protest movement against then president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> served as an impetus for the formation of Kodao Productions and Southern Tagalog Exposure (ST/eXposure) in 2001, Tudla Productions (originally Tudla Multimedia) in 2003, and Mayday Multimedia (originally Mayday Productions) in 2004. Other collectives are Tan-aw Multimedia (originally Northern Horizons), founded in 2002; Sine Patriyotiko (SIPAT), 2004; Bicol xPress, 2004; and Pokus Gitnang Luson Multimedia (Pokus GL), 2005. In the Visayas, there are Aninaw Productions (Cebu-based), founded in 2008, and Sine Panayanon (Iloilo-based), 2011. In Mindanao, there is Kilab Multimedia, founded in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent years, political film collectives have initiated, organized, or participated in activities other than actual video production, such as the AgitProp Political Film Festival (first held in 2001 alongside the International Conference on People&rsquo;s Culture), Pandayang Lino Brocka (organized by Tudla Productions held annually since 2008), and Alternatibong Midya (AlterMidya) of the alliance of alternative media groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While most of the existing political films are considered committed documentaries, not all political films are limited to the documentary type. AsiaVisions produced <b><i>Isang Munting</i></b><i> <b>Lupa</b></i> (A Small Piece of Land), 1989, an adaptation of the short story &ldquo;Tata Selo&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5696\">Rogelio Sicat</a>, and <b><i>Fragments</i></b>, 1991, a piece of video poetry. Kodao made a full-length docudrama, <b><i>Sa Hamon ng Panahon</i></b> (To the Challenge of the Times), 2009. ST/eXposure&rsquo;s <b><i>A Day in the Life of Gloria</i></b><i> <b>Arroyo</b></i>, 2006-10, is a short animation. Tudla&rsquo;s <b><i>Barikada </i></b>(Barricade), 2011, is a short narrative, while Mayday&rsquo;s <b><i>Kuwentong Obrero</i></b> (Workers&rsquo; Stories), 2010-11, is a stop-motion video animation series.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Rosemarie Roque, with notes from&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>Johann Vladimir J.

However, in recent years, specifically since 2009 when the Cinema Committee of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> launched Cinema Rehiyon, the term &ldquo;regional cinema&rdquo; or &ldquo;regional filmmaker&rdquo; has acquired different meanings. Regional may first refer to one&rsquo;s geographic origin by birth, as coming from any of the 17 politically demarcated regions in the country. Hence, a film done by a director born and raised in Zamboanga City, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4365\">Sheron Dayoc</a>, is regarded as a Western Mindanao film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Second, regional may also mean an ethnolinguistic affiliation. For example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> cinema may not only cover filmmakers and films from Cebu but also from Bohol and certain provinces in Mindanao where Cebuano is the lingua franca. Consequently, Cebuano cinema is an umbrella term for all films where Cebuano is spoken. In this view, language is a vital component where nuanced expressions suggest distinct worldviews or reflect a unique character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A third meaning of regional may simply indicate any work whose theme or content is about an indigenous or local culture outside Manila. The film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1303\"><strong>Thy Womb</strong></a></i></b>, 2012, by Manila-based director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4543\">Brillante Mendoza</a> set in Tawi-Tawi could be considered regional in this sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A fourth definition of regional covers the filmmaker&rsquo;s primary place of professional film work. This view emphasizes a person&rsquo;s residence in a specific place for a reasonable length of time. By virtue of this local immersion, the director as resident film artist is assumed to have grown in his or her understanding of the local culture and therefore can engage with a local network of artists and technical staff to depict a specific aspect of the milieu. Following this perspective, an Ilocano who has lived in Negros Occidental for many years and shoots a film in Ilonggo about life in the haciendas may produce a work that may be regarded as an Ilonggo film. His or her film about Ilonggo culture may therefore become part of Ilonggo cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Which of the four meanings of regional should prevail&mdash;the geographic, ethnolinguistic, thematic, or professional? One way to resolve this question is to look at how Filipino anthropologists and sociologists define a synonymous term, which is &ldquo;ethnic.&rdquo; As sociologists and anthropologists have noted, the various meanings of &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; are highly contextual (Wikipedia 2014; Wikipilipinas 2014). For example, a Manila-born worker whose mother is Cebuana and father is Ilocano will say he or she is from Manila. But when he or she is in the company of colleagues who are from Cebu and is able to speak and converse in Cebuano, he or she will say he or she is from Cebu and the others will recognize his or her Cebu lineage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The varied dimensions show that regional does not represent a constitutive essence of being. Hence, the Philippine experience of ethnicity and by extension regionalism is not grounded on a monolithic interpretation. Regional arises from the circumstances one chooses and uses to define one&rsquo;s self. The term &ldquo;regional&rdquo; is a social construct that is highly context-dependent. Regional cinema then is a fluid concept encompassing a strategic stance of artistic production. It is about becoming and the self-actualization of a creative potential. Hence, regional cinema can accommodate multiple modes of film authorship and collaboration ranging from a traditional geographically defined position to a postmodern deterritorialized and pastiche approach. A filmmaker like Noriel Jarito from Samar can conceivably cast a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> actress like Donna Kebeng to speak in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> and star in a film that is shot in a squalid district in Davao made to look like the backwaters of Manila to suit a story about marginalized migrants. (Noel Jarito from Samar actually directed and acted with Donna Kebeng in a short feature entitled <b><i>Strawberry and Durian</i></b>, 2013, set in Davao. The film was shown in Cinema Rehiyon 6.) Similarly, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a>, longtime Manila resident, can choose to shoot his award-winning film <b><i>Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon</i> </b>(<b><i>From What Is Before</i></b>), 2014, in remote farmlands in northern Cagayan Valley and recast the place as a stand-in for the Cotabato of his childhood, utilizing the bucolic landscape as a means of evoking an archetypal village ruled by indigenous rites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Owing to these overlapping nuances in the term regional, the NCCA Cinema Committee that first organized Cinema Rehiyon takes a more flexible position when assessing the regional character of a film. Curators ascertain how any or all of the four&mdash;geographic, ethnolinguistic, thematic, and professional&mdash;dimensions may be present in the film. When drawing the lineup of films for their area, curators first find out if the film was done outside Manila by a filmmaker who has lived long enough in the region to be able to create a work representative of the region&rsquo;s culture. Curators also collaboratively program a section called Crossing Borders or Crossing Regions based on a multilayered view of regional filmmaking. As curator Teddy Co notes, this particular program portrays &ldquo;themes of diaspora and dislocations&rdquo; (2013, 19). Films shown in this section are done by directors who have shot outside their geographic locale and collaborated with other regional filmmakers on a subject matter that again may be about another local culture. For example, in Cinema Rehiyon 5, director Nadjoua Bansil from Zamboanga presented <b><i>Bohe: Sons of the Sea</i></b>, 2012,<b> </b>about the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut/Badjao</a> living in Malitam Island off the coast of Batangas City, while Brigite Salvatore of Tawi-Tawi showed <b><i>model ciTizen</i></b>, 2012, an autobiographical account of her experiences as a Muslim transgender woman in Manila struggling with community expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from examining the regional character of a film, curators also consider the film&rsquo;s verisimilitude as a way of measuring the film&rsquo;s integrity and authenticity. For instance, can tattooed Manila urbanites don <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> folk garb and represent Ifugao lifeways and traditions? Critical appraisal needs to evaluate such representations in the light of artistic issues related to &ldquo;geographical veracity and cultural authenticity&rdquo; (Co 2013, 21). Another related curatorial problem deals with point of view. Whose interests are being served by the film? To what extent can artistic license be undertaken without distorting or misrepresenting a specific culture? How can traditions be communicated to young audiences in an innovative yet respectful way? There are no easy resolutions to these questions, but conversations sparked by such questions are surely needed to guide filmmakers in their craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"history\" name=\"history\"></a>History</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Research exclusively devoted to the origins and historical development of regional cinema in the Philippines has been scarce. The task of defining a chronology of events that have shaped regional cinema is hampered by the dearth of documentation describing in detail the different kinds of films produced, the lack of archival records and extant films, and the scant level of scholarly and critical writing on regional cinema issues and concerns. Just the same, an initial narrative needs to be constructed to help contextualize and make sense of available and assorted documents and materials on regional cinema. This overview of the history of regional cinema is at best tentative and subject to future discoveries and validation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Visayan film industry, which actually is comprised of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> cinema, is often cited as an example of regional cinema as a living industry meeting and servicing the demands of theatrical distributors and film exhibitors for a movie-paying public outside the national capital region. In her article &ldquo;Cebuano Cinema: Then and Now,&rdquo; Cinema Rehiyon festival curator Maria Victoria Beltran reports that Cebu had an active film industry before the World War II. Its first locally produced talking film in 1938 was Piux Kabahar&rsquo;s<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1122\"><strong>Bertoldo ug Balodoy</strong></a> </i></b>(Bertoldo and Balodoy). Produced by Virgilio Gonzalez of Estudio America-Filipino, the film is about the comic adventures of a pair of Siamese twins. Other prominent films that were made in this era of Cebuano cinema were <b><i>Gugmang Talagsaon </i></b>(Rare Love), <b><i>Mini</i></b> (Fake), <b><i>Tanso sa Ginto</i> </b>(Copper in Gold),<b> </b>and<b> <i>Bulak sa Lunangan </i></b>(Cotton in the Mud) (Alburo 1997; Deocampo 2005).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cebu film industry thrived as a commercial enterprise from 1950 to 1957, a period that has been regarded as another prolific era of Cebuano cinema. The film output was remarkably high. &ldquo;More than 50 films were produced in seven years by around 30 Cebuano film productions&rdquo; (Beltran 2009, 33). In 1969, the film <b><i>Badlis sa Kinabuhi</i></b> (Life Lines) was nominated in 14 categories at the annual awards of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy for Movie Arts and Sciences or FAMAS</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4679\">Gloria Sevilla</a> won as Best Actress and Frankie Navaja Jr as Best Child Actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cebuano industry continued to produce films well into the 1970s, and a cursory look into the titles and synopses of the films shows output consisting of the staple mix of melodrama, comedy, and action features (Noriega et al. 2014). By 1980 onward, the cost of importing, developing, and printing film stock had become prohibitive due to economic inflation. Film producers resorted to shooting on the cheaper 16mm stock and transferred the edited material to 35mm for theatrical release (Noriega 2014). With mounting production costs, profits plunged, prompting many Cebuano film production companies to fold up and close shop. Although several films that were produced years later attempted to revive it&mdash;notably, <b><i><strong>Matud Nila</strong> </i></b>, 1991, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4665\">Leroy Salvador</a>, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1262\"><strong>Panaghoy sa Suba</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Call of the River</i></b>), 2004, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4550\">Cesar Montano</a>. But the glory days of Cebuano cinema that showcased the artistry of actors like Gloria Sevilla, Mat Ranillo, and <strong> </strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4669\">Caridad Sanchez</a> have yet to return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No other cinema in other regions of the country has come close to the economic scale of operations and distribution manifested by the Cebuano film industry. Film activity in the regions in the 1980s and 1990s until the turn of the millennium has been largely sporadic, being products of either individuals seeking artistic expression or collectives learning the art and science of filmmaking. In 1990, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a> established in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, at the University of St. La Salle, the Negros Summer Workshop offering short courses in theater acting and production and film directing, acting, and production. Courses like the Director&rsquo;s World and Film Production, and Production Design were taught by Peque Gallaga with directors Lore Reyes, Gabby Fernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3668\">Manny Montelibano</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4428\">Lawrence Fajardo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Baguio City, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a> (pseud. of Eric de Guia) made a name for himself in the international film circuit for producing, writing, and directing what was then regarded as experimental films. His more notable films were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1218\"><strong>Mababangong Bangungot</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Perfumed Nightmare</i></b>), 1977, which won the International Federation of Film Critics jury prize; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1312\"><strong>Turumba</strong></a></i></b>, 1981, which was awarded Best Third World Film at the 1983 Manheim Film Festival; and <b><i>Sino&#39;ng Lumikha ng Yoyo? Sino&#39;ng Lumikha ng Moon Buggy?</i></b> (Who Invented the Yo-yo? Who Created the Moon Buggy?), 1982. Although Kidlat Tahimik was from Baguio, his early films did not tackle the sociocultural concerns faced by indigenous communities in the Mountain Province or the Cordillera region and, instead, critiqued the insidious effects of neocolonialism and globalization. As Peque Gallaga did in Negros, Tahimik organized in Baguio the Sunflower Film and Video Collective and since 1997 has conducted film appreciation and production workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The individual endeavors of Gallaga with his Negros Summer Workshop and Tahimik with his Sunflower Film and Video Collective confronted the challenges of the limited resources they had for filmmaking. Outside of these venues, regional filmmakers seeking to apply the training they gained at these workshops and pursue personal projects found very little or no support at all from funding agencies. It was when inexpensive and portable digital technologies surfaced and advanced, coupled with the rising wave of independent films in the early part of the first decade of the millennium, that regional filmmaking reemerged and thrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"resurgence\" name=\"resurgence\"></a>The Resurgence of Regional Cinemas</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The resurgence of regional cinema became particularly evident with the establishment of Cinema Rehiyon, a flagship film festival project conceived by Teddy Co of the Cinema Committee of the NCCA. Prior to Cinema Rehiyon, individual filmmakers dispersed in their localities explored and experimented on their own the artistic potential of the new digital technologies. With Cinema Rehiyon, regional filmmaking became a collective endeavor fueled by a shared consciousness of cultural self-articulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cinema Rehiyon was initially organized out of a need to showcase filmmaking activity in the regions. In 2008, the NCAA Cinema Committee brainstormed on its contribution to the Philippine Festival of the Arts to be held during the annual Arts Month in Feb 2009. The NCCA Cinema Committee members then were Dr Miguel Q. Rapatan (chair); Teddy Co (vice-chair); Jose Antonio Garcia and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3313\">Joey Ting</a> (education sector representatives); Willie Mayo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4568\">Jesus Navarro</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4349\">Rez Cortez</a> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a> sector representatives); and Vicky Belarmino (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4687\">Society of Filipino Archivists for Film</a> sector representative).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the theme was on Harvest of the Arts, the committee decided to survey the different regions and bring together short or full-length feature films done by various directors. The plan involved showcasing these films in a four-day, noncompetitive, free-admission festival called Cinema Rehiyon: Alter Nativo or Films from the Other Philippines. Although the bulk of mainstream industry films was produced in Manila, the festival aimed to show that this number did not fully define the scope and character of the Philippine national cinema. In the view of the NCCA Cinema Committee, for Philippine cinema to be truly national, films created outside the Manila circuit of production need to be given their own space for exhibition. Cinema Rehiyon thus had two objectives&mdash;namely, &ldquo;1) to showcase the most outstanding works of regional filmmakers and 2) to discover new and fresh talents by providing them with a venue for their works&rdquo; (Fernandez 2013, 47).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In order to ensure a wide participation of filmmakers from various regions, the Cinema Committee identified provincial centers and selected regional film curators. The regional film festivals that were first identified with their respective film festival names were as follows: the Mindanao Film Festival in Davao City, Cinemagis in Cagayan de Oro City, Bacollywood in Bacolod City, Pasale in Naga City, and Ay Apo! May Shooting sa Baguio in Baguio City. The curators were asked to search for filmmakers in the regions and facilitate preparatory workshops prior to the national festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The initial screening of Cinema Rehiyon of regional film works was held on 18-21 Feb 2009 at the Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, an intimate screening room at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>. A total of 58 entries participated in the festival, with six full-length features&mdash;namely,<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1317\"><strong>Yanggaw</strong></a></b></i> (Affliction) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4690\">Richard Somes</a> from Bacolod, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1188\"><strong>Imburnal</strong></a></i></b> (Sewer) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a> from Davao City, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1182\"><strong>Hunghong sa Yuta</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i><strong>Earth</strong> &rsquo;s Whisper</i></b>) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4534\">Arnel Mardoquio</a> from Davao City, <b><i>Brutus</i></b> by Tara Illenberger (shot in Mindoro), <b><i>Dagyang</i></b> (Frolic) by Joenar Pueblo from Iloilo City, and <b><i>Joy to the World Prusisyon</i></b> (Procession) by Ray Defante Gibraltar, Oscar M. Nava, J. I. E. Teodoro, and Che Villanueva from Iloilo City. Also shown were 52 shorts, documentaries, and animation films, all released in digital format. The festival, directed by Gabby Fernandez of the College of Saint Benilde, showcased 18 films from Mindanao (Cagayan de Oro, Davao City, Maguindanao, and Zamboanga City), 21 from the Visayas (Bacolod, Iloilo, and Cebu), and 19 from Luzon (Mindoro, Naga, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, La Union, Baguio, and Kalinga). A total of 14 regional sites were represented. The festival also featured regional reports and situationers about filmmaking practices and papers delivered by invited guest speakers. With Cinema Rehiyon, regional filmmakers were able to establish their presence as a group, confer with one another on the creative challenges they faced, and screen their films in a recognized national festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Interest in Cinema Rehiyon from regional filmmakers steadily increased over the years. Cinema Rehiyon festival traveled to key regional centers&mdash;to Davao in 2011, Bacolod in 2012, UP Los Ba&ntilde;os in 2013, and Cagayan de Oro in 2014. By the time Cinema Rehiyon 6 was staged in Cagayan de Oro, a total of 108 films had been shown, confirming the accelerating growth of regional filmmaking activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Various cultural institutions and film foundations have acknowledged the direction of these efforts and have provided support for the growth of regional cinema. Aside from NCCA&rsquo;s Cinema Rehiyon, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4439\">Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP)</a> launched in 2012 the annual Sineng Pambansa (National Cinema), which gave production grants to filmmakers from Manila and the regions and staged festival screenings of their works. The FDCP&rsquo;s Sineng Pambansa<i> </i>was first staged in two parts: from 29 Jun to 3 Jul and from 22 to 25 Nov in Davao City. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals</a>, the independent film arm of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a>, has for several years now featured in its annual festival lineup works done by regional filmmakers who have qualified for their production grants program. Cinemalaya, the country&rsquo;s premier independent film festival organized by the Cultural Center of the Philippines, also has supported projects authored by regional filmmakers or works dealing with regional themes and topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Academic institutions have likewise recognized the importance of regional cinema. Different universities, such as Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro, Ateneo de Naga University, and the University of the Philippines at Los Ba&ntilde;os, have hosted the annual regional film festivals in their cities. The MFA program in Cinema Studies at the University of San Carlos in Cebu conducts and publishes research on topics related to the Cebuano film industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"significant\" name=\"significant\"></a>Significant Films</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 17 May 2011, a small independent film by a relatively unknown young director and team of artists took the plum awards of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Music at the annual Gawad Urian given by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a>. The film was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1146\"><strong>Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Eleuteria&rsquo;s Dream</i></b>), 2010, produced by Panumduman Pictures and Creative Programs Inc, helmed by Remton Siega Zuasola, shot by Christian Linaban (in one long take), and scored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>. In that same awards program, another independent film, <b><i>Sheika</i></b>, 2010, won Best Actress, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing. This film, which was jointly produced by HYDEout Entertainment, Skyweavers Productions, and Alchemy of Vision and Light Film and TV Productions, was written and directed by Arnel Mardoquio and featured Fe GingGing Hyde in her debut lead acting role. The editors were Willie Apa Jr and Arthur Ian Garcia. What was striking about their achievement in the Gawad Urian&rsquo;s major artistic and technical categories was the fact that their films were in Cebuano and Binisaya and shot entirely in Cebu and Davao City, respectively. Moreover, Zuasola and Mardoquio were filmmakers (along with their co-producers and fellow artists) who resided outside Metro Manila, the former living in Cebu City and the latter in Davao City. Considering that in the history of the Gawad Urian, the Best Picture and Best Director prizes from 1976 to 2000 were won only by Manila-based filmmakers, <b><i>Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria</i></b>&rsquo;s Best Picture and Zuasola&rsquo;s Best Director awards were particularly significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The banner year of 2011, however, could be seen as the climax of the recognition, few and far between, garnered by regional filmmakers from the Gawad Urian in previous years. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1256\">Oro, Plata, Mata</a>&nbsp;</i></b>(<b><i>Gold, Silver, Death</i></b>),<i> </i>shot on location in various places in Negros Occidental, won Best Picture, Best Director (Peque Gallaga from Bacolod City), and Best Sound in 1983. In 2005, Cesar Montano from Bohol won Best Director for <b><i>Panaghoy sa Suba</i></b>. Brillante &quot;Dante&quot; Mendoza from Pampanga won Best Director for the years 2007-09. In 2006, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4375\">Mes de Guzman</a> from Nueva Vizcaya won Best Director for his film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1143\"><strong>Ang Daan Patungong Kalimugtong</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Road to Kalimugtong</i></b>), which also won Best Production Design. In 2009, Popong Landero from Davao City was awarded Best Music for Mardoquio&rsquo;s <b><i>Hunghong sa Yuta</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But it was the year 2010 that may be called a golden year for regional films. Aside from the films of Zuasola and Mardoquio, three other films of the nine vying for the 2011 Gawad Urian Best Picture were also done by filmmakers based in the provinces. These nominated films were <b><i>Halaw</i></b> (<b><i>Ways of the Sea</i></b>) by Sheron Dayoc from Zamboanga City,<b> <i>Ang Mundo sa Panahon ng Yelo</i></b> (<b><i>Ice Is the Earth</i></b>) by Mes de Guzman from Nueva Vizcaya, and <b><i>Limbunan</i></b> (<b><i>The</i></b><i> <b>Bridal Quarters</b></i>) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4528\">Gutierrez Mangansakan II</a> from Maguindanao. Aside from receiving Gawad Urian trophies, Zuasola&rsquo;s film won the Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival, the Best Southeast Asian Film at the 2010 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4337\">Cinemanila International Film Festival</a>, the 2011 Special Jury Prize at the Jeonju Film Festival in South Korea, the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) Award&ndash;Special Mention at the 2011 Moscow International Film Festival, and the Geber Award and Golden Hanoman Award at the 2011 Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival in Indonesia. At the 2010 Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival, Sheron Dayoc&rsquo;s <b><i>Halaw</i></b> was named Best Picture in the New Breed Full Length Feature section. Later it would also win the NETPAC Award&ndash;Special Mention at the 2011 Berlin International Film Festival. Mardoquio&rsquo;s <b><i>Sheika </i></b>received the NETPAC Award at the Cinemalaya festival. Mangansakan&rsquo;s <b><i>Limbunan</i></b> was selected and shown as the closing film of the International Critics&rsquo; Week program of the 2010 Venice International Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Internationally, another Mindanao filmmaker from Davao City, Sherad Anthony Sanchez, copped the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> Grand Jury Prize at the 2010 Cinemanila International Film Festival for his film, <b><i>Balangay</i></b> (Balangay Boat). Earlier, his <b><i>Ang Huling Balyan ng Buhi</i></b> (<b><i>Woven <strong>Stories</strong> of the Other</i></b>) and <b><i>Imburnal</i></b> (Sewer) won Best Picture at the 2006 and 2008 Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aesthetically, many of these regional films transcend their ethnographic origins by exploring fresh representations of their milieu&rsquo;s traditions, ethos, and identity. For example, Mardoquio&rsquo;s <b><i>Sheika</i></b>, a film shot in Davao about a mother&rsquo;s love for her children, portrays the long-drawn marginalization of Muslim families in harrowing terms, making viewers understand the Mindanao conflict in ardent humanistic terms. On the other hand, Mangansakan&rsquo;s <b><i>Limbunan</i></b> and <b><i>Qiyamah</i></b> (<b><i>The Reckoning</i></b>), 2012, unveil a deep reflective and mystical dimension of Muslim life in the Maguindanao region, a depiction that stands in stark contrast to popular media&rsquo;s image of Mindanao as a haven for terrorists. <b><i>Yanggaw</i></b>, 2008, by Negrense filmmaker Richard Somes transplants the cannibalistic force of the aswang, a stock horror figure in Visayan folklore, to an unlikely setting of parental love and self-sacrifice. In a similar vein, Alvin Yapan from Bikol plumbs in <b><i>Debosyon </i></b>(<b><i>Devotion</i></b>), 2013, the animistic and primordial roots of contemporary Filipino religiosity and mores and the age-old battle of the sexes, themes he has also dissected in two previous films,<b><i> Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe</i></b> (<b><i>The Rapture of Fe</i></b>),<b> </b>2009, and <b><i>Gayuma </i></b>(<b><i>Pilgrim Lovers</i></b>), 2011. Up in the north, Mes de Guzman&rsquo;s trilogy, composed of <b><i>Ang Mundo sa Panahon ng Bato </i></b>(<b><i>Stone Is the Earth</i></b>), 2010, <b><i>Ang</i> <i>Mundo sa Panahon ng Yelo</i></b>, 2010, and <b><i>Ang Mundo sa Panahon ng Bakal </i></b>(<b><i>Steel Is the Earth</i></b>), 2013, set in the vast and barren mountains of Nueva Vizcaya, focus on the hidden plight of working children and isolated families looking for a way out of their poverty using their wit and humor while preserving their human dignity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"regional\" name=\"regional\"></a>Regional vis-&agrave;-vis National Cinema</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taken as a whole, the diverse artistic achievements of regional filmmakers open up new modes of expression not previously available or encouraged or supported by the dominant studio system based in Manila. For a long period of time, regional filmmakers were dependent on Manila studios and commercial production houses for production capital, equipment, facilities, labor, promotion, and distribution. For some filmmakers, the expense of commuting from one&rsquo;s provincial residence to Manila was too costly, resulting in the decision to migrate to Manila and work with the studios. Consequently, since the studios were principally connected to the Manila system of exhibitors and distributors, stories onscreen were often about life in Manila rather than in the regions. The commercial returns that a producer reaped from initial screenings in Manila alone ranged from 40 percent to 60 percent on the returns of his or her investment and this drove the choice of material that had to be relevant to the paying audiences (Tiongson 2010, 2-41). Every now and then, a few films set outside Manila would emerge but the aesthetics and treatment of the subjects was customized for the taste of Manila audiences. For example, Peque Gallaga&rsquo;s 1982 family epic <b><i>Oro, Plata, Mata</i></b>, produced by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, charts the decadence of a sugar hacendero and his family before, during, and after the Japanese occupation. Although the film follows the travails of a landed Negrense family, the lead and supporting characters, including a number of the extras, throughout the film converse most of the time in Tagalog instead of Ilonggo for the convenience of Manila audiences (Yuson 2001, 294-305). Interestingly enough, decades later Peque Gallaga with co-director Lore Reyes produced for the 2013 Sineng Pambansa the film <b><i><strong>Sonata</strong> </i></b>, set in another Negros hacienda with dialogue predominantly in Ilonggo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, archivist Teddy Co, in an article published in <b><i>Movement</i></b>, the film journal of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund Film Institute</a>, described the disparity in the content of Filipino films: &ldquo;The Philippine movie industry has always been centered in Manila. All the major film production companies, film distributors, processing laboratories and post-production facilities are virtually clustered in the urban areas of Metro Manila. As such, the films produced cannot help but carry a strong Manila flavor, even if they have been shot in other parts of the country&rdquo; (2009). In turn, the authentic representation of the life of majority of Filipinos living in the regions where over 180 indigenous groups are said to live has for some time received scant attention or has been riddled with misconceptions about regional culture in numerous mainstream films. Consequently, the dearth of films presenting a true portrait of life in the regions has caused the regional as a specific marker of cultural identity to be invisible. With the displacement of the regional by film subjects privileged and patronized by Manila producers and audiences, films done in Manila have defined the nature and identity of Philippine national cinema. The centralization of film industry activity in Manila and its extension into and collaboration with allied media industries, such as television and print, have institutionalized a system of providing entertainment revolving around Manila studio system aesthetics. This system has also spread to areas outside of Manila. For example, in the case of the Cebuano movie industry, which until 1980 was a thriving sector, the selection of films for production mirrored the Manila studio system&rsquo;s penchant for formulaic mainstream subject matter. A survey of the synopses of Cebuano films in Noriega&rsquo;s study (2014) suggests that the films were largely genre works like their Manila counterparts except that the dialogue happened to be in Cebuano. Thus, within and outside of Metro Manila, the output of commercial film studios in the form of mainstream movies was homogenized and characterized by adherence to Manila studio system styles and requirements. The identity of national cinema was largely circumscribed by genre films produced in Manila or emulating the Manila studio style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A check into various writings on Philippine national cinema also shows the lack of critical attention given to the development or appraisal of regional cinema. Unlike Philippine national literature which actively integrates the diverse strands of writings from different parts of the archipelago, critical writing on Philippine cinema has served little notice on the contributions of regional form to the national identity primarily due to the lack of extant regional films. However, recent research into secondary sources found in publications during the pre-World War II years shows that in other parts of the country like Cebu, regional filmmaking was already taking place for quite some time (Beltran 2009, 33-34; Noriega 2014). These activities, however, go by unnoticed in various writings on Philippine film history, such as Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kasaysayan at Tunguhin ng Pelikulang Pilipino&rdquo; (History and Direction of Philippine Cinema) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4693\">Agustin Sotto</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Brief History of Philippine Cinema&rdquo; (Tiongson 1983, 22-47; 2010, 44-57). As a cultural entity, there is also little to be found about regional cinema and its influence on the discourse of Filipino film aesthetics. While certain discourses have been made about the Filipino worldview in film, as in Tiongson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Four Values in Filipino Drama and Film&rdquo; (Tiongson 1983, 102-25), the inquiry into the representation of these cultural values has often been tied up with Tagalog culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In both creative and critical endeavors, regional cinema has been for some time on the periphery of the discourse on national cinema. Regional cinema&rsquo;s representation of life in the islands and provinces has been driven to the fringes of the film industry, given the totalizing influence of the Manila studio system. In certain films, regional representations would appear but often become distorted through the lens of the Manila studio system and in the form of shopworn stereotypes (e.g., the head-hunting Ifugao, the contentious Waray, the naive Ilonggo, or the militant Tausug). In a way, regional cinema has become the mysterious and exotic Other of the dominant Manila studio system subject to parody, caricature, or travesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regional filmmakers aim to reverse their displacement from the national discourse by asserting their vernacular origins and mirroring their milieu&rsquo;s artistic sensibilities. In his closing speech at the 1st Cinema Rehiyon in 2009, festival director Gabriel Fernandez asserted the following: &ldquo;In various languages and dialects that reflect our diverse heritage, we say: we will no longer allow regional cinema to be relegated to the back pages in the annals of Philippine cinema. We come to claim what is truly ours: the right to be included in the national discourse on film&rdquo; (Fernandez 2013, 46). Regional cinema is thus a marker of presence. For a number of regional filmmakers, regional cinema is a movement from the margins to the center involving the de-Manilanization of national cinema and, in the process, the formation of a more inclusive national cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regional cinema does not seek to carve a space distinct from national cinema. On the contrary, regional cinema subverts the hegemonic order of the Manila studio system in current articulations of national cinema. Regional cinema promotes a more authentic imaginary of national cinema characterized by a polyvocal state, a genuine correlate to the country&rsquo;s archipelagic diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the digitization of film at the turn of the millennium and the succeeding availability of more affordable and mobile equipment and downloadable postproduction software from the Internet, such a project of a recovered sense of national cinema is now in progress. Regional filmmakers in pursuit of heterotopia have begun to create new avenues for self-representation independent of the commercial strictures and demands of the Manila studio system. Regional filmmakers regard the boon in digital film technologies as a source of agency for production and distribution and realizing and advancing the movement&rsquo;s agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The reemergence of regional cinema as a collective creative movement from 2009 onward has helped revitalize and reshape the discourse of national cinema. With their particular concerns and commitment to visibility, authenticity, and heterogeneity, regional filmmakers have enriched rather than detracted from the character of national cinema. In a sense, regional filmmakers have re-nationalized national cinema to reflect its archipelagic scope. Through their films, regional filmmakers reshape our imagination of the national cinema as one that genuinely embodies and celebrates the complexity, diversity, and depth of Philippine culture.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by&nbsp;</strong><strong>Miguel Rapatan</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Alburo, Erlinda. 1997. &ldquo;Screens of Images, Waves of Sound.&rdquo; In <em>Cebu, More Than an Island</em>.

				"value": "<b>Regional cinema</b> is generally defined as filmmaking done outside of Metro Manila and its environs by filmmakers who are from the region and tell stories about life in their region. However, in recent years, specifically since 2009 when the Cinema Committee of the <a href=\"/4/26/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> launched Cinema Rehiyon, the term &#x201C;regional cinema&#x201D; or &#x201C;regional filmmaker&#x201D; has acquired different meanings. Regional may first refer to one&#x2019;s geographic origin by birth, as coming from any of the 17 politically demarcated regions in the country. Hence, a film done by a director born and raised in Zamboanga City, like <a href=\"/4/26/4365\">Sheron Dayoc</a>, is regarded as a Western Mindanao film."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Second, regional may also mean an ethnolinguistic affiliation. For example, <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> cinema may not only cover filmmakers and films from Cebu but also from Bohol and certain provinces in Mindanao where Cebuano is the lingua franca. Consequently, Cebuano cinema is an umbrella term for all films where Cebuano is spoken. In this view, language is a vital component where nuanced expressions suggest distinct worldviews or reflect a unique character."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "A third meaning of regional may simply indicate any work whose theme or content is about an indigenous or local culture outside Manila. The film <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1303\"><strong>Thy Womb</strong></a></i></b>, 2012, by Manila-based director <a href=\"/4/26/4543\">Brillante Mendoza</a> set in Tawi-Tawi could be considered regional in this sense."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "A fourth definition of regional covers the filmmaker&#x2019;s primary place of professional film work. This view emphasizes a person&#x2019;s residence in a specific place for a reasonable length of time. By virtue of this local immersion, the director as resident film artist is assumed to have grown in his or her understanding of the local culture and therefore can engage with a local network of artists and technical staff to depict a specific aspect of the milieu. Following this perspective, an Ilocano who has lived in Negros Occidental for many years and shoots a film in Ilonggo about life in the haciendas may produce a work that may be regarded as an Ilonggo film. His or her film about Ilonggo culture may therefore become part of Ilonggo cinema."

				"value": "Which of the four meanings of regional should prevail&#x2014;the geographic, ethnolinguistic, thematic, or professional? One way to resolve this question is to look at how Filipino anthropologists and sociologists define a synonymous term, which is &#x201C;ethnic.&#x201D; As sociologists and anthropologists have noted, the various meanings of &#x201C;ethnic&#x201D; are highly contextual (Wikipedia 2014; Wikipilipinas 2014). For example, a Manila-born worker whose mother is Cebuana and father is Ilocano will say he or she is from Manila. But when he or she is in the company of colleagues who are from Cebu and is able to speak and converse in Cebuano, he or she will say he or she is from Cebu and the others will recognize his or her Cebu lineage."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The varied dimensions show that regional does not represent a constitutive essence of being. Hence, the Philippine experience of ethnicity and by extension regionalism is not grounded on a monolithic interpretation. Regional arises from the circumstances one chooses and uses to define one&#x2019;s self. The term &#x201C;regional&#x201D; is a social construct that is highly context-dependent. Regional cinema then is a fluid concept encompassing a strategic stance of artistic production. It is about becoming and the self-actualization of a creative potential. Hence, regional cinema can accommodate multiple modes of film authorship and collaboration ranging from a traditional geographically defined position to a postmodern deterritorialized and pastiche approach. A filmmaker like Noriel Jarito from Samar can conceivably cast a <a href=\"/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> actress like Donna Kebeng to speak in <a href=\"/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> and star in a film that is shot in a squalid district in Davao made to look like the backwaters of Manila to suit a story about marginalized migrants. (Noel Jarito from Samar actually directed and acted with Donna Kebeng in a short feature entitled <b><i>Strawberry and Durian</i></b>, 2013, set in Davao. The film was shown in Cinema Rehiyon 6.) Similarly, <a href=\"/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a>, longtime Manila resident, can choose to shoot his award-winning film <b><i>Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon</i> </b>(<b><i>From What Is Before</i></b>), 2014, in remote farmlands in northern Cagayan Valley and recast the place as a stand-in for the Cotabato of his childhood, utilizing the bucolic landscape as a means of evoking an archetypal village ruled by indigenous rites."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Owing to these overlapping nuances in the term regional, the NCCA Cinema Committee that first organized Cinema Rehiyon takes a more flexible position when assessing the regional character of a film. Curators ascertain how any or all of the four&#x2014;geographic, ethnolinguistic, thematic, and professional&#x2014;dimensions may be present in the film. When drawing the lineup of films for their area, curators first find out if the film was done outside Manila by a filmmaker who has lived long enough in the region to be able to create a work representative of the region&#x2019;s culture. Curators also collaboratively program a section called Crossing Borders or Crossing Regions based on a multilayered view of regional filmmaking. As curator Teddy Co notes, this particular program portrays &#x201C;themes of diaspora and dislocations&#x201D; (2013, 19). Films shown in this section are done by directors who have shot outside their geographic locale and collaborated with other regional filmmakers on a subject matter that again may be about another local culture. For example, in Cinema Rehiyon 5, director Nadjoua Bansil from Zamboanga presented <b><i>Bohe: Sons of the Sea</i></b>, 2012,<b> </b>about the <a href=\"/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut/Badjao</a> living in Malitam Island off the coast of Batangas City, while Brigite Salvatore of Tawi-Tawi showed <b><i>model ciTizen</i></b>, 2012, an autobiographical account of her experiences as a Muslim transgender woman in Manila struggling with community expectations."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Aside from examining the regional character of a film, curators also consider the film&#x2019;s verisimilitude as a way of measuring the film&#x2019;s integrity and authenticity. For instance, can tattooed Manila urbanites don <a href=\"/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> folk garb and represent Ifugao lifeways and traditions? Critical appraisal needs to evaluate such representations in the light of artistic issues related to &#x201C;geographical veracity and cultural authenticity&#x201D; (Co 2013, 21). Another related curatorial problem deals with point of view. Whose interests are being served by the film? To what extent can artistic license be undertaken without distorting or misrepresenting a specific culture? How can traditions be communicated to young audiences in an innovative yet respectful way? There are no easy resolutions to these questions, but conversations sparked by such questions are surely needed to guide filmmakers in their craft."

The task of defining a chronology of events that have shaped regional cinema is hampered by the dearth of documentation describing in detail the different kinds of films produced, the lack of archival records and extant films, and the scant level of scholarly and critical writing on regional cinema issues and concerns. Just the same, an initial narrative needs to be constructed to help contextualize and make sense of available and assorted documents and materials on regional cinema.

In her article &#x201C;Cebuano Cinema: Then and Now,&#x201D; Cinema Rehiyon festival curator Maria Victoria Beltran reports that Cebu had an active film industry before the World War II. Its first locally produced talking film in 1938 was Piux Kabahar&#x2019;s<b><i> <a href=\"/4/24/1122\"><strong>Bertoldo ug Balodoy</strong></a> </i></b>(Bertoldo and Balodoy). Produced by Virgilio Gonzalez of Estudio America-Filipino, the film is about the comic adventures of a pair of Siamese twins. Other prominent films that were made in this era of Cebuano cinema were <b><i>Gugmang Talagsaon </i></b>(Rare Love), <b><i>Mini</i></b> (Fake), <b><i>Tanso sa Ginto</i> </b>(Copper in Gold),<b> </b>and<b> <i>Bulak sa Lunangan </i></b>(Cotton in the Mud) (Alburo 1997; Deocampo 2005)."

In 1969, the film <b><i>Badlis sa Kinabuhi</i></b> (Life Lines) was nominated in 14 categories at the annual awards of the <a href=\"/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy for Movie Arts and Sciences or FAMAS</a>. <a href=\"/4/26/4679\">Gloria Sevilla</a> won as Best Actress and Frankie Navaja Jr as Best Child Actor."

				"value": "The Cebuano industry continued to produce films well into the 1970s, and a cursory look into the titles and synopses of the films shows output consisting of the staple mix of melodrama, comedy, and action features (Noriega et al. 2014). By 1980 onward, the cost of importing, developing, and printing film stock had become prohibitive due to economic inflation. Film producers resorted to shooting on the cheaper 16mm stock and transferred the edited material to 35mm for theatrical release (Noriega 2014). With mounting production costs, profits plunged, prompting many Cebuano film production companies to fold up and close shop. Although several films that were produced years later attempted to revive it&#x2014;notably, <b><i><strong>Matud Nila</strong> </i></b>, 1991, directed by <a href=\"/4/26/4665\">Leroy Salvador</a>, and <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1262\"><strong>Panaghoy sa Suba</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Call of the River</i></b>), 2004, directed by <a href=\"/4/26/4550\">Cesar Montano</a>.

Sino&apos;ng Lumikha ng Moon Buggy?</i></b> (Who Invented the Yo-yo? Who Created the Moon Buggy?), 1982. Although Kidlat Tahimik was from Baguio, his early films did not tackle the sociocultural concerns faced by indigenous communities in the Mountain Province or the Cordillera region and, instead, critiqued the insidious effects of neocolonialism and globalization.

Although the bulk of mainstream industry films was produced in Manila, the festival aimed to show that this number did not fully define the scope and character of the Philippine national cinema. In the view of the NCCA Cinema Committee, for Philippine cinema to be truly national, films created outside the Manila circuit of production need to be given their own space for exhibition. Cinema Rehiyon thus had two objectives&#x2014;namely, &#x201C;1) to showcase the most outstanding works of regional filmmakers and 2) to discover new and fresh talents by providing them with a venue for their works&#x201D; (Fernandez 2013, 47)."

On the other hand, Mangansakan&#x2019;s <b><i>Limbunan</i></b> and <b><i>Qiyamah</i></b> (<b><i>The Reckoning</i></b>), 2012, unveil a deep reflective and mystical dimension of Muslim life in the Maguindanao region, a depiction that stands in stark contrast to popular media&#x2019;s image of Mindanao as a haven for terrorists. <b><i>Yanggaw</i></b>, 2008, by Negrense filmmaker Richard Somes transplants the cannibalistic force of the aswang, a stock horror figure in Visayan folklore, to an unlikely setting of parental love and self-sacrifice. In a similar vein, Alvin Yapan from Bikol plumbs in <b><i>Debosyon </i></b>(<b><i>Devotion</i></b>), 2013, the animistic and primordial roots of contemporary Filipino religiosity and mores and the age-old battle of the sexes, themes he has also dissected in two previous films,<b><i> Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe</i></b> (<b><i>The Rapture of Fe</i></b>),<b> </b>2009, and <b><i>Gayuma </i></b>(<b><i>Pilgrim Lovers</i></b>), 2011. Up in the north, Mes de Guzman&#x2019;s trilogy, composed of <b><i>Ang Mundo sa Panahon ng Bato </i></b>(<b><i>Stone Is the Earth</i></b>), 2010, <b><i>Ang</i> <i>Mundo sa Panahon ng Yelo</i></b>, 2010, and <b><i>Ang Mundo sa Panahon ng Bakal </i></b>(<b><i>Steel Is the Earth</i></b>), 2013, set in the vast and barren mountains of Nueva Vizcaya, focus on the hidden plight of working children and isolated families looking for a way out of their poverty using their wit and humor while preserving their human dignity."

				"value": "Taken as a whole, the diverse artistic achievements of regional filmmakers open up new modes of expression not previously available or encouraged or supported by the dominant studio system based in Manila. For a long period of time, regional filmmakers were dependent on Manila studios and commercial production houses for production capital, equipment, facilities, labor, promotion, and distribution. For some filmmakers, the expense of commuting from one&#x2019;s provincial residence to Manila was too costly, resulting in the decision to migrate to Manila and work with the studios. Consequently, since the studios were principally connected to the Manila system of exhibitors and distributors, stories onscreen were often about life in Manila rather than in the regions. The commercial returns that a producer reaped from initial screenings in Manila alone ranged from 40 percent to 60 percent on the returns of his or her investment and this drove the choice of material that had to be relevant to the paying audiences (Tiongson 2010, 2-41). Every now and then, a few films set outside Manila would emerge but the aesthetics and treatment of the subjects was customized for the taste of Manila audiences. For example, Peque Gallaga&#x2019;s 1982 family epic <b><i>Oro, Plata, Mata</i></b>, produced by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, charts the decadence of a sugar hacendero and his family before, during, and after the Japanese occupation. Although the film follows the travails of a landed Negrense family, the lead and supporting characters, including a number of the extras, throughout the film converse most of the time in Tagalog instead of Ilonggo for the convenience of Manila audiences (Yuson 2001, 294-305). Interestingly enough, decades later Peque Gallaga with co-director Lore Reyes produced for the 2013 Sineng Pambansa the film <b><i><strong>Sonata</strong> </i></b>, set in another Negros hacienda with dialogue predominantly in Ilonggo."

				"value": "In 1987, archivist Teddy Co, in an article published in <b><i>Movement</i></b>, the film journal of the <a href=\"/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund Film Institute</a>, described the disparity in the content of Filipino films: &#x201C;The Philippine movie industry has always been centered in Manila. All the major film production companies, film distributors, processing laboratories and post-production facilities are virtually clustered in the urban areas of Metro Manila. As such, the films produced cannot help but carry a strong Manila flavor, even if they have been shot in other parts of the country&#x201D; (2009). In turn, the authentic representation of the life of majority of Filipinos living in the regions where over 180 indigenous groups are said to live has for some time received scant attention or has been riddled with misconceptions about regional culture in numerous mainstream films. Consequently, the dearth of films presenting a true portrait of life in the regions has caused the regional as a specific marker of cultural identity to be invisible. With the displacement of the regional by film subjects privileged and patronized by Manila producers and audiences, films done in Manila have defined the nature and identity of Philippine national cinema. The centralization of film industry activity in Manila and its extension into and collaboration with allied media industries, such as television and print, have institutionalized a system of providing entertainment revolving around Manila studio system aesthetics. This system has also spread to areas outside of Manila. For example, in the case of the Cebuano movie industry, which until 1980 was a thriving sector, the selection of films for production mirrored the Manila studio system&#x2019;s penchant for formulaic mainstream subject matter. A survey of the synopses of Cebuano films in Noriega&#x2019;s study (2014) suggests that the films were largely genre works like their Manila counterparts except that the dialogue happened to be in Cebuano. Thus, within and outside of Metro Manila, the output of commercial film studios in the form of mainstream movies was homogenized and characterized by adherence to Manila studio system styles and requirements. The identity of national cinema was largely circumscribed by genre films produced in Manila or emulating the Manila studio style."

				"value": "A check into various writings on Philippine national cinema also shows the lack of critical attention given to the development or appraisal of regional cinema. Unlike Philippine national literature which actively integrates the diverse strands of writings from different parts of the archipelago, critical writing on Philippine cinema has served little notice on the contributions of regional form to the national identity primarily due to the lack of extant regional films. However, recent research into secondary sources found in publications during the pre-World War II years shows that in other parts of the country like Cebu, regional filmmaking was already taking place for quite some time (Beltran 2009, 33-34; Noriega 2014). These activities, however, go by unnoticed in various writings on Philippine film history, such as Bienvenido Lumbera&#x2019;s &#x201C;Kasaysayan at Tunguhin ng Pelikulang Pilipino&#x201D; (History and Direction of Philippine Cinema) and <a href=\"/4/26/4693\">Agustin Sotto</a>&#x2019;s &#x201C;A Brief History of Philippine Cinema&#x201D; (Tiongson 1983, 22-47; 2010, 44-57). As a cultural entity, there is also little to be found about regional cinema and its influence on the discourse of Filipino film aesthetics. While certain discourses have been made about the Filipino worldview in film, as in Tiongson&#x2019;s &#x201C;Four Values in Filipino Drama and Film&#x201D; (Tiongson 1983, 102-25), the inquiry into the representation of these cultural values has often been tied up with Tagalog culture."

				"value": "In both creative and critical endeavors, regional cinema has been for some time on the periphery of the discourse on national cinema. Regional cinema&#x2019;s representation of life in the islands and provinces has been driven to the fringes of the film industry, given the totalizing influence of the Manila studio system. In certain films, regional representations would appear but often become distorted through the lens of the Manila studio system and in the form of shopworn stereotypes (e.g., the head-hunting Ifugao, the contentious Waray, the naive Ilonggo, or the militant Tausug). In a way, regional cinema has become the mysterious and exotic Other of the dominant Manila studio system subject to parody, caricature, or travesty."

In his closing speech at the 1st Cinema Rehiyon in 2009, festival director Gabriel Fernandez asserted the following: &#x201C;In various languages and dialects that reflect our diverse heritage, we say: we will no longer allow regional cinema to be relegated to the back pages in the annals of Philippine cinema. We come to claim what is truly ours: the right to be included in the national discourse on film&#x201D; (Fernandez 2013, 46). Regional cinema is thus a marker of presence. For a number of regional filmmakers, regional cinema is a movement from the margins to the center involving the de-Manilanization of national cinema and, in the process, the formation of a more inclusive national cinema."

Regional filmmakers regard the boon in digital film technologies as a source of agency for production and distribution and realizing and advancing the movement&#x2019;s agenda."

He was blessed with the courage of a true leader, but his quick temper easily earned the hatred of the other generals and became the cause of his assassination. <b><i>Heneral Luna</i></b><i> </i>(General Luna), 2015, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>, focuses on Luna&rsquo;s disagreement with the American occupation of the Philippines and how this would become the cause of several conflicts with his own countrymen that would climactically result in Luna&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other films focus on historical events, like <b><i>La Conquista de Manila </i></b>(The Conquest of Manila), 1912, which glorified the Legazpi expedition, and <b><i>Patria Amore </i></b>(Beloved Country), 1929, a film about the Philippine revolution. The film earned the ire of the Spanish community, which sought an injunction to prevent the movie from being shown. A film about the Japanese occupation of the country is <b><i>Manila: Open City</i></b>, 1968, which focuses on the Battle of Manila during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"true\" name=\"true\"></a>True-to-Life Stories</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nature of an individual&rsquo;s claim to public attention is an important consideration in deciding whether to use his or her biography as subject matter for a movie. There are generally three types of <b>true-to-life movies</b>: films about personalities who are being proposed as examplars of civic and humanitarian values, films about so-called notorious personalities, and films based on biographies as political advertisements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are films about contemporary men and women who are presented as exemplars of civic and humanitarian virtues. Jose Domingo Badilla was close to his times when he made <b><i>Princess Tarhata</i></b>, 1931, based on the real-life story of the daughter of the sultan of Sulu. She was one of the early Filipino scholars sent to the United States for studies, and upon her return she set up schools for the education of Filipinos in Mindanao. A second version of the Princess Tarhata story, <b><i>Tarhata</i></b>, 1941, was made by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a> starring Corazon Noble, and a third, <b><i>Tarhata</i></b>, 1957, marked the debut of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4644\">Lolita Rodriguez</a> in Philippine filmdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sampaguita also made a film out of the life and times of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4343\">Rudy Concepcion</a>, one of its more popular prewar actors, titled <b><i>Ang Kasaysayan ni Rudy</i> <i>Concepcion </i></b>(The Story of Rudy Concepcion), 1952. He died under mysterious circumstances at the height of his popularity, and throngs of movie fans turned up at his wake and funeral. A soldier who distinguished himself in the anti-insurgency campaign of the 1950s is the central figure in Nilo Saez&rsquo;s <b><i>Nicolas Feliciano: Ang Huk-Fighter ng Tarlac </i></b>(Nicolas Feliciano: The Huk-Fighter of Tarlac), 1978. Following the 1986 EDSA Revolt, a string of movies about converted rebels includes the biographies of Bernabe Buscayno, Victor Corpus, and the rebel-priest Conrado Balweg, each one implying that the fall of the Marcos dictatorship pointed to better times ahead. A film about the life of Iglesia ni Cristo leader Felix Manalo, titled <b><i>Felix Manalo</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>was released in 2015. Detailing his religious journey toward the founding of Iglesia ni Cristo, the film was directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a> and featured <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4709\">Dennis Trillo</a> in the title role.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are also movies based on the lives of notorious personages, particularly criminals. Notoriety, for one, as spread by print and broadcast media, leaves a deeper impression than bland innocence. The story of Teodoro Asedillo, a schoolteacher-turned rebel who was hunted down by government forces in the mountains of Tayabas, provided director VicenteSalumbides with material for <b><i>Pugad ng <strong>Aguila</strong> </i> </b>(Eagle&rsquo;s Nest), 1938. Another rebel provided the subject for the first film of Lamberto Avellana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1275\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>, 1939. The controversy over this film biography of Macario Sakay, the revolutionary leader tagged as a bandit by the American colonial government, led Avellana to comment 40 years later that if he were to do a remake of his film, the film would show Sakay as a freedom fighter, the way he was depicted years after by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1276\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>, 1993. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1173\">Hanggang sa Dulo ng Daigdig</a> </i></b>(To the Ends of the Earth), 1958, is an imaginatively embellished account of the career in crime of the outlaw Nardong Putik. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> starrer <b><i>Asiong Salonga</i></b>, 1962, was the first of a spate of films whose commercial appeal was based on material purportedly taken from the lives of real-life underworld characters. <b><i>Hindi sa Iyo</i> <i>ang Mundo, Baby Porcuna </i></b>(The World Is Not Yours, Baby Porcuna), 1978, a film by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4745\">Danny Zialcita</a>, carried an admonition to would-be criminals. During the martial law regime, the board of censors compelled producers to include in their film titles a warning or judgment on the biographical account of the &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; contained in the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lastly, there are films based on biography as political advertisement. To this group belong the films commissioned by politicians to project themselves and their political programs during an election campaign. <b><i>Iginuhit ng <strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b>(Destined by Fate), 1965, a film bio on Ferdinand E. Marcos who was running for president against the incumbent Diosdado Macapagal, attained the status of a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre when it was refused a permit for exhibition by the board of censors. To counter the impact of the Marcos film on the voters, Macapagal supporters funded a film on the life of their candidate, <b><i>Tagumpay ng Mahirap </i></b>(Triumph of the Poor), 1965, which, however, failed to get Macapagal reelected. Another film in this category is the <b><i>Arsenio Lacson</i> <i>Story</i></b>,<i> </i>1963, with Fred Montilla in the role of Manila&rsquo;s colorful mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lastly, many films have capitalized on sensational stories that came from news articles and magazine features. Actual crime stories were further sensationalized by Carlo Caparas in his <b><i>The Vizconde Massacre Story:</i></b> <b><i>God Help Us!</i></b>, 1993, <b><i>The Maggie de la Riva Story:</i></b><i> <b>God&hellip; Why Me?</b></i>, 1994, and <b><i>The Lilian Velez Story: Till Death Do Us Part</i></b>, 1995, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"theater\" name=\"theater\"></a>Theater</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the history of the Filipino film, the relationship between cinema and theater has been so familiar and familial that it is almost taken for granted. From 1912 to the 1950s, the mainstream cinema was created by directors, actors, and writers who either &ldquo;migrated&rdquo; to the screen from the traditional stage or continued to straddle both worlds: <i>sarsuwelista</i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3104\">Titay Molina</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">Atang dela Rama</a>, and the Ilagan clan; <i>bodabilista </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2880\">Katy dela Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, and the Salvador clan. Moreover, this cinema had to orient itself to audiences that had been reared on the content and production conventions of the komedya, sinakulo, sarsuwela, drama, and bodabil. On the other hand, since the 1960s, the artistic films of the <b>New Cinema</b> have been made by directors, actors, and designers who imbibed the influences and styles of modern Western theater (and film as well) from Americanized schools and non- or semi-professional drama groups in or outside of academe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The komedya is a play whose story is usually taken from or patterned after those of metrical romances called awit and korido. One kind of komedya known as the <i>moro-moro </i>tells a long-winded story (usually taking from three to nine days to finish) about the struggles between the Christian and Moorish kingdoms in medieval Europe. Important features of the komedya are the <i>torneo </i>(tournament) in which courtiers and peasants of various kingdoms fight one another to win a princess&rsquo;s hand, and the battles among princes and princesses and armies, which invariably end in the victory of the Christian kingdom, with the Moro<i> </i>being baptized in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a> produced movies based on famous awit and komedya, such as <b><i>Principe Te&ntilde;oso </i></b>(Prince Te&ntilde;oso), 1942, as well as <strong>komedya-type movies</strong> like <b><i>Aladin</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1946. When <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, one of the LVN directors, formed his own production company, he also turned to the komedya for the plots of his movies, such as <b><i>Prinsipe Paris </i></b>(Prince Paris), 1949, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1291\">Siete Infantes de Lara</a> </i></b>(<b><i>Seven Devils</i></b>), 1950. Today, the komedya survives in action films that feature the <i>bakbakan </i>or fight between the forces of good and evil and the <i>palasintahan </i>or love scenes between idealized heroes and heroines who are eventually reunited in spite of overwhelming odds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sinakulo or passion play is a theatrical version of the <i>pasyon</i>, a verse narrative on the life, sufferings, and crucifixion of Christ. It survives in movies billed as &ldquo;Lenten offerings,&rdquo; which have Christlike heroes or Mary-like heroines, such as Rosa Aguirre in <b><i>Siete Dolores </i></b>(Seven Sorrows), 1948, or RosaMia in <b><i>Pitong Kalbaryo ni Inang </i></b>(Mother&rsquo;s Seven Calvaries), 1962. Their meekness and sacrifices are invariably rewarded in the end. One of the most notable <b>screen sinakulo</b> is <b><i>Kalbaryo ni Hesus </i></b>(The Calvary of Jesus), 1952.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sinakulo survives most strongly in the Filipino&rsquo;s value system, which always favors the underdog. In <b><i>Roberta</i></b>, 1951, the much-abused heroine (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4247\">Tessie Agana</a> as the neglected orphan) suffers physical injury, maltreatment, and oppression but is rewarded in the end. Rosa (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4688\">Charito Solis</a>) in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1224\"><strong>Malvarosa</strong></a></i></b>,<b> </b>1958, suffers insults, misinterpretation, and trials from her four brothers but forgives them for their misdeeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many film <b>melodramas</b> have evolved from another sinakulo character, Mary Magdalene, who is depicted as a wanton woman with a heart of gold. The late <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4460\">Rita Gomez</a> became famous for portraying this character in movies like <b><i>Talipandas</i></b> (Wayward),<b><i> </i></b>1958. Films like <b><i>Tatlong Magdalena</i></b> (Three Magdalenes), 1960, and <b><i>Alas 5 ng Hapon: Gising Na ang mga Anghel </i></b>(It&rsquo;s Five O&rsquo;clock in the Afternoon: The Angels Are Awake), 1975, about the bar girls of Olongapo, also have Magdalene types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Probably the most prolific of all the dramatic progenitors of the Filipino film was the sarsuwela, (descended from the Spanish <i>zarzuela</i>), a musical comedy that supplanted the komedya in Manila from the 1900s to the 1930s. It is essentially a love story with songs and dances as highlights. Many sarsuwela were transplanted directly from stage to screen and may be called filmed sarsuwela. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><b><i>Walang Sugat </i></b></a>(No Wounds), 1902, was first made into a film by Albert Yearsley, 1912, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>, 1939, the latter starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a>. A third version was made by LVN in 1957 with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4552\">Mario Montenegro</a> and Charito Solis, directed by Lamberto Avellana. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b></a> (Country Maiden), 1919, was the first Nepomuceno film and starred the original sarsuwela stars, Atang de la Rama and Marceliano Ilagan. <b><i>Mahiwagang Binibini</i></b> (Mysterious Lady), 1939, which launched <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a>&rsquo;s film career, was based on a sarsuwela by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2888\">Servando delos Angeles</a>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\">Ang Kiri</a> </i></b>(The Flirt). After the sarsuwela disappeared from the stage, it migrated to film, creating the film sarsuwela or sarsuwela originally created for the screen. Such were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Bituing Marikit</strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Beautiful Star), 1937, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><b><i><strong>Giliw Ko</strong> </i></b></a> (My Beloved), 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the tradition of the drama come the <b>situation comedies</b> revolving around misunderstandings, as in the Pugo and Togo movies; and the melodramas about persecuted children as portrayed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\">Tita Duran</a> in <b><i>Alipin ng Palad </i></b>(Slave of Fate), 1938, and miserable wives as typified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4560\">Rosario Moreno</a> in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\">Tunay na Ina</a> </i></b>(Real Mother), 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finally, the influence of bodabil may be seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><b>musicals</b></a> with lavish production numbers featuring pop songs and dances, as seen in the grand musicals of Sampaguita Pictures: <b><i>Vod-A-Vil</i></b>, 1953; <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b>, 1962; and <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In general, the following characteristics of the traditional stage were &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; by mainstream Filipino cinema: plots consisting of &ldquo;major&rdquo; events arranged chronologically and designed to come to a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; ending&mdash;through a series of coincidences, revelations, chance encounters, and other forms of deus ex machina&mdash;which reaffirms the values of the establishment; idealized characters who are clearly identified as heroes or villains and who speak a language associated with their stereotypes; acting that is equated with masks of expressions and sets of gestures and mannerisms that symbolize rather than express emotions; direction that merely strings together rather than interprets characters and situations; cinematography that often merely &ldquo;records&rdquo; rather than interprets the characters, situations, and moods of a story; and editing that evokes the leisurely pace of komedya performances in rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the exposure of directors, actors, and designers to modern western theater since the 1960s and their immersion in productions of plays by Ibsen, Strindberg, Williams, Miller, and Durenmatt, a definite change could be observed in the conceptualization and execution of the films of the New Cinema. Viewing film as art, the New Cinema is partial to stories that highlight the uniqueness of individuals; plots that develop character more than action; dialogue, costumes, makeup, and sets that delineate character and mood; acting that is internalized and individualized; direction that pulls together all aspects of production into a cohesive artistic whole; cinematography that visualizes content, defines time/mood/character through lighting, composition, and camera movements; and editing that supports the internal rhythm of a film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of <b>digital filmmaking</b> in the early 2000s enabled a diverse number of filmmakers to produce works that could not have been done otherwise due to economic constraints. These include films adapted from the &ldquo;legitimate theater.&rdquo; In 2002, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a> adapted <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/642\"><strong>Paraisong Parisukat</strong></a> </i></b>(Square Eden), a one-act play written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3113\">Orlando Nadres</a> and first staged by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> in 1974.

Most of these efforts can be attributed to the success of the film as having achieved an iconic stature whether critically of commercially, or both. Two of Lino Brocka&rsquo;s films with complex characterizations that actors find challenging have been adapted to theater. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>debuted onstage in 2003 and was restaged in 2007, produced by Tanghalang Pilipino and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, considered by many as one of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>&rsquo;s finest screen turns, was staged by PETA in 2012, with Layeta Bucoy as writer and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3322\">Soxie Topacio</a> as director. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4415\">Eugene Domingo</a> played the title role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aunor&rsquo;s first foray into theater was through an adaptation of another movie she made. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4759\">Lupita Concio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1237\"><b><i>Minsa&rsquo;y Isang Gamu-gamo</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>Once a Moth</i></b>),<i> </i>1976,<i> </i>which rallies against American military presence in the country, was adapted for the stage in 1991 by writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a> and director Soxie Topacio.

Beliefs and superstitions about preternatural creatures, spirits, and ghosts of an animist past still haunt the Filipino psyche. The darkened movie theater or cinema house is a natural setting for the telling of scary stories. These considerations must have motivated the producers of the first Filipino talking picture, <b><i>Ang Aswang </i></b>(The Aswang), 1933, to base their material on folklore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To our day, the explorations of Filipino folklore continue to be done mostly in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><b>horror films</b></a>, a genre that, in its boundaries and conventions, takes advantage of the traditional customs, beliefs, stories, superstitions, and sayings, often evoking the strange and supernatural. Possibly the most commercially successful of this venture is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1289\"><b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll</i></b> </a>film series, produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a>. Its first installment was released in 1984, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4301\">Emmanuel H. Borlaza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a>. The latest of these installments, <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll XV</i></b>, was released in 2014 as one of the entries in the Metro Manila Film Festival. Every <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll </i></b>installment<b> </b>is composed of three episodes, and each dwells on the fear and mystery rooted in the yet unknown. May it be about a creepy refrigerator that lusts after women, a group of friends on a trip in a faraway province inhabited by vampires, a sea creature that takes revenge for the loss of her eggs by killing a group of people, a monster on the train, strange and beautiful creatures in the forest casting a spell on a band of young men, or a funeral parlor housing a family of flesh eaters, the films in the franchise acquaint the audience not only with common mythical creatures whose stories have been passed on from generation to generation, but also with bizarre tales brought about by current themes (Ondoy, transportation woes, thrift shops) with terrifying consequences. Focusing more on special effects and less on prosthetics by mid-2000s, <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll </i></b>films proved to be a crowd favorite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4690\">Richard Somes</a> is one of the filmmakers who had his break in the said franchise, with his segment &ldquo;Lihim ng San Joaquin&rdquo;<i> </i>(The Secret of San Joaquin)<i> </i>in <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll 2K5</i></b>, 2005. Three years later, he released <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1317\"><strong>Yanggaw</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Affliction) and gained critical recognition. The film was remarkable for its impressive technical feat, which was a far cry from the cheap thrills and lousy prosthetics done in previous retelling of the aswang story. By focusing on the family of the aswang, it is able to provide a new perspective and conflict that invigorates this oft-told story. <b><i>Yanggaw</i></b><i> </i>is proof that no matter how overused the material is, there will always be ways to enliven the subject. Somes went on to direct another episode for <b><i>Shake Rattle &amp; Roll 13</i></b>, 2011, and <b><i>Corazon: Ang Unang Aswang</i></b> (Corazon: The First Vampire), 2012, in almost a similar vein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two of the most highly regarded filmmakers who have made significant contribution to the popularization of Philippine folklore and legends are Peque Gallaga and Lore Reyes. With works such as <b><i>Hiwaga sa Balete Drive</i></b> (Mystery on Balete Drive), 1988, <b><i>Tiyanak </i></b>(Changeling), 1988, <b><i>Aswang</i></b>, 1992, and <b><i><strong>Halik</strong> ng Bampira</i></b> (Kiss of a Vampire), 1997, they retell the myths and scares and create some of the most terrifying moments in local cinema. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4650\">Chito Ro&ntilde;o</a> directed <b><i>Sukob</i></b> (The Wedding Curse), 2006, <b><i>T2</i></b>, 2009, and <b><i>The Healing</i></b>, 2012, tackling superstitions, spirits, and doppelg&auml;ngers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of folklore, however, is not confined to the retelling of horror tales. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Mariang</i></b><i> <b>Alimango </b></i>(Maria the Crab), 1938, is a captivating folk fantasy influenced by the Cinderella-type folk story. Toward the end of the story, the huge crab that befriends the lonely, oppressed girl washing clothes by the riverside is transformed into her fairy godmother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<i> alamat </i>(legend) has long been a favorite source of material for Filipino films. <b><i><strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong> </i></b>,<b> </b>1951, and <b><i>Mariang Sinukuan</i></b>, 1955, were based on legends about strong men and beautiful women. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Anting-Anting </i></b>(Amulet), 1934, presented a romanticized version of the &ldquo;Malakas at Maganda&rdquo; (The Strong and the Beautiful) legend. Another legend, the tale of the enchantress Maria Makiling was the subject of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4581\">Carlos Padilla</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Makiling</i></b>, 1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Where the subject matter is not drawn directly from folklore, a filmmaker may choose to adopt the narrative structure of the alamat. As a narrative form, the alamat allows a writer to make use of exaggeration or even fantasy, in dealing with a serious subject. Thus, directors/scriptwriters wanting to suggest to moviegoers a particular way of looking at the narrative choose to frame characters and incidents within a legend. In <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1284\">Sawa sa Lumang Simboryo</a> </i></b>(Python in the Old Dome), 1952, director Gerardo de Leon modulated the implausibilities in Amado Yaso&ntilde;a&rsquo;s komiks story by making the film narrative appear to be a tale contained in the ballad sung on the soundtrack. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4580\">Consuelo P. Osorio</a>&rsquo;s movie about the early years of Spanish colonization, <b><i>Alamat ng Perlas na <strong>Itim</strong> </i></b>(Legend of the Black Pearl), 1949, endowed its story with romance by claiming that the narrative was drawn from a legend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folkways have the appeal of exoticism in that they generally suggest customs and cultural practices from remote times and places. Films supposedly set in precolonial Philippines would claim that they are authentic accounts of the lives of early Philippine folk. Three movies set in precolonial times purport to show how Filipinos in ancient times lived: Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>Banaue</i></b>, 1975; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kamakalawa </i></b>(Day before Yesterday), 1982; and Lamberto Avellana&rsquo;s <b><i>Waywaya</i></b>, 1983. In these films, a grasp of the authentic early culture of the inhabitants was tenuous at best, so the directors had to depend heavily on the resourcefulness of the scriptwriter and the production designer to simulate lifeways and customs supposedly of the remote past. Folklore and &ldquo;fakelore&rdquo; have been mixed with impunity in more recent films using folk materials. This is to be observed in the series of film biographies of real-life social outcasts and underworld characters with which RamonRevilla endeared himself to fans of action films. Revilla attributed to the characters he played superhuman powers allegedly acquired through the agency of an <i>agimat </i>(charm) or <i>anting-anting </i>(amulet). <b><i>Hulihin si Tiagong Akyat </i></b>(Capture Tiagong Akyat), 1973, was the first in the series that has become &ldquo;folkloric&rdquo; through sheer gimmickry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Once upon a Time</i></b>, 1987, PequeGallaga tried to wed the past and the present by freely mixing traditional creatures of the folk imagination and contemporary character types. He secured the services of the popular film comedian Dolphy and an array of big stars in cameo roles for his movie. Critics, however, have raised the question of how far folklore may be reinterpreted in our time without losing its relevance and appeal to moviegoers who may be presumed to remain active participants in the traditional culture of the Filipino folk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the best-known use of folklore as movie material was Manuel Conde&rsquo;s series of film interpretations of the Juan Tamad legends. In 1947, Conde, for the first time, took from folktales the character of the simpleminded country bumpkin who goes by the name, according to the locality, of Juan, Suan, or Pilandok. His first film, a satire on the nouveau riche of the postwar years, was simply titled <b><i>Si Juan Tamad </i></b>(Lazy Juan), 1947. The following year, Conde returned to the comic folk figure and made him a bumbling tattler in <b><i>Juan Daldal </i></b>(Talkative John), 1948. There was an interval of 11 years before Conde again picked up his favorite alter ego. This time the target of his humor was the Filipino politician, and this was made explicit by the title <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1197\"><b><i>Juan Tamad Goes to Congress</i></b></a>, 1959. Three years later, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1198\"><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Society</strong></a></i></b>, 1960, poked fun at the foibles of the rich and famous in Manila&rsquo;s elite. The last film in this series, another satire on politicians, had a remarkably long title, <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1290\"><i>Si Juan</i> </a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1290\">Tamad at si Juan Masipag sa Pulitikang Walang Hanggan</a> </i></b>(Lazy Juan and Industrious Juan in Never-Ending Politics), 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Juan Tamad in another guise is the central character in <b><i>Pedro Penduko</i></b>, 1954, a comedy by Gerardo de Leon based on a komiks serial by the famous illustrator Francisco V. Coching. The misadventures of the character have been made familiar by the many versions of the Juan Tamad tale. Celso Ad.Castillo picked up the Pedro Penduko character for a comedy-action film titled <b><i>Ang Mahiwagang Daigdig ni Pedro Penduko</i> </b>(The Mysterious World of Pedro Penduko), 1973. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a> produced a revival of the character and his adventures in two installments: <b><i>Ang Pagbabalik ni Pedro Penduko </i></b>(The Return of Pedro Penduko), 1994, directed by Baby Navoa, and <b><i>Pedro Penduko, Episode II: The Return of the Comeback</i></b>, 2000, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4540\">Erik Matti</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Latin America, Brazilian and Cuban filmmakers have delved deeply into their respective folk traditions to create films that are able to stir audiences outside their countries. Prizewinning writer and director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5792\">Alvin Yapan</a> is usually drawn to strongly cultural practices and values that emphasize his Bikol roots, with narratives steeped in mythology and mystery, as exemplified in <b><i>Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe</i></b> (<b><i>The Rapture of Fe</i></b>), 2009, <b><i>Gayuma</i></b> (<b><i>Pilgrim Lovers</i></b>), 2011, and <b><i>Debosyon</i></b> (<b><i>Devotion</i></b>), 2013.

It is possible to argue that the best products of the movie industry have come from this relationship between film and literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two writers of the 19th century, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> (Balagtas) and Jose Rizal, gave the film industry a rich source of subject matter and themes through the classic works that made them famous. The Balagtas epic <i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\">Florante at Laura</a></strong> </i>(Florante and Laura) was first made into a silent movie by Edward Gross in 1917. Two decades later, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a> came up with a talking picture version, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1163\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Florante at Laura</strong> </strong> </i></b></a>, 1939, which incorporated more than 400 lines of the original poem in the dialogue of the speaking characters. The film was so successful that Salumbides did a remake in 1950 with the assistance of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5158\">Nemesio Caravana</a>, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> writer who later became an important director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><b>period</b></a> (costume) pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rizal&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\">Noli Me Tangere</a> </i></b>(Touch Me Not) has had several film versions: one by Edward Gross in 1917, another by Jose Nepomuceno in 1930, a third one by Gerardo de Leon in 1961, and a fourth by Eddie Romero in 1992, which was a movie shot for television. The de Leon film was restored by Harold Brandes of Germany&rsquo;s Federal Archive and turned over to the Philippine government by the Goethe-Institut Manila in 1990. The other Rizal novel, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Subversion), has had two versions: one produced by Gross in 1917 and the other directed by de Leon in 1962. Both the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><b><i>Noli </i></b></a>and the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\">Fili</a> </i></b>versions by de Leon won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences</a> Best Picture award for the years that they were shown. The Rizal novels&rsquo; legacy to Philippine cinema has not been restricted to their narratives. They have also provided distinctive character types as the subjects of other movies: <b><i>Maria Clara</i></b>, 1938; <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1951, 1999, and 2008; <b><i>Elias</i>, <i>Basilio, Sisa</i></b>, 1972;<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Juan de la Cruz</i></b>,<b> </b>a film that was started in 1974 by Gerardo de Leon and left unfinished at his death in 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first Filipino novel in English was made into a movie of the same title, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1722\"><strong>A Child of Sorrow</strong></a></i></b>, 1930, with the author <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5312\">Zoilo Galang</a> directing the film version. Another writer in English, Felicidad Ocampo, had her novel made into the motion picture <b><i>Dahil sa Pagibig </i></b>(Because of Love), 1938. She was known as &ldquo;the only Filipino novelist with technical background in Hollywood.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, the Tagalog novel serialized in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> </i></b>magazine was a rich source of film material.

The emphasis on the source of the narrative content of the film was indicative of the value producers assigned to its literary creators. In some instances, the contemporary reputation of certain writers derived more from their contribution to films than to literature. Lazaro Francisco, I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado, and Fausto J. Galauran continue to figure in discussions concerning authors of Tagalog literature whose novels were turned into films, but <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5780\">Teodoro Virrey</a>, Gregorio Coching, and Jose Esperanza Cruz are better remembered as authors of film narratives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Publishing houses, like Limbagan ni P. Sayo and Imprenta Luz Naciente, also contributed material to the film industry via Tagalog literary works published in book form. Among the more popular movies of the early 1930s were the films based on the outstanding works of two &ldquo;Hari ng Balagtasan&rdquo; (King of Poetic Jousts): <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sa Pinto ng Langit </i></b>(At Heaven&rsquo;s Gate), 1932, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\">Florentino Collantes</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Lumang <strong>Simbahan</strong> </i></b>(The Old Church), 1932.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the new Tagalog writers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5634\">Edgardo M. Reyes</a> has made one of the most celebrated contributions to film. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1796\"><b><i>Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</i></b></a>, his masterpiece, was rendered into a screenplay by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a> and directed by LinoBrocka under the title <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\">Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</a> </i></b>(<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1976. The film was a hit both among critics and audiences, launching Reyes into a career in the film industry. His other novels that were made into movies include <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1211\">Ligaw na Bulaklak</a></i><b><i> </i></b>(Wildflower), 1976, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>; <b><i>Sa Kagubatan ng Lunsod </i></b>(In the Jungle of the City), 1975, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4884\">Nick Lizaso</a>; and <b><i>Mga Uod at <strong><strong>Rosas</strong> </strong> </i></b>(Worms and Roses), 1982, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4697\">Romy Suzara</a>. Reyes, the novelist, was eventually drawn into the industry first as a scriptwriter for <b><i>Atsay </i></b>(The Maid), 1978, and then as director of a film for which he wrote the screenplay, <b><i>Bangkang Papel sa Dagat ng Apoy </i></b>(Paper Boat in Sea of Fire), 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent times, imaginative writers in English have been able to break into film with less fanfare and more aplomb. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;May Day Eve&rdquo; was one of the vignettes in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4462\">Joey Gosiengfiao</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Babae, <strong>Ngayon at Kailanman</strong> </i></b>(Woman, Now and Forever), 1977, which featured two other short stories, &ldquo;Wedding Dance&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5208\">Amador T. Daguio</a> and &ldquo;Juego de Prenda&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5535\">Wilfrido D. Nolledo</a>. The film&rsquo;s scriptwriters were also prominent literary figures: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2943\">Alberto Florentino</a>. Gosiengfiao gave filmic expression to two other Nolledo screenplays: <b><i>La Paloma, ang Kalapating Ligaw </i></b>(La Paloma: The Lost Dove), 1974, and <b><i>Sunugin ang Samar </i></b>(Burn Samar), 1974.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many Filipino literary writers also went into film. Among them are Ricardo Lee, whose several award-winning screenplays include those for the films <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1130\"><strong>Brutal</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><b><i>Himala</i></b></a>, 1982, <b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b>, 1998, <b><i>Mila</i></b>, 2001, and <b><i>Fuschia</i></b>, 2009; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>, whose screenplays include <b><i>Bulaklak sa City Jail </i></b>(<b><i>Flowers of the City Jail</i></b>), 1984, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1114\"><b><i>Bata, Bata &hellip; Paano Ka Ginawa? </i></b></a>(<b><i>Lea&rsquo;s Story</i></b>), 1998, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1151\">Dekada &rsquo;70</a> </i></b>(The 1970s), 2002; Pete Lacaba, whose screenplays include <b><i>Angela Markado </i></b>(Angela the Marked One), 1980, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1293\"><b><i>Sister Stella L.</i></b></a>, 1984, and <b><i>Eskapo: The Sergio Osme&ntilde;a&ndash; <strong>Geny Lopez</strong> Story </i></b>(Fugitive), 1995; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5209\">Jose Y.

Wattpad, an online platform and writing community, has become popular among young readers, and this huge following has encouraged commercial studio outfits to consider it a source of inspiration for some films made in the 2010s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three of the most commercially successful films in 2014 are based on Wattpad stories (all of which were published eventually in book form): <b><i>Diary ng Panget </i></b>(Diary of an Ugly), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3197\">Andoy Ranay</a>; <b><i>She&rsquo;s Dating the Gangster</i></b>, directed by Cathy Garcia-Molina; and <b><i>Talk Back and You&rsquo;re Dead</i></b>, also directed by Andoy Ranay. These movies further established the widespread appeal of Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla (KathNiel) and James Reid and Nadine Lustre (JaDine) as their generation&rsquo;s most bankable love teams, making teen romance a popular genre. The success of these movies led to more productions of Wattpad stories, including <b><i>Your Place or Mine?</i></b>, directed by Joel Lamangan; <b><i>Just the Way You Are</i></b>, directed by Theodore Boborol; and <b><i>Ex with Benefits</i></b>, directed by Gino Santos&mdash;all of which were released in 2015. Following the trend, these films deal with romance and relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"komiks\" name=\"komiks\"></a>Komiks</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From komiks to film is a trend that started in the 1950s. This was the time when a komiks writer like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a> commanded royalties higher than the talent fees of film stars or directors. When SampaguitaPictures signed him up for a 10-picture, five-figure contract in 1956, a <i>Manila Times </i>columnist wryly commented that, to break into the movie scriptwriting business, one must first break into the komiks circuit. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5339\">Pablo S. Gomez</a> was one of the komiks writers who became a successful scriptwriter and, later, movie director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Films based on komiks materials are as varied as the types of stories they have spawned, capturing the collective imagination of readers and viewers alike. They run the gamut from the incredibly fantastic to the dramatically real, with characters that range from the sublime to the ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mars Ravelo excelled in fantasy stories. The characters he created, like the mermaid Dyesebel, and the flying wonder woman Darna, have been depicted on-screen many times. It was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4519\">Edna Luna</a> who first appeared in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><b><i>Dyesebel</i></b></a>, 1953, followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> in 1973, Alma Moreno in 1978, and Alice Dixson in 1990. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a> appeared in the first two Darna pictures, <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 1951, and <b><i>Darna at ang Babaing</i> <i>Lawin </i></b>(Darna and the Hawkwoman), 1952, before she was succeeded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4588\">Gina Pare&ntilde;o</a> in <b><i>Darna at ang Planetman </i></b>(Darna and the Planetman), 1969, Vilma Santos in <b><i>Lipad, Darna, Lipad </i></b>(Fly, Darna, Fly), 1973, and Nanette Medved in <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 1991. Other Mars Ravelo fantasy characters that made it to the screen are the heavenly rooster in <b><i>Texas: Ang Manok na Nagsasalita</i> </b>(Texas: The Talking Rooster), 1952; the weird statue who comes to life in <b><i>Mambo Dyambo</i></b>, 1955; and the talking horse in <b><i>Silveria</i></b>, 1958. Aside from Ravelo, other komiks writers of fantasy tales are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo Sr</a>, author of <b><i>Kerubin </i></b>(Cherub), 1952; Gemiliano Pineda, of <b><i>Tulisang Pugot </i></b>(Headless Bandit), 1953; and Dominador Ad. Castillo, author of <b><i>Cofradia </i></b>(Black Girl), 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dramatic realism is the forte of komiks writer Pablo S. Gomez, whose major triumph, <b><i>Batang Bangkusay </i></b>(Child of the Slums), is best remembered for vividly exposing the violence and poverty of Tondo. Other writers of komiks dramas are Rico Bello Omagap, who wrote for NoraAunor in <b><i>Nasaan Ka, Inay? </i></b>(Where Are You, Mother?), 1970, and Elena Patron, author of the Lino Brocka film <b><i>Kislap sa Dilim</i> </b>(Spark in the Dark), 1991. The love stories of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5146\">Nerissa Cabral</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5540\">Gilda Olvidado</a> continued to win popular audiences as well as critical acclaim. Cabral&rsquo;s <b><i>Paano Ba ang Mangarap?</i> </b>(How Does One Dream?), 1983, and Olvidado&rsquo;s <b><i>Saan</i> <i>Nagtatago ang Pag-ibig? </i></b>(Where Does Love Hide?), 1987, were box-office hits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The romantic tradition in komiks stories of action and adventure is traced to illustrator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3477\">Francisco V. Coching</a>. His works have produced such screen heroes as the jungle man depicted by <strong> </strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4614\">Cesar Ramirez</a> in <b><i>Dumagit</i></b>, 1954, and the bearded rebel portrayed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a> in <b><i>Sabas, Ang Barbaro </i></b>(Sabas, the Barbarian), 1952. One of his most popular creations is the character depicted by Ramirez in <b><i><strong>El Indio</strong> </i></b>(The Native), 1953, a reference to the Filipino of Rizal&rsquo;s time who was depicted in Coching&rsquo;s drawings as tall, handsome, and muscular, with curly or wavy hair and clothes in the European style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For a komiks writer like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>, the primary impulse is to tickle the reader&rsquo;s funny bone. Velasquez poked fun at &ldquo;little brown Americans&rdquo; by making his principal character <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\">Kenkoy</a> ape the Rudolph Valentino hairstyle, wear Western togs, and exhibit mannerisms affected by Hollywood matinee idols. By making fun of the Pinoy colonial mentality, Kenkoy stressed traditional Filipino values embodied in his sweetheart, Rosing. The movie version, <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b>, 1950, starred film comedian Lopito and Filipina beauty VirginiaMontes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another tickler of funny bones is cartoonist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a> whose famous duo, <em><strong>Kalabog and Bosyo</strong> </em>, firmly established the comedy team of Dolphy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a>. <b><i>Kalabog en Bosyo </i></b>(Kalabog and Bosyo), 1959, was followed by a movie sequel, <b><i>Detektib Kalog </i></b>(Detective Kalog), 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is interesting to note that behind some of the most important stars of Filipino cinema, there is at least one memorable movie role or character taken from the komiks. This is true of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a> in his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\">Ang Panday</a> </i></b>(The Blacksmith) <b><i>1</i></b>, <b><i>2</i></b>, <b><i>3</i></b>, and <b><i>4</i></b> of 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1984; Rosa del Rosario in <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 1951; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4247\">Tessie Agana</a> in <b><i>Roberta</i></b>, 1951; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a> in <b><i>MN</i></b>, 1954; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\">Gloria Romero</a> in <b><i>Kurdapya</i></b> (Screwball), 1954; Lolita Rodriguez and Dolphy in <b><i>Jack and Jill</i></b>,<i> </i>1954; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4555\">Fred Montilla</a> in <b><i>Bondying</i></b>, 1954; Rita Gomez in <b><i>Diyosa </i></b>(Goddess), 1957; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4447\">Amalia Fuentes</a> in <b><i>Baby Bubut</i></b>, 1958; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4491\">Hilda Koronel</a> in <b><i>Haydee</i></b>, 1970; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4253\">Gina Alajar</a> in <b><i>Cofradia</i></b>, 1974; Alma Moreno in <b><i>Mrs. Eva Fonda, 16</i></b>, 1976; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\">Susan Roces</a> in <b><i>Maruja</i></b>, 1977; and Zsa Zsa Padilla and Bb Gandanghari (formerly Rustom Padilla) in <b><i>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</i></b>, 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Movies adapted from komiks serials have built-in advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, the komiks&rsquo; wide readership would surely want to see the movie adaptation. However, this same readership and potential movie audience would often demand faithful cinematic translation. They would turn away from the movie if it was too &ldquo;different&rdquo; from what was expected. There is little room for innovative scripting and direction since the movie must please its captive audience. On the other hand, compressing a long komiks storyline into a two-hour movie tends to magnify apparent violations of the rules of logic that are not immediately discernible in the original story. While the constraints of writing a serial that runs for weeks and months on end inevitably lead to inconsistencies that are ignored by the komiks reader, the corresponding movie should rise above its print version if it must reach the level of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wrong plot turns and lack of attention to small details can become glaring, unforgivable errors when retold on the big screen. The level of enjoyment one gets from watching a movie rendition of a komiks story ultimately depends on how credibly the filmmakers, both the scriptwriter and the director, fuse together the various elements of the two forms. Komiks and film may be strange bedfellows but a harmonious collaboration between the komiks writer and the filmmakers may initiate a creative participatory process among readers and viewers so that they can become more appealing and less appalling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"radio\" name=\"radio\"></a>Radio</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio has provided Filipino cinema with two types of materials: the radio drama and the drama musical. The radio drama is also known as soap opera since sponsors are usually manufacturers of laundry and toilet soap. Among such firms, the best known are Philippine Manufacturing Company (PMC) and Philippine Refining Company (PRC). Radio dramas may be comedy, fantasy, horror, or melodrama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The best example of the comedy form in radio drama is Beer Flores&rsquo;s story about the daydreamer Edong, which featured comedians Eddie San Jose, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\">Bentot</a>, Pugo and Tugo, and singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>. This spawned a series of films such as <b><i>Edong</i> <i>Mapangarap </i></b>(Edong the Dreamer), 1950; <b><i>Sebya, Mahal Kita </i></b>(Sebya, I Love You), 1957; <b><i>My Little Kuwan</i></b>, 1958; <b><i>Yantok Mindoro </i></b>(Rattan from Mindoro), 1960; and <b><i>Tang-Tarang Tang</i></b>, 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1489\"><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong></a> </i></b>(Prince Amante), 1950, and its sequel <b><i>Prinsipe Amante sa Rubitanya </i></b>(Prince Amante in Rubitanya), 1951, were based on fantasy radio dramas, written by Clodualdo del Mundo Sr. Listeners-turned-viewers were delighted to see <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a> as Prinsipe Amante and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4241\">Richard Abelardo</a>&rsquo;s special effects and camera wizardry that gave visual equivalents to their fantasies about kingdoms and castles, princes and princesses. Another film based on a popular fantasy radio drama was <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1471\"><i>Mga Kuwento ni <strong>Lola</strong> </i> </a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1471\">Basyang</a> </i></b>(Stories of Grandma Basyang), 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The horror type of radio drama is best represented by <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim </i></b>(Night of Terror), 1960. Radio announcer Ben David made a trademark out of the sinister laugh that only his unique vocal chords could provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most radio soap operas fall into the category of melodrama. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\">Lina Flor</a> was hailed Queen of Radio Dramas when a movie based on her work, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><i>Gulong ng</i> </a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\">Palad</a></i><b><i> </i></b>(Wheel of Fortune), 1950, started the trend of film melodramas based on radio plays. A drama of everyday life centering on the ups and downs of a typical Filipino married couple, it made the names of Carding and Luisa household words. Another popular Lina Flor soap opera was <b><i>Kasaysayan ni Dr. Ramon</i> <i>Selga </i></b>(The Story of Dr Ramon Selga), 1951, which had to be filmed again when the original finished product, already in the can, was destroyed in a big studio fire at Sampaguita. Other authors of radio plays whose works became popular film melodramas are Lourdes Carillo, C. Pagibigan Cruz, Mario Mijares Lopez, Aning Bagabaldo, and familiar names in Tagalog literature like Gemiliano Pineda and Clodualdo del Mundo Sr. Some of these writers became well-known movie directors, like Mar S. Torres and SusanaC.deGuzman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other type of film based on radio shows is the <b>drama musical</b> or <b>variety show</b>. Some famous examples are <b><i>Mga <strong>Reyna ng Vicks</strong> </i></b>(Queen of Vicks), 1958, where housewives won the title &ldquo;Queen for a Day&rdquo; on the strength of their true confessions, and <b><i>TawagngTanghalan </i></b>(Call of the Stage), 1958, based on the popular amateur singing contest that produced some of the nation&rsquo;s finest singers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\">Diomedes Maturan</a> and Nora Aunor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio has also thematically inspired film narratives. <b><i>Radyo </i></b>(Radio), 2001, a film by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a>, features an insane character that seeks to take revenge on a radio DJ when the latter made fun of his request to play a song for a woman he is attracted to. <b><i>Love Notes</i></b>, 1995, a film by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4392\">Maryo J. de los Reyes</a>, features a love-themed plot that interweaves a visual display of events and their radio-based storytelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"television\" name=\"television\"></a>Television</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the very start, the relationship between film and television has been both contradictory and complementary. Successful TV programs and formats make good film material. The popularity of drama series, such as <b><i>Mula sa Puso</i></b> (From the Heart), 1997-99, and <b><i>Esperanza</i></b>, 1997-99, led to commercially successful movie adaptations, both released in 1999. Lead stars <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4286\">Claudine Barretto</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\">Judy Ann Santos</a>, both considered to be the finest actors of their time, made a name for themselves with dramatic roles on television, resulting not only in a streak of notable shows but also in promising careers in film. Santos&rsquo;s earlier series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1466\"><strong>Mara Clara</strong></a></i></b>, 1992-97, was groundbreaking in its time, given its consistently high ratings (ascertaining its strong audience command) and its extrapolation of the <i>bida</i> (protagonist) and <i>kontrabida</i> (antagonist) as personified distinctly by Santos and Gladys Reyes. Clearly an indication of its fame, a movie was produced based on the series while it was still airing, released in 1996, directed by Jerry Lopez Sineneng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several TV sitcoms had also found their way to the silver screen. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), a popular TV sitcom that aired from 1973 to 1990, was translated into several films from 1974 to 1991. Another popular sitcom, <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b><i> </i>(Truants), which ran on TV from 1977 to 1990, inspired a series of movies from 1977 to 2008.<b><i> Buddy en Sol: Sine Ito </i></b>(Buddy and Sol: The Movie), 1992, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3084\">Leo Martinez</a> and Boots Plata, was based on a long-running sitcom that aired on RPN 9. <b><i>Bad Bananas sa Puting Tabing </i></b>(Bad Bananas on Silver Screen), 1983, directed by Peque Gallaga, was based on the comedy and variety TV show <b><i>Goin&rsquo; Bananas</i></b>, which ran from 1987 to 1991. <b><i>Home along da <strong>Riles</strong> </i></b> (Home along the Railroad), 1993, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\">Johnny Manahan</a>, and <b><i>Home along da Riles Part 2</i></b>, 1997, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4481\">Efren Jarlego</a>, were based on the hit TV comedy series starring Dolphy and Nova Villa about a family living near the railway tracks and their hilarious daily struggles. Another high-rated sitcom, <b><i>Oki Doki Doc</i></b>, which aired between 1993 and 2000, spawned a film of the same title, released in 1996 and directed by Efren Jarlego. It featured the same stars in the series, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4563\">Aga Muhlach</a>, Agot Isidro, Claudine Barretto, and Jimmy Santos. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1524\"><strong>Wansapanataym</strong></a></i></b> (Once Upon a Time), 1999, directed by Johnny Manahan and starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4385\">Christopher de Leon</a>, Shaina Magdayao, and Serena Dalrymple, came after the successful run of the award-winning children-oriented show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other TV programs focus on fantastical themes. Possibly the most profitable crossover from TV to film is <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!), which made its home in three networks (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4851\">IBC 13</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4842\">GMA Network</a>) from 1987 to 1997. The original cast includes Vic Sotto as Enteng Kabisote, Alice Dixson as Faye, and Charito Solis as Ina Magenta. Due to its unrivaled popularity and appeal to young audiences, eight movies were based on the fantasy series, all of which were box-office triumphs: <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b>, 1991; <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko! Part 2</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Enteng Kabisote: Okay Ka, Fairy Ko: The Legend</i></b>, 2004; <b><i>Enteng Kabisote 2: Okay Ka, Fairy Ko&hellip; The Legend Continues</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>Enteng Kabisote 3: Okay Ka, </i></b><b><i>Fairy Ko: The Legend Goes On and On and On</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Enteng Kabisote 4: Okay Ka, Fairy Ko: The Beginning of the Legend</i></b>, 2007; <b><i>Si Agimat at si Enteng Kabisote </i></b>(Agimat and Enteng Kabisote), 2010; <b><i>Enteng ng Ina Mo</i></b> (Your Mother&rsquo;s Enteng), 2011; and <b><i>Si Agimat, si Enteng Kabisote at Ako</i></b> (Agimat, Enteng, and I), 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television is a source of star material for film. Popular shows, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4909\">German Moreno</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1514\"><b><i>That&rsquo;s Entertainment</i></b></a>, have provided the industry with a number of young talented stars. Among those who have entered the film industry via the television medium are MaricelSoriano of the <b><i>John en Marsha </i></b>TV series and Alice Dixson, who was launched to movie fame via a TV commercial when she became known as the &ldquo;I can feel it&rdquo; beauty-soap model. Comedian ReneRequiestas also made his name first on TV before becoming a movie star. Others get good exposure on noonday shows such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a> </i></b>(Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!)<b><i> </i></b>and wind up becoming very popular like Tito, Vic and Joey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">TV is a good venue for regular exposure and for honing up the skills of movie hopefuls under buildup contracts. They are seen hosting TV shows, acting, singing, dancing, and the like. Weekly drama anthologies provide good vehicles for them to display their acting talents. The weekly drama special featuring a movie star, usually female, has been a favorite TV format for shows like <b><i>Hilda </i></b>(Hilda Koronel), <b><i>Gretchen</i> </b>(Gretchen Barretto), <b><i>Aiko </i></b>(Aiko Melendez), and <b><i>Sheryl</i> </b>(Sheryl Cruz). The most popular and longest lasting was the <b><i>Maricel Drama Special</i></b>, for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4691\">Maricel Soriano</a>. For the male stars, there were shows like <b><i>Palibhasa Lalake</i> </b>(Because They Are Guys), which greatly enhanced the careers of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4459\">Richard Gomez </a>and Joey Marquez, and <b><i>Buddy en Sol</i></b>, which did likewise for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4613\">Eric Quizon</a> and Redford White.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 2000s and onward, the reverse trend has been to adapt well-known movies, mostly based on komiks and fantasy stories, for TV. Works by Carlo J. Caparas, Mars Ravelo, Pablo Gomez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5294\">Jim Fernandez</a> proved to be very bankable telenovelas, which previously had been popular film adaptations based on their material.

The first season included <b><i>Palimos ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Begging for Love), 2007; <b><i>Hiram na Mukha</i></b> (Borrowed Face), 2007; <b><i>May Minamahal</i></b> (<b><i>Loving Someone</i></b>), 2007; and <b><i>Natutulog Ba ang Diyos?</i></b> (Is God Sleeping?), 2007. The second season focused on reviving the films of Susan Roces, including <b><i>Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara</i></b> (Kill Barbara with Fright), 2008; <b><i>Maligno</i></b> (Evil Spirit), 2008; and <b><i>Florinda</i></b>, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television also finds a good source of talents from other fields or aspects of film production, like scriptwriters, directors, designers, and other production personnel. Among these are Jose Javier Reyes, Angel Cruz, Argel Joseph, and Gene Palomo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the one hand, television has become an extension of the film industry, giving exposure to its film products. Film and television share the same audience. The film audience is also the TV audience. For this reason, film producers have come to invade television not only to promote their films with trailer commercials and TV guestings but also to compete with other TV shows by way of one-hour drama anthologies, sitcoms (situation comedies), and other &ldquo;specials.&rdquo; Besides making profits from TV advertisements, film producers who are also producers of TV shows benefit in other ways. When Regal Films was producing TV shows, for instance, it saved 17,000 to 19,000 pesos per 30-second trailer ad, which it would otherwise have to pay in cold cash if it did not have its own TV show on prime time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television also serves as media outlet for the industry&rsquo;s old films and retrospectives, especially during occasions where film tributes are made to industry achievers or outstanding film personalities, like Gerardo de Leon, Lamberto V. Avellana, and Lino Brocka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The TV industry supports the film industry by giving employment to film stars and film workers who are idle between picture assignments. Working on regular TV shows affords a regular and stable income, compared to the highly unpredictable situation in the film industry. In the 1980s, big stars Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos gave more of their time and energies to their weekly TV shows&mdash;<b><i>Superstar</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Vilma</i></b>,<i> </i>respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"foreign\" name=\"foreign\"></a>Foreign Films</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The influence of foreign films on local cinema has been perennial and strong, because the American colonial presence facilitated the entrance of Hollywood movies into the Philippines. As early as the silent-pictures era, the American influence was already seen in Philippine comedians. Hollywood&rsquo;s Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, and Oliver Hardy had their Filipino counterparts in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\">Canuplin</a>, Jose Cris Soto, and Bayani Casimiro. Later, Buster Keaton and the Three Stooges would also become models for other local comedians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When talking pictures came to the Philippines, one of the biggest influences on local cinema was the Hollywood musical. Films like <b><i>The Great Ziegfeld</i></b>, 1936, <b><i>Show Boat</i></b>, 1927, and <b><i>Rose Marie</i></b>, 1936,<b> </b>inspired such Filipino movies as <b><i><strong>Nasaan Ka Irog?</strong> </i></b>(Where Are You, Beloved?), 1937; <b><i><strong> <strong>Bahay Kubo</strong> </strong> </i></b>(Nipa Hut), 1938; and <b><i>Paroparong Bukid</i> </b>(Country Butterfly), 1938. If Hollywood had its Jeanette MacDonald and Deanna Durbin, Filipinos had their own Fely Vallejo and Elsa Oria, the &ldquo;singing sweetheart of the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the genre of swashbuckling adventure, the principal hero was Douglas Fairbanks Jr as well as Errol Flynn. Those who went to Filipino movies like <b><i>Prinsipe Paris </i></b>(Prince Paris), 1949, <b><i>Apat na Alas</i> </b>(Four Aces), 1950,<b><i> Carlos Trece</i></b> (Charles XIII), 1953, learned swordplay from local stars like EfrenReyes, Manuel Conde, and Johnny Monteiro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The war movie&rsquo;s most popular hero was Audie Murphy in <b><i>To Hell and Back</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>1955, Fernando Poe Sr in <b><i>Dugo</i> <i>ng Bayan </i></b>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946, and Leopoldo Salcedo in <b><i><strong>Fort Santiago</strong> </i></b>, 1946, epitomized the Filipino soldier&rsquo;s courage and valor on the battlefield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Johnny Weismuller as Tarzan in the film series based on the novel <b><i>Tarzan of the Apes </i></b>(1914) was represented in Filipino movies at various times as <b><i>Kulafu</i></b>, 1947, <b><i><strong>Hagibis</strong> </i></b>, 1947, and <b><i>Og</i></b>, 1952. Mr Philippines titleholder Jesus Ramos appeared in the latter film, as well as in its sequels, <b><i>Si Og sa Maynila </i></b>(Og in Manila), 1952, and <b><i>Si Og sa Army </i></b>(Og in the Army), 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, the most popular Hollywood young stars were James Dean and Elvis Presley. Filipino movie fans promptly established their own fan clubs for Lou Salvador Jr and EddieMesa as the &ldquo;James Dean of the Philippines&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elvis Presley of the Philippines,&rdquo; respectively. Local stars imitated the looks, the swagger, attire, manner of acting and singing, and even the length of the sideburns of foreign idols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hollywood movies influence audience tastes as well as the kind of stories to be made. The early 1960s produced the teeny-bopper flicks and the James Bond movies. This was the era of the young love teams in the musicals of Nora Aunor, Tirso Cruz III, Vilma Santos, Edgar Mortiz, Eddie Peregrina, and Esperanza Fabon. Movies like <b><i>Young Love</i></b>, 1970, <b><i>My Pledge of Love</i></b>, 1970, <b><i>Haydee</i></b>, 1970, <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971, and <b><i>The Sensations</i></b>, 1971 explored their respective narratives&mdash;mostly focused on the flowering of young love&mdash;with musical performances. More mature audiences enjoyed the spy and detective plots of Tony Ferrer movies like <b><i>Sabotage</i></b>, 1966. Moviegoers also flocked to spoofs like <b><i>James Ban-Dong</i></b>, 1964,<b><i> </i></b>for the Ian Fleming spy James Bond, and <b><i>Dr. Yes</i></b>, 1965,<b> </b>instead of <b><i>Dr. No</i></b>, 1962. Western movies were also lampooned in local films&mdash;for example, <b><i>Barilan sa Baboy-Kural </i></b>(Gunfight at the Pig Corral), 1962, was a spoof of <b><i>Gunfight at the O.K. Corral</i></b>, 1957,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Mekeni&rsquo;s Gold</i></b>, 1969, made reference to the foreign movie <b><i>Mackenna&rsquo;s Gold</i></b>, 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s saw the rise and development of directors, scriptwriters, designers, and performers, many of whom studied film abroad or in local universities. They were familiar with Italian neorealism (Rosselini, de Sica), the Swedish art film (Bergman), the French Nouvelle Vague<i> </i>(Truffaut, Godard, Resnais), the Italian auteurs (Antonioni, Fellini, Rossi, Bertolucci), the Indian art film (Ray), and the Japanese art film (Kurosawa). It was the age of the decline of the Hollywood studio system, and the traditional genres were being replaced by more complex characterizations, anti-linear narratives, and antiheroes. The other foreign directors who influenced Filipino directors at this time were Brian de Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, and Robert Altman. They generally affected the style of Filipino New Wave directors of the 1970s and 1980s like Mike de Leon, Ishmael Bernal, Lino Brocka, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>, Marilou Diaz-Abaya, Peque Gallaga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad.

The dominant images need to be examined for their truth and relevance to the realities of an impoverished society seeking to liberate itself from social, economic, and political constraints that hold back its progress. Knowing the sources of the images and the various angles of vision that fashioned them is to begin to understand how the negative images could be counteracted and the positive ones nourished. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\"><strong>Marra PL.

As a narrative form, the alamat allows a writer to make use of exaggeration or even fantasy, in dealing with a serious subject. Thus, directors/scriptwriters wanting to suggest to moviegoers a particular way of looking at the narrative choose to frame characters and incidents within a legend. In <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1284\">Sawa sa Lumang Simboryo</a> </i></b>(Python in the Old Dome), 1952, director Gerardo de Leon modulated the implausibilities in Amado Yaso&#xF1;a&#x2019;s komiks story by making the film narrative appear to be a tale contained in the ballad sung on the soundtrack. <a href=\"/4/26/4580\">Consuelo P.

In these films, a grasp of the authentic early culture of the inhabitants was tenuous at best, so the directors had to depend heavily on the resourcefulness of the scriptwriter and the production designer to simulate lifeways and customs supposedly of the remote past. Folklore and &#x201C;fakelore&#x201D; have been mixed with impunity in more recent films using folk materials. This is to be observed in the series of film biographies of real-life social outcasts and underworld characters with which RamonRevilla endeared himself to fans of action films. Revilla attributed to the characters he played superhuman powers allegedly acquired through the agency of an <i>agimat </i>(charm) or <i>anting-anting </i>(amulet). <b><i>Hulihin si Tiagong Akyat </i></b>(Capture Tiagong Akyat), 1973, was the first in the series that has become &#x201C;folkloric&#x201D; through sheer gimmickry."

However, this same readership and potential movie audience would often demand faithful cinematic translation. They would turn away from the movie if it was too &#x201C;different&#x201D; from what was expected. There is little room for innovative scripting and direction since the movie must please its captive audience. On the other hand, compressing a long komiks storyline into a two-hour movie tends to magnify apparent violations of the rules of logic that are not immediately discernible in the original story. While the constraints of writing a serial that runs for weeks and months on end inevitably lead to inconsistencies that are ignored by the komiks reader, the corresponding movie should rise above its print version if it must reach the level of art."

Komiks and film may be strange bedfellows but a harmonious collaboration between the komiks writer and the filmmakers may initiate a creative participatory process among readers and viewers so that they can become more appealing and less appalling."
