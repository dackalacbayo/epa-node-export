Some of the most commonly used <b>art materials</b> are clay, wood, metal, stone, fiber and dyes, paint (including oil and watercolor), ink, pencil, paper, glass, plastics, and film. These materials may be used by themselves or in combination with each other. If combined, two or more materials may be worked on simultaneously or may be used one after another. The processes for working on these media depend largely on the material/materials to be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"clay\" name=\"clay\"></a>Clay</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Clay earthware</b> excavations in sites such as the Manunggul, Maitum, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>nay dating back to the third and second millennium BC are evidences of early indigenous technology in handling wet clay&mdash;by stamping, incising, drying, and firing. These types of earthware, formed when surface shales and clay are fired at temperature between 1840&deg;F and 2030&deg;F, compose most of the products by small-scale pottery manufacturers in the country today. They include all shapes and sizes of jars, cooking stoves and pots, serving plates and trays. Today, flower pots, tiles, toy fruits, and cooking utensils are also made.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary artists using clay as a medium include BaidyMendoza, Charito Bitanga, LazaroSoriano aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3778\"><strong>Aro Soriano</strong></a>, JulieLluch, and CharlieCo. They make figurative sculpture from baked red clay called <b>terra-cotta</b>, which is first shaped by <b>modeling</b>&mdash;meaning, shaping a solid mass of clay&mdash;or by <b>coiling</b>, a process of building up the walls of a hollow form. Most artists either leave these pieces unglazed or paint on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Stoneware</b>, made from fine clay fired at higher temperature from 2130&deg;F to 2300&deg;F, are often utilized for decorative pieces and foodware. The clay turns tan or gray and its particles are freed when fired, resulting in smooth surfaces impervious to water, unlike terra-cotta which remains porous. Stoneware is usually glazed&mdash;meaning, covered with a vitreous solution that modifies and gives a semitransparent, smooth, and impervious finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stoneware have been created by studio potters like Leonardo Villaroman, NelfaQuerubin, Manuel Ramirez, Jaime and Anne deGuzman, Kay de Lange, UguBigyan, and LanelleAbueva-Fernando.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Porcelain ware</b>, made from a mixture of kaolin and feldspar, are fired at very high temperature.

Representatives of gods called <b>bulol </b>are carved by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, Kankanaey, Kalinga, and Ibaloy of northern Luzon. The best bulol are made from narra, chosen for its sturdiness and unfading sap. After the tree is cut and the figure carved, ceremonies are held where the bulol is bathed in the blood of sacrificial animals, thus its dark color. In the Cordilleras, food bowls, jar covers, gong handles, doors, coffins, spoons, and forks are also carved from wood with distinct symbolic and decorative features.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Mindanao and Sulu, the<i> </i><b>sunduk </b>(grave markers), <b>panolong</b><i> </i>(house beams), and other house panels, and boat-shaped coffins are the major pieces of wood sculpture that are colored with natural dyes and lately with paint. Horse saddles, chess sets, Qur&rsquo;an stands, covers of tobacco containers, chests, looking glasses, and backstrap-loom supports are also carved from wood. At times these are decorated with shell inlay and hair tufts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tagbanwa of Palawan sculpt birds, lizards, turtles,<b> </b>wild pigs, and boat forms from softwoods, which, after carving, are repeatedly exposed to the soot of burning almaciga or copal resin. The black of the soot is made permanent by repeated application of camote leaves. The figures are then incised with dots, curves, scrolls, leaves, and other geometric motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spanish colonial <b>santos</b> were usually made of hardwoods like molave, <i>kamagong</i>, and <i>balaon</i>; medium like narra, tanguile, and apitong; and softwoods like batikuling, dap-dap, lanete, and <i>lawaan</i>. For the wood-carvers of Paete, Laguna, the best wood for santos is batikuling because it is tough and repels termites; however, other woods, such as narra, kamagong, jackfruit, and marang, are also used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the wood-carving tools in Paete come from the shop of Mariano Cajipe who fashions them on a native forge. The traditional wood-carving tools are the <b>paet</b><i> </i>(chisel), the <b>hiwas </b>(skew), the <b>landay </b>(shallow gouge), the <b>lukob</b><i> </i>(deep gouge), and the <b>trespico </b>or <b>tatlong kanto </b>(parting tool). Native handmade tools are harder and more durable than those imported because they undergo a more thorough tempering process in which the steel, several times fired and hammered into shape, is entirely dipped in oil and water up to the fine and sharp blade-ends. Unused railroad tires and old saws are converted to make these tools, the sizes of which range from the very fine, used for delicate work such as carving eyes, to the very large for working on broad surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process called <b>encarnacion</b><i> </i>(from Spanish<i> carne</i>, &ldquo;flesh&rdquo;), which refers to the rendering of flesh tones by a specialist known as the <b>encarnador</b>,<b> </b>was derived from the Spanish tradition of religious art practiced since the European medieval ages. The<b> </b>polychromed santo was called <b>encarnado</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the figure is carved, it is worked by the encarnador who has mastered the technique of coloring the clothes and, especially, the face, hands, and body parts of the wooden image. In the 19th century, the carved figure was twice coated with a native gesso<b> </b>made of a mixture of fine white clay or <i>kesong puti</i> (native white cheese) and glue made from boiled carabao hide. This process created a solid and nonporous surface for the paint, which was then applied over it. The <b>estofado </b>technique was used for ornamentation. Here the gesso surface was gilded, then painted over. The gilt undercoat lent a warm luminous tone, and decorative motifs were executed by lightly scratching the paint with a fine instrument following the design, in the process exposing the gold underneath. In the 19th century, Filipino sculptors also worked on ivory and perfected a technique of painting on the material in such a way that the color was rendered permanent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In many parts of the country, the wood-carver&rsquo;s art finds expression in different forms. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>Furniture</strong></a> in Betis, Pampanga, feature floral and curling vine designs in openwork with finely turned miniature balusters. Pakil, Laguna, is known for its filigree sculpture of toothpick trees and fantasy birds and fans. In Quezon Province, fiesta ornaments called <b>pahiyas-tambag</b><i> </i>are made from the <i>kayetana</i> and <i>matang-araw</i> wood of the Sierra Madre for the feast of San Isidro, the patron saint. Paper, as a by-product of wood, has been the primary material for papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; tradition called<b> taka</b> in Paete and the creation of traditional <b>higantes </b>(giants) in Angono, Rizal. <i>Papel de hapon</i> (japanese paper) is used for the <b>pabalat</b> (wrapper) tradition of paper cutting in Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For modern sculpture, Philippine hardwoods are among the best in the world. Aside from their tested durability, they have warmth of tone and a natural coloration that ranges from dark brown to yellow and reddish hues, as well as a fine-grain texture. Woods evoke the forests from which they came from as well as the atmosphere of the human dwelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many sculptors have used the best Philippine wood. NapoleonAbueva did large figures in wood, abstract pieces, <b>retablos</b> for chapels, and imaginative wood furniture. Jeremias Elizalde Navarro aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J. Elizalde Navarro</strong></a> carved expressionistic masks and figures with a strong, primitive quality. With the dearth of wood for sculpture, some artists, like JerusalinoAraos and ReyPazContreras, turned to weathered wood from railroad tracks or the stairs and beams of demolished houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RobertoFeleo and the Hulo group of artists have used impregnated sawdust as material for relief sculpture. SantiagoBose and Jordan Mang-osan have devised a method of sculpting wood from fire produced by reflecting sun rays with a magnifying glass. Grasses and reeds may be used as sculpture materials, as seen in RobertoVillanueva&rsquo;s installation works.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Figurative sculptures, called <b>komis</b> in Bontoc, are made of tree fern. The Cordillera <b>bihang</b> is an idol fashioned from roots of giant fern. Other statues functioning as talismans are made from reeds, leaves, and tree barks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In harvest rites, called <b>ubaiya</b>, the Ifugao community installs arches across trails. Hangings of sugarcane piths and <b>dongla </b>leaves are tied at the center. Ancestral images constructed from <b>runo</b><i> </i>sticks and dongla leaves are repeatedly set along the various arches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> lime tubes, incised with designs and indigenous poetry, called <b>surat Mangyan</b> and <b>ambahan</b> respectively, are well-known crafts done by Hanunoo Mangyan and the Batak of Palawan. Bamboo is also used for arches and <b>kubol</b> (temporary sheds or balconies) for fiestas of patron saints. In Bulacan, these are called <b>singkaban</b>, for which either bamboo or carved banana trunks can be used. Bamboo was made into sculpture by FranciscoVerano in 1980. Recently, bamboo has also become a trend among installation artists who inscribe and even paint them into colorful sculpture, as done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a>. Some artists have used bamboo or forest vines, seed pods, and tree barks, as seen in the installations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a> and GenaraBanzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Basket making</b> all over the islands utilizes materials from plants. Strips of buri, rattan, pandan, and bamboo splits, as well as <i>ibus</i>, nipa palm, nito, <i>saha</i> (banana pulp), and buntal fibers are variously dried and cut as materials for hats, baskets, and thatching. A particular hat-making tradition in Abra called<i> </i><b>tabungaw</b><i> </i>involves the use of gourds together with rattan and bamboo weave. Other food crops and plants that can be transformed into artworks are the <b>kiping</b><i> </i>rice wafer of Lucban, Quezon, used for the tradition of the<i> </i><b>pahiyas</b> (decoration); coconut leaves for the <b>pusu</b><i> </i>(woven containers of cooked rice) in the Visayas; and lime fruits, such as <i>dayap</i>, for the fruit carvers of Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"metal\" name=\"metal\"></a>Metal</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Metal has been used as a sculptural medium from early times to the present. For small bronze or brass pieces, the <b>cire perdue</b><i> </i>or &ldquo;<b>lost wax</b>&rdquo; method is commonly followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the lost wax process, a set of materials is used for making the brass mold and another set for the two incasement layers. To make the wax mold, paraffin is mixed with almaciga and beeswax in equal proportions. The waxy mass is flattened with a rolling pin to the desired thickness. The wax is then dipped in lukewarm water to make it pliable then pressed around a previously prepared wooden pattern of the desired size and shape. The wax is cut in half, removed from the wooden pattern, and joined together to form the new mold, which is made to harden while small spaghetti strips of wax are used to form <b>okir </b>designs on the surface. When the wax mold with its designs is completed, a mixture of equal parts of fine bamboo, charcoal, and muddy soil is patted to half-inch thickness inside and outside the mold for the first incasement. This is followed by a second layer consisting of three parts sandy soil and one part muddy soil, which is also placed inside and outside the mold. The whole is sun-dried for three days and fired in an open pit, after which the melted wax is poured out and molten brass poured in its place. For finishing touches, engraving, as well as copper or silver inlay, embellishes the vessel. Basically the same process, though in simpler form, is followed by the Tboli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tboli use this process for their figurines and jewelry, which are made of metal alloys of bronze, brass, and copper. The Maranao also use the same process for their brass vessels. Mindanao betel-nut boxes are generally made from copper inlaid with silver. Brass is recycled from old cannons, church bells, and machine-gun bullets. In Pampanga, the tradition of <b>pukpuk</b> involves the hammering of metal into intricate designs for church decoration. For modern sculptures, the traditional method in bronze sculpture is <b>sand casting</b>, which involves making a mould of special sand from the original model in plaster of paris, inserting a core, and pouring in the molten bronze. This was the method used by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>, GuillermoTolentino, and Peter de Guzman in their bronze works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from traditional casting, the figure may be built from bronze shavings, then pulverized and passed through a sieve until it has the fineness of talcum powder. This is then combined in exact proportions with chemicals possessing binding properties. The bronze substance is poured into a mould where it subsequently hardens. This process, introduced by AnastacioCaedo and his son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>, wherein firing in a kiln is not required, entails high fuel consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary sculptors have made use of metal in different ways. Unlike other media, metals have the properties of ductility (meaning, they can be drawn out into wires) and malleability (meaning, they can be shaped by hammering), or they can be melted, cast, molded, or pressed into predetermined shapes. In contemporary sculpture, metals&mdash;such as bronze, steel, iron, and aluminum&mdash;have been welded, cast, molded, polished, or patinated, producing durable and permanent works. EduardoCastrillo uses cut and welded metal sheets to create dynamic figures in the abstract or figurative mode; SolomonSaprid creates, out of welded pieces, craggy and expressive figures; VirginiaTy-Navarro uses the &ldquo;<b>pointillist</b>&rdquo; technique of dropping tiny blobs of molten metal on a frame; ConradoMercado does open-cage construction with steel rods; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3683\"><strong>Leeroy New</strong></a> uses coiled flexible conduits in the shaping of his installation works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"stone\" name=\"stone\"></a>Stone</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the most ancient sculptures found in the Philippines were made of stone. Statues called <b>likha</b>, blocks of human figures with lightly incised features, have been found in Calatagan, Batangas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, adobe and other stones were carved to create santos, niches, and decorative reliefs for the facade and exterior walls and portals of churches, as well as the statues and reliefs on the <i>capillas posas </i>or wayside altars. Tombstones were usually made of marble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stone is also used as a sculptural medium by modern artists. IldefonsoMarcelo sculpts human forms in various attitudes in adobe. Abueva has done adobe, marble, and alabaster sculpture. More recently, Peter de Guzman and AgnesArellano have devised their own marble-cast techniques from waste marble powder. Mount Pinatubo ash is also now widely used as synthetic stone sculpture by many sculptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"fiber\" name=\"fiber\"></a>Fiber and Dyes</span></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Weaving</b> refers to the orderly, rhythmic interlacing of warp, which has been done since the second millennium BC. Abaca, a wild plant of the banana family, is the most widely used weaving material in the country. Also called <b>waka</b> in Maranao, <b>baka</b> in Subanon, and <b>wogo</b><i> </i>in Tiruray, the fiber first undergoes a process of stripping. Locally grown cotton is also found among the Maranao, Yakan, and Maguindanaon. Bark is also pounded by the Kalinga to produce red cloth. Sago palm is a source of coarse sack cloth, while the thinnest strip of coconut leaves are used for soft <b>katsa</b> (cheesecloth). <b>Pi&ntilde;a</b> fiber from the pineapple plant is best known for the delicate textile used in making embroidered <b>barong</b>,<i> </i><b>terno</b>, and <b>kimona</b><i> </i>of the lowland Christian tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Processing fiber requires beating the raw material to soften and separate strands, after which the fiber is spun. <b>Ikat</b> necessitates the process of tie-dyeing thread prior to weaving. Weaving by back-tension or backstrap loom is done in most parts of the country. Although from a later tradition, the floor loom is popular in Ilocos, Tagalog, Bicol, and Panay provinces. Weaving in its various traditions is a subject of scholarship, preservation, and revitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contemporary art, textile and clothing have been transformed into three-dimensional works in the installations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3725\"><strong>Alma Quinto</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3490\"><strong>Marina Cruz</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"natural\" name=\"natural\"></a>Natural Dyes and Pigments</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The country has a rich tradition of extracting and using natural dyes. The most common of these dyes is indigo. Among Mindanao highlanders, <b>sikarig</b> is a vegetable dye that gives deep red colors, while yellow and orange are sourced from a species of ginger and turmeric. In Luzon, red tints are extracted from the bark of the narra tree. The <b>katuray </b>plant is a source of strong brown pigment. A good red color can also be extracted from macopa. The wood of the <b>sapang</b>, a low thorny bush with yellow flowers, produces a common red color when boiled. The talisay tree is a source for black and brown dyes. Achuete, traditionally used for food coloring, is well known for its reddish orange color. Folk painters and weavers use a variety of these colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Resist dyeing</b> is based on controlling fiber colors by binding, knotting, stitching, or treating parts with wax, which repels the dye. When the resist is done on a prepared textile, it is called <b>batik</b>. Dye-resist has also been used in <b>printmaking</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Appliqu&eacute;</b> is a method of decoration that uses patches of varying motifs and color.

Almost all surfaces can be used as painting ground provided they are able to absorb pigments. The painting surface is primarily canvas, cotton, or linen cloth stretched on a frame and primed with a white or lightly tinted base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Painting has been done on a wide variety of surfaces with the use of brushes, spatulas, sticks, and even fingers. National Artist CesarLegaspi is well known for using the palette knife. Rafael Pacheco is known for <b>finger painting</b>. Most contemporary Filipino artists, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>, paint in the <b>direct method</b> wherein paint is applied directly onto the surface with a brush. A few use the indirect or <b>traditional method</b>, wherein they apply the paint in thin layers of transparent color. Another technique in the indirect method is <b>scumbling</b>, wherein an opaque layer of oil paint is worked over another layer so that small areas of the color beneath show through in an uneven, broken manner. New pigments have been produced, such as acrylic or acrylic vinyl polymer emulsion paint, which can also be used on canvas. Water soluble and quick drying, acrylic can be applied in thin, transparent washes or in thick <b>impasto</b> or pile-up texture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paper for painting is also commercially available. It comes in different thicknesses, weights, textures, and tones&mdash;qualities that artists take into consideration in their particular kind of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For watercolor, the paper is first soaked and stretched to prevent wrinkling during the painting process. The water-based pigments are applied to the paper as layers of transparent color stains. The <b>wet-on-wet techniques</b> create atmospheric effects in landscape in which the white ground of the paper is made to show through to provide the highlights. The <b>dry-brush technique</b> is used to bring out fine details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Gouache</b> is opaque watercolor or poster paint in which the pigments are mixed with zinc white to create a more solid effect. Outstanding among watercolor artists are RomeoTabuena, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\"><strong>Florencio Concepcion</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3699\"><strong>Leon Pacunayen</strong></a>, and Araceli Dans; among gouache artists, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A <b>fresco</b> is a mural or large-scale painting done directly on a wall. To ensure durability, the wall must first be prepared by a coat of damp plaster. In true fresco painting, the artist works while the plaster is damp, using water-based pigments that are absorbed by the wall itself. Frescoes were done for Spanish-period churches by painters like CesareAlberoni and GiovanniDibella.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Commercially available rice paper is commonly used for Chinese watercolor and calligraphy. Watercolor paper, printing paper, and other specialty papers that are imported from Europe, the United States, and Japan are widely used. Since the 1980s there has been a trend in using handmade papers made by artists&rsquo; communities from plants in their surroundings. VirgilioAviado, who first experimented in handmade paper under the tutelage of ManuelRodriguezSr, pioneered in the making of paper prototypes prior to the dissemination of the technology by the Design Center of the Philippines in the 1970s. Handmade paper has a distinctive organic quality that comes from its slightly uneven and fibrous texture. Its irregular edge contributes to its personal and nonmechanical significations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Katsa is a common substitute for canvas, especially for large murals for political rallies and other public gatherings, as it can be rolled up in an emergency. Katsa is also the surface used for painting with dyes in a dye-resist technique similar to handmade batik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paintings are also done on wooden surfaces. Plywood&mdash;especially marine plywood, which does not warp&mdash;is commonly used. <b>Tempera</b> <b>painting</b>, the most common technique of easel painting in Europe until the late 15th century, was traditionally done on wooden panels. The panel was first coated with gesso, which is generally any white substance, such as plaster of paris, mixed with size or glue to provide a smooth and matte ground. Painting then proceeds with the use of <b>tempera</b>, which consists of pigments ground with egg yolk, producing a great intensity of hue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Religious icons are also done on wooden panels. <b>Gold leaf</b> may be used for the embellishment of the saintly figures as well as for the background, the gold suggesting heavenly glory. As early religious paintings in the Philippines were done on flat wood panels, they are also referred to as <b>icons</b>. Bohol has yielded a wealth of icons on wood depicting the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, the Virgin Mary, and scenes from Christ&rsquo;s life and passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"printmaking\" name=\"printmaking\"></a>Printmaking</span></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Printmaking</b> is the art of creating an original design on a hard surface such as wood or metal, and then transferring its image onto a pliant surface like paper or cloth. Printmaking has many types: <b>relief</b>, wherein the imprint comes from the surface of the block through its principal methods of woodcut and engraving; <b>intaglio</b>, which refers to the printing method where the printed image comes from the inks deposited in the grooves and lines beneath the surface of the plate; <b>planography</b>, including <b>lithography</b> or printing from a perfectly flat limestone slab, and <b>serigraphy</b> or the screen process that produces stenciled designs by pressing silkscreen paint through the open sections of a masked-out design with a squeegee through the mesh and onto paper or cloth; and <b>xylography</b> or the Chinese art of making prints from the natural wood grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of printing technology and computer imaging programs has resulted in digital printing of artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"glass\" name=\"glass\"></a>Glass</span></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another two-dimensional medium is glass or stained glass. The latter consists of designs made from pieces of colored glass figures held together by strips of lead, which themselves constitute an independent design. Stained glass is primarily associated with the Gothic cathedral of the 12th and 13th centuries, which had rose windows and walls of stained glass narrating religious episodes. In 1956, GaloB.Ocampo, after studies in the liturgical arts in Rome, finished 73 stained glass windows for the Manila Metropolitan Cathedral. Other practitioners of the art of stained glass were CenonRivera and AbdulmariImao. Glass as a sculptural medium has been developed by RamonOrlina who fashions it into sculptural form, freestanding or integrated into architectural design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"mixed\" name=\"mixed\"></a>Mixed Media</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the 1980s, distinctions between the media of painting, photography, sculpture, and printmaking have been blurred because techniques and processes have blended with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paintings on tiles or dishes by <b>glazing</b> has also been done by JoseJoya and ManuelBaldemor in collaboration with commercial ceramic manufacturers. The de Guzmans have also done tile paintings fired in their own pottery studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Mosaic</b>, another two-dimensional art, goes back to early Christian and Byzantine churches and catacombs. Its technique is simple but painstaking: small units called <b>tesserae</b>, originally chips from slabs of colored stone, marble, or glass, are embedded on a wall or a floor prepared with wet cement in such a way that their tiny facets reflect the light. Mosaics are now made from a large variety of materials such as bits of colored paper or foil, postage stamps, shells, butterfly wings, and egg shells. Elizabeth Chan and Clarissa Perez are mosaicists. An example of Perez&rsquo;s mosaic is the baptistry at the Mary the Queen Church in San Juan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Collage</b> is also a form of two-dimensional expression. This was first done by the cubists Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso by pasting printed texts on the painting surface. Later, they collaged rope and sections of oilcloth to incorporate actual textures as well as to initiate a play between the simulated and the real. Artists have done collages with bus tickets and bottle caps, maps, and clippings. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\"><strong>Lee Aguinaldo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3553\"><strong>Marciano Galang</strong></a>, Fred Liongoren, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3609\"><strong>Prudencio Lamarroza</strong></a> were among the first to use collage in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, Larry Tronco, RodolfoGan, and BenMaramag used a spray gun for softly modulated, ethereal effects. For texture, some incorporate passages of <b>frottage </b>done by rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper placed on a textured surface, such as a floor board or cement wall, to capture its particular character. Another technique, <b>decalcomania</b>, is done by applying pigment on two sheets of material such as paper, pressing them together to obtain random shapes, then drawing out their figurative potentials by enhancing them and creating recognizable forms. The same effect can be obtained by pressing sponge or crumpled cloth on the printed surface. Many prefer to work in mixed media, possibly combining oil, acrylic, and pastel with printmaking techniques and collage in one work. This flexibility often leads to a blurring of distinctions between printing as a two-dimensional expression and sculpture as a three-dimensional expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists associated with business and industry use materials such as grassy chromium, aluminum, plastics, and electric light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>European constructivists</b> were the first to use plastics in art. Among the materials they use were plexiglass, celluloid, nylon, and lucite with threadlike stainless-steel springs to create forms in which space seems to flow through the transparent materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\"><strong>Assemblage</strong></a></b> refers to the gluing of materials and actual objects together. Discarded junk, such as rubber tires, dolls, toys, metal cogs, as well as &ldquo;<b>found objects</b>,&rdquo; like driftwood, shells, tough forest vines, stones, and detritus from the sea, have been brought into an art context. Their shapes, textures, emotional and literary associations enter into the meaning of the work. Navarro andHechanova were among those who first used this method in contemporary sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Kineticism</b>, as exemplified by DavidMedalla&rsquo;s work, introduced the element of movement, and <b>luminism</b> the element of electric light. Many artists have also done sets for theaters, furthering the transformation and enrichment of their media. Computer technology has also landed as a visual art machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, there are painted sculptures, sculptural paintings, mobiles, photograms, painted photographs, installations with projected images, shadow projections, computer-generated graphics, video, xerography, and ready-mades. There are also media that seek to make a mark or modify the environment, such as <b>earthworks</b> on site or <b>site-specific</b> <b>works</b>. <b>Performance art</b> borrows elements from theater, kineticism, luminism, sculpture, and painting. ImpyPilapil, GabrielBarredo, and Cesare and JeanMarieSyjuco are among those who have done luminal and motion sculptures. The human body has become a primary medium of conveying meaning through performance as exemplified in Judy Sibayan&rsquo;s project of using herself as a curatorial platform in exhibiting art. Sound has also been incorporated in sculptural works such as by Medalla, Chabet, Arellano, Syjuco, and in particular, in Lirio Salvador&rsquo;s <b><i>Sandata</i></b> assemblage works, which also function as a musical instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The repertory of media available to today&rsquo;s artist is rich and varied, and possibilities of experimenting with them are endless. While traditional Western media are highly dependent on imported materials&mdash;such as oil on canvas, acrylic on canvas, watercolor on strathmore, and etchings on arches&mdash;which have remained the dominant, bankable media in the art market, many of the more creative artists have braved the challenge of unearthing forgotten indigenous recipes, combining these with recycled and alternative local technology. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong> and Alice G.

It may be conducted formally in school at different grade levels, or informally through workshops and apprenticeship.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The latter is the case among many Philippine ethnolinguistic groups. Traditions in art forms such as <b>weaving</b>, <b>pottery</b>, <b>basketry</b>, <b>carving</b>, <b>jewelry making</b>, and <b>metalwork</b> are passed on within a family or community. A young girl from the Cordilleras, for instance, learns how to spin, dye, and weave from her own mother or grandmother. In doing so, some places have become associated with particular products: Ilocos is known for its <b>burnay</b> and <b>abel</b> (blanket); Paete, Laguna, for wood carving; and Basey, Samar, for its colorful mats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Conversely, artistic customs may disappear due to dearth and death of practitioners within a community. To address this, the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or National Living Treasure Award program was legislated in 1992 to give state recognition and support to traditional folk artists who exhibit technical and artistic excellence. Awardees are tasked to pass on their artistic traditions to their peoples in order to promote and preserve cultural heritage through the establishment of the School of Living Traditions in their communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The apprenticeship system likewise characterized art education during the 16th-18th centuries. Spanish missionary-artists opened workshops in their <i>conventos</i> (parish houses) in Intramuros and were sent to mission territories to instruct <i>indios</i> (Christianized native) and the Chinese on how to paint and sculpt religious images in the Western manner. Prints, especially from Flanders and Northern Europe, served as models for painting and sculpture and facilitated acquaintance with the European iconographic tradition. These religious images were made to adorn churches and to illustrate the teachings of Christianity, the major patron of the arts. By the same token, the <b>typographic press</b>&mdash;introduced by the friars by the early 17th century&mdash;produced devotional books, catechisms, dictionaries, <b>estampas</b> (large holy pictures), <b>estampitas</b> (small holy pictures), grammars, maps, and sermon collections. Like in painting and sculpture, knowledge in engraving and printing was transmitted to an apprentice or disciple who worked closely with a master to learn about the medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A more formal training in the visual arts emerged in the 19th century when the Academia de Dibujo, the first Manila art academy, was established in 1823 by the Real Sociedad Economica de Amigos del Pais. Its teacher and director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a> opened it to everybody, whether Spaniard, mestizo, or indio. Hitherto, many Filipino painters were either self-taught or learned informally from clerics. Domingo and the Real Sociedad also published <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2175\"><strong>Elementos de Perspectiva</strong></a></strong> </i></b> (Elements of Perspective) in 1828, positively indicating its academic orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first art academy, however, closed in 1834 due to lack of funds. Revived in 1850, its successor was patterned after the Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid where its directors had studied. Among the courses offered were modeling, figure drawing, drawing from life, and drawing from masterpieces. This learning-by-imitation model called for a museum to enable students to copy sculptures and paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initially a school for drawing and painting, the <i>academia</i> later added courses in engraving, lithography (1889), and sculpture (1893). Regardless of the course, learning was measured by a progressive mastery of simple to complex tasks. Drawing, believed to be the foundation of painting, was taught first. In anatomy classes, a student proceeded from drawing casts to painting live models. Incentives included awards, exhibits, as well as art scholarships to the Spanish peninsula. Among the notable products of the academy were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\"><strong>Lorenzo Rocha</strong></a>, who later assumed co-directorship of the school after completing its first art scholarship to Spain, as well as Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The academia dissolved in 1898 with the change in colonial government from Spain to the United States. No formal art academy operated until the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts (UP SFA) opened in 1909. During the interval, artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3454\"><strong>Teodoro Buenaventura</strong></a>, Fabian de la Rosa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3532\"><strong>Rafael Enriquez</strong></a> offered private lessons in their studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Partly due to the efforts of the Asociacion International de Artistas organized by Enriquez, an <i>escuella de bellas artes</i> (school of fine arts) was reestablished and was attached as a charter unit of the University of the Philippines (UP). Enriquez served as the SFA&rsquo;s first director. Majority of its founding faculty, like Buenaventura, Joaquin Herrera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\"><strong>Miguel Zaragoza</strong></a>, and de la Rosa, were instructors and/or graduates of the Academia de Dibujo. The UP SFA reproduced the European academic orientation of the latter, including the atelier and concours system. Instructions, such as life drawing classes, were given to groups of 20-35 students under a particular instructor. At the end of each semester, an exhibition was held and prizes were awarded. Five-year certificate courses in painting, sculpture, and engraving were offered; students were admitted via competitive examination.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the eminent early graduates were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a>, both of whom were soon invited as faculty and later assumed directorship of the school. Their lofty stature and influential romantic realist style closely identified the UP SFA with academism until the late 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contrast, the fine arts and architecture program of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) was associated with modernism. It opened in 1930 with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> as director. Notable modernists, including Carlos Francisco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\"><strong>Diosdado Lorenzo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, and Galo Ocampo, were invited by Edades to teach at UST. In 1938, Edades, Lorenzo, and Ocampo also established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3420\"><strong>Atelier of Modern Art</strong></a> in Manila. The distinction between the so-called conservative and modern art, which was applied by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> in its painting categories from 1949 to 1955, was likewise implemented in the Shell National Students Art Competitions from 1953 to 1961. Most UP students won the prizes in conservative art while UST students garnered majority of awards in the modern category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the second half of the 20th century, other fine arts programs and organizations began to be established. In 1950, the Fine Arts Department of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) was organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3626\"><strong>Araceli Limcaco-Dans</strong></a> who later also co-founded with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a> the Philippine Art Education Association in 1968. The University of the East School of Music and Arts was established in 1964 with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3821\"><strong>Pablo Victoria</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\"><strong>Florencio Concepcion</strong></a> among its early directors. Far Eastern University opened its Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts in 1970 with Galo Ocampo as head of the Department of Fine Arts. Outside Manila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\"><strong>Martino Abellana</strong></a> was the prominent faculty in UP Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fine arts curriculum also expanded in terms of course offerings and degree programs. A bachelor of fine arts major in advertising began to be offered by most of the aforementioned schools as well as by the College of Holy Spirit, the Far Eastern Air Transport Incorporated, and the Eulogio &ldquo;Amang&rdquo; Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology, among others. Moreover, courses, if not degrees, in animation, art management, photography, video production, interior and industrial design have since been introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although often discussed in terms of instruction in skill courses, art education further includes the teaching of history, appreciation, and criticism of art. As early as 1912, the UP SFA administered a course in theory and history of art for its fourth year students. Vicente Alvarez Dizon taught drawing and art appreciation at the National Teachers College and lectured on history of art at the UP SFA from 1929 to 1941 and 1940 to 1947, respectively. From 1953 to 1960, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\"><strong>Fernando Zobel</strong></a> lectured at Ateneo de Manila University (AdMU) in courses such as Introduction to Contemporary Painting, where he taught students how to look at painting as an artist might. In 1955, the UP College of Liberal Arts offered a course titled Humanities I, which included formal analysis of Western music and visual arts. By school year 1960-61, it became a required course for every UP student when it was incorporated into the general education program of the state university. Like Zobel, Humanities I treated art as a human(izing) experience rather than technical acquisition. Leopoldo Yabes, a proponent of the humanities program in UP, clarified that the humanities are intellectual disciplines, not vocational studies. Arts appreciation has since become a core course in the general education curriculum at the tertiary level.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art education was likewise integrated in the curriculum of many primary and secondary schools. An early exponent was Dizon, author of <b><i>Art Education and Appreciation</i></b>, 1934, who advocated its inclusion to awaken an aesthetic sense in the early life of the youth. In 1941, the Bureau of Public Schools issued a <b><i>Course of Study in Art Education for Elementary Schools</i></b>. This was reportedly the first mention of &ldquo;art education&rdquo; as a subject. Hitherto, during the early American colonial period, &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; was the focus and nomenclature used in the study of art, which started as early as 1915 with the publication of <b><i>Freehand Drawing for Primary Grades</i></b><i> </i>by the Department of Instruction. In 1963, Dans, who earlier developed the PWU Department of Fine Arts, also reorganized the art program of the Ateneo Grade School. Pablo Victoria wrote <b><i>Art in the Elementary School</i></b>, 1959, and <b><i>Art Activities in the Elementary School</i></b>, 1966. The Philippine High School for the Arts was established in 1977. Among the directors of this government-run school for artistically gifted students was another artist cum art educator Virginia Flor-Agbayani.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Workshops and internship programs facilitated by individual artists, art groups, institutions, and galleries are also venues for education in the arts. Manuel Rodriguez Sr conducted printmaking workshops during the 1960s, which was continued by Virgilio &ldquo;Pandy&rdquo; Aviado and younger members of the Printmakers Association of the Philippines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3724\"><strong>Nelfa Querubin</strong></a> in Iloilo, Tessy and John Pettyjohn in Laguna, the de Guzman family and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3446\"><strong>Ugu Bigyan</strong></a> in Laguna teach pottery in their respective studios. Institutions like the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP), the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, and the Lopez Museum provide on-the-job training to student volunteers in the various aspects of museum work. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

As distinguished from art history, art criticism is the evaluation of the artistic merits, historical significance, and cultural impact of artworks. It normally entails an ability to discern quality and skill in works, as defined by particular standards or canons of taste common to a time or place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a modern professional public practice, art criticism came to be increasingly allied in the 19th and 20th centuries with commodity market forces and their connection to the monitoring of changing trends in taste and fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The speeches of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> and Graciano Lopez Jaena at the banquet in honor of Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo provide one of the earliest examples of art criticism. According to Rizal, the gold and silver medals of Luna&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong> </i> </b>and Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2319\"><strong>Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho</strong></a></strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Christian Virgins Exposed to the Populace) at the 1884 Madrid Exposition demonstrated that genius can be found in all countries, thereby supporting the campaign for political equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American period, debate between conservative art and modern art stimulated critical writing about the nature of art.

This group included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5036\"><strong>Aurelio S. Alvero</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5059\"><strong>Francisco Arcellana</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3444\"><strong>Leonidas Benesa</strong></a>, Ricaredo Demetillo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3803\"><strong>Emmanuel Torres</strong></a>. Alvero, who used the pseudonym Magtanggol Asa, wrote the monograph of the <b><i>First Exhibition of Non-Objective Art in Tagala</i></b><i> </i>presented by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\"><strong>Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</strong></a> in 1953. Benesa and Torres, who were products of Ateneo and the Zobel lectures, as well as Arcellana and Demetillo, who were faculty members at the UP Department of English, were all winners in the AAP art criticism contest. Launched in 1954, the contest also lists critics <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5201\"><strong>Jolico Cuadra</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3734\"><strong>Cid Reyes</strong></a> as awardees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The growing trend in the 1960s toward abstraction gave rise to questions of national identity vis-&agrave;-vis internationalism. In 1972, some of these art reviews first published in periodicals were compiled by Alice Coseteng in <b><i>Philippine Modern Art and Its Critics</i></b>.<i> </i>Aside from Benesa and Torres, other critics and book authors active in the 1970s were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3702\"><strong>Rodolfo Paras-Perez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3740\"><strong>Alfredo Roces</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3837\"><strong>Paul Zafaralla</strong></a>.

A panel discussion on &ldquo;The Role of the Critic&rdquo; was organized by the Metropolitan Museum in 1990. An art criticism workshop facilitated by the UP Department of Art Studies was sponsored by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in 1998. Competition and workshops continue with institutional support. Since 2009, UST conducts the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J. Elizalde Navarro</strong></a> National Workshop in the Criticism on the Arts and Humanities.

Archaeological, ethnological, and fine arts collections are kept by the state as purveyors of the historical past and rich diversity of cultures in the Philippines. This is exemplified by the National Museum collection pertaining to ancient pottery, as well as the boat-making tradition, which elucidates the maritime culture of the Philippines in precolonial times. The textile designs and wood carvings preserved through conservation methods also help art scholars in cross-cultural research across the Asian region. The gold and pottery collections of the BSP are significant as they illustrate the ubiquity of these materials in precolonial times.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><em>Collections in museums abroad, such as the Smithsonian, Musee du quai Branly, University of Chicago, Lilly Library of the University of Indiana, and various museums and archives in Spain, hold important artworks, artifacts, and documents pertaining to Philippine art, including <b>bulol</b> sculptures, woven traditional textiles, jewelry and beads, and the <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b>.

		"text": "<p><strong>Section:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"#patronage\">Patronage</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"#art\">Art Market</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"#awards\">Awards</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"#law\">Law, Censorship, and Ethics</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The making of art does not involve only the crafting of an object, an experience, or an event. As a number of thinkers have pointed out, notably those who have sought to make sense of art in systemic terms, whether a thing can be considered art is not given nor self-evident; such a classification is not reducible to abiding by a particular set of artifactual, perceptual, stylistic, or expressive properties. Instead, the status of &ldquo;art&rdquo; is conferred upon a work as it circulates through an art world&mdash;that is, the network of interdependent social agents that contribute toward the construction of the conditions of possibility by which a work may be recognized as art at a certain conjunction of space and time. The contingency of any understanding of art deserves emphasis. However resonant the notions of eternal merit, timeless beauty, or unequivocal genius might be, appeals to these ultimately beg, rather than respond to and explain, the question of what constitutes art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From artists to museums, from critics to academies, from gallery-goers to auction houses, from collectors to government offices, all these agents continuously perform various acts of legitimization that help specify the cultural category of art, among them training artists, mounting exhibitions, organizing sales, publishing reviews, and bestowing awards. Such acts should not be understood as &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; or &ldquo;objective.&rdquo; After all, to select one object over another and validate that as art is to reveal a set of values that delimit what art is and could be. These values are not only aesthetic ones&mdash;they also reveal the gaps and fissures of art history with respect to gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and class, both political and ethical. This is not to suggest that the agents of the art world conspire with one another to produce a monolithic definition of art. Their efforts to advance different and competing interests may serve to reinforce and perpetuate the prevailing order or lead to transformative ruptures in that order.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A work is validated through aspects of the art world such as <b>patronage</b>, the <b>art market</b>, <b>awards</b>, <b>law</b>, <b>censorship</b>, and <b>ethics</b>. The web of connections in the art world and how it affects the shifting meanings of art in society can be understood when considered with the agency of artists, art managers, art collectors, cultural administrators, educators, art critics, art historians, art organizations, and art publics. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byJaime Oscar M. Salazar and Cecilia S. De La Paz</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"patronage\" name=\"patronage\"></a>Patronage</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art patronage refers to the commissioning, purchasing, or support of the arts by individuals or groups. It is rooted in the stratification of society and the emergence of dominant groups or classes, which have acquired economic surplus. It is also bound up with ownership of artworks by individuals, groups, or institutions. Traditional art patronage emerges only among groups of relatively higher social organization but over recent years, artists and cultural workers have increasingly sought to recapture the sense of public engagement that defined precolonial art as it was woven into the daily life of communities. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, the <i>kadangyan</i>, the elite group, sponsors the <i>ca&ntilde;ao</i>, a communal prestige feast. On occasion, this is marked by the carving of the <b>hagabi</b><i> </i>bench, a status symbol. Among the northern groups, the hagabi or ceremonial bench is commissioned by wealthy families as a symbol of economic dominance. The sultans and datus of Mindanao and Sulu gave a boost to wood carving in the ornamentation of their houses, such as the <b>torogan</b>, and in <b>okir</b><i>-</i>decorated objects of daily use, in brassware for rich dowries, and in the different kinds of woven <b>malong </b>(tubular skirts). Weaving was often the pastime of women who wove cloth, like the <b>tnalak</b>, for specific occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gold, even in pre-Hispanic times, was already a symbol of wealth. Wrought into earrings, necklaces, and other body ornaments as well as <b>anito</b> or representations of the deity, gold was used by skilled artisans in creating ornaments for the well-to-do. Gold and ceramics acquired through trade were buried with the affluent in the belief that doing so would extend the dominance of their class to the afterlife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Internal trade among the different ethnolinguistic groups was already well established prior to Spanish colonization. A traditional pattern of trade involved the mountain and coastal peoples, as in the trade between <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> and Ilocano. Early weaves from the Cordilleras used rough fibers of bark. It was through trade, beginning in the 19th century, that the more ductile cotton was introduced to the mountain peoples, thus bringing about the evolution of Cordillera weaving as it is today. However, cloths woven in the Ilocos and acquired through trade retained their prestige and value. In turn, the Ilocano acquired Cordillera gold for jewelry, together with the products of the mountains needed for various crafts and arts. Certain groups were known for their trading abilities like the Pampango, the Batangue&ntilde;o, and the Maranao. External trade with the southern coast of China and the islands of Borneo and the Malay peninsula was also well established before colonial times. Through trade with China, porcelain and other luxury items became part of the inhabitants&rsquo; trove of ritual and prestige objects. These items, once on Philippine shores, were brought by the traders inland; hence the presence of Chinese dragon jars among the Cordillera peoples and the Palawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The monarchs of Spain were indirectly the art patrons during the Spanish rule for they not only financed the state but also instituted the system called the <i>patronato real</i>, which took charge of the expenses of the Catholic church. With the consent of the popes, the kings provided a yearly stipend for the friars; supplied wheat, wine, and oil for the churches; and paid up to a third of the sum needed for building a new church. This was in exchange for the privilege of supervising the church in the colonies through approving the appointments of priests and bishops and scrutinizing all ecclesiastical decrees before implementation. In practice, the money spent for evangelization was raised from the colony itself, first by awarding the religious orders and dioceses the royal <i>encomiendas</i>, which meant that tribute from these areas reverted to the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As encomiendas failed to produce the revenues expected, the system was replaced in the late 16th century by the more lucrative galleon trade. The religious were allowed space for their exports in the galleon. During the 17th century, encomiendas ceased to be viable sources of income, and haciendas<i> </i>took their place. Most were owned by the religious. Both the galleon trade and the haciendas produced funds for the church, which in turn were spent for their apostolates. From Mexico, the galleons brought back to the Philippines the <i>situado</i>, a subsidy in silver taken from the rebate from the galleon trade. The situado financed the running of the colony, including the church&rsquo;s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from these sources of income, the church received donations from pious persons. Called founders or benefactors, these persons paid for a building, a sacred vessel, or painting, or left behind a pious endowment to be administered by the religious or by a board composed of priests and lay people. For instance, it is recorded that the church of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a></strong> of the 1630s was paid for by Gov-Gen Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora; and the Misericordia Confraternity, an association founded to help widows of Spanish soldiers, had a fund administered by a board that looked after its increment and distribution. Fund-raising campaigns were also undertaken. Thus did the Jesuits raise funds to build the 1889 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\"><strong>San Ignacio Church</strong></a> in Intramuros and the Recollects, the 19th-century <i>convento </i>(parish house) of Lacy, Siquijor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It would be an exaggeration to call the church the sole patron of the arts. However, by the 18th century, when church building and decorating was in full swing, it certainly was the most important institution, eclipsing the state in its patronage and directly commissioning many artworks. From the 16th to the mid-19th century, art was in the service of religion and colonial expansion. Artistically inclined friars taught engraving, painting, and sculpture, as well as music and the manufacture of musical instruments. Through the instrumentalities of the 1750 Real Orden, and later the 1840s Comision Permanente de Censura, all artistic productions passed through strict friar supervision. Artists had to obtain ecclesiastical permission to function in colonial society. It is not clear if the guild system found in Europe and Mexico had a counterpart in 17th- and 18th-century Philippines. If there were guilds, church control would have been exercised through them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The churches built all over the country became the immediate centers of art patronage. Local populations were mobilized for the construction of churches. Commisioned were paintings to cover the walls and altars, as well as religious sculptures or <b>santos</b> to grace the <b>retablos</b><i>.</i> As the churches grew in wealth, other arts were employed, such as the use of silver and/or gold for the altar, the chalice and monstrance, the accessories of the saints, and the floral ornamentation called <b>ramilletes</b>, embroidery in gold and silver for church vestments and costumes of the santos. Religious engravings for novenas brought out the skill of local engravers who were also put to work in cartography. Well-known 18th-century maps are those of 1734 and 1744, commissioned by the Jesuit Murillo Velarde and engraved by the Tagalog printers Nicolas de la Cruz <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3783\"><strong>Francisco Suarez</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The creation of paintings and other church ornaments required great skill. Centers of art appeared, such as Paete in Laguna for wood carving, as well as Vigan in Ilocos Sur and the districts of Santa Cruz, Quiapo, and Binondo in Manila for silvercraft and embroidery. Bohol was well known for its mats, some interlined with gold thread and used as carpets in churches as well as for paintings and santos. Among the products that came from Binondo were ivory carvings. These were considered prestige products and found their way not only into churches but private homes. So sought was ivory that rich individuals bought these to give as gifts to friends and political lords in Mexico and Spain. Some Philippine ivories are now in Mexican and Spanish collections. In the active commerce between the Philippines and Mexico, exported aside from ivory were textiles&mdash;such as pi&ntilde;a and sinamay, which was used to stiffen collars and cuffs&mdash;fans, and statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of the opening of the country to international trade in 1834 and the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, which shortened sea travel between Spain and the Philippines, there emerged a new mestizo/native landlord-merchant class that benefited from cash-crop agriculture. This <i>ilustrado </i>(educated) class sent its young men to Europe to pursue various disciplines in the arts and the sciences, where they were exposed to liberal ideas, as well as the social amenities and cultural interests of the times. Church dominance in art patronage waned as the ilustrados emerged. Enjoying unprecedented wealth, they built the <i>bahay na bato</i> (house of stone) and furnished these in the European style, complete with Vienna chairs, mirrors, and various objets d&rsquo;art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the 19th century, there was a fashion for miniature paintings, whether secular portraits or religious images, which brought out the talent of local artists. These were placed in gold lockets and given as prized gifts. To celebrate their social and economic ascendancy, the status-conscious ilustrados proceeded to commission portraits in the miniaturist style, which painstakingly recorded refinements of dress and jewelry, together with their treasured material possessions. The new entrepreneurs also commissioned <b>letras y figuras</b> (letters and figures), which artfully emblazoned their names in genre figures with scenes of urban streets and landmarks. Along with the letras was interest in <b>tipos del pais</b><i> </i>(country scenes), which portrayed human figures dressed in local costumes in a variety of color and style, belonging to various social classes and representing diverse occupations. Patrons of the tipos could be foreign merchants who commissioned artists to paint and compile albums of tipos as souvenirs for home. Known for their album of costumes were the mestizo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a> in the 1820s and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3417\"><strong>Justiniano Asuncion</strong></a> toward the middle of the century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this period of ilustrado dominance, santos commissioned for private altars became even more refined in material and artistic conception, richer and more elaborate in their embellishments. The<i> </i><b>santeros</b><i> </i>(makers of santos) enjoyed widespread patronage not only among the Manila elite but also among those in the provinces. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> guilds catering to the rich sprang up in Quiapo and Santa Cruz. Among the widely patronized santeros were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3418\"><strong>Leoncio Asuncion</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\"><strong>Isabelo Tampinco</strong></a>, Mariano Madri&ntilde;an, and Maximo Vicente.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Civil government, although not as active as the church, was also an important patron of the arts. Its patronage of the arts came to the fore when it sponsored the foreign education of artists. The best known of these pensionados were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo who won gold and silver medals, respectively, at the 1884 Madrid exposition. Luna was commissioned by the Madrid government to do several paintings, among them <b><i>La Batalla de Lepanto</i></b> (The Battle of Lepanto). He also received commissions from the government in Manila. Both artists enjoyed the patronage of the elite, and Luna was in the good graces of the king of Spain, Carlos IV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three other government programs for fostering the arts were competitions, participation in international exhibits, and the establishment of an art academy. A competition was held for the cover design of the Augustinian Manuel Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b> (Plants of the Philippines), a four-volume work published from 1877 to 1880. Agustin Saez, a Spanish art instructor, won over Hidalgo to do the illustrations. For the same book, Filipino artists like Hidalgo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\"><strong>Lorenzo Guerrero</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3653\"><strong>Felix Martinez</strong></a>, Regino and Rosendo Garcia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\"><strong>Miguel Zaragoza</strong></a>, and others, collaborated in rendering aquarelles that were to be reproduced lithographically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another form of government patronage was the establishment of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura in 1845, authorized by Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria and confirmed by Queen Isabela II. Authorized was a budget of 4,000 pesos for supplies and a monthly salary of 1,200 pesos per month for a professor of art. The <i>academia</i> replaced an earlier academy founded by Damian Domingo and was paid for by private sponsors. The academia lasted until 1845 when it was reorganized as the Escuela de Dibujo, Pintura y Grabado, which continued in existence until 1893.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spanish colonial period introduced all the characteristics of European patronage. Like the church movement in Europe, the state took a more active role in establishing academies which trained artists and ensured a style of art that would not threaten but enhance the power and prestige of the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the fringes of colonial patronage, <b>folk art</b> emerged, sometimes challenging Spanish hegemony. Folk art was a form of artistic expression that drew from the traditions of farming communities, mainly still animistic, and the Christian tradition. Much folk craft often associated with fiestas, like <b>pan de San Nicolas</b> (embossed cookies), <b>birhenan</b> (cookies shaped like the Pakil Virgen de los Dolores),<i> </i><b>taka</b> (papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; toys), terra-cotta dolls, and <b>parol</b><i> </i>(lanterns), were above ground and easily under the supervising eyes of colonial authority. But an underground folk expression in <b>anting-anting</b> (amulets) and esoteric <b>oraciones</b> (prayer booklets) emerged because they were believed to give power to their users. Anting-anting took many forms, but the more common ones were shirts emblazoned with mystic designs and cast metal medallions. The latter employed Christian symbols, like the cross and the eye of God, but surrounded by elements drawn from mystical writing. Oraciones were often illustrated with diagrams and symbolic images, and reading the prayers gave the reader powers according to the dictates of the text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The establishment of American rule in 1901 saw another wave of patrons in the colonial officials and visitors in the country. In the spirit of the international expositions in vogue during the 20th century, these new patrons favored local color and the &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; in paintings, which they brought back to the United States as a reminder of their visit to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the arts, the period was marked by the dominance of a stream of painting heavily influenced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> based in the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. UP was established by the American colonial government in 1908. The art school, founded in 1909, functioned as the official academy and a canon-making institution. The prolific Amorsolo, with his rural idylls of abundant harvests and the <i>dalagang bukid</i> or village lass, gained recognition and a sizeable patronage among American officials and the art-conscious sector of the local elite to whom owning an Amorsolo work was a status symbol. Amorsolo also won recognitions in art expositions abroad. During this time, clients commissioned painters directly as there were still no galleries for the exhibit and sale of artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amorsolo&rsquo;s ascendancy was challenged by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>&rsquo;s one-man show at the Philippine Columbian in 1928. Freshly returned from abroad, Edades asserted modernist ideas and challenged the conservative and academic style of Amorsolo. The art scene was divided into the conservatives led by Amorsolo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a>, on the one hand, and the modernists, led by Edades, on the other. The public was made aware of this conflict by the press exchanges between the two camps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this period and the postwar era, two developments proved significant to the struggle for modern art. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>, founded in 1948 by Purita <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w-Ledesma, instituted an annual competition for artists, thus encouraging the production of new works. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\"><strong>Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</strong></a>, founded in 1950 by Lydia Arguilla, became the first gallery to display and sell artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The conflict between the conservatives and the modernists came to a head in the 1955 AAP annual art competition. The conservatives walked out because of the perception that the judges were biased for modern art. From this split grew what is now called &ldquo;Mabini Art,&rdquo; named after the street where many conservatives had their studios. Most of the conservatives had been trained in the UP School of Fine Arts under Amorsolo. In turn, they trained younger artists who remained under their influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The older conservative artists were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3535\"><strong>Oscar Espiritu</strong></a>, Felix Gonzales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3630\"><strong>Crispin Lopez</strong></a>, and Felix Zablon. A younger generation consisting of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3555\"><strong>Miguel Galvez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3495\"><strong>Gabriel Custodio</strong></a>, Romeo Enriquez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3772\"><strong>Serafin Serna</strong></a>, Cesar Buenaventura, and Ben Alano set up their studio in the Mabini area, and clients bought works directly from them. Most of them continued in the tradition of Amorsolo landscapes. Partly out of economic necessity, most were reduced to formula painting and to copying landscapes from imported art manuals. They continued to cater to foreign tourists and to local clients who sought less expensive paintings of familiar scenes to decorate their walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In time, the Mabini artists developed a system of production and marketing. Painters were grouped under a manager, often an artist himself, who obtained local and foreign commissions, imposed quotas and conditions on the painters, and paid them for their work. By the 1970s, some Mabini groups had branched out from Amorsolo-type paintings to other figurative and eclectic styles as well as into other media such as brass hammer-outs. But they remain decorative and facile in style. Also part of the Mabini art market were branches in Angeles, Pampanga, particularly near Clark Air Base where the painters catered to American clients who commissioned portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the ascendancy of modern painting and sculpture, a new patronage developed among urban, educated, and art-conscious Filipinos. They had supported the modernists in their struggles, and they became their new patrons. Galleries were subsequently set up for the display and sale of works. The pioneering PAG grew out of an advertising outfit and became the first venue for modern paintings. The owner, Arguilla, set into motion the practice of art criticism by writing and publishing some of the earliest writings on art. For print, Manuel Rodriguez Sr opened the Contemporary Arts Gallery, which also held printmaking workshops. Other privately owned spaces that were put up later include the Luz Gallery, Ayala Museum, and Marisan Gallery (now West Gallery), as well as the Heritage Gallery, Greenhills Art Center, Gallery <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>, Galerie Bleu, Galleria Duemilla, Hiraya Gallery, Liongoren Gallery, and Gallery  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong>. Aside from these, other venues for art are the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP), with its several galleries (named after Juan Luna, Fernando Amorsolo, Guillermo Tolentino, Victorio Edades, and Carlos Francisco); the Metropolitan Museum of Manila; and the National Museum, with its several venues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Marcos period saw a boom in the art market. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> R. Marcos&rsquo;s interest in the arts gave rise to patronage by her and a number of government officials and their wives. Among these officials was former Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) governor Jaime C. Laya. The BSP acquired works of 19th- and 20th-century masters, early moderns, and major contemporary artists, the latter through its reinvigorated annual acquisition program. These form what is now the BSP collection, a rich public repository of Philippine art regularly shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. The Casa Manila, under the Intramuros Administration, was also established to house artistic and traditional objects related to the Spanish colonial period. Other institutions, like private banks and other government offices, followed the trend. Notable for having accumulated old masters&rsquo; paintings were the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the United Coconut Planters Bank, and the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank, while the Multinational Investment Corporation invested in art masterpieces for resale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of this vigorous art collecting, hitherto unknown 19th-century works were discovered and retrieved from dusty bodegas. The art market for these works was greatly stimulated, with prices skyrocketing to the hundreds of thousands. But it was the art dealers rather than the uninformed, often provincial owners, who derived much profit. Mrs Marcos also singled out artistic personalities in all fields to be special recipients of her favors. Part of the boost given the arts was the institution of the National Artist Award centered at the CCP. The attention given by the Marcos government to culture, however, tended to harness cultural and artistic activity to the service of the first couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another factor that enlivened the art market was the building boom, which sought to project a prosperous image for the country so as to attract foreign investments. The buildings at the CCP Complex, particularly the Philippine International Convention Center and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, were built to host international conferences. Five-star hotels, such as the Manila Peninsula Hotel and the Mandarin Oriental, mushroomed at the height of the tourist drive. Most of these buildings were furnished with first-class accommodations, which included expensive paintings by well-known artists. Painters and sculptors were mobilized by dealers to fill these buildings with their works, with both artist and dealer reaping monetary rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this period, the fine arts developed as an industry. Its business potential was put to use by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a>&rsquo;s Marisan cards, which made serigraph editions of works of well-known artists. Handmade paper reemerged as a craft and fine art form, fostered in part by the Design Center of the Philippines, which conducted seminars on papermaking. Handmade paper was seen as a potential source of income for economically depressed areas. The qualities of local fiber, like abaca, rice, cogon, and other grasses, were exploited. Handmade paper was produced in quantity by establishments like the Duntog Paper Mill of Baguio and Salay Paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indigenous textiles also became the fashion. While handlooms in the Ilocos and Cordilleras produce textiles for daily use in traditional patterns, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/958\"><strong>Narda</strong></a> Capuyan took traditional <b>ikat</b> as a starting point for innovative designs for tapestries, clothing, and fashion accessories. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3432\"><strong>Manuel Baldemor</strong></a> introduced innovations in taka making in Paete by carving new molds. A parallel initiative in this regard was also undertaken by artist-members of Kasibulan working with women taka makers in Paete. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a> teamed up with Anaware in Bacolod to make limited editions of plates bearing his signature figure drawings. Imelda Pilapil, experimenting on discarded objects (like drums, steel reinforcement) and also on glass and plastic, has made decorative yet functional furniture for export. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\"><strong>Ramon Orlina</strong></a> created small glass sculptures sold in museum shops and specialty stores. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3407\"><strong>Jerry Araos</strong></a> made furniture out of discarded railroad tires and parts of houses. Artists consciously tore down the traditional separation between fine art and functional crafts. In so doing, their works have been made accessible to both the wealthy and the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this period, the first of a long series of coffee-table books on art appeared, and most were hard put in balancing art appreciation with a commodity orientation. Many of these books were meant to create a symbiotic and profitable relationship between art and advertising, as some art writers were regarded primarily as art promoters rather than critics and historians. Coffee-table books and gallery lectures on art management and collecting also stimulated public interest in the arts and boosted art sales. With the lively art market, patrons, both corporate and individual, strongly focused on the investment side of art collecting. This has resulted in more sales. In this climate, many artists were enticed by commercial opportunities, although the best of them survive even when art patronage is on a downswing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of the perceived injustices and corruption of the Marcos regime, a new form of art emerged in the <b>street art</b>, put together by protesting groups and those engaging in nonprofit community projects. Cause-oriented groups cooperated with artist groups to produce murals and effigies mounted on jeepneys and trucks paraded during rallies. These are usually done without any artists&rsquo; fees, and the materials used consist of house paint and canvas donated by the groups and their sympathizers in labor, the academe, the professions, and members of the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early years of the Corazon Aquino administration, numerous art organizations sprang up overnight, indicating a lively art climate. The earlier commercial character gave way to a more socially and politically conscious art. As a result of numerous dialogues between the government and artists, the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts (PCCA) was organized in 1987 to stimulate the development of art. Among the committees in the PCCA are those of the arts, heritage, and cultural dissemination. In 1992, the PCCA became the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, which by law was supposed to establish a national endowment fund to support the projects in arts and culture approved by its national committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP, which was closely associated with Imelda Marcos, changed directions from being primarily a center for performing arts to being a coordinating center for all the arts and for all artistic traditions. At this juncture, it emphasized the Filipino artist over the foreign artists that the Marcos regime had favored. The CCP&rsquo;s Coordinating Center for Visual Arts gave venue grants and some financial support to Manila-based and regional groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today&rsquo;s comparatively less centralized climate has enabled artists and various art agents to take greater initiative in managing their own practice. Private corporations and individuals remain the strongest patrons. Annual art contests sponsored by Metrobank, Philippine Long Distance Telephone <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, Petron, and Shell continue to give important incentives to artists. Despite the improving national economy and the rising local/international interest in the work of Filipino artists as demonstrated in the yields of regional art fair franchises and auctions, art practice and management remain competitive fields where only the strongest survive as new entrants emerge. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

The phenomena gave birth to art fairs, hedge funds, and hybrid partnerships across various art-world players, which heavily influenced the modes of valuation that operate in the Philippines. Amid these high-stake art agents, there would still indeed be downstream industries operating, such as forgeries and even itinerant peddlers literally vending frames on the street, coexisting in parallel to such aboveboard art market platforms. The vagaries latent in valuation disparities would first become most publicly prominent when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Magsaysay-Ho&rsquo;s diminutive piece, <b><i>In the Market Place</i></b>, sold at a Christie&rsquo;s auction in Singapore for a record 15 million pesos in 2008. Earlier, the GSIS acquired Juan Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>Parisian</i></b> <b><i>Life</i></b>, 1892, for 42 million pesos in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yet, despite the implementation of the National Cultural Heritage Act or Republic <em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Act</span></em> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>66 of 2009, which is the state&rsquo;s attempt to enable the comprehensive registering of artifacts, particularly those en route outside the Philippines, the art industry remains largely unregulated. Its transactions are merely subject to general strictures applied to businesses across the board. Gallery commissions on sales made of artists&rsquo; works average at 50 percent of sale price with artists often being left to negotiate the burden of requested discounts and delayed or delinquent payments. Unlike in some international territories where resale or secondary market movement of works also accrues to shared benefits for artists or their heirs, similarly equitable arrangements do not play out in the local art world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the activity of foreign gallerists and curators coming into the Philippines began stirring up an arguable degree of professionalism and competitive fervor to retain talent in the early 2000s, what has most dramatically impacted the mode of production and degree of circulation of the works of some artists has been the slow but rising influence of both small and local, as well as large, franchise auction houses. The latter established themselves in the country through official representatives or through collaborative projects, as in the case of the recent teaming up of Christie&rsquo;s with Art Fair Philippines (AFP) in 2015. Apart from AFP, which is organized by past officers of the Museum Foundation of the Philippines, at least two other major art fairs present themselves as being the most anticipated showcases of modern and contemporary art in the country: the Manila Art, initiated by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a>fide Art Galleries Association, and the Sikat Pinoy National Art Fair, sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry. As an act of philanthropy, parallel didactic-education events are usually part of the programming of these undertakings to balance content with business concerns, addressing the need of the visitors and especially the collectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These frequent interfaces between art industry agents and critical agents from the museum-academic sector have parallels in the way art historians are conscripted to produce the literature on art that affirms the choices made within the logic of business models peopled by both well-meaning enthusiasts but also savvy commodity traders. The aggressive push of auction house curators, for instance, has come at the cost of waning interest among artists to push into untried directions in art-making. Rather, artists are given advice based on business models, favoring a formulaic mind-set expressed in preferred scale, trend conformity, even type of figuration, in keeping with the notion of building a dependable brand possibly only accessible to a few. In contrast to the 1950s through the 1980s when auctions came largely as isolated attempts to do fund-raising benefits by the Art Association of the Philippines or by the gallery network that was for a time running a themed project called Art Manila, the current pace of monthly/quarterly auctions brings scouts right to the studios of artists who, instead of producing for exhibitions in museums or even their own galleries, are pressured to tick off orders from a preferred list of collectors or to headline the spread in upcoming fairs/auctions. Gallerists too have tended to exert their influence much earlier now in the still nascent career of artists as they have become staple presences on thesis or award panels if they are not avidly attending critique sessions and art award ceremonies to keep in step with industry developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, parallel self-organizing being done by artists does continue to take the form of artist-run spaces or itinerant platforms, which at their global height in the 1990s succeeded in short-circuiting validation mechanisms by drawing the attention of less established collectors and still enterprising curators. These spaces and art platforms variably embrace alterity in their programming, with some merely providing a venue but others seeing to it that they serve the need of artists for places to converge, undertake workshops, organize discussions or transmedia projects. Such activities would not easily fit into the mode of operations of more mainstream and profit-oriented spaces. In some cases, art galleries might eventually appropriate these public engagement modalities to maintain relevance within the fluid parameters of the art world. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"awards\" name=\"awards\"></a>Awards</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The enterprise of conferring awards covers a wide range of such symbols of validation as honors, grants, and residencies, commonly obtained by way of a competitive application or nomination procedure. While it is ostensibly about acknowledging achievement, it actually involves the manufacture of value. Prize-giving is an opportunity for art-world agents to advance and reinforce their claims to authority and legitimacy by advocating a certain aesthetic, endorsing specific practices, or drawing evaluative attention to a work of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is not in any way to suggest, of course, that the act of awarding is, at its root and core, a futile, cynical one, no matter how vulnerable it may be to charges of commercialization, corruption, or obscurantism, and no matter how valid such charges may be&mdash;unfortunately so in situations, sadly ubiquitous, where accolades serve as shortcuts for cautious, incisive assessment; where they are construed as permanent guarantees of noteworthy performance; or where they are wielded as weapons by stakeholders, givers, jurors, funders, recipients, and critics among them, to coerce acquiescence or to quell resistance from others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Awards in the field of visual arts are given to recognize individual accomplishment as well as to encourage excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest award received by a Philippine native was given by an institution outside the country. In 1868, LorenzoRocha received an honorable mention for <b><i>El Sue&ntilde;o de Don Ronsiro </i></b>(The Dream of Don Ronsiro) from the Madrid art exposition of that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the earliest local art competitions in the 19th century was that opened by the editor Domingo Vidal y Soler to select the best cover design for the deluxe edition of Fr Manuel Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas </i></b>(Plants of the Philippines) in 1877. Prof Agustin Saez won first prize, and his student FelixResurreccionHidalgo won second. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a> de Manila subsequently awarded Hidalgo a scholarship in fine arts, after undergoing a competitive test. He was sent to Spain to pursue advanced studies at the Academia de San Fernando in Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Sociedad Economica de Amigos del Pais de Filipinas gave awards to artists who contributed to <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b>, one of whom was Regino Garcia y Baza. In 1879, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5449\"><strong>Liceo Artistico-Literario</strong></a> held a literary-artistic contest for which  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> submitted two entries: a poem, &ldquo;AlaJuventudFilipina&rdquo; (To the Filipino Youth), and the other a wooden bust of Cervantes. The prize was awarded to TelesforoSucgang for his bust of Cardinal Cisneros. A nationwide artistic competition was held in Oct 1882 during the tercentenary celebration of Santa Teresa. On this occasion, LorenzoGuerrero won a gold medal for <b><i>Transverberacion de Santa Teresa de Jesus </i></b>(Transfixion of Saint Theresa), and FelixMartinez won the silver medal. The year 1883 saw the Amsterdam International Exposition in which Paete sculptor MarianoMadri&ntilde;an won first prize for his <b><i>Mater Dolorosa </i></b>(Sorrowful Mother). King Alfonso XII sent the diploma of honor to the winning sculptor through the governor-general in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first important international competition in which Filipino painters won was held in Europe. This was the Madrid exposition of 1884 in which Filipino expatriate artists JuanLuna and Hidalgo won prizes. To qualify for the competition, the artists had to conform to its standards: oil on canvas, large-scale, subject drawn from classical antiquity, modeling with light and dark. Luna won the first gold medal for his large-scale canvas <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, and Hidalgo, a silver medal for <b><i>LasVirgenesCristianasExpuestasalPopulacho </i></b>(Christian Virgins Exposed to the Populace). Luna was awarded the first gold medal rather than the medal of honor, which was the highest distinction. The medal of honor in that 1884 competition was not awarded to any artist. There were talks that Luna was denied this distinction, not because of any artistic shortcoming but because he was not Caucasian. Even the king of Spain, Alfonso XII, with his warm congratulations of Luna, openly expressed his sympathies for Luna&rsquo;s failure to receive the medal of honor. Later, because of growing public opinion critical of the jury, Luna was commissioned to do a large canvas, <b><i>La Batalla de Lepanto </i></b>(The Battle of Lepanto), which was unveiled by the Queen Regent Maria Cristina in 1887 and hung in the Senate conference hall. In 1886, Luna entered the <b><i>Spoliarium </i></b>in the Paris Salon, and the piece received another gold medal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Luna and Hidalgo won in subsequent competitions. At the Exposicion General de las Islas Filipinas held in Madrid in 1887, Hidalgo won his first gold medal for <b><i>La Barca de Aqueronte</i></b> (The Boat of Charon). This painting also won for Hidalgo a <i>diploma de honor </i>(certificate of honor) at the Exposicion de Bellas Artes of Barcelona in 1891. In 1890, Luna became a lifetime member of the exclusive Societe Nationale des Beaux Arts of Paris, which allowed him the privilege of showing several paintings at the Champs de Mars without being screened by the board. As Luna won the grand prize at the salon for his <b><i>Chiffonier </i></b>(Rag Picker), he was entitled to this privilege. From then on, the artist&rsquo;s paintings on exhibit would be labeled &ldquo;Hors Concours&rdquo; (H.C.) or &ldquo;outside the contest&rdquo; to indicate that the work was by an established artist and thus did not enter in competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1887, the Exposicion General de las Islas Filipinas took place in Madrid. The Philippine participation was managed by Vidal y Soler and Garcia y Baza, a Filipino artist and botanist who directed the building of nipa houses typifying native construction. Garcia himself won honorable mention for his painting depicting Philippine views and themes in this exhibit. In the same exposition, RafaelEnriquez, later to become first director of the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts, won a medal for <b><i>La Muerte de D. Simon de Anda </i></b>(The Death of D. Simon de Anda), while DomingoTeotico won a bronze medal in sculpture. The following year, in 1888, Garcia also supervised the Philippine and Compa&ntilde;ia Tabacalera exhibits in the Exposicion Universal de Barcelona where IsabeloTampinco won a gold medal for his model depicting the sculptures and carvings of the new Jesuit church in Intramuros, the San Ignacio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Besides the international expositions already mentioned, there were the Exposicion Internacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid in 1892, the Universal Exposition of Chicago in 1893, the Exposicion Artistica de Bilbao in 1894, and the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas in Manila in 1895. In 1895, even Filipino sculptors IsabeloTampinco, BonifacioArevalo, EulogioGarcia Velarde, and EugenioLlerena won prizes. An earlier art competition held in Manila in 1892 was connected with the third centenary of San Juan de la Cruz. Teotico won second prize in sculpture in this fete. It is also to be noted that in these expositions, paintings and artworks constituted only a section; other sections consisted of agricultural exhibits featuring rice and woods, as well as local crafts&mdash;such as canes&mdash;in which Filipino artists also won prizes. For instance, a set of carved furniture by Teotico won a silver medal in the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas. Aside from these expositions, well-known painters like Hidalgo also participated in the regular salon exhibits of Les Champs Elysees in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1902 Exposicion de Hanoi, the sculptor Arevalo won awards for his works, among them are portraits of the emperor and empress of Japan. Two years later, in 1904, the Universal Exposition of Saint Louis was held. The Philippine representation was displayed in a mock village occupying several hundred acres comprising settlements of various cultural groups. The artistic entries were given awards by the Philippine Exposition Board. There were two types of awards: overall collaboration and individual awards. Hidalgo received a gold medal for overall collaboration, while he received other golds, silvers, and bronzes for his individual entries. This was also the case for other artists like Felix Martinez, MiguelZaragoza, and FabiandelaRosa. De la Rosa won a gold medal for <b><i>PlantingRice </i></b>and a bronze medal for <b><i>The Death of General Lawton</i></b>, a historical scene commissioned by the American consul. Also in the Saint Louis exposition, Manila sculptor Llerena won a silver medal for his <b><i>Huyendo del Fuego </i></b>(Fleeing from the Fire), a wood carving of a woman and her children fleeing from a fire. It is interesting to note that in this exposition a work by sculptor MarceloNepomuceno was rejected because its subject of a Filipino woman brandishing a bolo against a lion and an eagle was considered too strongly nationalistic by the exposition board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1908, the Primera Exposicion de Bellas Artes y Artes Industriales in Manila was sponsored by the Asociacion Internacional de Artistas de Manila to welcome an American squadron in its visit to the city. In this show, Llerena again won for two sculptures of tipos del pais, featuring human figures in local costume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also in 1908, the Liga Antipornografica held a literary-artistic competition in Manila in honor of Pope Pius X. Here Llerena won a silver medal for his carving of San Francisco Xavier. In the Panama International Exposition of 1915, a painting by Hidalgo, exhibited posthumously, won a gold medal. In the Philippine Exposition of 1925, JoseCaancan of Paete won first prize for his wooden bust of Gen Leonard Wood. During the American colonial period, medals were also awarded to the most artistic floats on Rizal Day celebrations and carnivals. One more exposition before World War II was the Golden Gate San Francisco World Fair and Exposition in 1939. For this occasion, pioneering modernists VictorioEdades, GaloB.Ocampo, and CarlosV.Francisco aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a> Francisco were commissioned to do two murals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese occupation, 1942-45, an important aspect of the Japanese campaign was undertaken in art and culture. The Japanese occupational government, through the Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas, sponsored two art exhibits. RicartePuruganan&rsquo;s <b><i>Bullfight</i></b> won first prize in the 1943 exhibition. Francisco won first prize for <b><i>Angelus</i></b>, second prize for <b><i>Frugal Meal in the Fields</i></b>, and third prize for <b><i>Angono Fiesta</i></b> in the 1944 exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, the first national art awards were instituted by the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines and the first AAP national art exhibition, which was also a competition, was held on 3 Jul 1948, the year AAP was founded at the National Museum on Herran St. The judges for this historic exhibit were Edades, the pioneering exponent of modern art; FernandoAmorsolo, the leading painter of the conservative academy; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\"><strong>Francesco Monti</strong></a>, a sculptor; and Emilio<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>rCruz, one of the earliest art critics.

Ocampo, ManuelGalvez, and Katy Yatco. The third AAP-sponsored contest was the Manila Art Club art exhibition held on San Marcelino St in October. What was new in this contest was the division of the entries into two categories, conservative and modern, both further grouped by medium into oil and watercolor/pastel. Top winners for the conservative category were Laxa, MiguelGalvez, Romeo B. Rodriguez, CrispinLopez, and SimonSaulog; those for the modern category were Puruganan, Legaspi, H.R. Ocampo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>&mdash;with some winning more than one prize. The judges were Jack Y. Bryan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3640\"><strong>Anita Magsaysay-Ho</strong></a>, and AurelioS.Alvero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1950, the AAP held its annual in January, and a third semiannual art exhibition in the painting category in July as sponsored by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong>. As in the 1949 Manila Art Club exhibition, this fourth AAP annual exhibition at the Manila Trading and Supply Center on 24 Feb 1951 had entries divided into conservative and modern, with the additional category of sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AAP also instituted special awards, one for Best Interpretation of Filipino Life to Non-Filipinos in drawing and watercolor, and another award in caricature. JuvenalSanso won first prize in the conservative category for his work <b><i>Sorcerer</i></b>. The other winners were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3583\"><strong>Rodolfo Herrera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3565\"><strong>Wenceslao Garcia</strong></a>, and SerafinSerna. Top winners in the modern category were Legaspi, H.R. Ocampo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\"><strong>Galo B. Ocampo</strong></a>. The winners in sculpture were Mariano Edjawan, first prize; NapoleonV.Abueva, second prize; and Ramon Estella, third prize. The special award for Best Interpretation of Filipino Life to Non-Filipinos was given to H.R. Ocampo. Also in the same year, the AAP held its first separate sculpture show. The winners were Abueva, AnastacioCaedo, and JoseAlcantara. It had special awards for Best Filipino Interpretation of the Madonna, and Best Entry in Wood, Plaster, Metal, and other Media. Abueva won three prizes in this competition. The judges were Magsaysay-Ho, Gilbert Perez, Daniel Zamora, PabloAntonio, and MaximoVicenteJr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AAP annual art exhibitions reflected growing tension between the conservatives and the modernists who challenged the former&rsquo;s dominance. The final break came at the eighth AAP annual exhibition held at the Northern Motors Showroom. Whereas in the regular exhibition the division between the conservatives and modernists was observed, this was not the case in the Rotary Golden Anniversary Awards, which had a separate contest co-sponsored by the AAP in the same venue. The Rotary Club had earlier approached the AAP and announced that it would give three cash awards, with a first prize of 2,000 pesos for the paintings or sculptures that would best reflect the Rotary themes of service, international brotherhood, and understanding. The winners were all modernists: VicenteManansala, Galo B. Ocampo, and ManuelRodriguezSr. Thus conservatives walked out with their paintings from the exhibit hall, and put up their own exhibit at the Luneta and on Mabini St. This historic walkout proved that the modernists had finally gained ascendance. In subsequent competitions, the AAP often observed the following categories: painting and sculpture, with special awards in watercolor, graphic arts, and photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several other award-giving bodies were instituted to honor Filipino artists, such as the Republic Cultural Heritage Awards.

This was packaged as such in honor of the pioneering Thirteen Moderns. Up to 1980, the selection of awardees depended largely on the choices of then visual arts director Albano. The first batch of awardees in 1970 were Ray Albano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\"><strong>Angelito Antonio</strong></a>, Virgilio Aviado, Eduardo Castrillo, Benedicto Cabrera, Restituto Embuscado, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3553\"><strong>Marciano Galang</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3581\"><strong>Lamberto Hechanova</strong></a></strong>, Jaime de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3647\"><strong>Noel Manalo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3649\"><strong>Ben Maramag</strong></a>, Manuel Rodriguez Jr, and Antonio Austria. In 1988 the new CCP democratized the selection by asking different groups to nominate candidates. The search was also widened to encompass different styles and highlight the excellence and maturity of artists&rsquo; works. Given every two years, it comes with a production grant, trophy, and group exhibition at the Bulwagang Juan Luna or Main Gallery.

While the award was first given in 1977, the guidelines were only established in 1988. Awards were given every year from 1989 to 1994, before becoming every three years. Among its past awardees in the visual arts were artists Luz, 1989; Legaspi and Imao, 1990; Joya, 1991; BenCab, 1992; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\"><strong>Tony Velasquez</strong></a>, 1993; Malang Santos, 1994; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, 2004; Francisco Coching and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3671\"><strong>Pitoy Moreno</strong></a>, 2008; Brenda Fajardo, 2012; and Roberto Chabet and Ben Farrales, 2015. AAP founder PuritaKalaw-Ledesma and the Talaandig School for Living Traditions also received the Tanging Parangal award in 1991 and 2015, respectively. In 1999, the CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts were conferred to 100 Filipino artists and scholars who have strongly contributed in the development of Philippine art. Among the recipients were visual artists Napoleon Abueva, Fernando Amorsolo, Lydia Arguilla, Roberto Chabet, Danny Dalena, Araceli Dans, Fabian de la Rosa, Victorio Edades, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong>Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, Brenda Fajardo, Botong Francisco, Jose Joya,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</strong></a></strong>, Cesar Legaspi, Juan Luna, Arturo Luz, Vicente Manansala, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\"><strong>Nonoy Marcelo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3656\"><strong>Eduardo Masferre</strong></a>, H.R.

Starting 2001, the Gawad Alab ng Haraya (Alab ng Haraya Awards) and Dangal ng Haraya (Achievement Awards) were instituted by the NCCA to recognize the contributions of groups and individuals in the field of arts management and cultural work. Another government corporation award body is the Government Service Insurance System, which has been running an annual art acquisition mechanism through its own competition launched in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Manlilikha ng Bayan or National Folk Artist Award was started in 1990 as a national tribute to master folk artists. Initiated by the Rotary Club of Makati-Ayala and the Cultural Center of the Philippines and supported by an interagency committee from the private and government sectors, it was first given to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3701\"><strong>Kahhimngan Palatic</strong></a> for Cordillera ikat weaving, RasidLaidan for Maranao brass casting, MagdalenaMarti for pi&ntilde;a weaving, FidelGo for <b>burnay</b> pottery, MaluyLasaSambolani for Laminusa mat weaving, and ElyArcilla for Paracale gold-jewelry making. Management of the awards has been passed onto the National Commission for Culture and the Arts through Republic Act 7355. The Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (National Living Treasure Award) or GAMABA has been given to the following:  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Ginaw Bilog</strong></a></strong> for<i> </i><b>surat Mangyan</b> and <b>ambahan</b><i> </i>poetry, awarded in 1993; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3667\"><strong>Salinta Monon</strong></a> for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> textile weaving, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3527\"><strong>Lang Dulay</strong></a> for Tboli <b>tnalak</b> weaving, both awarded in 1998; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3769\"><strong>Darhata Sawabi</strong></a> for Tausug <b>pis syabit</b> weaving, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3403\"><strong>Haja Amina Appi</strong></a> for the Sama mat weaving, and  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>Eduardo Mutuc</strong></a></strong> </strong> for Kapampangan silversmithing, all awarded in 2004; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3556\"><strong>Magdalena Gamayo</strong></a> for Ilocano <b>inabel</b><i> </i>weaving, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3564\"><strong>Teofilo Garcia</strong></a> for <b>kattukong</b> hat making, both in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Co-equal with the GAMABA as the highest state award is the National Artist Award. Pursuant to a decree signed by then president Ferdinand Marcos to recognize the contributions of Filipino artists, the title of National Artist was conferred on Fernando Amorsolo, 1972, because his &ldquo;years of creative activity have defined and perpetuated a distinct element of the nation&rsquo;s artistic and cultural heritage and won universal acclaim for our country and people;&rdquo; Carlos V. Francisco, 1973, because &ldquo;he transcended the narrow medium, investing his murals and easels with the robust spirit and infectious gaiety of the simple people whose joys and sorrows he captured on canvas with enviable fidelity;&rdquo; GuillermoTolentino, 1973, because &ldquo;his restless search for the proper molds in which to pour his talents led him to commemorative sculptures which are delicate and classically balanced, and more often monumental with a scale and grandeur matched by no other sculptor of his time;&rdquo; NapoleonAbueva, 1976, because &ldquo;his massive abstractions and constructions of incredible variety and diversity, an unfailing inventiveness, a prodigious energy and inexhaustible inspiration firmly imprint his signature on the art of our time;&rdquo; VictorioEdades, 1976, because he changed &ldquo;the direction of Philippine painting decisively, ending the parochial isolation of Philippine art and placing it in the mainstream of international culture;&rdquo; Vicente Manansala, 1981, because he left &ldquo;a rich legacy of extraordinary achievements manifested in a large body of masterful works revealing the many facetedness of the outside world of fleeting time and of the mind;&rdquo; Cesar Legaspi, 1990, because he refined &ldquo;cubism in the Philippine context&rdquo; and contributed &ldquo;significantly to the advent and eventual acceptance of modern art in the Philippines;&rdquo; and H.R. Ocampo, 1991, because &ldquo;his courage and unique vision opened the way for a new language in painting that was freer, richer, and more poetic and for tirelessly seeking and refining an idiom that would be truly reflective of the Filipino society and sensibility.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Subsequent awardees include Arturo Luz, 1997, who &ldquo;created masterpieces that exemplify an ideal of sublime austerity in expression and form;&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J. Elizalde Navarro</strong></a>, 1999, honored for his &ldquo;40 years of drawing, printmaking, graphic designing, painting and sculpting&rdquo; and his imaginative use of color; Ang Kiukok, 2001, whose expressionistic works were &ldquo;imbued with nationalist fervor and sociological agenda:&rdquo; Jose Joya, 2003, who &ldquo;distinguished himself by creating an authentic Filipino abstract idiom that transcended foreign influences&rdquo;; BenCab, 2006, whose works show that the &ldquo;potency of figurative expression had held out vital options for Philippine art in the martial law years in the seventies through the contemporary era;&rdquo; Abdulmari Imao, 2006, whose works popularized &ldquo;the indigenous <b>ukkil</b>, <b>sarimanok</b> and <b>naga</b> motifs &hellip; and instilled in the consciousness of the Filipino nation;&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3391\"><strong>Federico Aguilar Alcuaz</strong></a>, 2009, whose gestural paintings are characterized by &ldquo;light, composition and color&rdquo;; and Francisco Coching, 2014, whose &ldquo;works reflected the dynamics brought about by the racial and class conflict in Philippine colonial society.&rdquo;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G. Guillermo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A. Pilar</strong></a>, updated by Cecilia S. De La Paz</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"law\" name=\"law\"></a>Law, Censorship, and Ethics</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">As a mode of validation, law, censorship, and ethics influence the valuation of art in the public sphere. In the Philippines, the struggle between freedom of expression, institutional responsibilities, and state power would affect art practice and its circulation in society. An examination of the law would reveal two major tendencies that mark out the spectrum of legal attitudes toward art: protective on the one hand, and repressive on the other. The protective tendency of law with regard to art can be discerned in regulations that pertain to such areas as freedom of expression, cultural heritage, and intellectual property rights. The repressive tendency, usually exercised in the interest of a public that is presumed to be vulnerable to moral harm, is exemplified by regulations related to indecency, obscenity, and offenses against religious worship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The law does not have to grapple directly with aesthetic questions or set down explicit definitions for art in order to affect the art world. For example, in a 1964 decision involving the artist Mauro Malang Santos, better known by the mononym &ldquo;Malang,&rdquo; the ruling of the Supreme Court on a matter of procedure wound up depriving the artist of the right to control how his work could be used, including the economic exploitation thereof. Malang had initiated an action for damages against the McCullough Printing Company for reproducing and selling a Christmas card design that he had made for the personal use of former ambassador Felino Neri. McCullough had retained Malang&rsquo;s signature in the design, ensuring that he would be identified as the maker but had not obtained his consent for further circulating the reproduced image. Following the dismissal of his complaint by a lower court, the artist filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, alleging that said court had committed several errors in making its judgment. The lower court&rsquo;s decision, however, was affirmed: it was established that Malang had failed to comply with the registration requirements of the copyright law in force at the time, and therefore the design had entered the public domain and was freely available for anyone to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another instance might be the 2013 ruling of the Supreme Court on the dispute that had erupted around the 2009 roster of the Order of National Artists. Then president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had decided to confer the honor upon seven individuals. Only three of them had been selected by the joint boards of the NCCA and the CCP: visual artist Federico Aguilar Alcuaz, filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>, and writer Lazaro Francisco. The rest&mdash;comic book writer and film director Magno Jose Carlos J. Caparas, theater artist Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, architect Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa, and fashion designer Jose &ldquo;Pitoy&rdquo; Moreno&mdash;had been added by dint of presidential prerogative, which was also used to justify the removal of musicologist Ramon C. Santos, who had also been chosen by the NCCA and the CCP, together with Alcuaz, Conde, and Francisco. A number of concerned parties, which included National Artists Bienvenido Lumbera and Virgilio Almario, filed suit, alleging that Arroyo had committed grave abuse of discretion. The Supreme Court eventually ruled against the inclusion of Caparas, Guidote-Alvarez, Ma&ntilde;osa, and Moreno, but it believed that the omission of Santos was well within the president&rsquo;s authority. However, Santos was eventually proclaimed National Artist for music in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In certain situations, the law or gatekeepers&rsquo; perception of what constitutes normative art has translated into preempted exhibition-making and thus the curtailment of freedom of creative expression. This has been demonstrated in cases wherein museum curators have intervened on behalf of their institutions and prevailed over the showing of work by artists who, in their judgment, could affront the sensibilities of persons in authority. This was exemplified in the 2003 pulling out of the work of artist Dindo Llana titled <b><i>Naku! </i></b>(Oh!), which satirizes President Arroyo, from the exhibit<b><i> Letras y Figuras: Contemporary Idioms on Idea and Identity</i></b><i> </i>(Letters and Figures) at the Ayala Museum, which was keynoted by the Spanish ambassador and attended by President Arroyo. In 2007, to commemorate the centennial history of press freedom in the Philippines, the National Press Club<b><i> </i></b>commissioned the Neo-Angono Art Collective to paint a mural, <b><i>Sangandaan ng Kasaysayan ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>ng Pamamahayag sa Pilipinas </i></b>(Crossroads of History for Freedom of Expression in the Philippines).<b><i> </i></b>Ironically, the mural<b><i> </i></b>was subsequently altered by the commissioning party without the consent of the Neo-Angono Art Collective, thereby changing the meaning and tone of the artwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Possibly the most prominent case thus far that spurred public focus on proposed limits to artist&rsquo;s expressive leverage is the 2011 case laid against artist Mideo Cruz&rsquo;s work, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2273\"><strong>Poleteismo</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Polytheism),<b> </b>shown in the <b><i>Kulo</i></b> (Boil) group exhibition of University of Santo Tomas Fine Arts alumni at the CCP Main Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first public critique of <b><i>Poleteismo</i></b> circulated through the criminal investigation show <b><i>XXX</i></b> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> on 18 Jul 2011. The work was framed within the issue of the Reproductive Health Bill, focusing on the artist&rsquo;s usage of condoms and phallic objects as elements in the installation. This was followed by numerous articles in mass media as well as innumerable posts and comments that went viral through the social media. After weeks of media coverage, the Cultural Center of the Philippines hosted a public forum titled &ldquo;Dakdakan&rdquo; on 5 Aug 2011 wherein contending parties confronted each other. The CCP Board of Trustees decided to close the exhibition on 8 Aug 2011 and announced this to the public the next day. This was followed by a senatorial inquiry on 16 Aug 2011, which ended with the decision to wait for the findings of the Office of the Ombudsman on the administrative and criminal cases filed. Among these was Manuel Dayrit&rsquo;s administrative complaint against CCP Board of Trustees members Emily Abrera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a>, Florangel Rosario-Braid,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2667\"><strong>Jaime Laya</strong></a></strong>, Isabel Caro Wilson, Zenaida Tantoco, Maria Cristina Turalba, Antonio Yap, Carolyn Espiritu, and CCP Visual Arts and Museum Division head Karen Ocampo Flores for violation of sections of Republic Act 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standard for Public Officials and Employees), while Eusebio Dulatas Jr charged Abrera and Sunico for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a public officer or employee.Dayrit and Dulatas also filed separate criminal complaints for violation of paragraph 2(b), Article 201 (Immoral Doctrines, Obscene Publications and Exhibitions, and Indecent Shows) of the Revised Penal Code against Cruz and the previously mentioned CCP officials. Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales later dismissed the administrative and criminal cases in a 34-page joint resolution and a 30-page joint decision, both signed on 28 Feb 2013. The Office of the Ombudsman ruled that the showing of <b><i>Poleteismo </i></b>does not constitute an obscene act and that the censoring of the artwork effectively accomplished by calls for the early closure of the group exhibition constituted prior restraint as prohibited by the Philippine Constitution. The aborted showing precipitated by an arson attempt supposedly targeting the gallery prejudiced not only Cruz but also his fellow artists from publicly circulating their work under terms and within the duration agreed upon previously with the CCP. <em><strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>Written byJaime M.

In the history of art-making in the Philippines, artists have engaged the public on how to understand the meaning of art in society. Artists groups, organizations, and institutions initiate projects that address political, social, economic, cultural, and ecological concerns in the Philippines. These art initiatives inform us on the creative ways in which art performs a transformative role in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"organizations\" name=\"organizations\"></a>Organizations and Collectives</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Organizations among visual artists have been formed to establish and maintain unity and harmonious working relationships between artists and to advocate for the welfare of artists and the development and upgrading of their art. In contemporary art practice, artists would also form collectives as a way to create collaborative work that explores issues in art expression, human rights, political freedom, environmental concerns, and community engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest-known organization devoted to artistic activities was the Sociedad de Artes y Oficios founded in Manila in May 1869. Intended to promote awareness in the arts and crafts, it also conducted workshops on drawing, engraving, carving, modeling, metal casting, and jewelry smithing. The trades taught included agriculture and dentistry. There were also classes on declamation and vocal and instrumental music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Nov 1877, the Liceo Cientifico Artistico Literario was founded. It is particularly remembered because JoseRizal won an award in one of its contests. The <i>liceo</i> (school) held its inaugural program on 23 Feb 1878 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> de Variedades, during which the painter Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo played the violin. On 29 Nov 1879, the liceo sponsored a literary, musical, and artistic competition in which Rizal won first prize for his poem &ldquo;AlaJuventudFilipina&rdquo; (To the Filipino Youth), and JuanLuna received a silver palette for <b><i>Daphnis y Chloe </i></b>(Daphne and Chloe). The provinces, following the trend in Manila, also founded artistic clubs. In Iloilo, for example, the Sociedad Artistico Literario de Iloilo was founded on 25 Oct 1893.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Sociedad de Escultores de Santa Cruz, on the other hand, was the only organization comprised exclusively of sculptors. Founded in 1880, it had as members all the prestigious sculptors at the turn of the century. These included EugenioLlerena, Ambrosio Garcia, Juan Toribio, MarianoSiauinco, MarceloNepomuceno, Aproniano Santos, Marcelo de la Rosa, Juan Flame&ntilde;o, Cayetano Castillo, IsabeloTampinco, and EulogioGarcia y Velarde. Founder and first president of the society was RomualdoTeodorodeJesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new American regime&rsquo;s emphasis on education and the opportunities it opens led to the sprouting of clubs and organizations, many understandably devoted to art. The earliest art society founded in the American period was the Centro de Artistas established on 11 Feb 1904. This organization included painters, sculptors, musicians, and writers. While it sponsored literary-musical programs, it also served as a school. The Board of Directors was composed of painter-sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3561\"><strong>Eulogio Garcia</strong></a> Velarde, president; engraver Fernando Zamora, vice-president; painter Cecilio Gloria, treasurer; and sculptor Juan Flame&ntilde;o, vice-secretary. Since it offered courses on the various arts, heads were assigned for every department. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\"><strong>Isabelo Tampinco</strong></a> served as head for architecture; Manuel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, sculpture; Ciriaco Gaudinez, silversmith; ToribioAntillon, painting; and Isidoro Roxas, music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1908 the prestigious Asociacion Internacional de Artistas de Manila was founded. Perhaps the artists attached the term &ldquo;internacional&rdquo; to their group&rsquo;s name because the founding members of this society, like RafaelEnriquez, MiguelZaragoza, and JoseMariaAsuncion, were medalists of prestigious salon competitions abroad. There were also Spanish immigrants in the group like Armando Camps, Luis Viejo y Morena, and Augusto Fuster. The Asociacion Internacional was responsible for lobbying the inclusion of a college of fine arts as a unit in the University of the Philippines (UP) founded in 1908. The School of Fine Arts formally opened in 1909. Toward the end of the second semester of that year, the UP Fine Arts Society was founded. It was the most active artistic club in the country until the founding of the ArtAssociationofthe Philippines(AAP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Founded on 15 Feb 1948, the AAP, on the initiative of Purita<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w-Ledesma, an alumna of the UP School of Fine Arts, was originally conceived as an alumni association of the school. Its inaugural meeting was held at the Padre Faura building that now houses the Supreme Court. There were 13 charter members: Kalaw-Ledesma, DiosdadoLorenzo, AntonioDumlao, RamonPeralta Jr, Nemesio Faustino, Severino Fabie, Virginia Flor Agbayani, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3488\"><strong>Emilio </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r Cruz</strong>, Candido Alcantara, Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\"><strong>Francesco Monti</strong></a>, Alfredo Pesta&ntilde;o, and Fermin Sanchez. Kalaw-Ledesma was elected president and Peralta secretary; later, with growing membership, Agbayani was elected treasurer. Its first office was in a room at the National Museum made available by museum director Eduardo Quisumbing. The founding members decided upon an emblem in the form of an oval and a sprig of bamboo designed by Dumlao. Its constitution was patterned after the Artists&rsquo; Equity, an American organization, with the help of a visiting American artist Lily Harmon. Membership was open to painters, sculptors, graphic artists, art collectors, art patrons, and art lovers; they were classified as regular, honorary, patron, and associate. Its first public activity was a retrospective exhibit of the works of FabiandelaRosa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AAP offered incentives to artists and sought to raise artistic standards. Its goals were accomplished primarily through annual art competitions. The members of the newly organized AAP paid a courtesy call on Pres Elpidio Quirino who consented to inaugurate the exhibition. The first AAP national art exhibition, held at the National Museum on 3 Jul 1948, gave the first prize to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a> Francisco. Other prizewinners were Lorenzo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\"><strong>Demetrio Diego</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>, and Hernando R. Ocampo aka H.R. Ocampo. The panel of judges consisted of Aguilar Cruz, Monti, Edades, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>. From 1948 to 1950 the competitions were in painting; it was in the fourth annual exhibition in 1951 that sculpture entered the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Due to increasing tension between the moderns and conservatives, two categories, the conservative and the modern, were instituted in 1949. However, the struggle between the two camps came to a head in the 1955 annual competition held at the Northern Motors Showroom. That year the competition coincided with the Rotary Golden Anniversary Awards, which offered a substantial prize and was the bone of contention between the two groups. In the Rotary Golden Anniversary Awards, the first prize was won by GaloB.Ocampo, the second prize by ManuelRodriguez Jr aka Boy Rodriguez, and the third prize by Manansala. In the AAP annual competition, the first prize in the conservative category went to ArturoLuz, a modernist, while the winner in sculpture was JoseP.Alcantara. The conservative camp believed that the panel of judges was biased against them and staged the historic walkout from the AAP exhibit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The founding of the AAP was followed by the opening of the PhilippineArtGallery (PAG). PAG was not only a gallery; it was also one of the first modern art institutions in the country. It became a full-fledged gallery on 30 May 1951, but its beginnings may be traced to the latter part of 1950, when a group of 11 women writers decided to organize a promotions and advertising outfit. This was first called Promotions Incorporated, and the women incorporators, headed by LydiaVillanueva-Arguilla, writer and widow of the short story writer ManuelArguilla, were Flora Lansang, TrinidadTarrosa-Subido, Consuelo Abaya, and EstrellaAlfon. RomeoV.Tabuena was hired as staff artist to do the layout and design. The first office was on the third floor of the Palomo Building on O&rsquo;Donnell corner Azcarraga (now <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5627\"><strong>Claro M. Recto</strong></a> St) in front of Aranque Market. Artist friends, like H.R. Ocampo, often paid visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The idea of a commercial art gallery began three months later when Arguilla began hanging paintings on the walls. These began to attract attention at a time when public art awareness had been enhanced by the founding of the AAP and the ongoing debates between the conservatives and the modernists. The wall on which the paintings were hung became known as the &ldquo;Feature Wall&rdquo; because it intended to present artists in a kind of one-person show. Tabuena was the first to be featured because he had enough paintings to show. Other artists who held one-person shows were Luz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a>, H.R. Ocampo, and Arguilla herself. Later, artists were invited to participate in group exhibits. Since it was a commercial gallery, it got a 30 percent commission from the sale of the works, prices of which ranged from 50 to 400 pesos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After six months at the Palomo Building, the outfit moved to the second floor of the second house from the corner of Taft and Herran Streets between the Brown Derby and the Agoncillo Building where the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization held office. It was in this new location that Promotions Incorporated gave way to PAG, with Promotions functioning to promote PAG in the press. With the growing interest in Philippine art, it attracted not only artists but also writers, professors, poets, students, and other cultural personalities including cultural attach&eacute;s of foreign embassies. PAG evolved into a busy art center with lecture forums, classes in art and music appreciation, flower arrangement and drawing from life, as well as lessons in Tagalog, Spanish, and French. To augment its income, the gallery printed Christmas cards designed by artists such as Manansala, Luz, Tabuena, NenaSaguil, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>taMagsaysay-Ho, and CenonRivera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first art collectors, such as Leandro V.Locsin, had PAG as their source. Among its commercial strategies was installment buying. It also held a monthly Premium Sale, which drew collectors and art lovers. The first was held on 2 Mar 1952. With a ticket priced at 5 or 10 pesos at most, one could win a painting by H.R. Ocampo, Legaspi, or Tabuena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a year, PAG transferred again due to a hike in rent which it could not meet. This time it moved to Room 201 of the nearby Petrona <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>Apartment</strong></a>s on 560 Taft Ave facing the Philippine General Hospital, at the invitation of CarmenGuerrero-Nakpil whose family owned the place. It was there that PAG celebrated its first anniversary with a big monthlong exhibition of paintings, photographs, and architectural designs, all of which occupied three floors of the building. After its second anniversary in the same location, PAG, through Arguilla&rsquo;s efforts was able to put up a Philippine exhibit in the United States, where she stayed for a year. In her absence, PAG was managed by Cora Valencia and Arguilla&rsquo;s half-brother, Peping Reyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 22 Nov 1952, the Philippine Art Gallery Association was formed to firm up the finances of the gallery. Its officers were Saguil, H.R. Ocampo, Arguilla, and Mario Guerrero. Its members included Lorenzo, Manansala, Luz, Legaspi, Dumlao, Magsaysay-Ho, Joan Edades, FernandoZobel, VictorOteyza, Teddy Abueva, Nap Jamir, RamonEstella, Max Lalata, JoseJoya, AmeliaLape&ntilde;a, VirginiaMoreno, ManuelRodriguezSr, Helen Roces Guerrero, JoseMaceda, AlbertoFlorentino, and a number of foreigners. An Apache Ball was held in 1953 to raise funds for the association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">PAG stayed at Petrona for more than a year. Due to financial constraints, it had to move to the Antonio Apartments at No. 4 Arquiza, off Mabini St in 1953. When Arguilla came back from the United States in Aug 1954, she recapitalized and renovated the gallery with the help of Joya and VictorioEdades who held a one-man show after its renovation. In 1954 a new set of officers were elected: Edades, president; H.R. Ocampo, vice-president; Arguilla, treasurer; and Oteyza and Jamir, directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In December 1955, Arguilla left again to join <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tion Brotherhood in Laos where she met Pierre Salas, a film scriptwriter, whom she married. When she came back she paid all the back rentals, and a branch of the PAG was opened at 16 New York St, which was owned by her family. In 1957 there was another election of officers with Arguilla as president; Zobel, vice-president and secretary/treasurer; H.R. Ocampo, director-at-large; and JesusAyco, manager. In 1958 another branch was opened at No. 3 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s St in Cubao jointly owned by Arguilla and her sister Remedios. It featured a studio-theater-gallery designed by RodrigoPerezIII. The Arquiza gallery was maintained but the New York branch was closed. At its inauguration, the gallery featured paintings of Rivera on the theme of the dance, while dances choreographed by Benny Villanueva, half-brother of Lydia, were performed by his students. Invited guests were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han dancers under LucreciaReyes-Urtula and LucreciaR.Kasilag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite publicity campaigns, PAG on Williams St did not prosper and was closed down but the Arquiza branch was maintained up to the late 1960s. In 1968, Arguilla left for Geneva to join the Philippine Embassy as cultural attach&eacute;. It was there that she discovered she was ill with cancer. It was during this time that the Arquiza branch was closed and its belongings transferred to the house on Williams St, which many years later would be bought by Mario Alcantara who put up the Heritage Art Center. This burned down in 1989 and was relocated to Blue Ridge Subdivision in Quezon City. The existence of the PAG was coterminous with Arguilla, who died on 20 Dec 1969 (Kalaw-Ledesma 1987).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other art organizations, most of them Manila-based, are Sining Bugkos, founded in the early 1980s, which is a regional alliance of cultural formations from urban communities, workers unions, and students from the National Capital Region (NCR); the Artista ng Bayan, founded in 1985 by JoseTence-Ruiz, Edgar Talusan Fernandez, FedericoSievert, Lito Mondejar, and Cap Reyes, among others, which aims to serve the community through art; Kabataang Tondo Art Group, founded by FernandoSena, which conducts workshops for children in depressed areas such as Tondo; Christian Art Society of the Philippines; the Philippine Association of Printmakers, founded in 1962 by ManuelRodriguezJr; the Philippine Art Educators Association, established in 1968 by AraceliDans and BrendaFajardo, which aims to promote art education in the community by developing the students&rsquo; creativity and aesthetic sensitivity; Society of Philippine Sculptors, established in 1968 by VirginiaTy-Navarro and NapoleonAbueva, which sets a direction toward the upliftment of sculpture through interactions and initiation of new activities that address present concerns of the field; Samahang Kartunista ng Pilipinas, organized on 28 Feb 1978 by Lauro Alcala, Eduardo Aragon, Tito Milambiling, Renato Santiago, Edgardo Soller, Generoso Cabrera, Romeo Togonon, Hugo Yonzon Jr, and Paulino Galvez, which aims to work for the improvement of Filipino cartoonists and their profession. Other artists groups include the Saturday Group which meets every Saturday to sketch or paint together; the Dimasalang group, composed of landscape painters who are concerned with the effects of the Philippine sunlight, reviving a search initiated by FernandoAmorsolo; Artists&rsquo; Circle Fraternity and Sorority and Lingkod Sining, both from UP; and ANG, a group composed of graduates of the Philippine High School for the Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the heightened awareness of the crucial role of art in society, artist organizations and collectives were created to address various issues plaguing Philippine society. Nagkakaisang Progresibong Artista at Arkitekto, a propaganda movement composed of &ldquo;committed artists,&rdquo; emerged in the 1970s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\"><strong>Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP)</strong></a>, spearheaded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\"><strong>Behn Cervantes</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\"><strong>Jose F. Lacaba</strong></a>, and NicanorG.Tiongson, was founded in 1984 to help unite Filipino artists against the Marcos dictatorship. CAP is an organization of writers, artists, and cultural workers committed to the principles of freedom, justice, and democracy. Kababaihan sa Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan, founded in 1987, was composed of women artists advocating for awareness of gender issues in society. Salingpusa, active 1985-92, was founded by UP students whose primary goal is to make art more available to the public. Members of the Salingpusa, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3452\"><strong>Elmer Borlongan</strong></a>, Manny Garibay, Tony Lea&ntilde;o, Ferdie Montemayor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3547\"><strong>Karen Flores</strong></a>, among others, would eventually form <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3761\"><strong>Sanggawa</strong></a>, active 1994-2000, an artist collective specializing in large-scale work and murals. UGATLahi Artist Collective, founded in 1992, used art as means of protest in street rallies, creating murals and effigies. Later in 2005, TutoK was formed with Flores, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3743\"><strong>Iggy Rodriguez</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\"><strong>Mideo Cruz</strong></a> as core members, with the goal to commit art productions to the cause of human rights and freedom of expression. Youth- or student-based organizations are exemplified by Kabataang Artista para sa Tunay na Kalayaan, active ca 1990-2000, which had chapters in different universities, colleges, and communities in and out of NCR, with the goal of creating art for social change, genuine freedom, and national democracy. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

Artists from the north have drawn inspiration from the mountainous scenery and indigenous traditional cultures of the Cordilleras. Baguio and Sagada are home to many artists, at the same time that these places have attracted many from the lowlands to stay or at least to participate in communal art activities. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a> has drawn artists such as SantiagoBose and RobertoVillanueva. Bose has consistently worked in indigenous materials and used precolonial symbols. Villanueva is known for his open-air reed labyrinth archetype<b><i> </i></b>or <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong>Uma ti Biag</strong></a></strong> </i> </b>(Kankanaey for &ldquo;Garden of Life&rdquo;) on the grounds of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) in 1989. AsterTecson, who used ethnic themes of political dimension, was also based in Sagada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painter/printmaker BenedictoCabrera aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a> has also found Baguio congenial to his art. Some young artists associated with UP Baguio and led by Damay Demetillo at one time grouped under the name Taong Bundok and held a number of exhibits. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a> and Jordan Mang-osan devised a color-sculptural technique wherein wood is carved with the intense heat reflected from the sun&rsquo;s rays by a magnifying glass. The trend in indigenous materials and themes spearheaded by Villanueva and Bose is strong among the northern artists. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of them, Cordillera-born Jordan Mang-osan, has developed an original form of solar painting. These are figure etchings in wood executed by the intense heat from the sun&rsquo;s rays finely directed on the wooden surface by a magnifying glass. Aside from Baguio artists and residents, Manila artists working in indigenous materials have also participated in the Baguio art festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lakeshore town of Angono, Rizal, has produced a rich crop of artists. In the 1960s, the art of National Artist CarlosV.Francisco called attention to his native town of Angono where he chose to live and work. Best known for his historical murals, folk genre, and mythological paintings, he inspired generations of artists in his hometown, such as  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3451\"><strong>Jose Blanco</strong></a></strong>, Perdigon Vocalan,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Salvador Juban</strong></a></strong>, and Nemesio Miranda Jr aka Nemiranda, who, together with Dominador Tiamson and other artists, founded in 1975 the Angono Ateliers Association. The artists later split into two groups: those who stayed with the Angono Ateliers and those who formed the Angono Artists Association. A number of young artists have founded the junior ateliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taytay, a town adjacent to Angono, also has its share of artists. They have organized into the Group Artists of Taytay and had a big exhibit in Sep-Oct 1991 at the Galleria Manuela in Mandaluyong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tanay artists have also formed their own organization based in the studio of senior artist Martin Catolos who has a studio-workshop in Tanay; here young painters hone their skills in oil and watercolor under his tutelage and find a venue to exhibit their works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paete in Laguna is another art center in the Southern Tagalog region. In fact, its name is derived from <i>paet</i>, the chisel for wood carving, which was the principal town occupation even before the coming of the Spaniards. An old Paete master is JoseDans, whose large painting depicting heaven, earth, and hell, graces a wall of the town church. The master wood-carver or <b>santero</b><i> </i>is exemplified by MarianoMadri&ntilde;an whose <b><i>Mater Dolorosa</i></b> (Sorrowful Mother) was exhibited in the Amsterdam International Exposition of 1883. So acclaimed were the Paete carvers that from 1876 to 1878 a number of them were employed to carve religious images for churches in Spain. Since the Spanish period, carving has been a communal activity structured around the family as guild, thus generations of families active to the present are the Madri&ntilde;an, Caancan, Dans, Acupan, Adao, Caday, Palatino, Kadarnigara, Cagandahan, and Ac-ac. The contemporary carvers work in the manner of cooperatives such as in the groups called Likas Paete and Lilok Paete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lakan Sining ng Bulacan is a group that includes artists whose ancestral roots are in Bulacan, such as Joya, Al Perez, RoyVeneracion, and FlorencioConcepcion. AroSoriano also hails from Bulacan and does community workshops in painted terra-cotta figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Pampanga, the towns of Angeles and San Fernando are sites of artistic activity. The commercial galleries in these towns were largely oriented to American patrons during the time when Clark Air Base was still in operation. In the 19th century, the portraitist SimonFlores y de la Rosa settled in Betis, Pampanga, where his paintings adorn the town church. During the American colonial period and the postwar years, a Pampango maestro was VicenteAlvarezDizon who taught at the UP School of Fine Arts. A number of his descendants are active in the local art scene. The watercolorist ClaudeTayag hails from Angeles, Pampanga. The Pampanga Arts Guild, based in Angeles City, was formed in the 1980s by a group of artists to conduct art workshops, exhibits, competitions, and exchange of ideas among artists in Central Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Visayas, Cebu has produced a large number of visual artists from the 19th century to the present. Cebu City and other towns, such as Carcar and Argao in the south, and Bogo and Bantayan in the north are known for their long artistic traditions. Old Cebuano masters include CanutoAvila of San Nicolas, Raymundo Francia of Parian, and Diosdado Desamparado Villadolid of Bantayan. An important Cebuano family of artists includes the patriarch Jose Trinidad Alcoseba of Carcar and his grandson Tony Alcoseba. A well-loved Cebuano maestro of portraits and landscapes was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\"><strong>Martino Abellana</strong></a>, also an art teacher to an entire generation of artists. Another teacher-artist, as well as lepidopterist, is Julian Jumalon. In 1937, Jumalon, along with Oscar Figuracion, Ricardo Avila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3406\"><strong>Fidel Araneta</strong></a>, Silvestre Orfelia, Emilio Olmos, and Jose Trinidad Alcoseba formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3470\"><strong>Cebu Arts Association</strong></a>, considered the oldest still-active organization for artists in the Philippines. The group promoted the visual arts in Cebu and became a venue for the exchange of ideas among artists. Other senior artists are Carmelo S. Tamayo of UP Cebu and Virgilio Daclan, who is active in art circles. Leading second-generation Cebuano artists are the Mendoza brothers (Sofronio aka SYM, Teofilo, and Godofredo), RomuloGalicano, and GamalielSubang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists of Bacolod are among the most militant and the most organized. In 1983, when the late film director Brocka went to Bacolod during a human rights rally, the Pamilya Pintura and some other artists formed the CAP, Bacolod chapter, which spearheaded the mass movement in Bacolod. In 1986 two groups were formed: the Black Artists of Asia and the Dibuhista Gahiliugyon sa Negros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most dynamic Bacolod groups is the Black Artists of Asia (BAA), the adjective &ldquo;black&rdquo; referring to Negros island. Its core members, also the Pamilya Pintura core, were NorbertoRoldan, CharlieCo, NunelucioAlvarado, and Dennis Ascalon. BAA included cultural workers mostly in the visual arts and some in theater, such as Milton Dionson. For exhibit venue, it opened BAA gallery in Bacolod and BAA atelier under one roof. Aside from paintings, it has a strong craft orientation as it developed alternative art products, such as handmade paper, terra-cotta sculpture, postcards, glass etchings stone art, and printed T-shirts. Its objective was to produce works of social relevance linked to the issues in Negros. In 1986 the BAA was invited to Japan to hold an exhibition in an artist exchange program. This was followed by exhibits in Amsterdam and Sydney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Efforts to organize Visayan artists include the Visayan Islands Visual Arts Exchange Conference or VIVA ExCon, a biannual affair supported by the CCP. In Feb 1990 it aimed to formulate Visayan aesthetics from the different islands. A leading Iloilo group is the Hubon Madia-as, with the Visual Arts Committee of the Arts Council as umbrella organization. Among its leading artists are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3516\"><strong>Edward Defensor</strong></a>, visual and theater artist, and Nelson Ferraris. Gaudelia Doromal from UP Iloilo has also been active in the organization of the Arts Council, with the help of CCP, which holds the yearly Hublag Festival wherein artists from the Visayas and all over the country are invited to hold exhibits and performances in Iloilo City. Another Iloilo group is Pugaran, which stresses interaction with the community. Iloilo artists place importance on the use of indigenous materials and are highly innovative in their approach to art-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Davao City has also been a lively center of artistic activity in the visual arts and literature. Art Association Davao, a leading member of which was AngKiukok, featured the visual artists and creative writers active in this southern city; notable is the group&rsquo;s Road Map<b><i> </i></b>series, each composed of a single sheet of paper folded like a map into pages of text or pictures. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>, &ldquo;Father of Modern Art in the Philippines,&rdquo; settled in Davao City after the war and continued to paint there. Jose V. Ayala has done abstracts with a surrealist flavor and has had one-person shows in Manila. Working in different media, RubendeVera specializes in bird images and indigenous/ethnic subjects and has done powerful pen-and-ink drawings on social issues. George So does watercolors, acrylics, and pen-and-ink drawings, often realistic but at times in a surrealistic vein. Norberto Monterona from Iligan does portraits and genre paintings, using local textile paint applied to chipboards with bamboo sticks. Victor Secuya does drawings in an ink-blot style. Davao also has an outstanding crop of women painters, among them TitaLacambra-Ayala and LydiaRiveraIngle. The Talaandig artists, composed of the indigenous community in Bukidnon and led by Rodelio Linsahay Saway aka Waway, explored soil painting to depict the worldview of their people. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G. Guillermo and Santiago A. Pilar, with notes from Cecilia S. De La Paz</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"public\" name=\"public\"></a>Public Art Initiatives and Community-Based Projects </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary art practices include a broad spectrum of engagements with communities of varied configurations. Artistic and creative strategies are effective means to shore affect, form communal bonds, and mobilize members of a community, whether long-standing or newly formed, rooted in a place or arising from an event. This development to great degree signals artists&rsquo; greater participation in social issues. As consequence, it also speaks of their active production of a social discourse that interrogates art&rsquo;s role in social life. <b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These practices are called a variety of names: collaborative, relational, participatory, or socially engaged art. While art projects and artistic practices differ, they share several attributes: a focus on collaboration, an emphasis on pedagogy, a loosely formed organization deemphasizing hierarchy, dialogue, and interconnectedness aided both by digital technology and a burgeoning network. While their projects transpire in community contexts, they also enter the exhibitionary circuit where often projects themselves are presented as images and texts through documentation and recordings. This array that best describes this emergent category of artistic practice also places in relief the changing status of artists in relation to the art they make as well as the shift in their associations with their audiences or viewers, or their co-creators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several platforms of engagement can be identified in the Philippine art scene. Most notable are artist groups or artist collectives (individual artists who gather and work on specific projects), art spaces, and of late, online venues or platforms. Many would be housed in physical spaces, several of which would provide a mix of uses. Others use spaces for specific projects and events and, moreover, rely on virtual space for interaction. Some would locate themselves on the ground or sites where their projects happen. The frequency of events also differs; some coincide with local festivals or are held in conjunction with international ones. While these artistic endeavors incorporate aspects of site-specificity, they manifest a marked turn toward interaction and &ldquo;co-production,&rdquo; further destabilizing notions of authorship and the roles of artists in art-making. This is exemplified by the following art spaces and projects: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\"><strong>Shop 6</strong></a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> from the 1970s to the 1980s, which supported mixed media constructions, installations, and site-specific works involving artists espousing guerrilla exhibits in homes, parks, and other venues;  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></a></strong> Galleries</strong>, founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3411\"><strong>Agnes Arellano</strong></a>, which supported interactions between literary and visual arts from 1984 to 1990; Surrounded by Water, founded in 1998 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3805\"><strong>Wire Tuazon</strong></a> to serve as experimental platform for young artists; Big Sky Mind, co-founded by artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3456\"><strong>Ringo Bunoan</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3573\"><strong>Katya Guerrero</strong></a>, which was initially a gallery-caf&eacute; and later became an independent artist-run space from 2001 to 2004; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a>, founded in 2000 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3747\"><strong>Norberto Roldan</strong></a>, Donna Miranda, Manny Chaves, and curator Bobi Valenzuela as a project space envisioning experimentation in art in a noncommercial venture; and Tupada Action and Media Art or TUPADA, founded 2002, composed of young artists interested in performance art in public spaces. Interest in art production involving local communities is exemplified by the Daambakal Sculptor&rsquo;s Collective led by Rey Paz Contreras, which engages environmental issues in the urban context of Tondo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Collaboration in art production does not only encompass work with members of communities but also entails partnerships with other organizations. These often large-scale projects happen over a length of time and are carried out with state agencies or with private support from foundations and funding bodies. A notable characteristic is the capacity to raise funds on their own; an example is 98B&rsquo;s Weekend Market series. A lot of these initiatives would also have artists with thriving individual careers as members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artist initiatives organize events on singular runs or yearly intervals. The Neo-Angono Artist Collective, founded in 2004 in Rizal Province, organizes Neo-Angono Public Art Festival annually. A major element of the festival program is installation pieces and performance art. They can be found in the most unlikely places. A dried out stream bed for artist Wire Tuazon&rsquo;s installation of a house on stilts with cement bags for walls, a replica of a boat stranded atop trees, a building and a belfry, or the altered signage of the local market are some examples. These works, like most others for the festival, all combine social commentary and feed off spontaneity and play, allowing for interesting encounters between art and viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bagasbas Beach Eco Arts Festival in Daet, Camarines Norte, had three runs with installations and site-specific art installed along the beach as well as other sites. It had as participants local and international artists. This model is familiar, found in many points of the globe. However, one contention against so-called community art is the difficulty of making claims for how much art is able to accomplish in terms of enacting change. Much of the interactions that transpire are difficult to gauge, foremost because they are founded on intangible aspects of human interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are projects, however, that focus on direct engagement with communities devastated by tragedies and natural disasters. Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3725\"><strong>Alma Quinto</strong></a>&rsquo;s body of works has long delved into this practice. Her <b><i>House of Comfort</i></b> art project has traveled the archipelago as well as Japan. In the Philippines, Alma has worked with communities recovering from devastation of typhoons, floods, and armed conflict. She designs, organizes, and carries out workshops that enable participants to find their voice and recover their dreams. <b><i>House of Comfort</i></b> is a big house of dreams, patched from many hours of sewing and conversing. The house has been exhibited at various museums in different configurations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a> also organized the Assistance for Crises Bureau with components Artist Teams for Crises and Creative Workshops. Workshops were conducted in the Visayas and Mindanao with plans of them being done all over the country. The program emphasized the role of the creative arts in the recovery of communities that suffered natural calamities and man-made disasters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artist groups (e.g., UGATLahi and TutoK) and spaces (e.g., Project Space Pilipinas and 98B) organize a series of activities on numerous themes focusing on activist projects, mobilizing community members for causes, wherein they become venues for pedagogy, sharing, and forging ties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AXIS Art Project has its roots in Baguio City and its vibrant art scene. Initiated by artist Kawayan de Guia in 2011, AXIS focuses on projects with collective memory and communities at their core. These include events at the 2011 Philippine Art Festival; an exhibition at the MO Gallery in Taguig, Metro Manila in 2012; the Haselma Axis Art Project, 2012; and its subsequent installation at the Singapore Biennale in 2013. They successfully brought together artists and audiences through various activities that utilized different platforms. Venues were diverse yet the creative encounters they fostered shared the qualities of the ephemeral, the itinerant, and mostly employing make-do strategies. AXIS project components are defined by travel and connection, interaction and conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 2011 Ipitik Festival was held alongside Baguio&rsquo;s annual Panagbenga Festival. Activities for this Philippine Arts Festival included a <i>pinikpikan</i> cook-off (a traditional Cordillera dish distinct for having the live chicken beaten with a stick prior to cooking; the bruising brings blood to surface, rendering the meat more flavorful), a 108-gong performance by students, and the film events Cinema Rehiyon and the Asia-Africa Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most notable among the events at the 2011 Philippine Arts Festival were the making and installing of the AXIS Tent at the Rose Garden of Burnham Park and the Transient Studio, co-organized with artist Chris Y&ntilde;iguez, at the Camp John Hay Library. Numerous activities took place inside the tent: wood carving, basket weaving, music, and crafts. People were free to pass through, visit and join the tent activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Transient Studio happened inside and around the perimeters of the run-down Camp John Hay Library. Participating artists made use of the ramshackle space, exhibiting works in what was an unlikely place for what we have come to know as contemporary art. Some utilized materials found on site, crafting installations and site-specific pieces that combined found material, words, performance, and live music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 2012 Haselma AXIS Art Project was inspired by the highway that Dangwa buses plied from Baguio City to the other points in Benguet province. For this, de Guia replicated the bus as a makeshift tent, propped and installed this at numerous stops during a five-day journey with artists traveling from Baguio. A distance of about 120 km was traversed, with artists engaging local communities through site-specific works. Aside from the tents, De Guia constructed a &ldquo;snowman&rdquo; from chicken dung on the highway&rsquo;s highest peak, where tourists typically take photos. This was not only a commentary on the consumption of place but also an observation of the rapid degradation of the environment through harmful farming methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Haselma AXIS Art Project also sought to collect objects along the Haselma Highway, reminiscent of artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3405\"><strong>Rene Aquitania</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Lakaran</i></b><i> </i>project of 1986. Aquitania hauled a vegetable cart from Manila to Baguio, picking and collecting objects along his path. These acts of itinerant collecting, however random and happening during different decades, are about piecing together collective memory and remembering place in a context frayed by conflict and challenged by hardships. AXIS firmly relocates not only the city of Baguio from de Guia&rsquo;s memory but also counts upon art to redefine its relevance in contemporary life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1995, the NCCA, through the National Committee on Visual Arts headed by Brenda V. Fajardo, came up with the Visual Art Congress and eventually gave birth to Sungdu-an, an exhibit platform participated in by visual artists from NCR, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Coined by the curator Roberto &ldquo;Bobi&rdquo; Valenzuela,<i> sungdu-an</i> is a Waray term for &ldquo;confluence.&rdquo; The <b><i>1st Sungdu-an: Pagtatagpo</i></b> (Meeting) was held in 1996, using some of the rooms at the third floor of the NCCA Building. A room was assigned for each region, and it featured <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> works by artists representing Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The second Sungdu-an was called <b><i>Sambayan: Philippine Art and Culture Festival</i></b><i> </i>(One Nation: Philippine Art and Culture Festival), curated by Corazon Alvina and by regional curators when the exhibit traveled in various provinces in 2000. Forty works were featured, with each curator selecting 10 works that he/she felt represented his/her own interpretation of Sambayan&rsquo;s general theme. The venues range from provincial museums and universities to plazas. The <b><i>3rd Sungdu-an: Making the Local</i></b>, 2002-4, included a research component and six art projects initiated by curators who actually came from the regions. Rather than individual artists, artist groups and collaborations were prioritized, celebrating local art and empowering the local artists and organizations. The <b><i>4th Sungdu-an: ExTensions</i></b> in 2007 was a scaled-down version of the second and third because of budget constraints. Held in Capitol University in Cagayan de Oro, it was organized by the members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\"><strong>Printmaking</strong></a> Association of the Philippines. In 2009, <b><i>Sungdu-an 5: Current: Daloy ng Dunong</i></b> (Current: Flow of Knowledge)<b><i> </i></b>explored the current, the present, the &ldquo;now&rdquo;; and the transfer of knowledge and wisdom. Patrick D. Flores, the project director, focused on honing the curatorial skills of the artists aside from exploring themes beyond representation. Held at the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong>, the curatorial roster included Dennis Ascalon for Visayas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3607\"><strong>Irma Lacorte</strong></a> for Luzon, Cris Rollo for Mindanao, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3728\"><strong>Claro Ramirez</strong></a> for NCR. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byTessa Maria Guazon, with notes from Cecilia S.
