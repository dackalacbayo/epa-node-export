		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pacita Abad&nbsp;</b>(<b>Pacita Barsana Abad</b>)<b>&nbsp;</b>was a painter and printmaker. She was born in&nbsp;Batanes on 5 Oct 1946. She died in Singapore on 7 Dec 2004. She was the daughter of Jorge Abad and Aurora Barsana. She was married to Jack Garrity. She received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1968 from the University of the Philippines and her master&rsquo;s degree in 1972 from the University of San Francisco. She attended the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, DC, 1975-77, and studied at the Art Students League of New York in 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Abad did <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">prints</a>, her principal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">medium</a> was <b>trapunto</b>, the art of joining together and quilting pieces of plain or printed cloth with an embossed design produced by outlining the pattern with single stitches and then padding this with yarn or cotton. The artist enhanced the figurative designs with rickracks, ribbons, and buttons. She created from this process large wall hangings of a joyous warmth and vivacity. Her art reflected her many travels; Ramayana figures mingled with Dicka African chiefs and Papuan goddesses, which entered in colorful procession. Abad is known for her literally and metaphorically layered visual treatises on the global motility of Filipinos and other diasporic peoples. Her influence is also manifested in the sharing of her technical processes done through art school extension programs in the Philippines during respites from her many travels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abad created more than 4,500 artworks from 1974 to 2004. She held over 60 solo exhibitions at museums and galleries in Asia, the United States of America, Europe, Africa, and Latin America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She exhibited abroad in the following sites: Dhanmondhi Studio, Dhaka, Bangladesh, 1978; New England Center for Contemporary Art, Connecticut, 1980; Boston University Art Gallery, Massachusetts, 1981; and Hong Kong Art Center.

She was artist in residence at Altos de Chavon, Dominican Republic, in 1982. She also participated in more than 70 group and traveling exhibitions around the world. In 2003, her <b><i>Circles in My Mind</i></b> was exhibited at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute and her <b><i>Endless Blues</i></b> in Siuntio, Finland, and Hadeland, Norway. In 2000, she launched a <b><i>Wayang Dinnerware Collection</i></b> in Jakarta, Indonesia. Also in 2003, she opened her <b><i><strong>Bati</strong>k Dinnerware Collection</i></b> in Jakarta. In 2004, she had several exhibitions of <b><i>Circles in My Mind </i></b>at the Genome Institute of Singapore, CCP, and Andrew Shire Gallery, Los Angeles, California. In 2005, the School of Economics of Singapore Management University organized a posthumous tribute for her, <b><i>A Special <strong>Tribu</strong>te to </i></b><i><strong>Pacita Abad</strong></i><b><i>: A Philippine-American Artist</i></b>. In 2006, an exhibition, <b><i>Pacita: Through the Looking Glass</i></b>,<i> </i>was held in Esplanade-Theatres on the Bay, Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her Philippine awards and citations include the Ten Outstanding Young Men Award, 1984; the Likha Award as part of the celebration of the centennial of Philippine independence, 1998; and the Pamana ng Pilipino Award from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>, 2000.

This was also the year that the Pacita Abad Art Estate, a nonprofit private organization, was established in Singapore to preserve all materials related to the artist&rsquo;s career. It produced two films: <b><i>Groovy</i></b>, on Abad&rsquo;s artistic career, and <b><i>Pacita&rsquo;s Painted Bridge</i></b>, on her painting of the Alkaff Bridge, a 55 m long bridge that spans Singapore River at Robertson Quay.

He was born in&nbsp;Carcar, Cebu on 30 Jan 1914. He died in&nbsp;1988. His parents were Teofilo Abellana and Filomena La Orden Alcoseba. His grandfather, Saloy Abellana, was an apprentice to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> in Manila; his father Teofilo, a school principal, worked as sculptor in Carcar; his elder brother Sindulfo was also a sculptor who worked on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> for the rotunda in Carcar while another elder brother, Ramon, a dentist, was also a sculptor and musician. His nephews <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3554\">Romulo Galicano</a> and Gabriel Abellana are also painters. Abellana was married to Natividad Castillo Noel. He finished his formal art education in 1938 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a>, where among his peers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3768\">Simon Saulog</a>. He subsequently taught freehand drawing and rendering to architecture students at Cebu Institute of Technology. Later he became the head of the fine arts program of UP in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An admirer of classical music, Abellana believed that music cannot be separated from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>. He described his artistic process as &ldquo;expressive of creative purpose, like the unfolding of an intimate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\">concerto</a>&rdquo; (Maceda 2015). Using the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">mediums</a> of oil, pastel, charcoal, and watercolor in his body of works, his influence lay primarily in portraiture employing realism and impressionism on landscapes inspired by the coastal environs of Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Working in the artistic environment of the debate between academic and modern art, Abellana was concerned with the reconciliation of the figurative and abstract modes. At the 1952 second watercolor exhibition of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</a>, Abellana won first prize in the conservative category for <b><i>The Farmer&rsquo;s Son</i></b>. The following year, another entry, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2208\"><strong><i>Job Was Also Ma</i></strong><b><i>n</i></b></a>, again grouped with the conservatives, won first prize at the semiannual exhibition of the AAP, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a> won first prize in the modern category. In 1958, he won a special award for <strong><i>Rocks</i></strong> at the 11th AAP annual exhibition. Up to the 1980s, Abellana continued to head group shows of Cebuano artists in Cebu and Manila. Known as the &ldquo;Dean of Cebuano Painters,&rdquo; Abellana was mentor to an entire generation of Cebuano artists. Among his students were Romulo Galicano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3663\">Sofronio Y. Mendoza</a> aka SYM, Jose Kimsoy Yap Jr, Mariano Vidal, Cecilio Pepito, Adeste Deguilmo, Sonia Yrastorza, and Titing Baguio, all well-known Cebuano artists. Abellana&rsquo;s mentorship to Cebuano artists helped bolster the art scene in Cebu City and the Visayas region. A retrospective exhibit, <b><i>Ang Kalibutan sa mga Mata ni <strong><strong> <strong>Martino Abellana</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> (<b><i>The World through the Eyes of Martino Abellana</i></b>), was held on 29 Jan to 28 Feb 2015 at the North Wing Atrium of SM City Cebu. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

She married Generoso Abes with whom she had two children. She graduated with a bachelor of fine arts degree from the College of the Holy Spirit. Later, she pursued fine arts studies at Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, Spain, and master of arts in psychology at Ateneo de Manila University. She authored the curriculum on industrial design at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3717\">Philippine Women&rsquo;s University College of Fine Arts</a> where she was dean from 1979 to 1987.

Some of these were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a> using macrame techniques and which recalled forest canopies. Others were tapestries or hangings incorporating decorative weaving techniques in such a way that they alluded to landscapes with birds flying about. Colors and tones were used to create contrasts, and the woven fibers ranged from heavy and irregular to the smooth and silky. Her work amply demonstrated the artistic potential of indigenous plants and grasses in decorative textiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abes was commended for her unique industrial designs here and abroad. She won Best Product Design awards for <b><i>Stars</i></b>, 1989, and <b><i>Marie Claire</i></b>, 1991, in Paris; and for <b><i>Katha</i></b> (Fiction) in Manila, 1990. In the constant quest to explore textile as form and the pushing of the boundaries of her craft, Abes shifted her creative process from designing tapestries to the reworking of ecclesiastical garment motifs (Ramirez 2015). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Annaliza B.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span class=\"Runrighthead\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Manix Abrera</span><b>&nbsp;</b>(<b>Manuel Luis Lorenzo Abrera</b>) is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">comic book</a> artist and cartoonist. He was born in&nbsp;Pasay City on 8 Feb 1982.&nbsp;He is the son of cartoonist Jess Abrera (Jesus Pabico Abrera Jr) and Ma. Bernadette Gregorio Lorenzo. Abrera graduated from the University of the Philippines under the bachelor of fine arts (visual communication) program in 2003, which gave him the Best Undergraduate Thesis award. He went on to take graduate studies in the same institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abrera was a cartoonist for the <b><i>Philippine</i></b> <b><i>Collegian</i></b> or <b><i>Kule</i></b> during his undergraduate years. He developed his own voice and identity while producing weekly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">comic strips</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">editorial cartoons</a>, and article illustrations for <b><i>Kule</i></b>. He also started publishing <b><i>Garapata Blood</i></b> (Flea Blood) for the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b> during his sophomore year in 2000. <b><i>Garapata Blood </i></b>was a comic strip that Abrera created with his bandmates John Paul Cuison and Bheng Densing. When he was offered his own comic strip space, he started <b><i>Kikomachine <strong>Komiks</strong></i></b>, named after their band Kiko Machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Kikomachine Komiks</i></b>,<b> </b>published in the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b> from Monday to Saturday, and the comic strip compilations that issued out of them brought Abrera to prominence among a particular youth demographic. Abrera also eventually developed a web comic series called <b><i>News Hardcore</i></b>, which comes out in <b><i>GMA News Online</i></b> every Monday. Beginning 2005, <b><i>Kikomachine Komiks</i></b> was compiled yearly into books and published by Visprint Inc. As a daily strip in mass circulation, <b><i>Kikomachine Komiks</i></b> became a popular series as it dealt with Filipino culture and everyday life. Abrera relates that his creative process involves taking daily events he observed and amplifying these graphically while using colloquial language. Though sometimes criticized for making the text heavy, dialogue is a key part of Abrera&rsquo;s pieces. His use of text as visual element, sometimes running around or deliberately inverting the comic frame, has also set his work apart from other daily strips. The use of spare lines in every panel and often simply outlined figures make Abrera&rsquo;s characters easy to read visually. Similar to most comic strips, the expressions and gestures of the characters are often exaggerated. This style is also observed in his <b><i>News Hardcore</i></b>, which relates the travails of a young journalist. The series<i> </i>focuses on the office life of the young working population. While still employing simple lines to delimit figures with exaggerated movements and facial expressions, <b><i>News Hardcore</i></b> stylistically differs in its use of colored tints and shading, particularly of the background, as these elements are absent in <b><i>Kikomachine Komiks</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abrera&rsquo;s most notable work is his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">graphic novel</a> titled <b><i>12</i></b>, 2009, also by Visprint Inc. As a wordless graphic novel, it is comprised of 12 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short stories</a> wherein he goes beyond the limitation of daily panels that his comic strips impose. Each story line is thus developed more elaborately and plays with flow and slower pacing. In this work, Abrera&rsquo;s witty verbal humor previously demonstrated in the comic strips was replaced by a more philosophical and existential tone. While still counting upon the tropes of everyday life, <b><i>12</i></b> is given to unlikely and reflective readings. His experimental use of wordlessness here pushes the boundaries of the comic genre as it leaves more room for the reader to craft meaning from the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abrera was given the Reader&rsquo;s Choice Awards in Komikon or the Annual Philippine Komiks Convention in 2011 for <b><i>12 </i></b>and <b><i>Kikomachine Blg. 6 &ldquo;Venn Mann at Iba Pang Kalupitan ng Kapalaran&rdquo;</i></b> (Kikomachine No. 6<i> </i>&ldquo;Venn Mann and Other Cruelties of Fate&rdquo;).<i> </i>He has been an active participant of Komikon<i> </i>since its inception in 2005. Through it and parallel efforts, Abrera involves himself in the creation of a local comics community. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Maria Portia Olenka Placino</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Napoleon Abueva&nbsp;</b>(<b>Esabelio Napoleon Veloso Abueva</b>), also known as Billy Abueva, was a sculptor and National Artist for visual arts. He was born in&nbsp;Bohol on 26 Jan 1930. He died in Quezon City on 16 Feb 2018. He was the son of Congressman Teodoro Abueva and Purificacion Veloso, both executed by the Japanese in 1944 for their guerrilla activities. He married Sergia Valles. They have three children, one of whom, Mulawin, is also a sculptor. As a boy, Abueva apprenticed with the Cebuano sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3406\">Fidel Araneta</a>. Later, on a scholarship given by Pura Villanueva Kalaw, he studied at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a>, where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a> was his mentor. He then took his master&rsquo;s degree at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan on a Smith Mundt-Fulbright grant. He further trained in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> and ceramics at the University of Kansas and took graduate units in art history at Harvard in 1956.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abueva posed the challenge of modernism to his mentor Tolentino and, through his prolific and energetic work, significantly tilted the balance in favor of modernism. It was in the 1950s that he firmly established his reputation as the pioneering modernist in sculpture. Abueva&rsquo;s artistic influence continued in his capacity as professor and former dean of the UP College of Fine Arts from 1978 to 1989. In 1993, he was given an honorary doctorate in humanities and promoted to university professor. He retired from UP in 1995 and was later given the honor of Professor Emeritus in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abueva&rsquo;s works have spread far and wide in galleries, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, public buildings, residences, campuses, and parks both here and abroad. His versatility in both <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">medium</a> and expression eludes conventional categorization. He has done sculpture in a wide range of media: in metals such as iron, bronze, brass, and stainless steel; in stones such as adobe, marble, alabaster, and coral; and in woods such as molave, narra, <i>kamagong</i>, ipil, and bamboo. But he had admitted to be happiest working with Philippine hardwoods, bringing out their grained texture and natural sheen in the process of direct carving. He has often combined different materials, such as wood with metal and stone, and has worked in techniques proper to the materials used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although he identified his original influence as Brancusi, Abueva has constantly searched for new forms and modes of expression. In 1957, he created the double crucifix for the<em> </em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice</a> at the UP Diliman campus. He created many public sculptures for the UP Diliman campus such as the <b><i>UP Gateway</i></b>, 1967, on the University Ave; <b><i>Siyam na Diwata ng Sining</i></b> (Nine Muses of the Arts), 1994, at the UP Faculty Center; <b><i>Three Women Sewing the First Philippine Flag</i></b>, 1996, at the UP Donor&rsquo;s Garden, as part of the centennial celebration of the 1896 Philippine Revolution; and <b><i>Magdangal</i></b> (Honor), 2008, located in front of the College of Arts and Letters Building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As his work progressed in complexity and maturity, it became more and more characterized by a rich blend of wit and imagination&mdash;qualities that stemmed from an artistic individualism that enabled him to pursue his art without inhibition or self-consciousness. Among Abueva&rsquo;s many important works are the buoyant sculpture <b><i>Moses</i></b>, 1951, floating on water; <b><i>Rice Planting</i></b>, 1952, an early modernist work with large, vigorous rhythms; <b><i>Allegorical Harpoon</i></b>, a work in molave which was the Philippine entry in the 32nd Venice Biennale in 1964; the stylized <b><i>Water Buffalo</i></b>, 1968, in bronze; <b><i>Birds</i></b>, 1971, in veined marble; the opalescent and compact <b><i>Alabaster City</i></b>, 1973; and the life-size <b><i>To and from the Sea</i></b>, 1978, with its rugged male figures carrying a banca. <strong> </strong> One of his largest works is the <b><i>Transfiguration</i></b>, 1979, a towering Christ figure, at the Eternal Gardens Memorial Park in Caloocan. He carved the 14 Stations of the Cross in hardwood, installed all along the circular inner walls of the Claret School Chapel in Teacher&rsquo;s Village, Diliman. He also did a bronze figure of Teodoro M. Kalaw<b><i> </i></b>in front of the National Library; marble sculptures for the National Heroes Shrine in Mount Samat, Bataan; <b><i>Sunburst</i></b>, 1994, at the Peninsula Manila Hotel and other public sculptures in Makati City. He performed the death mask procedure on the late Cardinal Sin and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\"> Fernando Poe Jr</a>. He has done altars in wood with metal trim, combining modern with folk in the ornate reliefs. A number of aspects emerged from his work: the purely figurative, the fantastic, the constructional, the highly stylized, the abstract, and the functional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One important aspect of Abueva&rsquo;s work is his enduring interest in the functional side of sculpture. He said, &ldquo;I work on functional objects on the basis of sculptural problems, rather than on utilitarian objective, as diversion from pure sculpture.&rdquo; Along this vein, he has done numerous doors in relief, benches, lounging chairs, a many-angled mirror tree, fountains, machines for grating coconuts, and a fantastic chariot that he himself rode in the complete regalia of a Roman centurion. Describing sculpture as primarily manual work, he stressed that the sculptor must also be a carpenter, mason, welder, electrician, and even a weight lifter. His work is characterized by a strong sense of form and material, by flexibility and invention, and by a fertile imagination, by turns whimsical, literary, erotic, and fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Done in modernist idiom, his adobe sculpture, <b><i><strong> <strong>The Kiss</strong> </strong> </i></b>, won the second prize in the fourth <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</a><strong> </strong> annual exhibition in 1951. In a separate sculpture exhibition in the same year, he won first prize for<b><i> Mother and Child </i></b>and best entry in plaster for <b><i>Chukie Warren</i></b>. His other AAP awards are as follows: first prize, <b><i>Rice Planting</i></b>, 1952; second prize, <b><i>Mother and Child</i></b>, 1952; first prize, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2212\"><strong>Kaganapan</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Fulfillment), 1952; second prize, <b><i>Father and Son</i></b>, 1954; first prize, <b><i>Figure</i></b>, 1958; third prize, <b><i>Manila: The First Years</i></b>, 1977; and honorable mention, <b><i>Bagong Buhay</i></b> (New Life), 1974. While he was studying abroad, his <b><i>Kiss of Judas</i></b>, 1955, <b><i>Water Buffalo</i></b>, 1968, and <b><i>Unknown Prisoner</i></b> won international awards. He received the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1966. In 1976, he was proclaimed National Artist in sculpture. In 1995, he won the fourth ASEAN Achievement Award for the Visual Arts in Singapore. In 1999, he was honored with the CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts. In 2010, a book on his life and works titled <b><i>Abueva</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3734\">Cid Reyes</a><strong> </strong> was launched.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He also taught at the UP CFA from 1994 to 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Achacoso has produced paintings in oil on canvas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">mixed media</a> which explore the visual connections between art, ecology, and science. Interested in the various interfaces between painting, writing, and scientific disciplines, his images over the years have ranged from those appropriating figurative icons of flora and fauna to those representing cellular and abstract forms. His interest in such themes was evident early on in his solo exhibitions such as <b><i>Terrain</i></b>, 1993, at West Gallery where he explored imagery and surfaces culled from natural history and geological strata, and analogies between the visual and scientific. This inquiry is sustained decades later in shows such as <b><i>Abstraction of Beasts</i></b>, 2011, which responds to images found in scientific journals and taxonomic studies. From the late 1980s onward, Achacoso&rsquo;s explorations have extended from evolutionary and natural sciences to the fields of astronomy and geology and the visual processes of map making and topographic studies. These have led to the production of paintings consisting of emblems, patterns, and archetypes as culled images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His earliest solo exhibitions <b><i>On the Origin of the Species</i></b>, 1988, and <b><i>Descent of Man</i></b>, 1991, were held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. Since 1987, he participated in group exhibitions at the CCP, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3720\"> Pinaglabanan Galleries</a>, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise, SM Megamall Art Center, Lopez Museum, Big Sky Mind, Mag:net Gallery, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3599\">UP Vargas Museum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A writer and critic, Achacoso produced catalogue texts and articles about exhibitions of Philippine contemporary art. He won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>&rsquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3444\">Leo Benesa</a> Award for Art Criticism twice in 1993 and 1994. He has co-curated exhibitions with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3588\">Nilo Ilarde</a>, including <b><i>Here Be Dragons: Topology of Allegory</i></b>, 2009, at Manila Contemporary and <b><i>Destroy All Monsters</i></b>, 2007. Achachoso has pursued his interest in botany as a member of the Philippine Native Plant Conservation Society Inc since 2008. Achacoso received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2000. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Lisa Ito-Tapang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Dayao, Dodo. 2011. &ldquo;Ronald Achacoso: Abstraction of Beasts.&rdquo; http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/47586.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Galleria Duemila. 2003c. &ldquo;Ronald Achacoso.&rdquo; http://www.galleriaduemila.com/WEB2003/artists/rac/racabout.html.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ito, Lisa C. 2014b.

He was born in&nbsp;New York, USA on 5 Sep 1933. He died in Quezon City on 16 Jan 2007. At age 14, he was sent to a military school in the United States. When he returned to the Philippines, he took up commerce at De La Salle University. He had no formal art education, but as a young boy he was already interested in it. During his stay in New York, he frequented the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was exposed to the works of Titian, Rembrandt, and other Dutch masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aguinaldo held his first exhibit at the Philippine Art Gallery in 1958. His early works were influenced by Jackson Pollock. Through the years, he developed several styles of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>: &ldquo;flick&rdquo; painting, where he &ldquo;flicked&rdquo; paint from a palette knife on canvas; &ldquo;galumphing,&rdquo; which incorporated a few pop images largely influenced by Robert Motherwell; and &ldquo;linear&rdquo; painting in his geometric abstract phase. He was best known for this hard-edge minimalist style, which influenced a new generation of abstractionists in the 1960s such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3649\">Ben Maramag</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3557\">Rodolfo Gan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3758\">Rodolfo Samonte</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aguinaldo&rsquo;s works were featured in several exhibitions. In 1992, the Lopez Memorial Museum organized the exhibition and publication of a portfolio of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s selected pen-and-ink drawings titled <b><i>Rembrandt&rsquo;s Light Series</i></b> based on Rembrandt&rsquo;s numerous versions of his self-portraits. In May 1993, Galleria Duemila held a two-man exhibit by Aguinaldo and<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3684\">Justin Nuyda</a>. This joint show was Aguinaldo&rsquo;s last exhibition. In 2010, the Ateneo Art Gallery marked its 50th anniversary with a posthumous exhibit, <b><i><strong><strong><strong>Lee Aguinaldo</strong></strong></strong>: In Retrospect</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which featured paintings, drawings, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">mixed-media</a> works that spanned Aguinaldo&rsquo;s different styles and period. In 1994, he underwent a major heart operation. He recovered but he never painted again.

He was born in&nbsp;Baguio on 6 Nov 1967.&nbsp;His parents are Bartolome Aguinaldo Sr and Petra Lachica, both originally from Candon, Ilocos Sur. He took architectural drafting at the Baguio Colleges Foundation in 1989 before joining the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild (BAG)</a> in 1991. Early in his career, Aguinaldo was a magazine illustrator and a cartoonist for the Baguio-based paper <b><i>The Midland Courier</i></b>. He also did illustrations for a number of books done by the Cordillera Green Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Learning <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">mixed media</a> art, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation art</a> while assisting more senior artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3443\">Ben Cabrera</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a> in conducting BAG workshops, Aguinaldo developed his abilities in hand printing calendars, T-shirts, and cards for the tourist market in Sagada. His need for paper led him to innovate with materials, and in 2000, he started using carved rubber as both painting surface and primary sculpted material. Aside from evocative anecdotal narratives on environment, culture, and society, his art stands out because of this medium he has chosen to work with repeatedly. He draws on rubber and carves out the voids, then he brushes bright hues of acrylic paint to color the incised patterns. Printer&rsquo;s ink and oil paints are applied with a roller for the raised areas. Instead of printing this out on paper to make artworks in multiples, the plate itself is presented as the finished work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aguinaldo participated in the Baguio Arts Festivals from 1989 to 1993 and has had numerous group and solo exhibitions since then in Philippine and international venues. Most notable among his solo shows are his first, <b><i>Ap-Apo ni Tuo</i></b> (Ancestors of the People), 1994, at the Pasilyo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, where he showed a set of painted images on handmade paper depicting traditional stories of the Benguet people, and <b><i>Creative Isolation</i></b>, 2002, at the Hiraya Gallery, where he first publicly showed his output using <i>ukir </i>on rubber. As an offshoot of his first show at the CCP, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s work was published in a coffee-table book, <b><i>Ap-Apo ni Tuo</i></b>, 1997, which had his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> appearing alongside stories and myths of the Cordillera. Out of his own initiative, Aguinaldo toured this set of works to Benguet schools and local government units (LGUs). He also held art workshops and donated copies of this book to LGU libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aguinaldo&rsquo;s international exhibitions include <b><i>Northern Exposure</i></b>, 2007, in Utterly Art Singapore and <b><i>Cultural Crossing</i></b>, 2009, at the Vermont Studio Center&rsquo;s Red Mill Gallery as part of his Freeman Fellow residency. Other international exhibitions were held in South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Germany, France, and Australia. In 2003, he was conferred the CCP Thirteen Artists Award.

His father is Hadji Salip Ahmad, a Samal Balangingi, and his mother is Salip Aisa Salipyasin, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a>. His wife is Eulida Mancao with whom he has three children. Although of mixed ethnic origin, Ahmad was raised as a Maguindanaon in Sibugay, Zamboanga peninsula. The Maguindanaon trace their roots in Zamboanga since the 1780s when Sibugay&mdash;then a center of Subanon culture&mdash;was an autonomous region under the Maguindanao sultanate headed by Datu Dakula. The latter exercised jurisdiction over a large area of what is now politically subdivided into the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City, and the western part of Zamboanga del Sur. According to the painter, his lineage comes from the Royal House of Salipyasin, which later conferred him the title of Sharif Datu Manukur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At age five, in the late 1950s, Ahmad became fascinated with films like <b><i>Three Musketeers</i></b>, <b><i>Tarzan</i></b>, and <b><i>Durango Kid</i></b>, which screened at the clubhouse of the Americans who then controlled the Kabasalan rubber plantations. The movies in his mind were transformed into drawings using pencil or crayons. Largely self-taught, his only formal training was a drafting course taken at the Zamboanga School of Arts and Trade in Zamboanga City. He then worked as a graphic artist and rendered pop art designs for tricycles and ice cream carts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He developed his own figurative style in watercolor, which recreates scenes from an unknown past and from forgotten customs and traditions drawn from childhood memories. Ahmad preserves these important rituals, traditions, and beliefs through his intricate watercolors, which employ a tedious technique that involves painting two different colors one on top of the other. The top layer is then gently erased using a fine brush and applying only the precise amount of water so as not to cause any blotting. This is calculated to produce delicate lines that reveal the underlying color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Islamic and ethnic traditions are important influences on his art, as exemplified by the work <b><i>Thanksgiving</i></b>, which depicts men who sit around a long table laden with sumptuous food, illustrating the segregation of men and women in certain Muslim rites. His paintings of women are meticulously executed to show great detail in indigenous adornment and clothing, as seen in <b><i>Utarah</i></b> (The Midday Wind), 1994. Ahmad&rsquo;s belief in the supernatural is made evident in <b><i>Soratan</i></b> (Soulmates), 2003, which portrays men and women awaiting their destined partners, one of whom is a female deity descending to her beloved. With his continuous production of artworks that show the unique culture of the ethnic groups of the province, Ahmad renders a magnanimous picture of Zamboanga Sibugay, a place sometimes associated with cases of kidnapping and other lawless acts. His house in Kabasalan, which also functions as a workshop and gallery, is an architectural landmark and a tourist destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works have been exhibited at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, Metropolitan Museum of Manila, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>. In 1995, he held a solo exhibit at the Philippine Center and the Hilton Hotel in New York, USA. He has also presented his works in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Singapore. Ahmad was part of the show titled <b><i>Glimpses of Mindanao: <strong><strong>Peace</strong></strong> in the Land of Promise</i></b>, sponsored by the Philippine Embassy and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a>, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\"><strong>Rosalie Matilac</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>Ahmad, Salipyasin. 2009.

He was born in&nbsp;Pasig, Manila on 8 Aug 1916. He died in&nbsp;Bacolod on 2 May 1982. He was the son of Leon Conde Ayco and Encarnacion Ramos. He adopted an artistic name (Jess Aiko) in 1967. He obtained his early schooling at Ateneo de Manila. He took courses in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts</a> in 1935-36. He also studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas. He traveled to Europe and studied in London and Paris for some time. He held his first one-person show at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3716\">Philippine Art Gallery</a> in May 1956, which was followed by group and solo shows in Bacolod, Cebu, Iloilo, and Dumaguete cities. In his shows, he displayed an avant-garde sensibility borne out by his experiments in enamel and tempera. He was instrumental in the formation of the Art Association of Bacolod. He lived in Bacolod City for most of his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Well-traveled and well-read, Ayco witnessed the vigor of abstract painting in Paris. His canvases were covered with splatterings of enamel paint. The density and tensility of his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">medium</a> became the very subject of his paintings. An early work of Ayco, <b><i>Young Widow by the Church</i></b>, 1947, showed his expressionistic tendency, quite advanced for the period in the context of Philippine art history. However, he also used the patterns formed by the medium to evoke shapes derived from life as in <b><i>Sylvan Idyll</i></b>, 1956.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ayco designed for dance and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> presentations, and choreographed dances in Bacolod, Iloilo, and Cebu. He was involved in the Kayumanggi Folk Dance Troupe from the 1950s through the 1960s, the Negros Occidental Dance Troupe (NODT) in the 1970s, and in the Kaanyag Pilipinas Dance&nbsp;Company, formerly the West Negros College Dance Company, in the 1980s. As artistic director of the NODT, he worked with dance directors Elsie Yelo-Enriquez and Virgie Gallespen. Under his direction, they strung together Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a> into theatrical programs like <b><i>The Lost Earring </i></b>and <b><i>Fiesta</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which included another original treatment of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5653\">Alejandro Roces</a>&rsquo;s story &ldquo;The Cockfight.&rdquo; In 1965, he staged <b><i>Scintilla</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which fused Philippine folklore, stories, music, and choreography, and in 1966, the dance drama <b><i>Igpat sang <strong>Bulawan</strong> </i></b>(Glow of Gold), about the barter of Negros and Panay that antedated the <b><i>Dularawan: Salakot na Ginto </i></b>(Image Play: Golden Salakot) in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was also involved with Visayan theater groups in plays and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>.

He produced and directed <b><i>Medea </i></b>and Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Salome</strong></i></b>, among others. He also designed for most of the dance productions of Bacolod&rsquo;s choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2524\">Lydia Madarang-Gaston</a>, and for the first Asian tour of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2555\">Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a> in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aiko won the following prizes in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> art competition: honorable mention in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>,<b><i> Pitang</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1952; second prize in non-objective painting, <b><i>Anterean Dance</i></b>, 1958; and second prize in non-objective painting, <b><i>Plutonian Passage</i></b>, 1962. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born in&nbsp;Bagong Bayan, Taguig, Rizal on 20 Aug 1920. He died on&nbsp;10 Jan 1991. Painter. His parents were Fausto Alano and Genoveva Pagsisihan. He married Leticia Custodio, also a painter. His father, an employee of the Philippine National Bank, collected <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> which filled their house. Being constantly surrounded by these paintings inspired Alano to study art and become a painter himself. He attended the Singalong Elementary School and the Arellano High School. In 1948, he graduated from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a> with a degree in painting. The first public exhibition of his works was in a group show organized in 1949, featuring the works of members of the Philippine Arts Guild. He co-owned his first gallery with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3772\">Serafin Serna</a>. In the 1950s, Alano taught art lessons to naval officers&rsquo; wives at Sangley Point, Cavite, and for 20 years maintained his own studio at Ermita, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alano was a disciple of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>. Of the members of the Amorsolo School, Alano effectively captured Amorsolo&rsquo;s warm sunlight colors, which he used in representing the Filipino&rsquo;s sun-kissed complexion and innate energy. Alano, however, was original in his subjects, avoiding Amorsolo&rsquo;s farm scenes and focusing on full-figure or half-figure renditions of workers, particularly fisherfolk. He was known for painting images of young boys holding their catch, with a glistening pond in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of his life, his genre scenes were regularly bought by German art dealers such that the German art world of that period came to know the Philippines through Alano&rsquo;s paintings of rural scenes.

He was born in&nbsp;Bacarra, Ilocos Norte on&nbsp; 27 Jan 1947. He died in Quezon City on 6 Aug 1985.&nbsp;His parents were Pastor Albano and Alejandra Pidad. Albano obtained his bachelor of arts degree, major in English literature, at Ateneo de Manila University in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1970 until his death, Albano played a major role in the art world when he joined the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> and became its visual arts director, succeeding his mentor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a>. As curator he actively promoted conceptual art in CCP&rsquo;s major exhibitions, gaining acceptance for this relatively new form of art. He launched in 1980 the bimonthly CCP art publication <b><i>Philippine Art Supplement</i></b>. During his term at the CCP, Albano designed many posters for the center, mainly for the theater productions of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>, for which he also designed sets and lights. Albano also founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> club for CCP employees and participated in international exhibitions. As artist and/or administrator, he attended and officially represented the Philippines in various international conferences, symposia, and exhibitions such as the Asian Art Festival in Fukuoka, Japan; the Munich Summer Festival; the ASEAN Exhibition of Painting and Photography; the Philippine Sceneries Show in Beijing, China; and the Biennale de Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an artist, Albano was considered to be an abstractionist, experimentalist, and a conceptualist. His works studied and played with the process of art production by exploring and pushing the boundaries of time and space surrounding the artist during the creative process and within the work and the characteristics of the materials used in art making. The breaking of preconceived ideas about art and its processes became Albano&rsquo;s major concern. He once took 100 shots of a subject who did not change her pose throughout the session. Albano&rsquo;s investigation on time revealed many different changes going on in the background even if the subject never moved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Albano received the John Mulry Award for Literary Excellence from Ateneo in 1968. He also received the Thirteen Artists Award from the CCP in 1970. In 1977, he received a grant as artist in residence under the Fulbright-Hayes Fund International Exchange of Scholars at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. He won honorable mention in the 1974 Tokyo International Biennale of Prints. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Rachel Mayo, updated by Zeny May D.

Both Italian natives, the two artists arrived in the Philippines as members of the Italian opera troupe Compa&ntilde;ia Assi-Panadis on 24 Mar 1875. The two were immediately contacted by the Augustinians who were currently redecorating the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">Church of San Agustin</a>, Intramuros, Manila. Alberoni and Dibella assessed the expenses at 6,000 pesos to which the priests eventually added another 2,000 pesos. The project, unveiled the following year, resulted in a stupendous work, such that the priests were criticized for their extravagance. However, this achievement opened the eyes of the Filipino community to a new cultural sensibility. The two artists became instant celebrities and were persuaded to stay. As early as 1876, they began redecorating the interior of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an Palace</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As toasts of the town and owing to their distinctive personalities, Alberoni and Dibella were the first artists to be featured in a Philippine magazine. Alberoni was described as a &ldquo;<i>bohemio de la raza</i>&rdquo; (true-to-form beatnik) &ldquo;dressed up and coiffed like a true painter.&rdquo; Dibella, on the other hand, was described as looking more like a &ldquo;seminarian.&rdquo; &ldquo;If Alberoni were a genius,&rdquo; read the article, &ldquo;he would be as vain and conceited as Cellini, as irascible as Michaelangelo and as pedantic as Courbet &hellip; Dibella in contrast, would be like a semitheologian like Rembrandt &hellip; and would, like Fortuny, settle down into a model padre de familia &hellip;&rdquo; (<i>Ilustracion del Oriente</i> 1878).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As soon as they began work in Manila, the two hired local painters as assistants, encouraging apprenticeship, because they could not do all their commissions by themselves. Dibella returned to Europe on 3 May 1881 but Alberoni remained, and established on 19 Sep 1884 a school specializing in scenographic art. The courses offered were linear drawing, ornamental drawing, and figure drawing. The classes were held in a building located on Calle Quiotan in Santa Cruz, Manila. Matriculation per annum was<i> </i>&ldquo;<i>un real fuerte</i>.&rdquo; Before Dibella left, the two painted the interior of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> and the mansion of Jose Rocha.

The decorations are a blend of Filipino floral motifs, classical architectural ornaments, and religious symbols. The central nave was divided into six sections filled with liturgical allusions. They employed, for effect, <b>trompe</b> <b>l&rsquo;oeil</b>, such that when seen from a distance, the paintings gave the impression of being real, carved bas-reliefs. The set of <b><i>Junto al Pasig</i></b>, on the other hand, is described as a &ldquo;hall filled with columns creating an illusion of ample space.&rdquo; The set itself was collected by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3401\">Toribio Antillon</a>, who, together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a>, trained under the two Italians. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <strong><em>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Alcala was much influenced by the American cartoonist Al Capp. His own satirical cartoons reflect the foibles of Filipinos. So popular were his characters Kalabog and Bosyo that two screenplays were made of these characters, starring the comedy duo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4254\">Panchito</a>, teamed-up for the first time in 1959, and once again in 1986. <b><i>Tipin</i></b>, made for <b><i>Hiwaga Komiks</i></b>, 1951-66, was produced by Premiere Productions with Lani Oteyza in the lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of his published works include <b><i>The Best of Mang Ambo</i></b>, 1988; <b><i>The Best of <strong><strong><strong>Larry Alcala</strong></strong></strong>&rsquo;s</i> <i>Mang Ambo: Book 2</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>The Latest of Larry Alcala&rsquo;s Mang Ambo</i></b>, 2001; and <b><i>Congressman Kalog</i></b>, 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1997, PBBY gave Alcala the title &ldquo;Dean of Filipino Cartoonists&rdquo; and named one of its prizes after him: the Alcala Illustrators&rsquo; Prize.

He was born in&nbsp;Pasay City on 15 Dec 1911. He died in&nbsp;Binangonan, Rizal on 18 Mar 2005. Alcantara had no formal education in fine arts. He was first introduced to wood carving as an apprentice to Gonzalo Puyat, famous wood-carver and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> maker, and also through training at the Taller de Escultura de Tampinco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alcantara&rsquo;s earliest production belonged to the classical tradition.

Moreover, his working mainly on wood with polished surfaces and fluid lines enhanced his themes of maternal tenderness, as in <b><i>Mother and Child</i></b>, 1953. On the other hand, <b><i>Ina ng <strong><strong><strong>Ani</strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Mother of Harvest), 1954, shows the full figure of a stylized woman carrying a child in native rural costume that recalls the rich <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a> of the barong tagalog in its ornate border designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alcantara&rsquo;s awards from the AAP include special prize for <b><i>Ina ng Lahi</i></b> (Mother of the Race) and third prize for <b><i>The Kiss</i></b>, both in 1951; first prize for <b><i>Mother and Child</i></b>, 1953; third prize for <b><i>Ina ng Ani</i></b>, 1954; and second prize for <b><i>Susmariosep</i></b> (Jesus, Mary, Joseph), 1955.

Alcazaren&rsquo;s planar and object productions come out of a range of processes, from concatenating things to merely presenting them as they are but in a way that beholders are made to think upon the working out and working over of surface upon surface, color upon color, texture upon texture, and other decision points that figure in his production method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his solo exhibitions are <b><i>Arthropophilia</i></b>, 1992, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a><strong><strong><strong><strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> (CCP); <b><i>FRNAUT </i></b>and <b><i>Bigger than a Breadbox</i></b>, both in 1995 at West Gallery; <b><i>Quotidian Gray</i></b>, 2000, SM Art Center; <b><i>9 Objects: A <strong>Tribu</strong>te to Marcel Duchamp</i></b>, 2001, Big Sky Mind and Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise; <b><i>Familiarity Breeds</i></b>, 2003, SM Megamall Art Center;<b><i> Crime and Decoration</i></b>, Theo Gallery, 2004; <b><i>SENI: Art and the Contemporary</i></b>, Singapore Art Museum, 2004; <b><i>The Sedimentation of the Mind Is a Jumbled Museum</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3599\">Vargas Museum</a>, 2004; <b><i>Coming Misconceptions</i></b>, 2005, Finale Art File; <b><i>Filipiniana</i></b>, 2006, Centro Cultural Duque Madrid; <b><i>Not Your Garden Variety <strong><strong>Earth</strong></strong> ly Delight</i></b>, 2006, Finale Art File;<b><i> Room for Error</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2007, West Gallery; <b><i>Low Tide</i></b>, 2007, Finale Art File;<b><i> Test</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2008, Mag:net Gallery Katipunan; <b><i>Gone to Seed</i></b>, 2008, Finale Art File; <b><i>Mixed Signals</i></b>, 2010, Utterly Art; <b><i>Choking Hazard</i></b>, 2009, Mag:net The Columns; <b><i>Sisyphus 3</i></b>, 2010, Finale Art File; <b><i>Save Me from What I Want to Save</i></b>, 2011, Finale Art File; and <b><i>Zero Ground</i></b>, 2014, The Drawing Room.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>FEDERICO AGUILAR ALCUAZ&nbsp; </b>(<b>Federico Alcuaz <strong>Aguila</strong>r</b>) was a painter and&nbsp;National Artist for visual arts. He was born in&nbsp;Santa Cruz, Manila on 6 Jun 1932. He died on&nbsp;2 Feb 2011.&nbsp;He was the son of Mariano Aguilar and Encarnacion Alcuaz. He was married to Ute Schmitz, a German, with whom he had three children. He finished early schooling at Dr Albert Elementary School and San Beda High School. He studied law at Ateneo de Manila University. He took up fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1949 and at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. The latter was the Spanish Academy attended by a number of eminent Filipino painters of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>. Alcuaz stayed for long periods in Spain and Czechoslovakia. Although based abroad, either in Germany or Spain, he visited the Philippines often and donated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>s to UP, Ateneo de Manila University, San Beda, and other institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alcuaz is best known for his tapestries and abstract paintings, although he also produced figurative works like portraits, nudes, still lifes, and landscapes. In 1963, at his first solo exhibition, his abstracts were dark and convoluted, allusive of organic shapes, vegetal or visceral. They had the energy and spontaneity of the subconscious, but of unusually vivid colors and textures, with much of their visual pull emanating from the play of shapes. A prominent subject for his landscapes is the Walled City, of which he did a panoramic mural. Alcuaz&rsquo;s memory hinged upon his deft draftsmanship and equally accomplished proclivity toward densely layered gestural and planar abstraction demonstrated throughout his peripatetic practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He had more than 40 exhibitions since 1963. In 1998, he had a solo exhibition at Galerie Borkowski, Hannover, Germany. Alcuaz suffered from chronic subdural hematoma in 2003 and recovered completely but stopped painting. The Ayala Museum in 2005 organized a one-man retrospective of his works titled <b><i>Passionate Eyes</i></b>. It featured 200 artworks from the collections of Benjamin Gayubar of Barcelona, Spain, and Eddie and Norma Chua of Quezon City. In 2008, Alcuaz and his family opened a collection of unexhibited works called Barcelona Series, consisting of paintings mostly done in the artist&rsquo;s studio on Aragones St, Barcelona, Spain. Alcuaz&rsquo;s works are included in the collections of some 20 museums and cultural institutions in the world today such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Madrid, the Gulbenkian Foundation Museum of London, the Museum of Modern Art of Warsaw, Poland, and the Philips Cultural Museum of Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alcuaz received the following awards: first prize for <b><i>Roadside Squatters</i></b>, Shell National Students Art Competition, 1954; Prix Montcada y Reixach, 1957; Prix Francisco Goya, 1958; Diplome d&rsquo;Honneur, Exhibition Internationale d&rsquo;Art Libre, Paris, 1961; second prize, Fourth Biennial of Tarrasas, Barcelona, Prix Vancell, 1964; Decoration of Arts, Letters and Sciences, French Government, 1964; Order of the French Genius, 1964; Republic Cultural Heritage Award, Philippines, 1965; Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan and Araw ng Maynila Award from the city of Manila in 1966 and 1984, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2006, Alcuaz was given the Presidential Medal of Merit by the Philippine government for his outstanding contribution to visual arts. In 2009, he was proclaimed National Artist for visual arts. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

She was born in&nbsp;Caloocan City on 14 Jan 1957. She is the stepdaughter of Juan Daniel Misa and daughter of Marcelina Barela Bautista. She has three children, one of whom is theater actress and educator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3078\">Melissa-Vera &ldquo;Missy&rdquo; M.

She holds a baccalaureate degree in art, emphasis on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122#education\">art education</a>, kinder to 12th grade, graduating summa cum laude, from the University of Northern Iowa and a bachelor of fine arts degree, major in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, magna cum laude, from the University of the Philippines (UP). She was named as one of the 10 Outstanding Students of the Philippines by the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almonte is known for her large-scale figurative paintings which have represented the female form as vessels of both celebration and sufferance. Since publicly exhibiting her work in the early 1990s, she has painted women&rsquo;s bodies not as passive objects but as testimonies of strength and survival. Over the years, her work sought symbolic and erotic parallels between corporeal forms and images of fruits and flowers. She also explored the use of mixed media and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblage</a> in shows such as <b><i>Talambuhay </i></b>(Biography), 2005, at the Liongoren Gallery, merging biographical and Biblical narratives and creating <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><b>retablos</b></a> (altarpieces) from found objects. Her mixed media on board series <b><i>Ano Ka Ba Maria, Ba&rsquo;t Ka Nahulog sa Grasya? </i></b>(Hey Mary, Why Did You Fall from Grace?), 2006, delves into how the female form embodies trauma. She has also incorporated dance and performance in her exhibitions. Since 2010, she has also produced nonfigurative works on paper, departing from large, figurative paintings. Her solo show <b><i>Ngiti </i></b>(Smile), 2013, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">UP College of Fine Arts</a> Gallery featured a series of small works on paper, wielding both color and gesture as cathartic and celebratory elements in her visual acts of expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almonte&rsquo;s works were exhibited in the Philippines and in the United States, beginning with her first show, <b><i>I See Red</i></b>,<b> </b>in<b> </b>1993 at Hiraya Gallery. Other shows were at the Brix Gallery, Liongoren Gallery, Boston Gallery, Pinto Art Gallery, University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, Ateneo de Manila University, and the UP Fine Arts Gallery. Her group exhibitions include the Asia-wide <b><i>Women Imaging Women</i></b>, 1999; the survey show <b><i><strong>100</strong> Filipina Artists</i></b>, 2005; and the international art exhibition <b><i>Trauma, Interrupted</i></b>, 2007&mdash;all at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>.

She is an associate professor at the UP College of Fine Arts and has received the Golden Jubilee Professorial Chair, 2013-14; Tito de Santos Professorial Chair, 2012; Fernando Amorsolo Professorial Chair, 2007; and the Diamond Jubilee Professorial Chair, 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almonte received an Award of Excellence from the 12th Shell National Students Art Competition in 1989.

He was born in&nbsp;Navotas, Rizal on 19 Jul 1928. He died in Makati City on 7 Jul 2014. He was the son of Domingo Alonzo Sr and Sixta Roldan. Considered one of the top designers of the 1960s, Alonzo was a self-taught couturier known for his intricate beadwork and craftsmanship. As a young designer, he was fondly called &ldquo;Ni&ntilde;o Bonito&rdquo; by the fashion promoter and head of the Karilagan fashion shows, Conchita Sunico. Members of Manila&rsquo;s elite who modeled for Karilagan referred to him as &ldquo;Auring.&rdquo; Later in life, he would be known as &ldquo;Tatang&rdquo; to those working in the growing Philippine fashion industry and &ldquo;Prince of Philippine Haute Couture&rdquo; to the lifestyle media. A tribute titled <b><i>A Toast to the Prince of Philippine Haute Couture</i></b> was staged by his colleagues in Nov 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alonzo began as a hair stylist, putting up a beauty parlor after studying at the Helen Curtis School in Manila. However, he continued to make cocktail dresses for his five sisters and the praise lavished upon his home-sewn creations encouraged Alonzo to open his own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">dress</a> shop. An early member of the Philippine Couture Association, his work garnered international acclaim through the Karilagan shows produced by Sunico in the 1960s. In the 1970s, Alonzo regularly participated in Fiesta Filipina, a traveling showcase of Philippine contemporary fashion and costume initiated by the travel and aviation entrepreneur Roquito Ablan. In 1975, he won the Camel Award of International High Fashion in Servignio, Italy, where, as the only Asian in competition, his work was judged by Yves Saint Laurent, British bespoke tailor Henry Poole, and American sculptor Beverly Pepper. In December of that same year, he was also given the Premio Internazionale Cavalieri della Nuova Europa (International Prize of the Knights of New Europe) at the Palazzo Barberini in Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from his high society clientele, which included Philippine first ladies and Princess Margaret of England, Alonzo&rsquo;s richly beaded and embroidered garments would also adorn statues of the Virgin Mary. As a devotee, he dressed the Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2247\">Our Lady of La Naval</a> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> in Quezon City, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2251\">Virgin of Manaoag</a> in Pangasinan, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2248\">Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage</a> in Antipolo, among other venerated Marian images. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by Alice Sarmiento</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>Ching, Amyline Quien. 2014. &ldquo;The 12 Women of Aureo.&rdquo; <em>Manila Bulletin</em>, 3 Jul. http://www.mb.com.ph/the-12-women-ofaureo/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcelo, E. 2014. &ldquo;Veteran Fashion Designer Aureo Alonzo Passes Away at 85.&rdquo; <em>GMA News</em>, 7 Jul.&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/369120/lifestyle/fashionandbeauty/veteranfashion-designer-aureo-alonzo-passes-away-at-85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silvestre, Jojo G. 2013. &ldquo;Aureo Alonzo: I Literally Died in February and the Virgin Mary Saved My Life.&rdquo; <em>Philstar.com</em>, 27 Oct. http://<br />\r\nwww.philstar.com/sunday-life/2013/10/27/1249704/aureoalonzo-<br />\r\ni-literally-died-february-and-virgin-mary-saved-mylife.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

He was born in&nbsp;Fabrika, Sagay City, Negros Occidental on 5 May 1950. He is the son of Tomas Alvarado and Paula Pagubayan. He married Rosalia Daanoy. He received the Kabayao-Ledesma Scholarship Grant in Painting as a fine arts student at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman. He also studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a> at the La Consolacion College School of Architecture and Fine Arts, Bacolod City. Since 1980 he has been active as founding member of organizations like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3449\">Black Artists of Asia</a> and Pamilya Pintura. He also founded the Pintor Kulapol in Fabrica in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Much of Alvarado&rsquo;s work has dwelt on the plight of the <i>sakada</i> (seasonal cane workers). A striking aspect of his work is his original style of figuration. He has developed a style suitable to his folk subjects&mdash;the peasants and farm laborers, which he depicts as squat and angular to show their closeness to the earth as well as their strength in production. He uses vivid colors to enhance the sense of vitality and energy, while conveying strong emotion. More importantly, the artist uses symbols to convey the inimical forces that surround them: the crocodile at the heart of the sugarcane field, the thorns in the cornfields. He shows peasants in family groups, often in mourning over the grave of the victim of the harsh society. His peasant figures show strength and defiance that is at the same time dignified and moving. In recent works, he has combined <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> with elements of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>. Alvarado has worked in terra-cotta, as well as popularized silkscreened T-shirts with strong folk-social themes from the sugar industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These groups have stimulated artists&rsquo; social involvement in the rural communities. He has had many solo exhibitions of works of strong social impact. His first show was <b><i>Hampang-Hampang Lang &rsquo;Ni Pero Tuod Tuod </i></b>(Playful But True), 1979, Sining Kamalig, Manila. His other solo exhibits include <b><i>Welcome to Your Nightmare</i></b>, 1980, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>; <b><i>Kabayehan sa Uma </i></b>(Women on the Farm), 1981, Heritage Art Center, Quezon City; <b><i>Kaupod</i></b> (Companion), 1982, Hiraya Art Gallery, Manila; <b><i>Gilok</i></b> (Itch-Inducing Substance), 1990, UP Visayas Art Gallery, lloilo City; <b><i>Piesta: Art Common</i></b>, 1992, Barangay Fabrica, Negros Occidental; <b><i>Tagimata</i></b> (Mirage), both in 2000, Metropolitan Museum of Manila and Atelier Frank &amp; Lee, Singapore. He has also taken part in major group exhibitions in the country such as<b><i> Piglas: Art at the Crossroads </i></b>(To Be Free: Art at the Crossroads), 1986, and <b><i>Terra non Terra</i></b> (Earth Ground),<b><i> </i></b>1992, both at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, Manila. He did shows abroad in collaboration with Australian artist George Gittoes and Tokyo-based artist Theresa Kabayashi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alvarado was among the Thirteen Artists awardees of the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1992 and the nine Philippine representatives to the First Asia Pacific Triennial in Brisbane, Australia, in 1993. In 1997 and 1999, he won grand prize in the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards. In 2004, he was honored by the city of Manila with the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He was born in&nbsp;Quiapo, Manila on 8 Feb 1886. He died in 1955. He married Rosa Sevilla, writer and founder of the Instituto de Mujeres. Among the couple&rsquo;s children was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a>, a poet and renowned art collector who wrote his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122#criticism\">art criticism</a> under the nom de plume &ldquo;Magtanggol Asa.&rdquo; Emilio Alvero finished his basic education at the Quiapo Parochial School. He studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> privately under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3574\">Lorenzo Guerrero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3508\">Romualdo de Jesus</a>, and scenographic painting under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3386\">Cesare Alberoni</a>. He was a contemporary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> and Alejandro Cawed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a painter, Alvero is known for his realistic still lifes. In <b><i>Excursion</i></b>, Alvero&rsquo;s subject matter is boiled rice rendered so realistically, complete with spilled vinegar rolling down a banana leaf. Alvero&rsquo;s <b><i>Table Delicacies</i></b>, 1928, is outstanding not only because of the realism of the dish of tuna, the cantaloupe, and the basket of vegetables in the background, but also because the composition consists of mostly oval shapes which are echoed in the oval shape of the painting itself and the concave glass cover of the painting. At least six other still life paintings by this artist are preserved, one remarkable for its portrayal of makopa and balimbing, another a rich person&rsquo;s setting of sumptuous dishes laid out on a realistically depicted crocheted table mantel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alvero also painted other scenes. <b><i>A Nipa Hut</i></b>, which is outstanding for its realistic capturing of the rugged materials of the house, is in the Lourdes V. Ongpin collection. He also depicted the <b><i>Catafalque of Jose Mabesa in Hongkong </i></b>in oil, also found in the same collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alvero is also known to have designed houses, such as that of Dr Santiago Barcelona in San Juan, Manila. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born in&nbsp;Paco, Manila on 30 May 1892. He died in Manila on 26 Feb 1972. He is the son of Pedro Amorsolo, a bookkeeper, and Bonifacia Cueto. His younger brother is the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3397\">Pablo Amorsolo</a>. He married Salud Jorge in 1916, and they had six children. When Salud died in 1931, Amorsolo married Maria del Carmen, with whom he had eight children. He spent his youthful days in Daet, Camarines Norte. When his father died, his mother moved the entire family to Manila to live with her first cousin, painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a>. To raise money, Amorsolo sold watercolor postcards to a bookstore which paid him 10 centavos a piece, while his mother took on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>. Somehow he managed to complete his schooling at the Liceo de Manila, where he gained honors, especially in drawing and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>. At 17, he enrolled at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a>, where his uncle taught. He was one of its first graduates in 1919, receiving several medals for excellence. During his college days he was influenced by the works of the Spanish painter Diego Velazquez and other European painters, such as Sargent, Zorn, Sorolla, and Zuloaga. While a student, Amorsolo lived in a rented <i>accesoria</i> (row houses) and, in order to survive, joined competitions and did illustrations for publications like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s first novel, <b><i>Parusa ng Diyos</i></b> (God&rsquo;s Punishment). He also designed chairs for the Bureau of Public Works. Upon graduation, he became an instructor at UP, while continuing as a draftsman at the Public Works and chief artist of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/349\">Pacific Commercial</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For 38 years, he taught at the UP School of Fine Arts, and served as its director, 1938-52. He was such a formidable influence that his younger brother Pablo had to make a conscious effort not to imitate him. In 1916, entrepreneur Enrique Zobel de Ayala gave him a grant to visit Spain, Europe, and the United States. In 1922, Amorsolo made his first important painting, <b><i>Rice Planting</i></b>, which became one of the most popular images of the Commonwealth period, appearing in several versions in calendars, posters, and tourist brochures. During his peak years in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, he widely exhibited both in the Philippines and abroad, including New York and Belgium. His works covered a wide range which included portraits, landscapes, and genre. He also did illustrations for children&rsquo;s textbooks and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novels</a>, commercial designs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">cartoons</a> for the magazine <b><i>The Independent</i></b>, and illustrations for <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b> and <b><i>Telembang</i></b>, <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino</i></b>, and <b><i>Excelsior</i></b>. In his canvases, Amorsolo popularized the image of the beautiful and modest <i>dalagang</i> <i>Filipina </i>(Filipino maiden) in her traditional domestic roles. Of great influence was his ideal feminine type: the smiling, young woman of fair complexion and slender figure, wearing a colorful native costume which showed no sign of wear and tear from work and the tropical weather. He idealized the peasant, whom he situated in a rural idyll where nature was ever bountiful, and hunger and strife were unknown. He was the first to extensively portray traditional Filipino customs and manners, fiestas, and occupations like fishing, planting, going to market, washing laundry, cooking, and reading. He also did a series of historical canvases on precolonial scenes, such as <b><i>Early Filipino State Wedding</i></b>, <b><i>Traders</i></b>, and <b><i>Sikatuna</i></b>, as well as events surrounding the colonization of the Philippines, such as <b><i>The First Mass in the Philippines</i></b>,<b><i> The Building of Intramuros</i></b>, and<b><i> Burning of the Idol</i></b>. At one point, these works, had come under criticism, specifically in the way Muslim women had been represented. Nonetheless, these images have been reproduced in many textbooks and calendars, and have shaped the visual imagination of many generations of Filipino children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amorsolo is credited with having captured the elusive quality of Philippine light. In his landscapes and genre paintings, he used the technique of backlighting in which the figures are situated against the light, thus outlining them with a golden glow. He preferred to paint in natural light, learning to be quick and decisive in his work since &ldquo;light changes rapidly and you have to be fast in order to catch the mood with which you started out.&rdquo; In the 1930s, he was earning enough from his painting that he gave up commercial art work. His idyllic genre scenes were a favorite with American officials and visitors in search of tropical exotica. A master of portraiture, he was lionized by the moneyed and powerful for whom he painted countless works. Over the years, he took to photographing his works, mounted them in an album, and asked prospective patrons to choose what they wanted and indicate the size they needed. Amorsolo did not make exact replicas, varying some elements in the painting. The volume of paintings, not to mention sketches and studies, that came from Amorsolo is formidable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A complete listing of his works is yet to be made. Some have unfortunately been lost or stolen. In 1999, the mural he painted for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, <b><i>History of Music</i></b>, was restored. Also remarkable was his speed at executing his works&mdash;three life-size paintings for the Philippine Pavilion in the 1931 Paris Exposition were finished in less than a month. In the 1950s till his death, he averaged 10 paintings a month; but during his final years, diabetes and cataracts and the death of two sons affected his works. When another generation of Filipino painters wanted to break new paths in the 1930s, it took the form of a revolt against the Amorsolo school, which had been dominant for at least three decades. Modernism arose largely as a reaction to Amorsolo&rsquo;s style. He and sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a> were the objects of a diatribe led by such moderns as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After his death, Amorsolo&rsquo;s achievements were commemorated in numerous exhibitions. In May 1975, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> held an Amorsolo retrospective. In Jun 1989, the Metropolitan Museum of Manila held an exhibit titled <b><i>Lupang Hinirang: Alay ni Amorsolo </i></b>(Chosen Land: Amorsolo&rsquo;s Offering). In celebration of Amorsolo&rsquo;s centennial year, the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts launched the Amorsolo Centennial in May 1992 at Galleria de las Islas, El Amanecer, Intramuros, Manila. In the same year, a number of exhibitions followed: <b><i>The Corporate Amorsolo</i></b>, Ayala Museum; <b><i>Amorsolo Drawings</i></b>, Lopez Museum; and <b><i>Larawan</i></b><i> </i>(Portrait), National Museum. In 1993, the works of Amorsolo and his children and grandchildren titled <b><i>The Amorsolo Legacy</i></b> were shown in the PICC Art Gallery. In 2000, the exhibit <b><i>Fernando, Fernando</i></b> was shown in Ayala Museum; in 2002, <b><i>Brush with History</i></b> was shown in the same museum. In 2006, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, USA, exhibited <b><i>Pioneers of Philippine Art: Luna, Amorsolo, Zobel</i></b>. In 2008, a seven-museum retrospective exhibit on Amorsolo titled <b><i>His Art, Our Heart</i></b> was organized by Ayala Museum, GSIS Museum of Art, Lopez Memorial Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Manila, National Museum of the Philippines, UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3599\">Jorge B. Vargas Museum and Filipiniana Research Center</a>, and Yuchengco Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the honors he received are: the Outstanding UP Alumnus Award, 1940; the Rizal Pro-Patria Award, 1961; an honorary doctorate in the humanities from the Far Eastern University, 1961; the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila, 1963; the Republic Cultural Heritage Award, 1967; and the Gawad CCP para sa Sining, 1972. In 1973, he became the first artist to be proclaimed National Artist. After his death, Amorsolo received the CCP Centennial Honor for the Arts in 1999 and the Parangal Sentenyal from the University of the Philippines in 2008. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Rene B.

He was born in&nbsp;Daet, Camarines Norte on 26 Jun 1898. He died in&nbsp;Antipolo, Rizal in 1945. His parents were Pedro Amorsolo and Bonifacia Cueto. When he was eight, his family went to Manila where he studied drawing under the tutelage of his uncle, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a>. His brother, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>, like their uncle, was also a master painter and was known for his pastoral scenes and portraits. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3397\">Pablo Amorsolo</a> completed elementary and secondary schooling at Liceo de Manila, and graduated from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a> in 1924. Two years later, he was appointed assistant instructor in the UP School of Fine Arts, where he taught until World War II broke out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amorsolo, while admiring classical art, also strongly advocated modern art. In the 1930s, he was one of the most prolific editorial pen-and-ink illustrators for such publications as the <b><i>Graphic</i></b>, <b><i><strong>Tribu</strong>ne</i></b>, <b><i>La Vanguardia</i></b>, and <b><i>Herald</i></b>. He also served as artist for the <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>. His illustrations, which portrayed a wide variety of domestic and social situations, contributed to the rise of genre art in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When portraits were in vogue during the pre-World War II years, Amorsolo was one of the best portrait painters. His skilled brushwork could breathe life into his subjects, which he painted truthfully and without idealization. He painted subjects from all social classes and age levels. It was in these portraits that he showed his deep understanding of distinct human personalities. Historical subjects also interested him, as seen in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> <b><i><strong>Magellan</strong></i></b> <b><i>and the Natives</i></b> and <b><i>The Discovery of the Philippines</i></b>, a large-scale piece painted in 1944. Few of Pablo Amorsolo&rsquo;s paintings are extant because a large number of his works were destroyed in a fire in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pablo sincerely advocated the Greater East-Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and served as a colonel in the Kempetai. When the Americans returned, he was captured by Philippine troops and was killed by a guerrilla firing squad in Antipolo. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

In displacing these roadside obstacles to instead become a static display in a gallery, he not only makes them visible but indirectly evokes the contradictions present in runaway urbanization and survivalist tactics.

He was born in&nbsp;San Miguel, Manila on 15 Oct 1882. He died on&nbsp;1 Apr 1949. He finished elementary and secondary education as well as a <i>bachiller en artes</i> (bachelor of arts) at Ateneo de Manila, his tertiary degree obtained in 1904. He studied art at Liceo de Manila, Escuela de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado, and the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura run by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3454\">Teodoro P.

He was represented with eight <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> in the Philippine section at the Saint Louis Universal Exposition, 1904. He taught at the Philippine Normal School from 1918 to 1926.

His earliest phase from early 1900 to the 1920s was his most outstanding. This period produced the views of various gates of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">Walls of Intramuros</a> of which one version is in the Central Bank Collection. This piece is remarkable for its organization of shapes, the interplay of light and dark to suggest depth, and the pleasant combination of yellow, brown, green, and pinks that realistically render the thriving foliage on the walls. In the 1930s, Ancheta began painting seashore scenes of fishing boats. These pieces demonstrate how his colors became richer pastel shades of pink, orange, and lavender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ancheta&rsquo;s <b><i>A Victim of War </i></b>received an honorable mention at the Universal Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1904.

Antillon married Margarita Borja and they had a daughter, Concepcion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antillon studied at the Escuela Normal de Maestros, 1872-74, at the same time that he enrolled at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura. While still a student, he apprenticed under two scenographic painters, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3386\">Giovanni Dibella and Cesare Alberoni</a>, who traveled to Manila with an Italian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a> troupe. Staying in the Philippines, the two Italians painted drop curtains for operatic presentations. When they began accepting contracts to decorate the interiors of private homes, public buildings, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, Antillon became their assistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antillon later established a shop of his own and developed his own clientele.

He also painted the ceiling of the old church of Antipolo, Rizal. Antillon was also well known for decorating house interiors for upper-class Filipinos at the time.

He was born in Malolos, Bulacan on 3 Feb 1939. He is the son of Mariano Antonio, painter, decorator, and clothes designer, and Virginia Garcia. He married painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3442\">Norma Belleza</a>. In 1963, he received a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of Santo Tomas (UST), where he subsequently taught from 1963 to 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antonio started out with a black-and-white series but later developed his own color schemes. While some of his works bear a hue that can be described as &ldquo;acidic yellow,&rdquo; he used black charcoal-like strokes and strong color as a structuring principle in his works. One of his series demonstrated how he would experiment with particular hues to delineate figures. His subjects revolved around folk genre, which included cockfighters, vendors, ice cream peddlers, and balloon sellers. In the 1960s and 1970s, he also focused on street confrontations, which were expressive of the political temper of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of Antonio&rsquo;s works show the influence of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, in the style evident in the latter&rsquo;s Neo-Realist and cubist tendencies. The affinity is also present in terms of subject&mdash;namely, folk genre. It is by way of these explorations and proposed deviations that Antonio has, through the years, developed a style distinctly his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works were first exhibited in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3716\">Philippine Art Gallery</a>. Antonio continues to hold exhibitions and shows such as <b><i>Masters of Modernism: <strong><strong><strong>Angelito Antonio</strong></strong></strong></i></b>, 2013, at Galerie Joaquin and <b><i>La Musique </i></b>(The Music), 2014, with Michael Cacnio and Dominic Rubio, at Galerie Stephanie, Libis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antonio received awards in the Shell National Students Art Competition: third prize, <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Beginning Is Green</i></b>, 1958; second prize, <b><i>Kristo</i></b> (Christ), 1963; and certificate of merit, <b><i>Mag-iisda</i></b> (Fish Seller), 1964. His awards from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> include the following: third prize, <b><i>Mananahi</i></b> (Seamstress), 1962; second prize, <b><i>Deposition</i></b>, 1963; honorable mention, <b><i>He</i></b>, 1969; first prize, <b><i>Oracion</i></b> (Evening Prayer), 1970; special award, <b><i><strong><strong>Procession</strong></strong></i></b>, 1970; and major award, <b><i>Pangarap sa Buhay</i></b> (Life&rsquo;s Dream), 1972. He won first prize in the Travellers Life art competition, 1961; first prize in the UST 300th Anniversary, 1962; second prize in the Travellers Life art competition, 1963; and first prize in the Philippine Airlines art contest, 1968. He received the Thirteen Artists Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 1970.

She was&nbsp;born in&nbsp;Tandubas, Tawi-Tawi on 5 Jun 1925. She died on 2 Apr 2013.&nbsp;Her parents were Abubakar Bitao and Malak I. Bitao. Appi belongs to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> indigenous group from Tawi-Tawi, where the knowledge and practice of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2106\">mat weaving</a> is traditionally upheld by women in the community. From harvesting and preparing the pandan<i> </i>(pandanus) leaves, to designing and weaving the mat, the women in the Sama culture are knowledge-bearers of the materials, processes, and mat designs that abide by the principles of applied mathematics. Although Appi uses the traditional processes of mat weaving, she has also introduced innovative designs through the Sama mats, which in her hands take three months to create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">First, wild pandan leaves are harvested from the forest, preferably the thorny leaf variety that produces stronger and sturdier matting strips. Appi used a <i>jangat deyum</i> or stripper to make long and even strips from the pandan leaves that were then left to dry under the sun for three to four days. Using a large log, the strips were made to go through the process of <i>pinaggos</i> (pressing) until these became pliant enough for weaving. The strips were then dyed by boiling in a vat with hot water mixed with <i>anjibi</i> or commercial powder dye. Appi created colorful mats featuring complex geometric patterns with a sense of symmetry and proportion. Not satisfied with the color saturation of commercial dyes, she was known to have experimented with the use of anjibi in creating her own color palette and developing her own tints to obtain the strong and vibrant hues she preferred in her creations. She favored the colors red, purple, and yellow, featuring up to eight colors for a complicated design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process of weaving starts from the central strip to form the mat&rsquo;s backbone, expanding outward to the <i>tabig </i>or edges, keeping in mind the principles of symmetry wherein the geometric designs mirror or complement each other. Working on a base of 10-20 strips, Appi used strong visualization techniques in creating the designs, rather than relying on any mathematical formula. A plain white outer mat served as backing for the colorful woven mat she made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Appi was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 2004. Before Appi&rsquo;s passing in 2013, she was able to share her knowledge with her daughters and granddaughters, who remember her as a patient and gentle teacher who strove for perfection and had a sense of pride in the art of mat weaving. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Cecilia S.

He was born in&nbsp;Cagayan Valley on 31 Jan 1962, while she was born in&nbsp;Manila on 11 Oct 1965.&nbsp;Alfredo&rsquo;s parents are Alfredo A. Aquilizan and Iluminada Doran, while Isabel&rsquo;s parents are Florencio Gaudinez and Aurora Constantino. The Aquilizans are married and have five children. Their son Miguel is also an artist. They live and work in Brisbane, Australia. Alfredo received his bachelor of fine arts from the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University in 1986. He finished his master of fine arts at Anglia Polytechnic University in Norwich, United Kingdom, in 1997 and his doctor&rsquo;s degree at Queensland College of Art in Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, in 2012. Isabel received her degree in communication arts, major in theater arts production, from Assumption College. Alfredo and Isabel have taught visual and theater arts respectively at the Philippine High School for the Arts. Alfredo also taught at the University of the Philippines Los Ba&ntilde;os.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Together, they create collaborative art projects that invite reflection on notions of identity, home, culture, and community. Their works are largely shaped by their experience of displacement and migration, having to relocate to Australia in 2006 to earn a living and raise a growing family. Often process-based, their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a> relate to their condition as artists in transit to accomplish projects even while tending to their own home. From 1997 to 2007, they worked on <b><i>Be-longing</i></b>, a cumulative project involving the participation of communities they worked with through the collection of materials, to other aspects of their creative process which includes sharing personal stories revealing what these mostly domestic objects mean to their owners and why they would be willing to part with them as part of the Aquilizans&rsquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblages</a> and installations. The materials they use are often recyclable or ephemeral; they may also be mundane objects collected over time. Personal possessions are employed to harness referential qualities, to evoke ideas about the act of remembrance itself. <b><i>Project Be-longing # 2 </i></b>consisting of salt, household items, sound and olfactory elements, was installed as part of the Third Asia Pacific Triennial (APT) of Contemporary Art, 1999. <b><i>Presences and Absences </i></b>involved gathering thousands of toothbrushes that were put together in an installation for the 6th Havana Biennial in Cuba, 1998. The objects they install are imbued with personal or collective narratives, as exemplified by <b><i>Wings</i></b>, 2009, a work comprised of translucent slippers collected from Singaporean prison inmates. These objects were fashioned into angels&rsquo; wings as an expression of yearning for freedom. Another example is the <b><i>Dream Blanket Project</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>a dense and orderly arrangement of blankets coupled with sound articulating the dreams of its participants. It was exhibited in Manila and Busan in 2002, and in Queensland and the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The movement of things, people, and ideas in the contemporary world is a recurring theme in the work of the Aquilizans. <b><i>Another Country </i></b>gave rise to projects such as <b><i>Address</i></b>, an installation of the artists&rsquo; personal things formed into a large cube; <b><i>In-habit</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>where a miniature city of cardboard boxes encroach upon the exhibition space; and <b><i>In-flight </i></b>a project for APT 6, 2009, which used recycled materials and involved museum visitors co-creating handheld airplane toys.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>RENE AQUITANIA&nbsp;</b>(<b>Rene Mallari Aquitania</b>) is a performance artist. He was born in Baguio City on 18 Aug 1961. He is the youngest child of Carlos Padrique Aquitania and Juanita Naku Mallari. Aquitania&rsquo;s art encompasses theater, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>. He was introduced to art by older cousins Bayard Aquitania (of the now defunct Baguio Arts Council) and Benjie Mallari. Although he spent a semester at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts</a>, he is essentially self-taught. He is well-read and with substantial exposure to protest organizations and artists from academe and cultural institutions. He takes inspiration from nature and what he calls the &ldquo;ephemeral world of spirits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He is known for striking performances done as part of the protest movement in the politically charged atmosphere of the Philippines ca 1980-90. He performed in a variety of venues: streets, parks, Malate bars, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of Philippines</a> (CCP) Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino (also known as the CCP Little Theater), Music Museum, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\">Pinaglabanan Gallery</a> in Manila, and Caf&eacute; Amapola&rsquo;s Renaissance Gallery in Baguio. In 1980, he served as resource person for Makiling-trained and CCP artists bound for theater performances and art events in Baguio. He enrolled in UP when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a> was dean of the College of Fine Arts, but the economic and political turmoil triggered by the death of Ninoy Aquino in 1983 found him out of school and back in Baguio. He then started earnestly performing his pieces; getting ideas for concepts from reading papers on issues of the day, from Japanese Kabuki theater, and from fellow Baguio artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\">Roberto Villanueva</a>. Aquitania and Villanueva were engaged in a form of community art making in and around Baguio as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\">BenCab</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a>, and Katrin de Guia all decided to settle in the city. These artists along with David Barradas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3578\">Tommy Hafalla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3641\">Willy Magtibay</a>, Briccio Santos, and Vince Villareal became the core founders of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild</a> in 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finding himself in Belgium after the 1990 Baguio earthquake, Aquitania took formal studies in printmaking. Upon returning to the Philippines, he taught theater and printmaking in poverty-stricken communities at art workshops with the Baguio Arts Guild. He then immersed himself for two years in a Cavite slum. It was during this period that his work consisted of the ritualistic cleaning up of abandoned public spaces and turning these into active art spaces. Of the more formal and documented of his performances, the most prominent is <b><i>Art for <strong><strong>Peace</strong></strong></i></b>, 1986. This was a 129-mile walk done over five days straight on the highway from Baguio to the CCP during which Aquitania was lugging a makeshift vegetable pushcart. Objects accumulated during this journey was displayed along with the pushcart in a group exhibition at the CCP titled &ldquo;The Nature of Influence.&rdquo; Another work, <b><i>Proposal: Tocucan Bridge</i></b>, 1992, was performed a few times as part of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a>&rsquo; Neo-Filipino program at the CCP Little Theater. The concept for this piece comes out of a Cordillera rite that brought two tribes together through the act of making a bridge to span the breadth of the river separating them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The participatory aspects of Aquitania&rsquo;s work surfaced when he was in his 20s, when he began collaborating with ballerinas schooled in the classical tradition, Pinoy rock stars, street children, and beggars. This willingness to engage various publics informed by a consistent desire to conflate art making and everyday life continues to influence the practice of emergent performance, film, and visual artists both within and beyond Baguio, which continues to be Aquitania&rsquo;s work base and home. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>\r\n<em><strong>Written by Kelly P.

He was born in Cebu on 24 Dec 1912. He died in&nbsp;Bogo, Cebu on 29 Oct 1975. He studied fine arts at the University of the Philippines, 1932-34. At the age of 26, his works attracted the attention of the American press and was featured in magazines such as <b><i><strong>Sculpture</strong> Outside and</i></b> <b><i>Inside New York</i></b>. He is credited with having made the main altar of the Cebu City Cathedral. He operated the Araneta Sculptural Works Studio in Cebu City and is acknowledged as the first mentor of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3376\">Napoleon V. Abueva</a>, National Artist for visual arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Araneta is also known for portraiture. His style may be described as impressionistic, as in a sketch that captures the essence of the subject but without the rendition being thoroughly detailed. His <b><i>Ike</i></b>, 1953, on wood, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> is a good example, perhaps based on a line drawing of American president Dwight Eisenhower laughing heartily. Araneta enlivened this work through the use of texture, obtained by minutely chiseling the expanse of the entire surface. The artist has two other works at the National Museum&mdash;namely,<b><i> Portrait of Sergio Osme&ntilde;a</i></b>, 1952, and <b><i>Bust of Lapulapu</i></b>, 1954. Araneta is also reputed to have done the replica of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong></i></b> at the University of the Philippines campus in Cebu City, based on his design adapted from the 1935 version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Araneta won first prize for <b><i>Ike</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> exhibition of 1953.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>JERRY ARAOS&nbsp;</b>(<b>Jerusalino Villamor Araos</b>) was a sculptor and landscape artist. He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 5 Jul 1944. He died in Manila on 23 Dec 2012. The son of Severiano Araos and Juliana Villamor, he was married to Melendre Valencerina with whom he had six children, among whom are visuals artists Julian and Liwa. He studied English at the University of the East. Araos was founder of the artists&rsquo; guild Sanayan Lapat Kamay Inc (Salakai).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A self-taught sculptor with little formal training, he formed structure-ensembles from old weathered wood, planks, beams, stairs, and various architectural relics from demolished houses. He composed his materials into interrelated modular arrangements occupying a large space. In his heavy constructions, the dialogue between solid material and interior/exterior space is experienced as the viewer moves in and around the structures. His themes draw from the issues and concerns of the present: freedom, personal and national, or the lack of it. The modular approach is found in the Bartolina<b><i> </i></b>(Isolation Cell) series composed of cell-like units, which can be arranged and rearranged at will into levels of barred compartments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Araos invites his viewers to walk into prisonlike structures for an experience of cramped physical confinement with dehumanizing effect. In a well-known work, the large multisided form of the balimbing fruit shows pairs of nude backs carved in relief on both sides of several suspended planes. This work was a political comment on the duplicity and opportunistic jockeying for power by traditional politicians during the transition period from the Marcos to the Aquino government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the more formal side, Araos produced a number of nudes in wood in which the veins and marks of the material enhance the plasticity of the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a landscape artist, he designed outdoor spaces such as Kasalikasan at Bonifacio Global City. The Araos Garden in Antipolo also features his <b><i>Luklukan Chairs</i></b>, wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> of the human torso carved to accommodate the rumps of people sitting on them, a way of promoting the user&rsquo;s well-being. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span class=\"BioTrajan\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">JUAN </span><span class=\"Runrighthead\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">ARCEO</span>, also known as Juan Arzeo, was a painter. He was born ca 1785. He died&nbsp;ca 1870. He was one of the earliest recorded oil painters in the history of Philippine art. The details of Arceo&rsquo;s life, the dates of his birth and death, remain unconfirmed although it is known that he was a resident of San Fernando de Dilao (now Paco) in the mid-19th century. The peak of his activity seems to have been the 1840s to the 1850s, when he attracted the attention of three seminal writers. Sinibaldo de Mas, in his <b><i>Informe Sobre el Estado de las Islas Filipinas en 1842</i></b> (Brief on the State of the Philippines in 1842) compared Arceo to Vicente Lopez, the Spanish court painter of the 1840s. He stated: &ldquo;the Lopez of Manila, is actually called Alceo [sic] who works from a bamboo easel and has done various large canvases of the martyrs in China and Japan in the convents &hellip;&rdquo; Jean Mallat in <b><i>Les Philippines</i></b> (The Philippines), 1846, related that among the outstanding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> in Manila were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> paintings and oil portraits of Arceo. On the other hand, Rafael Diaz Arenas in <b><i>Memorias Historicas</i></b> (Historical Notes) wrote: &ldquo;After Damian [Domingo], Arceo excelled in the art of portraiture, the former residing in Tondo and the latter in Paco.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The statements of de Mas, Mallat, and Arenas are corroborated by the existence of several signed and/or dated works by Juan Arceo, many of them life-size. The earliest is the portrait of Arch Fray Juan Antonio Zulaybar, signed and dated 1820, in the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Museum. Characterized by rigid frontal presentation of the subject, this is evidently an early work of the artist. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2180\">La Extasis de San Pascual Baylon</a> </i></b>(The Ecstasy of Saint Paschal Baylon), which is signed and dated 16 Apr 1836, on the other hand, shows the full maturity of Arceo&rsquo;s art. In the central kneeling figure of the saint framed by the vignettes of his life are seen the delicacy of the artist&rsquo;s miniaturistic techniques, his masterful handling of the oil medium to evoke realistic textures, and his deep psychological characterization of the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arceo&rsquo;s portrait of Fr Manuel Blanco, author of <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b> (Plants of the Philippines), appears as a print in the book. His portrait of Fray Pedro de Santa Teresa, signed and dated 1840, shows the subject in his study cell with <i>capiz</i> (oyster shell) windows in the background. He is depicted writing on the page of a book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Juan Arceo&rsquo;s two portrait paintings of the Azcarraga family in the 1820s show the family of General Marcelo Azcarraga in their formal wear, showing the fashion of the times inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte, including empire-waisted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">dresses</a>. <b><i>Retrato de la Familia Azcarraga</i> </b>(Portrait of the Azcarraga Family), 1824, features the general&rsquo;s parents, Jose Azcarraga y Ugarte and Maria Isidra Palmera y Bersoza, with his two sisters and the maid, dated &ldquo;February 16, 1824.&rdquo; The 1827 painting features a child, Jose Jr, on a rocking horse with his sister Pilar and maid, dated Nov 1827 (Nakpil 2015). The presence of the <i>ninera </i>or <i>yaya</i> (maid) in<i> saya</i> (skirt), <i>tapis</i> (overskirt), and pa&ntilde;uelo<i> </i>(shawl) with<i> peineta </i>(hair comb) gives an interesting dynamic relationship in the family portrait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are many other extant signed works by Arceo as well as unsigned ones attributed to him. As the successor to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3525\">Damian Domingo</a> who died in 1834, he painted hundreds of canvases for the churches and convents of Intramuros. Before World War II, the Dominicans transferred many of Arceo&rsquo;s canvases from the convent in Intramuros to the new UST building on Espa&ntilde;a, thus saving several of the master&rsquo;s works from destruction. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born&nbsp;ca 1945. Arcilla is a jewelry maker in Paracale, Camarines Norte, who makes gold filigree in traditional designs, continuing Paracale&rsquo;s jewelry tradition coming from the Spanish times. Paracale, a gold-mining town since the early days of Spanish colonial rule, was the base of a Hispanic jewelry-making tradition, which evolved such traditional styles as the <b>agrimon</b>, also called <b>alpajor</b> or <b>alakdan</b>, a flat necklace chain used in the 18th century, and the <b>tamburin</b>, an intricate filigree bead necklace that became popular in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Paracale&rsquo;s 1,000-strong population of <i>panday</i> (goldsmiths), Arcilla is reputed to be the only one faithful to tradition, maintaining the use of tools, methods, and designs of two centuries prior. He was trained in the craft by one of the town&rsquo;s elders since Arcilla was 14 years old. He continued to produce high-carat, intricate jewelry, distinguished by a reddish patina, which is obtained by an ardent process called <b>sinasapo</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, Arcilla was one of the first folk artists conferred by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> the honor Manlilikha ng Bayan &ldquo;for preserving and continuing the old and endangered traditions of gold filigree jewelry making in Bicol Province.&rdquo; <em><strong>Written by Rosalinda Galang, updated by Zeny May D.

He finished his early education at Caramoan Elementary School and secondary education at Caramoan High School. He obtained his degree in fine arts at the University of the Philippines in 1960. Arcilla pursued advanced studies in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> at the University of Hawaii in 1975. He also received a scholarship grant to the Ecole de Beaux Arts, Paris, from the French government. He taught sculpture at the University of the East and was a board member of the Society of Philippine Sculptors. He held his first solo exhibition at the Manila Hilton in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arcilla is primarily known for figurative abstraction in bronze. Sometimes he adds other materials for contrast or to enhance his themes. His forms are schematic to convey the essence of the subject, mainly through geometric simplification.

She was born in&nbsp;Manila on 21 Nov 1949. She is the daughter of Liwayway Almario and Otilio Arellano. She was married to Michael Adams with whom she has a daughter, the singer-composer-musician Mishka Adams. She completed her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in psychology at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, and returned to take on a second degree in fine arts, major in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">UP College of Fine Arts</a>, 1984-90.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She is co-founder and president of the nonstock, nonprofit <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\">Pinaglabanan</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\"> Galleries Inc</a> and is director of various corporations. Built on the site of her ancestral home, which was razed in a 1981 fire that killed her parents, Pinaglabanan Galleries ran an exhibition space that was first directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a>, Arellano&rsquo;s mentor, from 1984 to 1990. It was the site of many cutting-edge presentations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">multimedia</a> art, such as the 1989 exhibition <b><i>Lemuria</i></b>, which was put together by the Baguio-based trio of filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a> (pseud. of Eric de Guia), painter and psychologist Katrin de Guia, and musician Shant Verdun. Pinaglabanan also fostered interactions between the literary and the visual arts with <b><i>Chromatext</i></b>, a series of exhibitions initiated by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5588\">Philippine</a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5588\"><strong> </strong></a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5588\">Literary Arts Council</a> (PLAC). Pinaglabanan Galleries now serves as an organizer and sponsor of exhibitions in other venues, and as a source of support for researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arellano usually works in plaster or marble that is modeled and cast from her own body, creating life-size figures that are filled with motifs appropriated from a vast range of religious, historical, literary, and biographical sources, and subsequently recombined in ways that can be ambiguous and bewildering. She has produced thematically related groups of sculptures that she calls &ldquo;inscapes.&rdquo; Used by the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins to refer to the design that distinguishes the identity of one individual from another, the term, in Arellano&rsquo;s lexicon, pertains to the integration of concept and form into a meaningful whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her habitual deployment of myths, particularly her references to gods and goddesses, and her use of the female nude have given rise to the charge that her art may, on the one hand, celebrate women, but, on the other hand, also reduce them to a fixed, universal essence based on their biological and, especially considering the erotic connotations of her sculptures, sexual characteristics. She has insisted, however, that her imagery and art-making processes constitute metaphors for the continuous exploration and uncovering of her identity as a woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her first solo show was <b><i>Myths of Creation and Destruction I</i></b>, held in Manila in 1988. It consisted of two pieces&mdash;namely, <b><i>Carcass-Cornucopia</i></b>, 1987, and <b><i>Music for Making the Sun Rise</i></b>, 1987. The latter, consisting of a long box filled with lines of coarse sand and small skulls, is an example of &ldquo;sound sculpture.&rdquo; Arranged purely on visual considerations, it was then interpreted as a musical composition by several instruments and male and female voices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arellano has also been involved in group shows at home and abroad, including <b><i>Iskultura: From <strong><strong><strong>Ani</strong></strong></strong>to to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\"><strong>Assemblage</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Sculpture: From Anito to Assemblage), 1991, at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila and <b><i>Who Owns Women&rsquo;s Bodies</i></b>, 2000-02, a traveling exhibition. She has participated in the Fifth and Sixth Havana Biennales, 1994 and 1997; the First Johannesburg Biennale, 1995; and the Third Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, 1999. She has twice been recognized by the city of Manila with its Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award for her contributions to art and culture: in 1988 for the visual arts&mdash;specifically, for Pinaglabanan Galleries&mdash;and in 2002 for sculpture. Arellano received the Thirteen Artists Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 1988. <em><strong>Written by Jaime Oscar Salazar</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Araneta, Elvira. 2013. &ldquo;Remembering Pinaglabanan Galleries.&rdquo;<em> Inquirer.net</em>, 18 Nov. http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/137495/remembering-pinaglabanan-galleries.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

He was born in&nbsp;Quiapo, Manila on 14 May 1850. He died in&nbsp;13 Dec 1920. He was the son of Justo Arevalo and Esperanza Flores. His father was a sculptor who died when Bonifacio was seven years old. Bonifacio was married twice. His first wife was Trinidad Arevalo, with whom he had a son named Juan Arevalo, who became one of the Philippine revolutionaries in Cavite. His second wife was Benita Ocampo, with whom he had a daughter. Arevalo also had a son with Carmen Ordax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bonifacio was brought up by his uncle Jose Arevalo, also a sculptor, who gave him his first lessons in wood carving. He was sent to study dentistry and train at the San Juan de Dios Hospital, and in 1876 he opened a dental clinic in Quiapo. One of the few licensed dentists of Manila at the time, he enjoyed a lucrative practice and became the first president of the Sociedad Dental de Filipinos. He supported the Philippine Revolution and joined Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government, for which he was imprisoned first by the Spaniards in 1896, then by the Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the practice of his profession, Arevalo engaged in cultural activities. He executed sculptural works and was a patron of the arts. He was the financier and manager of Banda Arevalo, one of the finest bands of the period which furnished music at the seat of the revolutionary government in Malolos. He also built a <i>komedyahan</i> or <i>moro-moro</i> theater in his backyard and assembled a company of players that staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a> performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His sculptural works fall into three categories: those with religious subjects or motifs; <b>tipos del pais</b> or pieces depicting local customs, scenes, and occupations; and portraits. Some of his religious works are <b><i>La</i></b> <b><i>Purisima Concepcion</i></b> (The Immaculate Conception), one for the Iloilo Church and another for the Dagupan Church; <b><i>San Rafael</i></b> (Saint Raphael); <b><i>Cristo de Velasquez</i></b> (Christ of Velasquez), a copy in wood of Diego Velazquez&rsquo;s painting; <b><i>Ecce Homo </i></b>(Behold the Man); and <b><i>Calvario</i></b> (Calvary). Examples of his tipos del pais are <b><i>Bayad</i></b> (Payment), <b><i>Magmamais</i></b> (The Corn Vendor), and <b><i>Zapatero</i></b> (The Cobbler), all miniature studies. He sometimes employed a doll technique, as in <b><i>Mga Pulubi </i></b>(Beggars), in which the heads and hands of the figures are carved in wood and the garments fashioned from cloth. His portraits include those of the emperor and empress of Japan, which were exhibited at the Hanoi Exposition of 1902, and the busts of Gov-Gen Ramon Blanco and Cayetano Arellano for which he used <i>lanite</i> and santol wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arevalo won a gold medal in the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition) held in Manila in 1895.

She was born on 3 Aug 1914. She died on&nbsp;20 Dec 1969. She married fictionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5061\">Manuel Arguilla</a> who died during World War II. Dancer Benjamin Villanueva was her half-brother. She finished journalism at the University of the Philippines and was associated with the Veronicans, an organization of writers. She took postgraduate studies at Columbia University through several study grants, and served as editor of the <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b> before World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1951, Arguilla helped found the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3716\">Philippine Art Gallery</a>, which was instrumental in encouraging the development of modern art in the Philippines. She organized the first Philippine Cultural Exhibition in New York City and Washington, DC, as well as the Cultural Exposition of the Republic of the Philippines that traveled to various countries of Southeast Asia in 1962. Other exhibitions she organized were those at the Philippine Pavilion of the New York World&rsquo;s Fair, 1964; Sydney, 1963; Bonn, 1966; and Geneva, 1968.

She experimented in a lot of media, but her major output consisted mostly of oils. She also created outstanding watercolors. In her works in both media, she was concerned with capturing a Filipino essence in abstract stylized forms. Thus she used earth colors particularly for rendering the complexion of human figures. Working during the ferment of the Neo-Realist movement, she also adopted the use of a narrow, tilted sense of space in her own work, which led to an enhanced filled-up effect in compositions desired by artists then. In <b><i>Patterns of Leaves and Woman&rsquo;s Faces</i></b>, she adopted the multi-exposure device from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> to create an abstract composition out of the patterns of shapes of leaves and faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arguilla won awards from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>: second prize, <b><i>Portrait</i></b> 1950; third prize, <b><i>Noon Shadows</i></b>, 1950; honorable mention, <b><i>Gabi Gabihan</i></b> (Every Night), 1950; <b><i>Two Children</i></b>, honorable mention, 1951; <b><i>Landscape</i></b>, honorable mention, 1951; and gold medal for Best Criticism of Contemporary Art in the 1960s. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

There were 13 charter members: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3528\">Antonio Dumlao</a>, Ramon Peralta Jr, Nemesio Faustino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3538\">Severino Fabie</a>, Virginia Flor Agbayani, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3488\">Emilio Aguilar Cruz</a>, Candido Alcantara, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3467\">Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a>, Alfredo Pesta&ntilde;o, Fermin Sanchez, and Purita Kalaw-Ledesma, who became its first president. Its constitution was patterned after the Artists&rsquo; Equity, an American organization. Membership was open to painters, sculptors, graphic artists, art collectors, art patrons, and art lovers. Its first public activity was a retrospective exhibit of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The AAP sought to raise artistic standards and offered incentives to artists. Its goals were accomplished primarily through annual art competitions. At the First AAP National Art Exhibition, held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> on 3 Jul 1948, the first prize went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>. Other prizewinners were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, Diosdado Lorenzo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">Hernando R. Ocampo</a>. From 1948 to 1950 the competitions were in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>; in 1951 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> was added. Due to increasing tension between the moderns and conservatives, two categories&mdash;the conservative and the modern&mdash;were instituted in 1949. The struggle between the two camps came to a head in the 1955 Annual Art Competition, which coincided with the Rotary Golden Anniversary Award. In the AAP art competition, the first prize in the conservative category went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3678\">Oscar T. Navarro</a> and the second prize to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3495\">Gabriel Custodio</a>; prizes in the modern category went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3635\">Arturo Luz</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3389\">Jose P. Alcantara</a> won in sculpture. In the Rotary Awards, Galo B.Ocampo received first prize; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3744\">Manuel Rodriguez Jr</a> aka Boy Rodriguez, second prize; and Manansala, third prize. The conservative camp believed the panel of judges to be biased against them. They walked out from the AAP exhibit and instead displayed their artworks along Mabini St, Manila, thereby forming the Mabini Artists group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among those who served as presidents of the AAP are Arturo Luz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3565\">Wenceslao Garcia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3486\">Allan Cosio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3592\">Raul Isidro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3543\">Edgar Talusan Fernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3468\">Orlando Castillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\">Virgilio Aviado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\">Ramon Orlina</a>, Salvador Convocar, and Fidel Sarmiento. <em><strong>Written by Alice G.

He was born in Santa Cruz, Manila on 14 Dec 1869. He died on&nbsp;2 May 1925.&nbsp;He was born to Marcela Raymundo and Hilarion Asuncion, a portraitist and painter of religious subjects who was the son of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3418\">Leoncio Asuncion</a>, a wood-carver. He is the grandnephew of painters Antonio Mariano (known as <i>el mayor</i>, who was <i>gobernadorcillo</i> or mayor of Santa Cruz in Manila in 1805), Ambrosio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3417\">Justiniano</a>, and sculptor Manuel Tarsilo&mdash;all brothers of Leoncio Asuncion. He married Juana Hubero, with whom he had three children. Asuncion obtained his bachelor&rsquo;s degree at Ateneo de Manila in 1888. He also studied at the Escuela de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado, 1884-89, and at the Universidad de Santo Tomas. Upon the advice of his teacher, the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3748\">Felipe Roxas</a>, he went abroad to take advanced studies. He studied at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, 1891-95. While his compatriots excelled in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, he was mainly interested in the philosophical and historical aspects of art, winning first prize in his history of art and costume classes, and second prize in his art theory class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon his return to Manila in 1895, Asuncion worked as an assistant in the School of Arts and Trade in Iloilo until 1898. He took an active part in the second stage of the Philippine Revolution and was forced to retreat to the hinterlands in the face of advancing American forces. However, after a while, he managed to reach Leyte. There he painted landscapes and drop curtains for local <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a> and set up a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> business with his brother. In 1905, he left for Manila and studied law. He joined the Partido Independista and contributed articles to several publications: the party&rsquo;s organ <b><i>La</i></b> <b><i><strong>Independencia</strong></i></b>, <b><i>El Ilonquillo</i></b> (where his illustrations also appeared), <b><i>La Voz de Mindanao</i></b>, <b><i>La Union</i></b>, <b><i>El Estudiante</i></b>, <b><i>El Renacimiento</i></b>, <b><i>The Independent</i></b>, and <b><i>Dia Filipino</i></b>. Together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3532\">Rafael Enriquez</a>, Asuncion established the Sociedad Internacional de Artistas and, in 1908, organized the Exposicion de Bellas Artes y Industrias Artisticas (Exposition of Fine Arts and Artistic Industries) to welcome a visiting American squadron. The following year, he began teaching at the new <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts</a> and served as its secretary from 1911 until his death in 1925.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3416\">Jose Maria Asuncion</a> submitted 12 paintings to the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition) in 1895 and two pieces to the Saint Louis Universal Exposition in 1904.

He was born in&nbsp;Santa Cruz, Manila on 24 Sep 1816. He died in&nbsp;Bulan, Sorsogon on 24 Oct 1896. He was the son of Mariano Asuncion, who was <i>gobernadorcillo</i> (mayor) of Santa Cruz in Manila in 1805. His mother was Maria de la Paz Molo de San Agustin, a Chinese-Portuguese mestiza. He married Justina Parafina Gomez and lived in Sorsogon in 1886 until his death in 1896. He was the eighth and youngest son in a family of 12 artistically talented children. His brothers Antonio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3419\">Mariano Jr</a>, and Ambrocio grew up to be painters, while Manuel Tarsilo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3418\">Leoncio</a> became eminent sculptors. Some of them, including Justiniano himself, also served as gobernadorcillo of Santa Cruz. During his incumbency, he inaugurated the street now called Oroquieta, which at that time led to the San Lazaro Hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Justiniano trained in the studio of his elder brothers and must have gone to the Academia de Dibujo under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3525\">Damian Domingo</a>, from whom he probably acquired his mastery of a style called <b>miniaturismo</b>. In this style, the minutest details are painted as realistically as possible, even if the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> ground were as small as a thumbnail, as it is in the case of lockets. Every trace of brushwork is also carefully concealed. Another proof of Domingo&rsquo;s influence was that Justiniano did at least three sets of albums of Filipino costumes, called <b>album de trajes</b>, which were similar to what Domingo worked on before he died in 1834. While Justiniano signed these folios &ldquo;Justiniano Assumpcion,&rdquo; he signed most of his oils &ldquo;J.A.&rdquo; His earliest signed and dated painting is <b><i>San Bonifacio</i></b>, 1838.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1850s, he came to be known for his exquisite portraits of the elegant ladies of his time. In one portrait of his niece Romana Asuncion&nbsp;Carillo, a sunset lies in the background to highlight the serenity of the sitter. This is the first time in Philippine art history in which the landscape is used for psychological and romantic realism. His portraits were done in miniaturistic realism, with the embroidery of the blouses&nbsp;of the ladies delicately rendered. Asuncion also executed locket-size and palm-size miniatures. He also painted the portraits <b><i>Dolores Paterno</i></b> and <b><i>Filomena Asuncion-Villafranca</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Asuncion became so skilled in rendering realistic figures and scenes that his works became illusionistic. A two-dimensional painting would give viewers the impression that what they were seeing was three-dimensional and real, as evident in the <b><i>Virgen de <strong><strong>Antipolo</strong></strong></i></b> (Virgin of Antipolo). To further this, the artist is said to have used his skills to play jokes. At one time he painted a set of coins on the lid of a chest, prompting the beholders to comment on the carelessness of the owner. He also painted a falling child on the wall directly under a window, which evoked cries of fright from passersby. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born in Santa Cruz, Manila on 1813. He died in 1888. He was one of the 12 artistically gifted children of Mariano Asuncion, <i>gobernadorcillo</i> (mayor) of Santa Cruz, Manila, in 1805. His mother was Maria de la Paz Molo de San Agustin, a Chinese-Portuguese mestiza. He was the brother of painters Antonio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3419\">Mariano Jr</a>, Ambrosio, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3417\">Justiniano</a>; and sculptor Manuel Tarsilo. Leoncio Asuncion married Petrona Eloriaga and became the father of painter Hilarion Asuncion, b. ca 1840, who in turn was the father of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3416\">Jose Maria Asuncion</a>, 1869-1925, the first secretary of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts</a>. When he was a child, there was yet no formal school in which to study the art of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>. He entered one of the <i>talleres</i> (studios) in his district Santa Cruz, which has been a beehive of artists and artisans since 1741. He probably studied under the earliest recorded sculptor from Santa Cruz, Anastacio de Jesus. In 1839, he and his brother Manuel Tarsilo established their own studio on Calle Santa Rosa (now Evangelista). Manuel Tarsilo died in 1854, thus it would be Leoncio who would become known for sculptural masterpieces. By the 1850s, his career as a carver was already established. Many of the younger generation of carvers went to apprentice in his shop, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3799\">Domingo Teotico y Eugenio</a>, 1853-1904, also an outstanding sculptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A carver during that time had to be versatile in two mediums: wood and ivory. Asuncion is remembered for his life-size group sculpture positioned as the ninth Station of the Cross, also known by its Spanish title <b><i>Tercera Caida</i></b>. This work was found in the Santa Cruz Church and was carried around in procession during Holy Week. There are only a few pieces authenticated as his work&mdash;among them, a <b><i>Santo Cristo</i></b> (Crucifix) and <b><i>La Purisima Corazon de Maria</i></b> (The Purest Heart of Mary), both made of ivory. The <b><i>Santo Cristo</i></b> is depicted in the <i>expirante</i> (expired) stance, which suggests the moment when Christ called out, &ldquo;Father, why hast thou abandoned me?&rdquo; On the other hand, the <b><i>Purisima</i></b> is a half-figure of Mary adorned at the bosom with a heart stabbed by a dagger. Both are of the <b>quita y pone</b><i> </i>variety, in which the image is an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblage</a> of smaller parts. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He died on&nbsp;7 Nov 1885. His parents were Mariano Asuncion <i>el mayor </i>and Maria de la Paz Molo de San Agustin. He is the brother of painters Antonio, Ambrosio, Mariano Jr, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3417\">Justiniano</a>, and sculptors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3418\">Leoncio</a> and Manuel Tarsilo. The Academia de Dibujo was established in 1823 and it is presumed that Mariano Asuncion, 21 years old at the time, had gone to study there, as was evident in his miniaturistic style, which was taught at the academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Acclaimed for his religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>, Asuncion produced hundreds of works, of which some 20 signed and dated pieces are still in existence. His earliest work is the <b><i>Vera Efigie de San Agustin</i></b> (Authentic Portrait of Saint Augustine), 1838, which is remarkable for the suppleness of the saint&rsquo;s features and brilliance of color as rendered. The next dated piece is the mural-sized <b><i>Milagro de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Carmen</i></b> (Miracle of Our Lady of Carmel), 1850. Then there is the <b><i>Extasis de San Francisco</i></b> (Ecstasy of Saint Francis), 1864, in which many objects are realistically rendered to the minutest detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mariano is especially known for his many versions of the <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario </i></b>(Our Lady of the Rosary). These paintings show Mary from the waist up, with a rosary in her right hand as she carries the child Jesus, who also holds a rosary. They were mainly commissioned by the affluent for their private altars, and eloquently expressed the prosperity of the patrons. The figures of Jesus and Mary are richly robed, wearing crowns studded with gems. Both are rendered with double chins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mariano was a member of the Venerable Orden Tercera de San Francisco. His obituary translates thus: &ldquo;Mariano Asuncion/The Virtuous Elderly Religious Limner/Dean of Native Painters/Juan de Juanes, Valencian Painter.&rdquo; The last phrase compared him to the master of religious painting from Valencia, Spain. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

It was opened on 15 Jun 1938 under the mentorship of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3530\">Victorio C. Edades</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3631\">Diosdado M. Lorenzo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>. It was located at the Union College at 622 Marcelo H. del Pilar St, Ermita, Manila. After a few months, the atelier moved to another branch of the Union College on Taft Ave. The atelier was closed in 1939 due to lack of funds. Its first director was Edades who resigned shortly after it opened. He was succeeded by Lorenzo, who continued on as director until the atelier closed. Lorenzo was designated as professor in charge of the atelier, while Ocampo served as the atelier&rsquo;s secretary and assistant to the professorial staff. A Mr Gutierrez handled interior decoration classes, while Elsie Concepcion handled art classes for children. Concepcion was also supposed to collaborate with Edades in pioneering a modern children&rsquo;s art pedagogy program patterned after the Van Cizek method in Vienna, but no further progress came after Edades resigned. Students enrolled in classes via individual tickets, which were sold at two pesos per session of three hours each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The atelier&rsquo;s 1938 prospectus lay down its principles of teaching art based on the following precepts: &ldquo;to fulfill a long-felt need &hellip; (for) a student wishing to take art training in the methods used by the great Moderns &hellip; where anyone interested may drop in and paint or sketch under guidance; &hellip; each student has his own aptitudes (sic) which will be encouraged according to the progressive methods prevailing in the great modern art schools of America and Europe.&rdquo; The atelier prided itself in creating innovation in Philippine art teaching methods through the practice of the &ldquo;atelier&rdquo; system of instruction, wherein advanced art students were given their own studio space and a model for such students to paint without supervision, but those who would like to discuss their problems with each other in &ldquo;a frank and friendly way&rdquo; were given the opportunity to do so. In addition, the atelier also offered a special class in art appreciation &ldquo;to those who understand the principle that underlie all great art masterpieces. This class will constitute of illustrated lectures supplemented by laboratory work in drawing, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> in oil, or watercolor sketching.&rdquo; Finally, the prospectus also declared that &ldquo;no school in the world can teach art, but the Atelier of Modern Art can guide the student along his particular inclination in a full expression of the best that is in him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The atelier&rsquo;s use of the Parisian atelier method challenged art pedagogy in the academic system then being implemented by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a>, where professorial supervision and correction still occurred on a class-wide basis, and where individual creativity (specifically, that which deviates from the purely &ldquo;retinal&rdquo; or &ldquo;photo-realist&rdquo; rendition of subjects) was disallowed, thereby creating a homogenous school of graduates whose work was patterned after the style of their professors. Moreover, the atelier challenged the academic and conservative method of UP through an equally dogmatic interpretation of Modernism. Eventually, however, this polarization gave way to artists&rsquo; attempting &ldquo;virile&rdquo; expression in Filipino art making, which negotiated Western avant-garde concepts alongside the rediscovery of both traditional or &ldquo;folk&rdquo; arts. In addition, the atelier also pioneered art appreciation as a separate and specialized course that was tailored to art students, as well as the lay person interested in learning about aesthetics, art history, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122#criticism\">art criticism</a>. The atelier system would not prosper in Philippine art educational institutions until after the war. Modern pedagogies of drawing from real life and creative composition would be pursued at the University of Santo Tomas by Edades and by the 1950s at the UP, under modernist faculty like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3445\">Constancio Bernardo</a>. Art appreciation would later on be taught by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a> at Ateneo in the early 1950s and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3702\">Rod Paras-Perez</a> at UP in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In its first and only year of operation, the Atelier of Modern Art boasted art lectures from architects like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, and Pablo Ocampo. An art exhibition featuring the works of Edades, Lorenzo, and Ocampo also served as a highlight, along with their respective profiles printed in the Atelier Prospectus. Other courses offered were drawing and painting, and fresco painting. Some of the atelier&rsquo;s most promising students and other faculty were subsequently listed by Edades in 1939 as the Thirteen Moderns of Philippine Art. Aside from Edades, Lorenzo, and Ocampo, the faculty included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>; while the students were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3464\">Arsenio Capili</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3487\">Bonifacio Cristobal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3640\">Anita Magsaysay</a> (later Mrs. Ho), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">Hernando Ruiz Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3703\">Jose Pardo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a>. Other artists who were associated with the atelier but were not listed under the Thirteen Moderns by Edades were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3752\">Simplicia &ldquo;Nena&rdquo; Saguil</a> who, along with Edades, Francisco, Legaspi, Manansala, and Hernando Ocampo would make up the postwar group called the Neo-realists. Despite the atelier&rsquo;s brief existence, it was thus instrumental in the group formation of the early Philippine Moderns just as it also represented a breakthrough in art pedagogic method that would influence teaching in larger and longer-running institutions such as the University of Santos Tomas and UP. <em><strong>Written by Reuben Ramas Ca&ntilde;ete</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>Guerrero, Amadis Ma., and Purita Kalaw-Ledesma. 1979. <em>Edades: National Artist</em>.

Atlas.<b>&nbsp;</b>He was a printmaker, who&nbsp;was active from&nbsp;1738-71. He was one of several highly accomplished engravers on copper in the 18th century. Lorenzo Atlas (previously identified as Laureano but with recent evidence seems to be Laurentius in Latin or Lorenzo in Spanish) is also one of the few 18th-century printmakers with extant examples of both his loose-leaf editions and book illustrations. Another engraver bearing the family name Atlas was active in the late 18th and early 19th centuries&mdash;namely, Vicente or Vicente Antonio, whose works were less interesting than Lorenzo&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Atlas&rsquo;s grandest work, <b><i>Verdadera Ymagen de la Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario de la Naval </i></b>(Authentic Portrait of Our Lady of the Rosary of La Naval), 1759, is an engraving on copper impressed on silk cloth. This is a rare example of a loose-leaf print that graced Filipino private altars. In 1743, he drew and etched the portrait of Arch Juan Angel Rodriguez, also on copper, the earliest known portrait of an individual who actually lived in the Philippines (no oil portrait antedates this). This appeared in <b><i>El Moyses Verdadero </i></b>(The True Moses), the biography of the subject by Fr Esteban de Roxas y Melo. Atlas&rsquo;s other works include <b><i>Glorioso Martyrio de los Veinte y Tres Protomartyres Franciscanos de Japon </i></b>(The Glorious Martyrdom of the 23 First Franciscan Martyrs of Japan) in volume 3 of <b><i>Chronicas de la Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio</i></b> (Account of the Apostolic Province of Saint Gregory), 1744, by Fr Juan Francisco de San Antonio; <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Rosa y Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Paz y Buen Viaje</i></b> (Our Lady of the Rose and Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage) in <b><i>Historia de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compa&ntilde;ia de Jesus </i></b>(History of the Province of the Society of Jesus), 1749, by Pedro Murillo Velarde; <b><i>Se&ntilde;or San Miguel</i></b> (Lord Saint Michael) in a novena in honor of the saint, 1751, and <b><i>Santa Rosa de Lima </i></b>(Saint Rose of Lima) in <b><i>Astro Brillante en el Mundo</i></b> (Brilliant Star on Earth), 1754, by Do&ntilde;a Leonarda Gil Gama. Atlas also engraved maps such as those of the ports of Caagayan and Sisiran, which illustrated the <b><i>Adicion de la Ordenanza de Marina </i></b>(Addendum to the Maritime Ordinance), 1757, by Pedro Manuel de Arandia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">That Atlas attained the highest degree of refinement in engraving is evident in his consummately detailed cross-hatching and stippling, which approximated all possible degrees of shading in drawing and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>. Not having had lessons in drawing from life, his renditions of the human figure show anatomical flaws. This is evident in <b><i>Aspecto Symbolico del Mundo Hispanico</i></b> (Symbolic Aspect of the Spanish World), which illustrated the doctoral thesis of Vicente de Memije. Atlas&rsquo;s last known work is the <b><i>San Francisco de Asis</i></b><i> </i>(Saint Francis of Assisi), which appeared in a life of the saint by Fr Antonio Bozal, 1771.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works were appreciated by the Spaniards of his time.

He was born in&nbsp;Shanghai, China on 5 May 1936. He is the son of Pedro Austria and Lucila Gilbuena. He married Tarcila Estepa with whom he has two children. He studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) where he taught <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> since 1969. He retired from teaching after 27 years and thereafter devoted his time to painting. His subjects are drawn from the elite and the ordinary, the urban and the rural: vendors, fortune-tellers, <i>sari-sari </i>(variety) stores, jeepneys, folk games, fiestas. His human figures, short and squat with flat, tubular limbs and stubby hands and feet, are simply and clearly defined, outlined in blue or other colors. His jeepneys are flattened out on the same plane as decorative patterns and motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compositionally, Austria&rsquo;s use of space follows the folk penchant for covering the entire field with elements of different shapes and colors. Such an approach stems from a passion for visually naming the objects of the material world rather than from any obsessive need to fill up vacant space. His fiesta paintings show outdoor settings with numerous figures massed around an activity, as an outdoor <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a> </i>(long hyperbolic verse plays), full of colorful costumes and lively movement as in his triptych <b><i>Pista</i></b>. It features three paintings done in 1978. The first work, <b><i>Prusisyon </i></b>(Procession), has rich colors that contribute to the sense of a religious fiesta. The second, <b><i>Moro-Moro</i></b>, shows a lit-up stage with actors against a cardboard castle backdrop.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>AUSTRIA, TAM </b>(<b>Atanacio Pefaranda Austria</b>) is a painter. He was born in&nbsp;Tanay, Rizal on 25 Aug 1943. He is the son of Mariano Austria and Reymunda Pefaranda. He is married to Mary Divine Sagara with whom he has two children. At age four, he saw the illustrations of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>, and in 1949 he completed his own illustration&mdash;a portrait of his mother (Aguilar 1999, 267). Austria had his early training under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, master painter of Angono. Later he went to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3810\">University of Santo Tomas (UST) School of Fine Arts</a> where he graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts in 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Austria ventured into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a> illustrations, sign <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, and on-the-spot painting on the streets of Ermita and Mabini. He became an illustrator for the Ayala Museum in 1967, creating the designs for the museum&rsquo;s diorama of Philippine history. Later, the Zobel de Ayala family commissioned him to create a mural for the Santuario de San Antonio in Forbes Park, Makati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A regional artist, Austria is known for his folk genre and interpretation of Philippine myths and legends. Among his early works were a Madonna-and-child series in somber tones, avoiding the usual sentimentality of the subject. In his folk genre works, mostly in sepia brown, a recurrent subject is a family traveling in a bull cart hung with an assortment of woven baskets. He works in a meticulous style, revelling in the details of numerous objects. One theme that Austria shares with the Laguna de Bay artists is the cult of woman, which is part of native folk romanticism. In one of his many versions of Mariang Makiling of folk legend, he shows the <i>diwata</i> (deity) in a forest idyll by a stream, playing with white doves perched on her delicate hands. In another painting, a woman with long tresses dressed in 19th-century costume reclines, fanning herself as she is borne in a rattan hammock by rugged men through the forest. Like many artists, Austria has also dealt with the fiesta and with folk rituals such as the Moriones festival. While his use of color is tempered, his paintings are marked by linear elegance and the filling up of space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has held numerous exhibits here and abroad. Austria&rsquo;s <b><i>Mother and Child</i></b> won fourth place in the 1982 Mobil Art Foundation. <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

She is married to painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3486\">Allan Cosio</a>. She studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas in 1959-61 and took special courses in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. She studied under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3745\">Manuel Rodriguez Sr</a> in his Contemporary Arts Workshop. She was co-founder of the Philippine Association of Printmakers (PAP) in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As printmaker, she did collagraphs which she constructed from beaten thumbtacks, bottle caps, discarded machine parts, and white glue markings. <b><i>Flag for Jasper Jolens</i></b>, 1968, and <b><i>Insight Out #3</i></b>, 1971, are examples of this technique. <b><i>Blue Movie</i></b>, 1970, is a collagraph print made from waste film strips that she glued, punched, and combined with beaten metal. In the 1980s, she concentrated on doing minimalist hard-edge paintings. Describing her process during this phase of her art as pure abstraction, she relates how she proceeded: &ldquo;Painting the square exactly in the middle of a larger square, moving it in another direction, pushing it against the border of a canvas, tilting it, enlarging or reducing it, using different tonalities, give unlimited possibilities.&rdquo; She however freely vacillates from geometric rigidities to organic and soft edges. In 1988-89, she used the same purely abstract design strategy in creating <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">mixed media</a> works, incorporating ethnic Philippine syllabary and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a> motifs. <b><i>Five Falls</i></b> and <b><i>Yakan Midnight</i></b> are examples of this experimentation which she rendered in handmade rice straw and mulberry paper combined with fiber, shells, and ethnic decorative bands. In 1992, her large-scale works collectively called <b><i>Lumang Abakada</i></b> (Old Syllabary) further explored this style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her solo exhibitions include <b><i>Recent Paintings</i></b>, Lopez Museum, 1987; <b><i>Tropical Flora</i></b>, Finale Art File, Makati, 1988; <b><i>Thirteen Nudes</i></b>, Finale Art File, Makati, 1989; <b><i>Papel Hibla</i> <i>Atbp</i></b>.

In the early years of the 20th century, he produced religious murals for around 20 churches and convents in Cebu, Bohol, and other parts of the Visayas. In 1917, he was commissioned to do a series of religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> to decorate the ceiling of Cebu&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Santo Ni&ntilde;o Church</a>. He is known to have suffered a near-fatal accident when he fell off a scaffolding while painting a church ceiling. He also did other works, including a portrait of Sergio Osme&ntilde;a in 1914. More importantly, he painted Visayan rural landscapes in vertical canvas format, showing scenes depicting activities and occupations, such as farmers in the field and peddlers on the road. His landscapes also showed the influence of Japanese and Chinese scroll paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like his contemporary Gonzalo Abellana, Avila also painted backdrops for plays, using what was called the <b>de aqua</b><i> </i>technique, which uses Muralo powder in water-based paints.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span class=\"BioTrajan\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">BACOLOR, FELIX</span><b> </b>is a visual artist. He was born in&nbsp;27 Nov 1967. Bacolor attained a degree in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> in 1989. He helped organize the First Dagupan National Arts Festival in Pangasinan in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An interest in living history is greatly evident in Bacolor&rsquo;s artistic practice. Whether with maps and actual artifacts, or the most ordinary objects like mass-produced toys or raw meat, the power of his art lies in its capacity to alter the way the objects are used, and then recast into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblages</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a>. Bacolor likens his practice to an &ldquo;archaeologist excavating artifacts.&rdquo; In the exhibit <b><i>Leavings</i></b>, 2012, at the West Gallery, the artist gathered the remains of art making from his studio. Through installations strategically placed in the gallery, Bacolor reassembled not only the discards of his art process but traced as well the inner workings of production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Constant in Bacolor&rsquo;s art are the strategies of experimentation and play. Most of his exhibitions combine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, and installation work. The endless combination of these forms and the avid research that informs them characterize Bacolor&rsquo;s art as inquisitive, provocative, and whimsical. In <b><i>Toy <strong>Stories</strong> </i></b>at Nova Gallery in 2013, Bacolor incorporated mass-produced plastic toys he had collected from Divisoria where they were bought in bulk. While the pieces referenced notions of play and childhood games, they were made to pivot on two central concepts: those of violence and collecting. The artist skilfully crafted them into pieces strategically installed in the gallery space, with one work leading to another, in a chain of signification that Bacolor deftly manipulated for viewers to discover and pursue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His exhibitions take into consideration the space and context where his pieces are installed. For the exhibition <b><i>Setting</i></b>,<b> </b>2014, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, Bacolor reconstructed the famed Manila Bay sunset in a video installation that incorporated a shallow pool of water, industrial fans to mimic surface ripples, and a sphere projected on a wall to represent the sun crawling toward the horizon. The piece, however, was devoid of drama and compelling beauty often associated with a sunset. Instead, in Bacolor&rsquo;s rendition the sunset appeared minimal and spare, stripped of emotion and human presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bacolor participated in group exhibitions in the Philippines and abroad including <b><i>Marcel Duchamp in Southeast Asia</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Equator Art Projects, Singapore, 2012; <b><i>Slipping Transmission</i></b>, Osage Soho, Hong Kong, 2011; and <b><i>Futuramanila</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Singapore and Hong Kong, 2008. Bacolor won second prize in the 1999 National Art Competition organized by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>. <em><strong>Written by Tessa Maria Guazon</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>Asia Art Archive. 2014b. &ldquo;Felix Bacolor: Swan Song.&rdquo; Accessed 20 Jun. http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/47610.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equator Art Projects. 2014.

He was born in Tambobong (now Malabon) ca 1701. He died ca 1790. He was associated with the Imprenta del Colegio de la Compa&ntilde;ia de Jesus from 1743 to 1768. Bagay and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3783\">Francisco Suarez</a> are noted for having appended &ldquo;Indio Tagalo&rdquo; (Tagalog native) to their names as these appeared in the 1734 map of the Philippines charted by the Jesuit Pedro Murillo Velarde.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bagay was earlier known as an engraver, and his first known work depicted the coat of arms of Gov-Gen Valdes Tamon which adorned the title page of the sermon of Fr Juan de Arechedera in praise of the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario in 1731. In 1734, he executed the 13 plates for <b><i>Navegacion Especulativa y Practica</i></b> (Theoretical and Practical Navigation), a primer on navigational charts and shipbuilding by Jose Gonzalez Cabrera. One of Bagay&rsquo;s works is a detailed drawing of a ship, above which is a legend containing the names of all its parts. In the same year, he worked on the Velarde map and a border panel consisting of six pictures showing various inhabitants of the colony. In 1760, he collaborated with Francisco and Luis Suarez to illustrate <b><i>Manga</i></b> <b><i>Panalanging Pagtatagobilin sa Caloloua nang Tauong Naghihingalo </i></b>(Prayers of Guidance for the Soul of the Dying) and its appendix <b><i>Mahal na Passion ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na&nbsp;</i></b><b><i>Tola </i></b>(The Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Verse) by Gaspar Aquino de Belen. The plates depicted different stages of Christ&rsquo;s suffering and his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bagay is the most prolific of the 18th-century engravers, with some 30 prints attributed to him. Other impressive works include <b><i>San Andres Apostol</i></b> (Saint Andrew the Apostle), 1735; <b><i>Santo Cristo</i></b> (Holy Christ), 1739; <b><i>San Francisco Javier</i></b> (Saint Francis Xavier), 1741; <b><i>La Santisima Trinidad sobre el Purgatorio </i></b>(The Holy Trinity above Purgatory), 1755; and an equestrian portrait of Fernando VI, 1758. His figures were characterized by rhythmic movement, and his scenes were presented from a multilevel or isometric perspective. His hatchings, cross-hatchings, and stipplings ranged from extremely fine to widely spaced. In some works, blocks of black areas contrasted with white, lending visual variety to his compositions. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Founded 1987 at the Renaissance Gallery of Caf&eacute; Amapola on Session Road, the Baguio Arts Guild is one of the longest-running art groups in the Philippines. BAG incorporators and first board members are David Baradas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3443\">Benedicto Cabrera</a>, Irineo Geslani, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4490\">Eric de Guia</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\">Roberto Villanueva</a>. The founding members are John Alaban, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3405\">Rene Aquitania</a>, Roland Bay-an, Teodoro Caja, Norman Chow, Jojo Elmeda, Katrin de Guia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3578\">Tommy Hafalla</a>, Monette Minas, Jordan Mang-osan, Christopher Mero, Nancy Pobanz, Virgilio Paterno, Eduardo Silayan, Fernando Torio, and Shant Verdun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Baguio Arts Guild is best known for the six international festivals it organized from 1988 to 2002 during which Philippine culture and the arts were celebrated and showcased in events that fostered good relations between artists and communities. The festivals enabled cross-cultural linkages within the Philippines and with countries around the Asia-Pacific region, with Japan and Australia as close partners. Locally, stronger ties were also forged with Makiling artists and artists from Negros. Participation and support came from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP), the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the city government, private organizations and corporations, schools and universities, and other art groups of different disciplines composed of dancers, musicians, theater actors, and writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baguio artists explored the use of indigenous materials and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">multimedia</a> as they worked on themes dealing with nature, the environment, sociopolitical realities, and the quest for what is Filipino in art. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">Performance</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation art</a> figured prominently. The festivals brought these art forms and concerns to a wider audience. After the festivals, Roberto Villanueva&rsquo;s striking installations using <i>runo</i> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2095\">bamboo</a> were seen outside of Baguio: <b><i>Archetypes: Cordillera Labyrinth</i></b>, 1989, at the CCP; <b><i>The Dream Weaver</i></b>, 1992, in Fukuoka, Japan; and <b><i>Bridge of Cross Culture</i></b>, 1992, in Lake Naguri, Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the years, BAG members have made a mark on the artistic landscape of the country, the most prominent being three of the founders: Benedicto Cabrera who became a National Artist in 2006 and established the BenCab Museum in Baguio City, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a> who is widely regarded among filmmakers as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/20/1054\">independent cinema</a> pioneer, and Santiago Bose who championed indigenous motifs and pop references to deliver postcolonial critiques through his installations and multimedia work. Bose received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 1976. A good number of visual artists associated with BAG have also received this award since then&mdash;namely, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3641\">William Magtibay</a>, Rene Aquitania, and Tommy Hafalla in 1992; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\">Alwin Reamillo</a> in 1994; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3381\">Leonardo Aguinaldo</a> in 2003; and Kawayan de Guia in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Between its members and across the organization, BAG earned many more awards and distinctions, both national and international. Kidlat Tahimik won first place for <b><i>Orbit 50</i></b> in the 1992 Gawad CCP para sa Alternatibong Pelikula at Video. Maria Luisa Aguilar-Cari&ntilde;o was a consistent winner at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Awards for Literature</a>. The BAG itself received a PILAK CCP Service Award for Culture and the Arts in the Community in 2004 and was given a Builder of Baguio Centennial Award in 2009 for being one of the organizations that became instrumental in shaping the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over time, BAG members have gone on to pursue their own artistic paths, some successfully establishing art groups of their own. Today the guild has dwindled in membership; but the organization still forges on with community-based activities, with members serving in committees, participating in public events, lecturing, judging art contests, exhibiting, and offering <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122#education\">art workshops</a> in partnership with nongovernment organizations. <em><strong>Written by Kelly P.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BALDEMOR, MANUEL </span></b>(<b>Manuel Dailo Baldemor</b>) aka Manny Baldemor is a painter. He was born in&nbsp;Paete, Laguna on&nbsp;26 Mar 1947. He is the son of Perfecto Baldemor and Felicitas Dailo. He is brother to sculptor Angelito. He belongs to an artists&rsquo; clan of Paete, a town known for wood carving. Baldemor is a product of both folk art tradition and fine arts training. He graduated from the University of Santo Tomas in 1968. Because of his exposure and training in the workshops of the wood-carvers and <b>santeros</b> (makers of religious images) of Paete, Baldemor decided to work on sculptural reliefs. Later, he also tried to develop the Paete industry of <b>taka</b><i> </i>(papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;) by designing flat wall taka depicting rural scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A consistent subject of his art has been his hometown, its people, their day-to-day activities, and their celebrations. He first attracted attention in the early 1970s with his pen-and-ink drawings, capturing in meticulous detail the folk spirit of Paete. A typical work would show flat superimpositions of winding streets, landscapes, wooden houses, ornaments of flower boxes, hanging plants, a figure of Christ or a saint surrounded by cloudlike garlands of sampaguita and ylang-ylang&mdash;all in a charming, decorative arrangement. Like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a> before him, he indigenized subjects such as religious feasts and the Last Supper by giving the characters a local cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baldemor has also worked in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>, many of his prints being still lifes of folk objects and utensils, as well as fruits and vegetables of backyard gardens. He has done a series of genre scenes using textile collage in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>. His style, while of a lively folk quality, also shows the influence of Manansala in its cubistic idiom. Baldemor&rsquo;s awards include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>&rsquo; major awards for <b><i>Filipino Home</i></b> and <b><i>Paete</i></b> in 1972 and 1973, respectively; honorable mention, <b><i>Huling Tagay</i></b> (Last Drink), 1974; and best entry, <em><strong>From a Farmer&rsquo;s Son</strong></em>, 1982. In Oct 2007, his painting titled&nbsp;<b><i>Karo ng Sorbetes </i></b>(Ice Cream Cart) was instrumental in capturing a UNESCO seat for the Philippines during the 34th general conference in Paris. His art is well known internationally as he worked as UNICEF&rsquo;s designer for 18 years, from 1990 to 2008. He was a Thirteen Artists awardee of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 1992. <em><strong>Written by Alice G.

He was born in Manila on 11 Jul 1937. He died in&nbsp;Quezon City on 6 Jan 2007. He was the son of Guillermo Baldovino and Dulcina Fletcher. He married Josefina Joya, sister of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3600\">Jose Joya</a>. In 1957, Baldovino started as a news photographer covering the International Airport for the Philippine News Service. From then on he either joined or contributed as a freelancer to other newspapers like <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b>, <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, <b><i>Daily</i></b> <b><i><strong><strong>Mirror</strong></strong></i></b>, <b><i>Sunday Times</i></b>, and <b><i>Philippines Herald Magazine</i></b>. Baldovino joined film productions as a still photographer in Gerardo de Leon movies like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><i>Noli Me Tangere</i></strong></a> (Touch Me Not), 1961; <b><i>The Moises Padilla Story</i></b>, 1961; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\"><strong><i>El Filibusterismo</i></strong></a><b><i> </i></b>(Subversion), 1962; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1145\">Daigdig ng mga Api</a> </i></b>(World of the Oppressed), 1965. In 1963, Baldovino became the first Filipino photographer to be hired by a foreign international publication, <b><i>The Asia Magazine</i></b>. This enabled him to travel extensively in the countries of Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and other Asian Pacific countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1966, Baldovino&rsquo;s photo essay on the Iglesia ni Cristo was included in the <b><i>Penrose Annual</i></b>, a yearly compilation of the world&rsquo;s best publications that feature the best in photojournalism. After martial law was declared in 1972, Baldovino turned to advertising where his photographs were used for annual reports, company brochures, posters, and print ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baldovino conducted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> workshops, judged photography competitions here and abroad, and exhibited his works in key cities around the world. One of his more important shows consisted of a national traveling exhibition of his collection of black-and-white photographs featuring National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, first shown at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baldovino is known for photographs that focus on visual arts and artists.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span class=\"Runrighthead\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BANAL</span></span><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">, YASON </span></b>(<b>Jason Baluyut Banal</b>) is an artist. He was born in Manila on 26 Aug 1972. He is the son of Jorge Lerma Banal Sr and Charminia Nuqui Baluyut. He earned his bachelor of arts in film at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in 1995 and his master of fine arts from Goldsmiths, University of London, in 2002. He teaches <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\">experimental film</a>, queer cinema, and special topics at the UP Film Institute (UPFI) and was coordinator for theater services in charge of the UPFI Film Center from 2009 to 2012. Banal has also served as visiting lecturer at the Tokyo National University of Fine Art and Music and the London Metropolitan University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banal founded and ran the short-lived but seminal site-specific project Third Space from 1998 to 2000 at a juncture when artist-initiated spaces were on the rise as emergent artists were also hosting exhibitions and programs at Surrounded by Water and Big Sky Mind. Third Space was a house turned laboratory space for alternative art lessons, film screenings, exhibitions, and happenings, including off-site interventions such as <b><i>Kaka-</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP), <b><i>Queenly Matter</i></b> in SM Megamall, and <b><i>Masa de Gala</i></b> in various churches and cruising spots. Banal&rsquo;s conceptual approach to work extends to curating and writing, which he occasionally does under the moniker Sonja Laban,<i> </i>even adopting an artist alias, WWW.KX3.BIZ. His whimsical and cryptic texts often appear as artist&rsquo;s curatorial statements and would, in one form or other, constitute the content of Banal&rsquo;s now-defunct column, Sleepwalking, in <b><i>The Philippine Star</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banal&rsquo;s creative and critical practice encompass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, text, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>. He infuses these with references to culture, language, and art history, usually with a playful tenor that allows him to slip critiques through the art world&rsquo;s own gatekeeping mechanisms. Done through performative and object-based approach often within institutional spaces themselves, Banal&rsquo;s interventions&mdash;such as a sold-off Christie&rsquo;s cyber domain, a starlet&rsquo;s suicide note emblazoned on the wall at the Ateneo Art Awards, the booths and passageways of art fairs, and even the display perimeters of canon-drawing survey shows&mdash;get his ideas enfolded into the systems he himself as an artist needs to work in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His shows are somehow linked, as they are all in varying ways on trial modes of art production, display and valuation, and the possible suppressed ties among the formal, the economic, the institutional and the social. His CCP exhibition <b><i>A Reading of Brightness Dark Clouds Surrounding </i></b>displayed documents related to the Metropolitan Museum&rsquo;s White Cube gallery for rent, banner portraits of 13 beautiful male artists (in lieu of the CCP 13 Artists), Super 8 film footage of the renovation of the former Senate Hall inside the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>, an original artwork by Damien Hirst guarded by CCP security, theory books and costume <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">jewelry</a> in vitrines, and scraped vinyl text from a commissioned work in the first Art Fair Philippines. He had Andy Warhol look-alikes in a standoff at the Tate Modern, Marina Abramovic styled mannequins reading <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Subversion) at Art Stage and art world gatherings shot in different cities and reimagined as a bourgeois <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\">horror film</a>. His photographs include portraits of male figures, mega gallery signages, grainy narratives, and screenshot collages. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">Sculptures</a> have involved consumed wine and champagne bottles crushed and shaped into minimalist cubes, faux <i>kamagong</i> structures lathered in pastel acrylic and tightening lotion, tarpaulin banners, neon light hyperlinks, and bronze pomegranates. His <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> perform a double take&mdash;black abstractions done in various brands of oil paint and studded with pearls, pastel impastos soaked in acid and the disintegration halted and preserved by a museum conservator, and green and blue paintings that double as chroma screens for film and photo shoots. A keen interest in norms, powers, and forms&mdash;their histories, economics, aesthetics, and agendas&mdash;has proven useful in exploring the tangled networks of art and society, their performers and markers, framing devices, and possible triggers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Residencies include Rijksakademie Amsterdam, Arts Initiative Tokyo, Platform 3 Indonesia, and Center for Contemporary Art Singapore. Solo exhibitions include Galerie Zimmermann, Edel Assanti, The Drawing Room, Osage Gallery, Mo Space, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3599\">Vargas Museum</a>. Group exhibitions include Tate Modern, Tate Britain, IFA Berlin, Oslo Kunsthall, Queens Museum of Art, Bangkok Art and Culture Center, Garage Museum of Art Moscow, Frieze Art Fair, Christie&rsquo;s, Sotheby&rsquo;s, Art Stage, Singapore Biennale, Shanghai Biennale, Jakarta Biennale, Sharjah Biennale, and Asia Pacific Triennale.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Pieces of the collection are on perennially rotated public exhibitions at a permanent space within the Metropolitan Museum of Manila and at the Money Museum, both located within the BSP complex in Malate, Manila. There are also paintings at the Philippine International Convention Center, the BSP main office building, and the BSP regional offices and branches. The collection has been variously featured in the Kayamanan book series, 1981-83, in <b><i>Ginto: History Wrought in Gold</i></b>, 2004, and in the Tanaw books, 2005, all published by the BSP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1950s, paintings, including some so-called Mabini artworks, began to be acquired to adorn the offices of the former Central Bank of the Philippines in Intramuros, Manila. During the term of Gov Gregorio S. Licaros (1970-81), the Central Bank moved to its present site in a building complex designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a>. Paintings by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3396\">Fernando C.

Laya</a> (1981-84) who systematized, expanded, and documented the art collection to include &ldquo;the origins of Philippine paintings&rdquo; as well as pre-Hispanic and colonial artifacts.

The books <b><i>Tanaw: Perspectives on the BSP Painting Collection</i></b> and <b><i>Tanaw: Catalog of the BSP Painting Collection </i></b>were consequently published in 2005.

She is the daughter of Julian Banzon, a nationally honored research scientist, and Vivencia Fernandez, a physician. Genara earned her bachelor of fine arts from the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in 1974, and completed a master&rsquo;s degree in development communication at UP Los Ba&ntilde;os in 1978. In 1992, she completed a master of fine arts in studio for interrelated media at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1974, Banzon worked closely with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3385\">Ray Albano</a>&rsquo;s group of conceptual artists who exhibited regularly at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP). Her works stood out as they focused on natural, creative processes. Banzon states: &ldquo;My main interest as an artist is to investigate indigenous and &lsquo;non-art&rsquo; materials, to invent procedures and systems in art making. I am concerned with making alive the forces or energies of local character and establishing installation as an art form.&rdquo; Her works were included in the exhibits <b><i>Site Works I and II</i></b> at the UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, <b><i>Art of the Regions </i></b>in Baguio, <b><i>Five Directions</i></b> at the Museum of the Philippine Art, <b><i>Trends in Philippine <strong>Sculpture</strong></i></b> and <b><i>Fiber as Art</i></b> both at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Based in Massachusetts since the late 1980s, Banzon has developed a multifaceted art career. She evolved a body of work that innovatively integrated use of natural materials (such as leaves, butterfly wings, and sand) and current technology (such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video</a> and X-ray plates) to comment on contemporary issues using her life experiences as an exile. Encouraging self-examination within the Filipino-American community, her work interweaves personal narratives with issues of migration. She has dealt with themes such as mail-order brides, the sex tourism industry, stereotyping of Asian women, and sociohistorical aspects of US and Spanish colonialism in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her major works in multimedia installation include <b><i>Bukid Art Inn</i></b> (Farm Art Inn) at the First Baguio Arts Festival and at the Black Swan Gallery in Australia; <b><i>Likha: La Orana Maria</i></b> (Creation: La Orana Maria) at the ARX &rsquo;87 in Perth, Australia; <b><i>Love Par Avion</i></b> at the Powerhouse Museum and Performance Space Gallery in Sydney in 1989; <b><i>Mahal Ba Kita?: The Economics of Love</i></b> (Do I Love You?: The Economics of Love) at the World Bank in Washington, DC; and <b><i>A Woman&rsquo;s View: Equality, Development and <strong><strong>Peace</strong></strong> </i></b>at the Art Gallery in the University of California, Irvine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her works have also been exhibited at the Third Asian Art Show at the Fukuoka Museum, Institute of Contemporary Art Boston Harvard Neighbors Gallery, the Fuller Museum of Art in Massachusetts, and the Dia Center for the Arts in New York.

He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 6 Oct 1957. His parents are Eugenio Barredo and Criselda Imutan. Born to an artistic family, he wanted to be a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> dancer and musician; in the mid-1980s he joined his sister <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2410\">Maniya Barredo</a> in a ballet company in Atlanta where he did costumes and sets, including huge screens. He studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> at the University of Santo Tomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While many of his works consist of chairs, seats, lamps, screens, and mirror or dock stands, their functional aspect is overshadowed by their sculptural quality. They even bear a relation to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> in their linear refinement and rich imagery. Often, the sculptural form, while integral in itself, doubles as a web for grouping of figures. Caught in the borderline between reality and fantasy, the question of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">material</a> and process comes to the fore. Figures are molded and hardened with layers of resin imparting a translucent glow. To execute his designs, he uses discards such as rods from bent and welded electric fan covers, broken particles of car windshields that have a crystalline appearance, and various materials like wood, paper, wrought iron, antique radios, coconut husks, bottle caps, bedsprings, fire hose coils, conveyor belts, wooden beads, computer and refrigerator parts, and cement grinders. Found objects and junk are transformed as elements of the sculptural form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first one-person show <b><i>Mindscape</i></b>, 1993, at the Gallery Genesis at the Megamall, Mandaluyong City. Since then, he has done solo and group shows here and abroad. He was the Philippine representative to the Havana Biennale in Cuba in 1985, and the Sao Paulo Biennale in Brazil in 1994. In 2016, he created a monumental three-level set for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a>&rsquo; <b><i><strong>Opera</strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which interpreted themes of birth, death, and rebirth<b><i> </i></b>through three-dimensional white figures of decapitated mannequins (some with smaller figures trapped inside their hollow torsos), floating body parts, curled fetuses, and an array of human and animal skeletons as well as two-dimensional blowups of anatomical studies dissecting the human body parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> awarded him the grand prize for <b><i>Inner Vision</i></b> in 1981 and gold medal for<i> <b>Primal Scream </b></i>in 1982. The Metrobank Foundation awarded him first prize for <b><i>Mindscape No. 6</i></b> in 1985.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BARRIOQUINTO, ANDRES </span></b>(<b>Andres Santos Barrioquinto</b>) aka Andy Barrioquinto is a painter. He was born in Manila on 6 Apr 1975. He is the son of journalist Cesar Barrioquinto and Ma. Socorro Santos. He is a painter and is married to fellow artist Iya Consorio with whom he has two children, Mazzy Star and Coco Rosie. During his youth, Barrioquinto lived in Hong Kong with his family for several years because of his father&rsquo;s work. This is where he experienced the darker and violent tendencies of city living. Prior to leaving Manila, the young Barrioquinto would hang out in the art department of the newspaper where his father worked. Upon his return to Manila, he attended an art workshop at the University of the Philippines before he eventually enrolled in the University of Santo Tomas (UST) where he graduated in 2000 as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> major.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Labeled by media pundits as the &ldquo;Dark Man of Philippine Art,&rdquo; his works often show the gloomy side of people, occasionally even venturing into the hysterical and nightmarish. This tendency was already obvious even in his first solo exhibitions <b><i>Stop Killing Me</i></b> and <b><i>My Love Gone Wrong Songs</i></b>, both in 2001. This propensity toward bleakness has persisted in later works, although these are more characteristically nuanced in the way they draw upon psychological feelings of terror internally induced by evoking the viewers&rsquo; imagination instead of relying on recognizably horrific visual elements. His early work as a professional painter often referenced variable styles evoking apparition-like forms in <b><i>Stop Killing Me</i></b> to the caricatures of <b><i>Ugaling Baboy</i></b> (Pig&rsquo;s Ways), 2004, with its distortions of the human face and body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Barrioquinto&rsquo;s preference for the color blue surfaced in 2005 in <b><i>Altered States </i></b>shown at Singapore&rsquo;s Utterly Art gallery. In 2008, the exhibition <b><i>Unexamined Failure/Disorder</i></b> showed him experimenting with a blend of realism and cubism, as in the painting <b><i>Wilderness</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which also manifested the beginnings of his now recurring motif of floral patterns serving as both figure and ground. In 2009, his works making up <b><i>The Gods of Small Things</i></b> featured the heavy use of Japanese print patterns and other Japanese imagery, which he stylistically integrated into his pieces. Although Barrioquinto has become known for these paintings that involve appending a small canvas to a larger canvas that come layered with patterns and mostly somber faces, such as in <b><i>Shadow Dancer</i></b>, 2011, he still occasionally veers away from this mode of image-making as in the show <b><i>Black Days</i></b>, 2012, in which he reverted to expressionistically distorted figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Barrioquinto has held solo and group exhibitions in various galleries in the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. He was awarded an honorable mention in the watercolor category of the 30th National Student Competition of the Shell Art Awards and the third prize in the 50th Annual Art Competition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> (AAP), both citations handed in 1997. He also received the grand prize at the 15th Young Painters Annual National Painting Competition of the Metrobank Foundation, 1998; juror&rsquo;s choice, 1st Nokia Arts Awards&ndash;Asia Pacific, Singapore, 1999; juror&rsquo;s choice in the 52nd AAP Annual Art Competition, 1999; honorable mention in the 9th Taiwan International Biennial Print and Drawing Competition, 1999; the UST Benavides Award, 1999 and 2000; best entry, lithography category, Print Association of the Philippines, 2000; and ACES Award for Continuing Excellence, Metrobank Foundation, 2009. Barrioquinto received the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> Thirteen Artists Award in 2003. <em><strong>Written by Iris S.

He was born on 5 Nov 1955. He studied at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bartolome&rsquo;s only solo show on extant records is <b><i>Lung</i></b><i> </i>at the Small Gallery (now Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP), 1976, which in fellow artist-peer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3775\">Judy Freya Sibayan</a>&rsquo;s words was an &ldquo;idea exhibition,&rdquo; reflective of the still tentative visual categories of the period. <b><i>Lung </i></b>consisted of nested plastic bags placed strategically at the entrance of the Small Gallery. Visitors were instructed to take two bags each, breathe into and place these into the alcoves of the interior space that was curtained off from easy view. Still in keeping with the early insistence of these artists to mine the everyday, <b><i>Lung </i></b>was further framed by Sibayan as &ldquo;space being turned into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>&rdquo; with collective human breath defining the shape and possible motion tracks of these accumulated transparent membranes flitting or sitting within the bounds of the static but now made plastic gallery site. One seemingly final appearance of Bartolome was dated to Feb 1988, where writer Nonoy Espina reports that the artist disrobed and enacted a crucifixion and rebirth alluding to his casting off of the worldliness he asserted was hounding artists and other practices of personal faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bartolome&rsquo;s group exhibitions include <b><i>Untitled Painting No. 1 and Other Paintings</i></b>, 1974, CCP Small Gallery; <b><i>Portfolio: Problems Definite, Solutions Infinite</i></b>, 1976, CCP Main Gallery; <b><i>CCP Annual</i></b>, 1981, CCP Main Gallery; and <b><i>Mixed Media</i></b>, 1985, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\">Pinaglabanan Galleries</a>. While little data are available on Bartolome&rsquo;s own work at this juncture, it is evident that he was part of the series of theme/artistic problem-related projects done at the CCP during the term of Director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3385\">Ray Albano</a>. As indicated in the show titles themselves, Bartolome and his peers would receive a curatorial prompt to which they would respond with a work. <b><i>Portfolio</i></b>, for instance, was proffered as an exploration of &ldquo;aesthetic relationships&rdquo; bound up in discreet units with a discernibly logical affinity. Bartolome specifically seemed to have responded to the notion of a portfolio as potentially occasioning a &ldquo;sequence of movements&rdquo; as in the case of film. For the exhibition, he turned in <b><i>Terrestrial Transports I</i></b>,<b><i> II</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>III</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bartolome&rsquo;s collaborations with former CCP curator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3775\">Judy Freya Sibayan</a> are accessible primarily through Sibayan&rsquo;s autobiographical project, <b><i>The Hypertext of HerMe(s)</i></b>. She describes her work with Bartolome and Ray Albano in <b><i>Thanksgiving Day</i></b> on 21 Sep 1978 at Liwasang Bonifacio as an early morning ritual-like laying out of mirrors at Liwasang Bonifacio, which simultaneously taunted vandals and a crowd apparently indifferent to the antics of artists.

He was born in&nbsp;Orion, Bataan on 20 Mar 1947. He died on 6 May 2014. His father, the Rev Ignacio P. Bautista, was a church minister of the United Methodist Church for 39 years; his mother, Eugenia Angeles, was a deaconess. He has a son with his wife Lorna. The family resided in Houston, Texas, USA, since 2009. He studied at Santa Ana Elementary School, 1959, and Union High School, 1963, in Manila after which he majored in advertising at the University of Santo Tomas (UST). In 1969, he earned a fine arts certificate in advertising at the University of the Philippines (UP). From there he proceeded to the Brooks Institute School of Fine Arts in Santa Barbara, California, where he obtained a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts, major in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, with honors in 1972. He studied lithography in the winter semester, 1982-83, at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf, Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bautista began in the mid-1960s as a painter of portraits and religious objects. While these early works were Christian, his art acquired an increasingly eclectic character, drawing on elements from the different traditional Asian religions to create a spiritual synthesis of modes of religious worship. In the 1970s, his imagery shifted to the surreal, as in his Inner Light series, which showed multilevel rock landscapes punctuated with personal symbols. He has worked in numerous media, including painting in oil and pastel, watercolor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, collage, cogon and abaca paper, lithography, and pencil and has used street rubbings, bas reliefs, cutouts, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of his solo and group exhibitions are the following: his first one-man show <b><i>Inscapes</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Ateneo Art Gallery, 1969; <b><i>Glenn&rsquo;s Works in Transparencies</i></b>, Savoy-Hyatt Hotel, 1971; <b><i>Pilipinas</i></b>, Philippine Consulate, New York, 1972; <b><i>Thirteen Artists</i></b>, 1974, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP); <b><i>Inner-Light Series</i></b>, Metro Gallery, 1975; <b><i>In Search of the Divine</i></b>, Sining Kamalig, 1976; <b><i>Abstractions</i></b>, Sining Kamalig, 1978; <b><i>Philippine Paintings</i></b>, Madurodam Complex, The Hague, 1980; <b><i>Abstractions</i></b>, ABC Galleries, 1982; <b><i>1985 ASEAN Show</i></b>, National Museum of Singapore; <b><i>Cut-Outs in Paper and Wood</i></b> <b><i>Series</i></b>, 1985, on permanent display at the Galerie Art204, Dusseldorf, Germany; <b><i>Nature and Technology</i></b>, Gallery Genesis, 1985; and <b><i>Halo-Halo </i></b>(Mash-up), CCP, 1987. In 2009-10, he participated in group exhibits of the Weatherford Art Association at the Firehouse Gallery and Art Center, Texas. He began doing art talks and exhibits in Houston, Texas, since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He won first prize for <b><i>The Event</i></b> in the International Christmas Art Competition sponsored by the World Literary and Christian Literature in New York, 1965. The Shell National Students Art Competition gave Bautista a certificate of merit for <b><i>Chinese Garden</i></b> in 1967 and first prize for <b><i><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></i></b> in 1968. Other awards include first prize, <b><i>The U.P. Entrance</i></b>, 1967, on-the-spot painting contest, UP President&rsquo;s Committee on Culture; third prize, <b><i>Main Building</i></b>, 1968, UST 37th Anniversary Foundation Day on-the-spot painting contest; second prize, <b><i>Arts and Sciences Building</i></b>, 1968, on-the-spot painting contest, UP President&rsquo;s Committee on Culture; and first prize, <b><i>Aguinaldo Portrait Mural</i></b>, 1969, Aguinaldo Centennial Commission.

He was born on&nbsp;15 Jan 1951. He is the son of Juan O. Bautista and Teodora Degollado. Bautista enrolled in a bachelor of arts in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a> course at the University of the East College of Fine Arts from 1969 to 1972. He went through a vocational track in his last two years at the Arellano High School. This armed him with skills in graphic arts, carpentry, and automotive and TV repairs. This technical aptitude allowed him to tinker and look at industrial and found objects as resource for his art. Bautista was apparently deeply sensitive about his perceived outside status, coming as he did from the University of the East and having only heard of then <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) Museum Director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a> through fellow Shell awardee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3557\">Rodolfo Gan</a>. Not being interested in producing traditional art, Bautista introduced himself to Chabet and earned his approval and, eventually, that of Chabet&rsquo;s successor Ray Albano. Among Bautista&rsquo;s cheekiest works were his box-type dextrose tube installation injected with luminous paint for a two-man show with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3553\">Marciano Galang</a>; his papering over the gallery walls with a reverse shot of the ceiling in <b><i>Post No Bill</i></b>, the inaugural CCP Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> (also known as Small Gallery) exhibition; and his turning in 100 paper bags and a toilet bowl plunger he called <strong><i>Bomba</i></strong> (Bomb) for the 1973 <b><i>Objects</i></b> exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\">Shop 6</a> artists who brazenly produced ephemeral work in the early 1970s, Bautista&rsquo;s practice possibly most dramatically demonstrates the intersections between artists inclined to a type of homespun or organically evolved conceptualism while injecting social commentary. His 1979 <b><i>Bubong</i></b> (Roof), for instance, which appeared in the <b><i>Five Contemporary Sculptors</i></b> exhibition at the CCP Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> (also known as Main Gallery) led to the cutting short of the exhibition run, as it coincided with an International Monetary Fund event whose delegates, according to Bautista, Imelda Marcos did not want exposed to such a jarring representation of squalor. As was the case with many of his peers, Bautista&rsquo;s work would demonstrate an interest in seriality and repetition as well as a dislodging of structure, often using the most mundane of materials such as bamboo, sand, mongo seeds (mung beans), laurel leaves, activist paraphernalia, hospital sanitary discards, chicken coop fencing, a hula hoop, water, machine oil, plastic, books, magazine clippings, a mouse trap, a face towel, tea bags, rags, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Albano describes Bautista&rsquo;s capacity to create &ldquo;situations,&rdquo; citing specifically <b><i>100 Paper Bags</i></b> and <b><i>The End</i></b> in the 1972 CCP summer exhibition where his predilection to playing off meaning and materiality would find witty realization. The artist is also remembered for the upended triangle of grass atop mirror work called <b><i>Bermuda Triangle</i></b> and for <b><i>Piet Mondrian &rsquo;84</i></b> which pairs a lowly woven kitchen rag with a printed reproduction of Mondrian&rsquo;s gridded color strips. Both works appeared at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\">Pinaglabanan Galleries</a>, as the latter took on the experimental art mantle alongside the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bautista participated in group exhibitions that included the <b><i>CCP Summer Exhibition</i></b>, 1972; <b><i>Shop 6</i></b> <b><i>Inaugural</i></b>, 1974, Sining Kamalig; <b><i>101 Artists</i></b>, 1974, Shop 6; <b><i>Shop 6: Early Works / Circa 1975</i></b>, Rizal Park; <b><i>Shop 6 at the CCP</i></b>, 1975; <b><i>Contemporary Art in the</i></b> <b><i>Philippines</i></b>, 1976, inaugural Contemporary Art Museum of the Philippines exhibit; <b><i>First CCP Annual</i></b>, 1976, CCP Main Gallery; <b><i>Pencil and Paper</i></b>, 1977, CCP Small Gallery; <b><i>Roots, Basics, and Beginnings</i></b>, 1977, CCP Small Gallery; <b><i>Gridworks</i></b>, 1978, CCP Main Gallery; <b><i>Third CCP Annual</i></b>, 1978, CCP Main Gallery; <b><i>A Decade of Developmental Art</i></b>, 1979, CCP Main Gallery; <b><i>CCP Annual</i></b>, 1979, CCP Small Gallery; <b><i>Wordworks, Graffiti, and Other Works with Words</i></b>, 1979, CCP Small Gallery; <b><i>Preview</i></b>, 1984, Pinaglabanan Galleries; <b><i>33 Artists</i></b>, 1984, Pinaglabanan Galleries; <b><i>Recent Abstractions</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1985, Pinaglabanan Galleries; <b><i>Mixed Media</i></b>, 1985, Pinaglabanan Galleries; <b><i>Sikat: Two Decades of Philippine Art</i></b>, 1969-89 (Ray of Sun / Famous: Two Decades of Philippine Art, 1969-89), CCP Main Gallery; and <b><i>Articulating Structures</i></b> <b><i>and Mediums: A Group Exhibition</i></b>, 2011, Nova Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bautista worked with the Population Commission through 1986 and exhibited less aggressively since, tending to design and trade business to support his family.

Her figurative works placed emphasis on her subjects&rsquo; physical strength and appearance. Color has remained of primary importance in her work&mdash;for instance, blue for outlining figures has created the effects of both volume and movement while white has intensified the play of colors. The rich details of dress such as floral designs and stripes, accessories like umbrellas, and the vast array of wares, flowers and fruits, fish and fowl have been used to bring out the entire spectrum of color in her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Shell National Students Art Competition gave her second prize for <b><i>Dead</i></b> <b><i>Christ</i></b>, 1961.

He did many sketches of a madwoman named Sabel as she scavenged around garbage cans. Cabrera acknowledged the female German artist Kathe Kollwitz as having had the greatest influence on his works, especially those dealing with the lower classes&mdash;like beggars, scavengers, and laborers&mdash;and the mother-and-child theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later, Cabrera became concerned with the Philippines&rsquo; colonial past. Based on old photographs, his later paintings took on the form of social commentaries on the influences of American and Spanish colonizers. <b><i>Pit-a-Pit Metamorphosis</i></b> shows a young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\">Igorot</a> boy undergoing a process of colonization. <b><i>Types of True Filipinos Waiting to Be Called Americans</i></b> depicts the servility of Filipinos to the Americans. <b><i>Surveying the New Territory</i></b> is a painting of a white man astride a horse surveying some land. <b><i>Brown Brother&rsquo;s Burden</i></b> shows a white man on a palanquin being carried by four Cordillera tribespeople. Aside from painting, Cabrera has done a lot of etchings, aquatints, and prints. He also explored handmade paper as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">medium</a> for visual expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first exhibition was in 1960 at the Indigo Gallery in Ermita, Manila. Throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, he had solo or group shows nearly every year. In the early 1970s, Cabrera and his wife moved to England. While in London, he held various solo exhibitions in reputable galleries. While in Europe, he also joined several Philippine shows in The Hague, Netherlands; the <b><i>Six Artistes Contemporains Philippines en Europe</i></b> (Six Contemporary Filipino Artists in Europe) in Paris; <b><i>Philippine Printmakers</i></b> at the Royal Festival Hall in London; the <b><i>Philippine Graphic Art Exhibition</i></b> in Munich; and the 8th Biennale Internationale de Arts<b><i> </i></b>in Valparaiso, Chile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">BenCab is a recognized cultural leader in Baguio City. He has a studio in Tubao, Benguet, where artists meet. Together with a small group of artists, he established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild</a> in 1987. In the late 1990s, Cabrera&rsquo;s input was a critical element in the creation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3791\">Tam-awan Village</a>, an assembled cluster of conserved Cordillera indigenous houses, which has become a site for fusing art, cultural, environmental, and historical advocacy. To showcase his personal art collection as well as his own artworks, he built and continues to manage the BenCab Museum in Baguio City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cabrera won awards and distinctions such as second prize for <b><i>Blue Serenity </i></b>in the 1962 Shell National Students Art Competition; first prize in the UP Student Council Art Competition, 1963; and first prize for <b><i>Yero</i></b> (Galvanized Iron), second prize for <b><i>Manok</i></b> (Chicken), and third honorable mention for <b><i>Pader </i></b>(Wall) in the Art Association of the Philippines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> competition in 1967. Books on his artworks were written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3740\">Alfredo Roces</a>, Jun Terra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>, Beatriz Romualdez Francia, Gloria G. Goloy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3444\">Leonidas Benesa</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5347\">Amadis Ma. Guerrero</a>. He received the Gawad CCP para sa Sining in 1992. He was proclaimed National Artist for visual arts in 2006. The University of the Philippines conferred upon him an honorary doctor of humanities degree in 2009. A yearlong retrospective exhibit in 2015 marked BenCab&rsquo;s 50th anniversary as an artist.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by Alice G.

He was born in Obando, Bulacan on 22 Dec 1913. He died in Quezon City on 8 Aug 2003. He was the son of Pedro Ma. Bernardo and Cecilia Anastacio. He studied at Obando Elementary School, 1920-25. In 1929, he transferred to Manila West, which is now Florentino Torres High School in Tondo, Manila, and there finished high school in 1933. He obtained a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1948. He was one of the students of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3397\">Pablo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> at the UP School of Fine Arts, 1940-41. He got a second bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a master&rsquo;s degree in fine arts from Yale University in 1952. He married Nieves de Guzman and they had two sons. In 1953, he resumed teaching at the UP School of Fine Arts, until his retirement in 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1979, he held a retrospective of his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> at the Museum of Philippine Art. Bernardo was one of the earliest and most consistent exponents of abstract art in the country. He worked in series, combining geometrism and color research in such work groupings as the Bernardian series, the Rhapsody Square series, and the Wildflower series. The most striking of these are his series of paintings with a tilted central square of softly modulating hue that transmutes into transparent polygonal shapes determined by mathematical relationships. The square, a principal obsession of the artist, is developed exclusively in the Rhapsody Square series, which takes after the legacy of Josef Albers&rsquo;s <b><i>Homage to the Square</i></b>. In the Rhapsody Square series, Bernardo deals with the same concept of a colored square within a square of a different hue. This is based on the research into color perception begun by Albers and color experiments done at the Bauhaus. In the Wildflower series, color is no longer handled scientifically but becomes symbolic of emotions and values, at the same time that the human figure, specifically the female nude, is brought into a hitherto abstract domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist received the Alab ng Sining award from the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">UP College of Fine Arts</a> in 2007.

Enverga University Foundation in 1984. He was a student of potters Jaime and Anne de Guzman. Bigyan&rsquo;s work in his seventh one-person exhibit at the Ayala Museum has been described as &ldquo;a play of solid forms, altered pieces, wax-resist decoration, stoneware textures, batik prints on ceramics and new experimental discoveries in studio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>. He is known for his well-crafted pottery, for imaginatively incorporating natural fibers such as rattan and abaca, twigs and roots with fired clay, and for constantly exploring the limits and possibilities of clay.&rdquo; The lack of proper school training did not hinder Bigyan from producing art pieces marked by artistry and innovativeness, as seen in his <b><i>Two-Bodied Nude of a Woman</i></b>.

His artistry was eventually recognized, mostly by Europeans who travel all the way to his studio-gallery in Quezon province. Bigyan has also established quite a number of outlets for his work in Manila and was, at one juncture, exporting pieces to Holland, France, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bigyan&rsquo;s one-person shows include <b><i>High on Fire</i></b> at the Ayala Museum, 1988; <b><i>Fire Works</i></b>, Madrigal Center, 1989; <b><i>Art on Fire</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 1991; <b><i>Capers and Clay</i></b>, Luz Gallery, 1992; <b><i>Fire Works (II)</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 1992; <b><i>Potters Wheel</i></b>, Liongoren Art Gallery, 1994; <b><i>Inspire</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 1995; and <b><i><strong>Poetry</strong> of Fire</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 1996.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BITANCOR, JEHO </span></b>(<b>Jeho Leander Bitancor</b>) is a painter and&nbsp;performance artist. He was born in&nbsp;Baler&nbsp;on 24 Oct 1967. He is the son of Gregorio Bitancor and Peladia Leander. His brother is Jose Johann Bitancor, a graphic designer and abstract painter based in California. Bitancor graduated from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a>, with majors in both <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> and visual communication (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a>), in 1990. He also attended the Art Student&rsquo;s League and New York University&rsquo;s School of Continuing and Professional Studies where he finished courses in painting in 1997 and graphic design in 2008, respectively. He is the founder of the Baler Art Group. He was an active member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> (AAP) in the 1990s and was also the facilitator of the Philippine International Performance Art Festival in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, he organized the first two Sining-Silangan Visual and Literary Arts Festivals in Baler, Aurora.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Developing from early quasi-surrealist symbology in his work from the 1980s, as well as drawing from his extensive experience in the field of advertising, Bitancor&rsquo;s paintings bring a concise use of formal elements and symbolism to the fore. He couples these with lenses of subjective observation and direct experience in order to thresh out his reflections on social structures, ideology, and the effects of these on daily individual struggles, demonstrated in pieces such as <b><i>Lunting-Tinig </i></b>(Green-Voice), 2015. As with his paintings, Bitancor&rsquo;s performance works also deal with issues within the thematic ranges of social realism. In his performances, he often assumes the persona of a corporate male thrown into variable narratives that employ a similar symbolic approach to that of his paintings such as in <b><i>White Lies</i></b>, 2005, and <b><i>Blind Faith</i></b>, 2012. At times, however, Bitancor eschews the closed narrative format in favor of what he calls &ldquo;live <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>&rdquo; in order to better exploit the immediacy of both his body and the particular sites in which he performs. This latter tendency can be seen in the work <b><i>Dreaming Green</i></b> done during the <b><i>Tutok Perspektiba </i></b>(Focus Perspective) exhibition at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bitancor&rsquo;s first solo painting exhibition was at the Shangri-La Plaza Manila in 1995. Titled <b><i>Takipsilim</i></b><i> </i>(Dusk) it was sponsored by the&nbsp;AAP. Since then, he has staged 20 solo exhibitions both here and abroad, including <b><i>Pilapinas</i></b> (Get in Line Philippines), 1997, at the Liongoren Gallery; <b><i><strong><strong><strong>Jeho Bitancor</strong></strong></strong>: <strong>One</strong> Man Show</i></b>, 1997, at the Vermont Studio Center; <b><i>Color the Sky Blue</i></b>, 2007, in Utterly Art Singapore; and <b><i>Splendid Squalor</i></b>, 2013, at Art Galilea, Bonifacio Global City. Since 1984, Bitancor has participated in over 70 group exhibitions in varied institutions and galleries here and overseas. These include those staged by artists groups such as the AAP and government institutions such as the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a>; regional selections such as the grant-based <b><i>Fifth</i></b> <b><i>ASEAN Youth Painting Exhibition</i></b>, 1987, and the ASEAN <b><i>Art Today</i></b>, 2001; and art fairs, fund-raisers, and various cause-related exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from the festivals and events he has organized, Bitancor&rsquo;s performance work has been featured in a number of platforms in Manila, Baguio, Bangkok, and New York. Among these were the works <b><i>Spitting at the Red Apple 1</i></b> at the <b><i>ASIATOPIA Performance Art Festival</i></b> in Bangkok, 2006; <b><i>In Between Histories</i></b>, 2007, featured in the <b><i>Tutok Perspektiba </i></b>show at UST; <b><i>Colonizador</i></b> (Colonizer), 2009, at the Grace Exhibition Space, New York; <b><i>In Memoriam</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, Bliss on Bliss Art Projects, New York; and <b><i>Ecdysis</i></b>, 2015, at the exhibition <b><i>Performance Anxiety</i></b>, Culture Fix, New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bitancor garnered distinctions from various local and foreign bodies such as the AAP, frequently making the Juror&rsquo;s Choice list before winning Best Entry for his painting <b><i>Musmos</i></b> (Innocence) in 1998; the Freeman Foundation Asian Artists Fellowship Award in Vermont in 1997; the Dangal ng Aurora award for visual arts in his native Baler, Aurora, in 2005; and the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2006. <em><strong>Written by Antares Bartolome</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">&nbsp;\r\n<p>Bitancor, Jeho. n.d.a.

Among its original members are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3747\">Norberto Roldan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\">Nunelucio Alvarado</a>, Dennis Ascalon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3474\">Charlie Co</a>, Perry Argel, Boysie Imperial, and Mario Stephen Regollo. Its precursor was Pamilya Pintura, a member organization of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>. BAA&rsquo;s focus on &ldquo;socially and politically progressive practice&rdquo; differentiated it from the more conservative Art Association of Bacolod (AAB) founded in 1975 by Edgardo Lizares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As with the rest of the archipelago during the 1980s, Negros underwent economic and political upheaval toward the end of the Marcos regime. Due to the steep decline in the price of sugar in the international market, the majority of Negrenses who worked in the sugarcane fields and mills suffered extreme hardship and deprivation. To alleviate this, the AAB initiated the Masskara Festival in 1982 where people wore large smiling masks made of papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; to celebrate Bacolod&rsquo;s charter day. On the other hand, in line with its socially committed stance, BAA (as did Pamilya Pintura before it) contributed artworks in the form of murals and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2099\">effigies</a> for mass actions. Despite its members&rsquo; varied styles and techniques, the BAA is associated with the Social Realists aggressively pursuing their practice across the Philippines. Eventually, many of BAA&rsquo;s members went on to have successful individual careers. Those remaining active in this circle of artists presently gravitate around Orange Gallery, an artist-run space spearheaded by Charlie Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, under the leadership of Norberto Roldan, the BAA led the first Visayas Islands Visual Arts Exhibition and Conference (VIVA ExCon), sponsored by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>. This exhibit-conference biennale was envisioned not only to &ldquo;showcase contemporary works of visual arts from the different islands but also to promote visual art forms reflective of the islands&rsquo; cultural influences, historical traditions and current social situations aside from encouraging innovative, experimental or collaborative works among Visayan visual artists&rdquo; (VIVA Excon Folio 1990, quoted in Locsin-Nava, n.d.).Held in Mambucal Resort, Murcia, on 22-28 Feb 1990, VIVA ExCon I attracted many artists and cultural workers from outside the Visayas region&mdash;notably, Bobi Valenzuela, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3462\">Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3764\">Pablo Baens Santos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3816\">Roy Veneracion</a>&mdash;as well as Baguio-based artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\">BenCab</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\">Roberto Villanueva</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">VIVA ExCon II, held in Bacolod on 13-15 Mar 1992, was participated in by 92 artists, including several from Japan, which promoted further cultural exchanges here and abroad. In 1994, VIVA ExCon IV was sponsored for the first time by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a>. Since then, the biennale has been managed by various Visayas-based artist organizations. The 13th VIVA ExCon was held on 13-16 Nov 2012, with founding BAA members Dennis Ascalon and Charlie Co in the working committee. The subsequent biennale was held in Dumaguete under the leadership of Antonio Alunan Wenceslao and project-managed by the artists&rsquo; organization PUSOD, with the succeeding installment planned for VIVA ExCon&rsquo;s homecoming in Bacolod in 2014. BAA itself is now registered under the Securities and Exchange Commission as Black Artists in Asia Association Inc. <em><strong>Written by Sofia G. Guillermo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BLANCO, JOSE </span></b>(<b>Jose Villones Blanco</b>) aka Pitok Bunggan was a painter. He was born in Angono, Rizal on 19 Mar 1932. He died in the same town on 14 Aug 2008. He was the son of Ismael Blanco, a fisher, and Manuela Villones, a store owner. His mother&rsquo;s uncle, Pedro Pi&ntilde;on, was a religious artist of the late 19th century. His wife Loreto &ldquo;Loring&rdquo; Blanco and his seven children, Glenn, Noel, Michael, Joy, Jan, Gay, and Peter Paul, are also painters. He obtained his fine arts degree from the University of Santo Tomas in 1953. Upon graduation, he worked as art director in an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a> company. In 1971, he resigned and devoted his full time to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Blanco painted for some time under the influence of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a> aka Botong, but he always resisted being absorbed by the strong personality of his mentor. He sought his own style, at first with difficulty, then with increasing confidence until he came into his own. The Philippine genre style of painting, or what the art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a> termed as &ldquo;folk realism,&rdquo; became his forte. He painted murals of genres, using vibrant earthly colors in depicting Philippine folk life, revealing his intimate familiarity with it. While he had had subjects ranging from the Tagalog pastoral scenes to memorializing and documenting Philippine folk traditions, he is best known for his large-scale works of folk genre in the rural Angono setting by the Laguna Lake. One of his most notable works was the <b><i>Angono Town Fiesta</i></b>, a 2.43 x 4.57 m mural that brings together a large number of Angono folk, each of them in an individual portrait, celebrating the fluvial procession of San Clemente in November. Another mural, <b><i>Burning of Angono</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1990,<i> </i>depicts somber and dark themes said to be reminiscent of his World War II experiences. His work attracted the attention of Imelda Marcos, who commissioned a series of murals on Pres Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s war exploits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1971, he held his first one-person show at the Manila Hilton Art Center. He commemorated this event with the painting <b><i>Tulungan</i></b> (Cooperation), which shows his family moving house over Laguna Lake on a raft steered by townspeople to the other shore. His first commissioned murals were <b><i>Three Regions</i></b> for Santa Clara Plywood and <b><i><strong>Bayani</strong>han</i></b> (Cooperation) for Unilab. In 1996, two of his major paintings about the Virgin Mary of Antipolo were hung at the Basilica of the Immaculate Concepcion in Washington, DC, as part of the commemoration of the 101st Philippine Independence. As a family, Pitok and his children held an exhibit at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> in 1978. They also had an exhibit in Xiamen, China, 1986, and on Fifth Ave in New York, 1999. His works, along with the works of his family, are exhibited in the Blanco Family Museum along Iba&ntilde;ez St in Angono, Rizal. <em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo, updated by Cecilia S.

Artistic activity in Bohol persisted until just before the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest painters of Bohol seem to have been Chinese artisans who migrated to the remote provinces like Bohol due to the periodic expulsions, bans, and campaigns of persecution against them. This theory is supported by the prevalence of expressive elements identifiable as Chinese-inspired in many of the early Bohol <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>. The paintings did not originate from just one master. Moreover, the extant pieces, mainly dated to the 19th century, were undertaken under the initiative of the Recollect Fathers and not by the Jesuits, who were expelled from the country in 1768.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the earliest pieces from Bohol has been called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2215\"><b><i>Kuan-Yin Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario</i></b></a>, apparently inspired by the image of Kuan-Yin, the Chinese goddess of mercy. It must have been made ca 1825, based on the condition of the pigments as compared with those of later dated pieces. The painter of the <b><i>Kuan-Yin</i></b> apparently influenced the next active painter, one of whose works is the set of Stations of the Cross, which features one unit with the year 1830. The influence is evident in the way the eyes of the personages are depicted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Only one name is known of the Bohol painters, Liberato Gachalian, who signed the set of the Passion of Christ originally in the parish church of Dawis, Bohol. His inscription states that he was commissioned in 1854 by Fr Antonio Obeda to execute the paintings. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BORLONGAN, ELMER </span></b>(<b>Elmer <strong>Misa</strong> Borlongan</b>) is a painter. He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 7 Jan 1967. The son of Pascual Borlongan and Dolores Misa, he married fellow artist Plet Bolipata. Borlongan had his first formal lessons from his father, and then under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3770\">Fernando Sena</a> at the Children&rsquo;s Museum and Library. Later, Borlongan became apprentice to his teacher in workshops in Montalban and Antipolo. It was during this time that the young art student became exposed to the grassroots. He also went on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> trips with the Kabataang Tondo Art Group founded by Sena. He studied with Sena until 1983, after which he took up fine arts at the University of the Philippines in 1987. The turning point in his practice came in his sophomore year when he was chosen as delegate to Malaysia in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) art exhibit and workshop with the theme &ldquo;People of the ASEAN.&rdquo; When he returned to the Philippines, the young artist sought to return to his indigenous roots, and stayed in Banaue for a short while. After the 1987 Mendiola massacre, Borlongan joined ABAY, a visual arts organization with a sociopolitical thrust. He became active doing murals, illustrations, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">comics</a>, and posters for cause-oriented groups. Later, Borlongan co-founded the Salingpusa group, going back to painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Borlongan describes his style as figurative expressionism, dominated by human figures with distorted and often surreal shapes and hues. In particular, the subject of the &ldquo;bald man&rdquo; is an iconic image in Borlongan&rsquo;s body of work and allows the exploration of sociopolitical issues in urban life. In 2002, he and his wife moved to Zambales where they built their studios. Borlongan began painting rural scenes with vivid colors, featuring genre scenes from a fishing community. He also worked for the defunct <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, illustrating fables in the lifestyle section using charcoal drawings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was an artist in residence in ARCUS Ibaraki, Japan, in 1996. Borlongan has been exhibiting widely since the late 1990s with shows in Tokyo, New York, Sydney, Singapore, Irvine, Brisbane, Honolulu, and Kuala Lumpur, among others. His works are in the collection of the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum and the Singapore Art Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Borlongan has won several prizes in various national competitions, including the Metrobank Foundation painting contest: second prize, <b><i>Rehimen </i></b>(Regime), 1988; and second prize, <b><i><strong><strong>Tampuhan</strong></strong> </i></b>(Lover&rsquo;s Quarrel), 1992. He received the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> Thirteen Artists Award in 1994. In 2004, he received the Award for Continuing Excellence and Service from the Metrobank Foundation.<em><strong> Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He was born in Baguio City on 25 Jul 1949. He died on&nbsp;3 Dec 2002. He was the son of Mariano Bose and Lourdes Pavila. He took up architecture at Mapua Institute of Technology, 1965-67, and finished fine arts at the University of the Philippines in 1972. While in college, he received several awards in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, editorial design, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a>. In recognition of his long interest in indigenous art making, he was awarded a grant by the Linang Project of the Council of Living Traditions in 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bose was a founding member and served as the chairperson of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild</a> in 1992 and 2001. He was a tireless experimenter in the use of different media including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance art</a>. He pioneered in the use of indigenous materials. None of his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> are in the academic oil-on-canvas. He has used, among others, old doors, bamboo nose flutes, driftwood, <i>estampita</i> (small holy pictures), paper bills, empty bottles, even carpets in collage. Sometimes he invents his own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">medium</a>, such as the one in <b><i>Drown My Soul in the Chico Dam</i></b>, which incorporates volcanic ash baked in a kiln for a hard sculptural effect. He has used Philippine precolonial symbols, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2227\">Manunggul jar</a> and the <b>bulol</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> of rice harvest gods), at times ironically juxtaposed with Western symbols. He also did a series on migrant Filipinos for a show in the United States, 1989. Drawn to the nativist millennarian groups of Mount Banahaw, Bose did the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2262\"><b><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong></em><i> at Rebolusyon</i></b></a> (Passion and Revolution), 1983, with a striking use of indigenous and organic materials. Dried branches massed together to form an improvised altar-like structure (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1849\">Bernardo Carpio</a>&rsquo;s mystic altar) above which, forming a colorful <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><b>retablo</b></a> (sculpted altar), are three vertical banners painted with native religious imagery common to the site, while a native saint brandishing a bolo rides forth to the revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1994, Bose was a visiting research fellow at the Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia. In 1998, his works were included in the <b><i>Alab ng Puso</i></b> centennial exhibition of Philippine art at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. In 2000, he was a visiting artist in residence at the Pacific Bridge Gallery in Oakland, California. He was awarded the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award for sculpture by the city of Manila in 2001. In 2003, Babilonia 1808, the international contemporary art program of the Babilonia Wilner Foundation in Berkeley, California, presented Bose&rsquo;s works in <b><i>Power and Poetics: Remembering <strong><strong><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></strong></strong></i></b> (1949-2002). In 2004, a retrospective at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> titled <b><i>In Memory of a Talisman: An Exhibition of Works of Santiago Bose</i></b> was held. In the same year, his book <b><i>Espiritu Santi: The Strange Life and Even</i> <i>Stranger Legacy of Santiago Bose</i></b> was published. He was also awarded the Gawad CCP para sa Sining (visual arts) in 2004. In 2010, another retrospective of the artist titled <b><i>Remix, Santiago Bose</i></b> was held at the Yuchengo Museum. In Mar 2011, his book titled <b><i>Baguio Graffiti-Gatos</i></b><i> <b>Callejeros</b></i><b> </b>(Baguio Graffiti-Stray Cats), 2006, was launched by Instituto Cervantes in Manila. In 2012, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3599\">Vargas Museum</a>, commemorated his 10th death anniversary with an exhibition <b><i>Can&rsquo;t Go Home Again: Santiago Bose in the Family Collection</i></b>. This consisted of the artist&rsquo;s work and documentation from the collection of the Bose family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bose exhibited internationally in seminal events such as the Havana Biennial, 1989; the First Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane, Australia, 1993; <b><i>Memories of Overdevelopment</i></b>, University of California Irvine, 1996; and <b><i>At Home and Abroad: 20 Contemporary Filipino Artists</i></b> at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He received a certificate of merit in the on-the-spot painting contest of the Shell National Students Art Competition in 1971.

He was given the grand prize for print by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> in 1981, and was a finalist in the 1982 Mobil Art Awards. <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He was born in&nbsp;Paombong, Bulacan on 1 Apr 1863. He died in&nbsp;5 Feb 1950. Fatherless at 14, Buenaventura went to Manila to look for work. The mother of his employer, Ramon Salas, saw a copy of a historical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> that he made and was very impressed. She sent him to the Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado de Manila. He eventually became one of the founding teachers of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts</a>, where he taught from 1909 to 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Buenaventura is one of the early masters of classical realism in the Philippines. In 1895, he entered three oils&mdash;<b><i>Despues del Ba&ntilde;o </i></b>(After the Bath), <b><i>Cabeza del Estudio</i></b> (Head Study), and <b><i>Estudio de Natural</i></b> (Study From Life)&mdash;at the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition). One of the three works obtained a bronze medal. In 1899, he opened a portrait shop in San Jose, Trozo. In many issues of <b><i>Chizpazos</i></b> in Jul 1908, his Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, located at No. 35, San Jose, Trozo, was advertised. In 1908, his <b><i>Ya Vienen</i></b> (They Are Here) won one of the silver medals at the art exhibition sponsored by the Asociacion Internacional de Artistas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bulk of Buenaventura&rsquo;s major works were destroyed during World War II. Most of those preserved are small landscapes and genre pieces that prove his consummate skills as a realist in the old school. His most popular works today are the pair of portraits at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3435\">Central Bank of the Philippines</a>&mdash;namely, <b><i>Portrait of Rufino</i></b> <b><i>Valencia</i></b> and <b><i>Portrait of Ramona Valencia</i></b>, the latter mistakenly identified as the artist&rsquo;s mother in <b><i>Kayamanan </i></b>(Treasure). Both show the artist&rsquo;s uncanny skill for strongly modeled forms and a sensitive eye for vital features that identify his sitters. Buenaventura is especially remembered as an art teacher admired by his students&mdash;among them, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3772\">Serafin Serna</a>, Tomas Bernardo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3643\">Mauro&nbsp;Malang<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Santos</a>. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">BUNOAN, RINGO </span></b>(<b>Maria Angelica Santos Bunoan</b>) is a visual artist, curator, writer, and researcher. She was born in&nbsp;Mandaluyong City on 3 Aug 1974.&nbsp;She is the daughter of Santiago Bunoan and Lourdes Amor Santos. She graduated with a bachelor of fine arts, major in art history, from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> (UP CFA) in 1997. She taught art history at the UP CFA from 1997 to 1998 and has written articles for various publications over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bunoan produces <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a> that explore the affective and conceptual possibilities of materials such as found and ephemeral objects, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, and sound recording. Her works have addressed connections between themes such as memory and transience, presence and absence, demise and loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early on, Bunoan utilized photography as a main element of her installation work. One of her earliest works, <b><i>White Noise</i></b>, 1997, positioned a photograph of a bed and two pillows in front of a CD player with looped recordings of ambient, everyday sounds. This vein of work employing notions of time and place extends up to the present with <b><i>Untitled</i></b><i> </i>[<b><i>Price List</i></b>], 2008, where she arranges images of price lists of exhibitions done over past years in various galleries. The photos are placed on tables, displaying them as both archival elements and art objects. In 1999, she started collaborating with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3398\">Poklong Anading</a> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video-based installations</a>, producing works such as <b><i>SOS</i></b>, 2003, featuring two TV monitors projecting an image of either artist sending flashlight signals to the other. Returning to the Philippines in 2007 after three years in Nepal, Bunoan produced a series of installations utilizing pillows as memorials of the corporeal. <b><i>In the Same Breath</i></b>, 2003, is a radial installation that incorporates pillows and photos of tombstones in tribute to her late mother who similarly passed away on the indicated date on the pictured graves. <b><i>The Wall</i></b>, 2008, uses hundreds of found pillows, stacked on top of each other to form a structural barrier embodying human presences that ultimately fall, given their own precarious positionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a curator, Bunoan has contributed to the flourishing of alternative art spaces in the Philippines in the 1990s to the 2000s. In 1999, Bunoan and artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3573\">Katya Guerrero</a> co-founded Big Sky Mind, a gallery-caf&eacute; that evolved into an independent artist-run space from 2001 to 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bunoan has also worked in close collaboration with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a>, eventually creating an archive of materials on his artistic and curatorial work while working as a researcher for Philippine contemporary art at the Asia Art Archive in Hong Kong from 2007 to 2013. Her third solo exhibition <b><i>Archiving Roberto Chabet</i></b>, 2009, translated this period of archival research into material work by salvaging his undocumented pieces and physically producing otherwise unrealized concepts. In 2010, she co-founded King Kong Art Projects Unlimited, which organized the exhibition series <b><i>Chabet: 50 Years</i></b>,<b> </b>2011-12, in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her work has been featured in exhibitions in the Asia-Pacific region and in the United States, including <b><i>USEBy: Asia Pacific Artist Initiative Project</i></b>, 2000, Center for Contemporary Photography, Australia; <b><i>PAUSE: The 4th Gwangju Biennale</i></b>, 2002, South Korea; <b><i>Episode: Asia Art Now</i></b>, 2004, Cheong-ju Center Gallery, Seoul, Korea; the Singapore Art Museum, 2004 and 2009; <b><i>Phantoms of Asia: Contemporary Art Awakens the Past</i></b>, 2012, Asian Art Museum, San Francisco, California; <b><i>Move On Asia: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\"><strong>Video Art</strong></a> in Asia 2002-2012</i></b>, 2013, ZKM Media Museum, Germany; and <b><i>Erasure: From Conceptualism to Abstraction</i></b>, 2013, Osage Gallery and City University, Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bunoan received the Thirteen Artists Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) in 2003.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">CAANCAN, JOSE </span></b>(<b>Jose Dalhag Caancan</b>)<b>&nbsp;</b>was a sculptor. He was born in&nbsp;Paete, Laguna on 20 May 1877. He died in&nbsp;8 May 1965. He was the youngest of 10 children born to Valeriano Caancan and Ines Dalhag. Caancan&rsquo;s father was a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> carver by occupation, and musician by avocation. His mother was a dressmaker who also did intricate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a> work for draperies or religious statues. Orphaned at age four, he stopped schooling as he had to make a living for himself, first as lathe operator in a furniture shop and then as wood-carver. He married twice but sired no children. His adopted son Gregorio Caancan continued Jose&rsquo;s tradition of wood carving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1894, Caancan was one of the ambitious young men who responded to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s search for working scholars to support during the latter&rsquo;s exile in Dapitan. Caancan was also known to be Rizal&rsquo;s barber. Mutual influences in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> of Rizal and Caancan constitute a promising case study. After a year of stay in Dapitan, Caancan returned to Paete to work on wood carving all his life. Although he was accustomed to doing religious statuary, he decided to concentrate on doing genre themes, such as <b><i>Boy on a Carabao</i></b> in three dimensions, <b><i>Couple Pounding Rice</i></b> in bas relief, and <b><i>Boy Fetching Water</i></b>, which became very marketable during the early 1900s. His workshop was virtually a school as he trained young boys on the rigors of sculptural anatomy. Among his pupils were Mariano Edjawan, Jess Limlengco, Luis Obial, and Isaac Cagandahan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Caancan was known to have won awards for religious statues he exhibited at the Golden Gate Exposition and an exposition in Paris. In the 1924 Philippine Exposition, he won first prize for his portrait of Leonard Wood. A relief carving on a Dapitan scene by Caancan is kept in Jose Rizal&rsquo;s house in Calamba. <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3462\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a></strong></strong></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3462\"><strong><strong><strong> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></strong></strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

She is recognized for depicting viewers in the act of viewing a painting, or capturing a painting within a painting. Viewers are prompted to critically reflect on their looking practices through her emphasis on the process of representation and impersonal response, the latter being suggested by backs turned against the actual viewers of the work. Such is exemplified in the suite of paintings she did for the exhibition <b><i>Under the Influence of Paintings</i></b>,<i> </i>2012, Art Stage, Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist&rsquo;s invoking of techniques of appropriation allows her to reconstruct minor histories of destruction and accounts of art heists, which often go untold in relation to the historicizing of the works of modern artists and masters from the Western world. In the exhibition <b><i>Pictures of Pictures</i></b>, 2009, and specifically in a painting she titled <b><i>Splitting 32</i></b>,<i> </i>Cabigting reinterprets a house dismembered by the architect-artist Gordon Matta-Clark.<i> </i>She also imagines the condition of rejected artworks in <b><i>Destroyed Painting: After Francis Bacon</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Barnett Newman and an Unidentified Woman Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Yellow, Red, and Blue</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cabigting&rsquo;s painting and intermedia approaches draw attention to the dynamism of the art world she inhabits. Counting on conceptualism&rsquo;s tendency to harness ideas and to focus on research-based practices, she exposes the presence of in-between states in artistic processes. In the exhibition <b><i>Title Withheld: Three Paintings</i></b>, 2010, Cabigting drew attention to a note or a file folder; or a scene in class in which students learned about Josef Albers&rsquo;s square motif.<i> </i>In <b><i>Dietro <strong><strong><strong>Mona Lisa</strong></strong></strong></i></b>, 2007,<i> </i>Cabigting reconstructed the verso of Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s much celebrated portrait, <b><i>Mona Lisa</i></b>.<i> </i>Based on conservation documents, she featured both images replete with minute details. Here, the aura of mystique did not originate from the frontal figure but rather from its obverse. The theme of reversal was also gleaned in Cabigting&rsquo;s exhibition <b><i>Under Wraps</i></b>, 2012, where she concealed her canvases behind white cloth in order to emphasize often disregarded aspects of painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cabigting has held many solo exhibitions in the Philippines&mdash;primarily in Finale Art File, Silverlens, and West Gallery&mdash;and abroad in Richard Koh Fine Art, Malaysia, and Artesan Gallery, Singapore. Among her group exhibitions are those at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>; Primo Marella Gallery, Italy, 2009; Prague Biennale, Czech Republic, 2009; and Art Beirut, Lebanon, 2013. She received the Ateneo Art Award in 2005. <em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D. Marcelino</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

He was born in&nbsp;Malabon on 31 May 1931. He is the son of Flaviano Cacnio and Telesfora Cruz. He married Amelia Reyes with whom he has four children, two of whom are sculptors, Michael and Ferdinand. As a young boy in Malabon, Cacnio was fascinated by folk designs such as those of <i>caretela</i> or horse-drawn rigs. In high school, he would be late for classes because he would spend a lot of time copying his favorite <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">comics</a>, such as <b><i><strong><strong><strong>Hagibis</strong></strong></strong></i></b> by his favorite artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>, or works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a> aka Botong Francisco. A consistent college scholar at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> (UP CFA), his classmates and friends Salvador Cabrera and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3391\">Federico&nbsp;Aguilar Alcuaz</a>, as well as his professor Toribio Herrera, encouraged him to persevere in art. In 1957, Cacnio joined the staff of the Ramon Roces Publications where he had as colleagues <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>. During this period, Cacnio did illustrations for the <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></strong> </i></b>magazine. He stayed in this job for more than 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1971, he was commissioned to do paintings of cockfights by aficionados of the sport. From then on, he developed his own style and experimented in employing variable textures. In his genre work, he has always been concerned with rendering individual portraits of people in dynamic relationships. In 1977, with the success of his first oil <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>, Cacnio decided to be a full-time painter. His first real break came in 1977 when he participated in the <b><i>Seven by Seven </i></b>show at the Silangan Gallery, featuring the works of seven professors of the UP CFA with seven of their former students. It was in 1985 that Cacnio was able to gather enough paintings for a one-person show at Gallery Genesis. This was followed by shows at the Ayala Museum in 1989, and at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 1990. In 1991, he was also sponsored by Alegria Work and Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cacnio won twice in the Shell National Students Art Competition. He received third prize for <b><i>Gathering Shells</i></b>, 1951, and first prize for <b><i>Tatlong Sabungero</i></b> (Three Cockfighters), 1953. He also won first place for his entry in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a> Centennial Art Competition. In 1967, he won various prizes at the Central Bank of the Philippines coin design contest. His winning designs were <b><i>Lapulapu</i></b>, for the one-centavo coin; <b><i>Marcelo H. del Pilar</i></b>, for the 50-centavo coin; and <b><i>Tandang Sora</i></b> for the five-centavo coin. In 1981, he was recognized by his hometown in the Gintong Parangal ng Malabon for Art. <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">CAEDO, ANASTACIO </span></b>(<b>Anastacio Tanchangco Caedo</b>) was a sculptor. He was born in Batangas, Batangas on 14 Aug 1907. He died in&nbsp;12 May 1990. He was the son of Arsenio Caedo and Genoveva Tanchangco. Caedo entered primary school at Batangas Elementary School at age 11 and completed his elementary education at Calaca Elementary School, Batangas. Dr Juan Tanchangco, an uncle, then a student at the University of the Philippines (UP), persuaded Anastacio&rsquo;s father to send his son to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">UP School of Fine Arts</a>, which the former had entered in 1925. It was a practice in those days at the School of Fine Arts to admit students even if they had not graduated from high school. Nevertheless, Anastacio studied high school at the Manila University while taking up fine arts at UP. Caedo managed to win all the major awards in the yearly school competition. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3802\">Guillermo E.Tolentino</a>, fresh from studies in Italy at that time and recruited to the UP faculty, saw Caedo&rsquo;s potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1925 onward, Tolentino and Caedo worked as a team. Caedo assisted Tolentino in most of Tolentino&rsquo;s landmark commissions like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><b><i>UP</i></b> </a><b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong></i></b>; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><b><i>Bonifacio Monument</i></b></a>, Caloocan City; the life-size figure of Pres Ramon Magsaysay at the Government Service Insurance System lobby, Arroceros, Manila; the <b><i>Rizal Monument</i></b> in front of the Rizal Provincial Capitol; the <b><i>Shaw Monument</i></b> at Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong; and all the dancing figures at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an Palace</a> Reception Hall and Music Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, Caedo established himself as a major sculptor doing commissions for the Jesuits, starting with a 14-foot statue of Saint Thomas More, which adorned the Ateneo College of Law on Padre Faura St. Caedo executed at least eight major works for the Jesuits. In 1951, he became a faculty member of the UP School of Fine Arts, serving the school for 20 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A product of the classical school that prevailed at UP until the mid-1960s, Caedo produced commissioned representational <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>, mainly monuments of national heroes and successful Filipino politicians, businessmen, and educators. Ranging from full figures to busts, these statues featured the actual but idealized appearance of their subjects. Caedo knew how to inject vitality or movement into his works, primarily through the subtle grouping of masses in a figure for the said purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Caedo&rsquo;s most popular works are the seven larger-than-life figures of Gen Douglas MacArthur and company at the Polo Red Beach, Leyte; the Benigno Aquino monument at the corner of Ayala Ave and Paseo de Roxas, 1986; and the yearly trophies of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1925 to 1929, he accumulated eight certificates of recognition and six medals. His <b><i>Dying Soldier</i></b> won the gold medal at the Philippine National Heroes Day Competition on 30 Nov 1920. His <b><i>Trece Martires de <strong><strong>Cavite</strong></strong></i></b> (Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite) and <b><i>Padre Jose Burgos</i></b> (Fr Jose Burgos) won top awards from 1931 to 1932. He also won second prize in the sculpture competition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> in 1952. In 1961, while his bust of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> only won third prize in the competition sponsored by the Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission, the copies of this artwork became the official token given to diplomats. His sculptures of Rizal may also be found in Germany and the USA. <em><strong>Written by Eric Catipon, updated by Cecilia S.

She was born in&nbsp;Manila on 16 Sep 1949. She is the daughter of Pedro Cajipe and Felipa Baisas. She is married to Simplicio Endaya, with whom she has three children. She finished her fine arts degree at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a printmaker, Cajipe-Endaya won recognition for her experimentation with technique and her exploration of Filipino visual imagery initially in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblage</a>, and eventually in her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a>. From 1976 to 1979, she produced a series of prints collectively titled <b><i>Mga Ninuno</i></b> (Ancestors), which brought together images from 19th-century engravings and novenas, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2152\"><b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\">Damian Domingo</a>&rsquo;s albums. Done in etching, collagraphy, and serigraphy, these were interplayed in an abstract order, in reference to the complex issue of national identity. In her 1981 individual show at the City Gallery, she used female figures and windows as motifs for social issues such as labor export and Third World cultural domination. In 1982, she began to take a feminist direction, focusing on the plight of the Filipina in her various contemporary roles. Cajipe-Endaya&rsquo;s works, which often allude to events and conditions like militarization, struggle for land, and colonial mentality, convey the turmoil and passion accompanying social change. She uses various materials and symbolic elements, indigenous and folk, to convey the textures and colors of Philippine culture as well as rich social and historical connotations. She has added sawali (plaited and woven bamboo) panels to collaged crocheted lace, denims, and various objects to endow them with a familiar immediacy. Some examples are <b><i><strong>May Bukas Pa</strong>, Inay</i></b> (Mother, There Is Tomorrow), 1982, and <b><i>Sa Lupang Golgota</i></b> (In the Land of Golgota), 1984. She continues to experiment with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">mediums and materials</a>, incorporating aspects of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> and painting in more recent installations. Some of her major works are in the following collections: <b><i>Bintana ni Momoy </i></b>(Momoy&rsquo;s Window), 1983, Ateneo University Art Gallery; <b><i><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g Bayan </i></b>(A Nation&rsquo;s Passion), 1983, Metropolitan Museum of Manila; <b><i>Sa Lupang Golgota</i></b>, 1984, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Fukuoka, Japan; <b><i>Mansanas sa Almusal</i></b> (Apple for Breakfast), 1988, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP); and <b><i>Solidarity Sisters</i></b>, 1999, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3435\">Central Bank of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She has held solo exhibitions in the Philippine Center New York, Walsh Gallery, Seton Hall University, New Jersey, United Nations Headquarters in New York, all in 2006; Executive Gallery, Goshen, New York, 2007; UP Vargas Museum, UP Diliman, Quezon City, 2010; Museo ng Katipunan, San Juan City, 2011; and Liongoren Gallery, Quezon City, 2011.

He was born in&nbsp;Lucena City, Quezon Province on 29 Oct 1980. He is the son of Leonito Calubayan and Francisca Capulong. He is married to the curator and writer Jocelyn Tullao. Calubayan has a degree in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a> from the University of Santo Tomas College of Fine Arts and Architecture, where he taught and took graduate studies until 2007. He has also given lectures to art students at Kalayaan College, Marikina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The foreign and its juxtaposition to that which is not, called by various names&mdash;the local, the native, the home-grown&mdash;is a central impetus in Calubayan&rsquo;s art. It becomes a lens through which he examines the contradictions and disparities of his artistic milieu. For a 2011 artist residency in Japan, he volunteered as an assistant to a fellow resident, gathered dust on adhesive tape from his apartment, and cooked <i>adobo</i>, a world-famous local dish that he then served to fellow artists. Amidst these seemingly mundane activities, Calubayan recorded the experience of being elsewhere, placed within a context wherein local identities were scrutinized, and to a certain degree defined and assessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Calubayan&rsquo;s 2014 project <b><i>Idiot Knows No Country</i></b> is a pun on the toast made by national hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> to fellow Filipinos <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, who were honored for their victories at the Madrid Exposition of 1884. Calubayan&rsquo;s project explores the many facets of identity and its complex constructions. The artist combines processes that carry the semblance of rituals through everyday practices and whose documentations are conjured as process-based or object-oriented outcomes. All these amount to a scrutiny of his identity as a Filipino artist circumnavigating the routes of the contemporary art world, at home and elsewhere. In these endeavors, Calubayan courageously tests the limits of art making and places his art practice under duress. By doing so, he reveals the inner workings of the world wherein his art thrives and his identity simultaneously fractures and flourishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He continues the project by juxtaposing his ritualistic visits to Mount Banahaw to exhibition visits in Australia where he completed another residency. Guided by Reynaldo Ileto&rsquo;s landmark work <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1641\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1641\"><b><i> and Revolution</i></b></a>,<b><i> </i></b>1979, Calubayan embarks on his own search for <i>liwanag </i>or light, like the 19th-century revolutionaries who trekked Mount Banahaw. Parallel to this, the artist journeys across continents and seeks the light to bridge artistic expressions. In the process, he likewise encounters centuries-old gaps that indeed cannot be in any way bridged but can only be revealed and scrutinized. <b><i>Idiot Knows No Country</i></b> culminates in an exhibition for which Calubayan constructs a hammock from the pages of Ileto&rsquo;s book, an object that contains light limned from a revolutionary project and a concurrent attempt to redefine it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Calubayan&rsquo;s exhibitions since 2007 are <b><i>Idiot Knows No Country</i></b>, 2014, in Bendigo, Australia; <b><i>Biography</i></b>, 2013, Blanc Gallery; and <b><i><strong><strong>Spoliarium</strong></strong></i></b>, 2013, Now Gallery. His works have been included in several group exhibitions including the survey exhibition <b><i>The Philippine Contemporary</i></b>, 2013, at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila; <b><i>Kulo</i></b> (Boil), 2011, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP); and <b><i>Extensions</i></b> at the Lopez Museum where Calubayan affiliated with an independent collective called Plataporma. Calubayan received the Ateneo Art Award in 2013 for which he completed a residency at La Trobe University&rsquo;s Visual Art Center in Australia. He was awarded the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2009. <em><strong>Written by Tessa Maria T.

He was born on&nbsp;28 Oct 1914. He died&nbsp;ca 1945. Capili entered the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a> in 1930, studying there until 1935. His earliest works were in the traditional representational manner as taught by the academically trained instructors of UP. However, because of the influence of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3685\">Galo B.Ocampo</a>, he began emboldening his lines, simplifying his figures as he used a palette knife to emphasize tonal contrast, which pleased <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>. The latter thus named him as one of the Thirteen Moderns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Capili&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Bagobo</strong> Chieftain</i></b>, 1936, at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Art Gallery is also inscribed as &ldquo;Davao,&rdquo; confirming the artist&rsquo;s presence in and affinity for the place. This work demonstrates his penchant for bright colors, which helped project the rugged way of life of his sitter while at the same time highlighting his guileless nature. Capili&rsquo;s <b><i>Impasto</i></b>, on the other hand, captured the rich texture of the chieftain&rsquo;s dress and the ruggedness of his surroundings. <b><i>Tinguian Woman</i></b>, 1941, shows Capili capitalizing on the bold and rugged patterns of the woman&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">dress</a>. It was also through this work that he demonstrated the formal expressiveness of modernism as then understood by Edades&rsquo;s group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1941, Capili obtained third honorable mention for <b><i>Lux Mundi</i></b> (Light of the World) in the Religious Category at the National Art Competition sponsored by UST. His <b><i>Bagobo Chieftain</i></b> was described in the show <b><i>Modang Modern</i></b> (Modern Fad), 1990, as indicative of Capili&rsquo;s promise as a painter.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born on&nbsp;7 Jan 1948. He is the son of Rafael Carating and Susana de Guzman. He graduated with a fine arts degree from the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1970. Aside from his career as a visual artist, he has also performed on stage as a baritone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two of the major themes in Carating&rsquo;s work are underground life and the weather. He is well known for his series on the <i>lamang lupa </i>(earth creatures) and &ldquo;underwaterscapes,&rdquo; which he calls the Anilao State. Art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3444\">Leonidas Benesa</a> describes his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> on the weather as &ldquo;mood paintings, tone poems in another discipline, but in a light rather than serious vein.&rdquo; The lyrical quality of Carating&rsquo;s works as much as his preferred subjects has led him to be categorized by art critics as an impressionist rather than an expressionist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carating has had over eight one-man shows and several retrospectives, one of which was held at the Bulwagan ng Dangal, UP Diliman, in Jul 2012. His works were exhibited in several major group exhibitions in the country and abroad, including the Second Havana Biennial in Cuba. Along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3387\">Augusto Albor</a>, Carating exhibited during the 2015 Venice Biennale via the Personal Structures: Crossing Borders platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carating won twice in the on-the-spot painting competition of the Shell National Students Art Competition: fourth prize for <b><i><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></i></b> in 1968 and first prize in 1969. He was also awarded by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>: honorable mention, <b><i><strong>Barong-Barong</strong> </i></b>(Shanty), 1971, and 12th, <b><i>Lamang Lupa</i></b> (<strong><strong>Earth</strong></strong> Creatures), 1973.

His parents were Eulalio Carmelo, an engraver, who was a Lacandola of the old Tondo aristocracy, and Maxima Casas, Eulalio&rsquo;s second wife. His father and the German Guillermo Bauermann co-founded the lithographic shop of Carmelo and Bauermann. He married Elvira Ullmann, a French mestiza, whose family put up a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">jewelry</a> business in the Philippines. Alfredo obtained his early education at San Beda College and Ateneo de Manila. He later enrolled at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3532\">Rafael Enriquez</a>. In 1914, he went to Leipzig, Germany, to train in lithography in preparation for taking over his father&rsquo;s place in the family firm. There he continued his artistic training and also took his first flying lessons. Carmelo pursued these two interests all his life, becoming the Philippines&rsquo; only marine painter and the first licensed civilian pilot in the country. He was eventually nominated for the Aerospace Hall of Fame in San Diego, California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through research and firsthand observation, Carmelo assiduously acquainted himself with features of different sailing ships down to their last detail.

His early works were characterized by firm modeling and the use of dark hues. His landscapes are predominantly rendered in white and light blue tones, evoking a cool atmosphere in contrast to Amorsolo&rsquo;s yellow and orange-flecked sceneries. After the end of World War II, Casta&ntilde;eda produced several <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> depicting the cruelty of the Japanese occupation forces. These pieces exhibit solidly defined shapes under strong contrasts of light and shadow, which give drama to the scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Casta&ntilde;eda was posthumously given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award by the city of Manila in 1971.

He was born in Camalaniugan, Cagayan on 31 Dec 1947.&nbsp;He is the son of Florencio Castillo and Luz Garduque. He studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1965. He began as an abstract painter, shifting later to the graphic arts where he made his mark, winning five first prizes and becoming president of the Philippine Association of Printmakers, 1973-75. He served as president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>, 1983-84, and was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his etchings, Castillo&rsquo;s strength lay in his inventive sense of design and exuberant use of folk motifs. Around 1972, sociopolitical concerns began to appear in his work, and he was detained for activism. He subsequently did a series of etchings on such themes as human rights violations and the people&rsquo;s struggle in the countryside. The only concession he made to his natural penchant for baroque fantasy consisted in his infusion of flying angels, which he posed as symbols of the liberative spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1975, Castillo left <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>. His show at the Quad Gallery made use of a stenciling technique, with subjects drawn from the 19th-century revolution as allegories for the contemporary one. During his social realist period, he painted peasants in struggle and peasant portraits based on a sojourn he took in the countryside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Castillo was a Benavides awardee of the UST twice, in 1970 and 1971. He was recognized by the Shell National Students Art Competition for the following: third prize, on-the-spot painting, and first prize in graphic arts for <b><i>Himig sa Bukid</i></b> (Tune in the Field) both in 1970; first prize and runner-up in graphic arts, <b><i>Hangal na Daigdig</i></b> (Foolish World) and <b><i>Fruits of Summer</i></b>, respectively, both in 1971. Castillo is involved in activities concerning human rights and labor issues.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He was born in&nbsp;Santa Ana, Manila on 31 Oct 1942. He died in&nbsp;Muntinlupa on 18 May 2016. He was the son of Santiago Castrillo and Magdalena de los Santos. He studied at Don Bosco Technical College and Ateneo de Manila University. He finished with a bachelor of arts degree in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a> at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1962. He has held a number of solo exhibitions in the United States: at the Agra Gallery, Washington, DC; Plaza Hotel, New York; and Via de Parigi, Palon Beach. He participated in the Fukuoka International Art Exhibition in Japan. Castrillo was a faculty member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> in 1974. In 1983, he held the artist-in-residence post at Far Eastern University, Manila. Castrillo was the president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> in 1984, and was reelected in 1987-88. In 1985-90, he was the representative for the visual arts to the UNESCO Commission on Culture in Manila. He was the vice president of the Society of&nbsp;Philippine Sculptors in 1990-92.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Castrillo contributed significantly to the development of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> in the Philippines. He made his mark in the 1960s with his public sculptures for memorial parks, like <b><i>Pieta</i></b> and the <b><i>Redemption</i></b>, and public monuments such as the <b><i>Spirit of <strong><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></strong></i></b>. At the other pole of these massive pieces is his miniature sculpture <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">jewelry</a>. He worked in a wide variety of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">media</a>&mdash;including bronze, brass, stainless steel, chrome, plexiglass, glass, and scrap metal&mdash;and processes like hammer-outs, reliefs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblages</a>, and bronze casting. He did mobiles of chrome and plexiglass, as well as stabiles and other huge environmental sculptures, which are mostly abstract. Many of his works are modular, allowing different compositional arrangements, so that the work is not fixed once and for all but is continually redefined in an active creative process. He also did figurative hammer-outs in which the expressive human forms are infused with the artist&rsquo;s social vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his other works are <b><i>Fountain <strong>Sculpture</strong></i></b>, 1984; <b><i>Kiuala Trengganu</i></b>, Malaysia; <b><i>Benigno S.

He was twice recognized by the Art Association of the Philippines: with an honorable mention in 1964, and a major award for <b><i>Deaf Touch of Joy</i></b> in 1968. He was named one of the Thirteen Artists by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in 1970. He was the Philippine representative in sculpture to the Paris Biennial. In 1986, he represented the Philippines to the Fourth ASEAN Square Sculpture Symposium in Brunei Darussalam. In 2007, he received the Thomasian Meritorius Award given by the UST Alumni Association Inc. <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

Jumalon, along with Oscar Figuracion, Ricardo Avila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3406\">Fidel Araneta</a>, Silvestre Orfelia, Emilio Olmos, and Jose Trinidad Alcoseba. The founding group started as a fellowship of artists who regularly flocked to Jumalon&rsquo;s studio on Colon St, and originally had as its acronym CEARTAS. They were later joined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\">Martino Abellana</a>, Carmelo Tamayo, Virgilio Daclan, Mary Avila, Sergio Baguio, Emeterio Suson, and Jesus Rosa. The original principles of the CAA were to promote community awareness for the visual arts in Cebu, as well as to provide a venue for the exchange of ideas among artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Its leaders, Jumalon and Abellana, were both educated at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a>, and approached art making based on an academic realist system derived from the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>. Through their long period of stay in Cebu, these two artists shaped the sensibility of many CAA members through the teaching and artistic production of works that hewed closely to this academic style, primarily portraits, landscapes, and still lifes. Works from the CAA members were then exhibited in venues in Cebu City that catered to the small public of local patrons and occasional visitors from Manila or abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, the modernist persuasion started to dominate the CAA, through the efforts of such artists as Fidel Araneta, a UP School of Fine Arts alumnus who studied under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a> but hewed to a more expressionistic style, and who was the first teacher of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a> in 1947-48; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3466\">Alfredo Carmelo</a>, who returned to Cebu from studies at the University of Santo Tomas in 1952, where he was a classmate of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\">J. Elizalde Navarro</a>; Virgilio Daclan, classmate of Abueva who subsequently taught fine arts at UP Diliman; and Fr Virgilio Yap, a Jesuit who was the first to advocate abstraction in Cebu during the 1960s and 1970s. The CAA membership from the 1950s to the 1980s thus reflected both conservative and modern persuasions, although a great majority still adhered to the conservative due to the postwar dominance of Abellana. Subsequent members included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3663\">Sofronio</a>, Teofilo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3660\">Godofredo Mendoza</a>; Jose &ldquo;Kimsoy&rdquo; Yap, Antonio Alcoseba, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3784\">Gamaliel Subang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3554\">Romulo Galicano</a>, Gig de Pio, and Mardonio Cempron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the advent of numerous art groups and competing art associations in Cebu starting in the late 1980s, the CAA went into hiatus by 2000. It was recently revived in 2014 via an exhibition titled <i>A New Beginning</i>, featuring works by a reconstituted membership from older as well as younger generations of Cebuano artists. <em><strong>Written by Reuben Ramas Ca&ntilde;ete</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Montera, Dennis. 2014. &ldquo;History of CEARTAS.&rdquo; Pers. comm, 4 Aug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

He first taught architectural design, theory, and history at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3810\">UST College of Architecture and Fine Arts</a> (1964-70) and later studio arts courses at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> (1971-2002). While teaching, Chabet pursued his own practice as an artist and a curator. He led the conceptual art group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\">Shop 6</a> and organized landmark exhibitions of vanguard works by young artists of the day, from the 1970s and into the next four decades. These were held in institutional venues such as the Museum of Philippine Art and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>&nbsp;(CCP), and in private galleries such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\">Pinaglabanan</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\"> Galleries</a>, Finale Art File, West Gallery, and MO Space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Identified as the main proponent of conceptual art in the country, Chabet espoused a practice that gave precedence to idea over form. Moreover, his teaching style challenged students and pushed them toward critical thinking and experimentation beyond the boundaries of traditional art making. Having taught for more than three decades, Chabet mentored generations of artists, many of whom became the most innovative Manila-based artists from the 1970s onward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He is known for his distinct drawings, collages, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a> that are highly allegorical and innovative. His choice of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a> functions as markers of a time in history&mdash;for example, the use of plywood and GI sheets reference his experience of post-World War II Manila. He treated his collages and installations like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>, composed and assembled in layers of found and fabricated objects. Working in a broad range of media, he favored the use of collage with paper and paper products such as envelopes and brown bags, photographs, maps, and readymades such as tables and chairs. He stimulated a nonconventional view of familiar things to evolve a conceptual art more interested in raising artistic and other questions through visual techniques rather than simply presenting works. In 1980, he held an exhibit titled <b><i>The Making of King Kong</i></b>, which demonstrated his acuity in employing popular culture and other sources of predigested ideas to provoke contrarian readings. Another challenging idea that ran across Chabet&rsquo;s work was his de-privileging of authorship, which could be seen in how he worked closely with his former students who later became close collaborators in many of his installation projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After retirement, Chabet continued teaching but in nonformal settings such as artist-run spaces and the Internet. The latter was through the daily online postings of &ldquo;Angel Flores Jr,&rdquo; the son of a fictive character he created in the late 1960s, together with two high school classmates, Ramon Katigbak and Benjamin Bautista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chabet was the first museum director of the CCP, a position he held from 1967 to 1971. His appointment began during the center&rsquo;s planning stage. During this period, he also received a one-year travel grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to observe current trends in contemporary art and museum practices, particularly at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Chabet conceived of the Thirteen Artists in 1970 as a curatorial project featuring young artists whose works &ldquo;show a recentness, a turning away from the past and familiar modes of art-making.&rdquo; This later evolved into the CCP Thirteen Artists Awards, now a triennial program that continues to give recognition to innovative artists. He also started the acquisition of CCP&rsquo;s contemporary art collection, which includes historical works such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2156\"><strong>The Builders</strong></a></strong></i></b><i> </i>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Allegorical Harpoon</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chabet received the 1972 Republic Cultural Heritage Award, the 1972 Araw ng Maynila Award for visual arts, the 1999 CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts, and the 2015 Gawad CCP para sa Sining. In 2011, King Kong Art Projects Unlimited, a group comprised of his former students, organized a yearlong retrospective project to celebrate his 50 years of art practice in exhibitions undertaken in cooperation with various museums and galleries in Metro Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Chabet&rsquo;s work was also the subject of <b><i>Who</i> <i>Was Roberto</i></b> <b><i>Chabet?</i></b>, a research-based project and exhibition undertaken by the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, 2015.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 26 May 1971.&nbsp;He is the son of Arsenio Ching and Chan Chaw Wa. He is married to visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3777\">Yasmin Sison</a>, with whom he has a son, Haraya. Ching graduated with a bachelor of fine arts, major in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> in 1998. From 2002 to 2004, he studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a> at Kyoto City University of Fine Arts in Japan on a Monbusho scholarship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">First joining group exhibitions in 1996, Ching is among the artists who co-founded the art group and alternative space <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3786\">Surrounded by Water</a>, 1998-2006, based in Angono, Rizal, and Pasig City. It was at Surrounded by Water where Ching held his earliest solo shows starting in 1999. Another solo exhibition of linocut prints, <b><i>Rubber Soul</i></b>, 2000, followed at the British Council, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ching&rsquo;s work as an artist is characterized by its sense of whimsical juxtaposition, merging fiction, fantasy, and figuration in his paintings. He has primarily worked in acrylic on canvas, positioning hybrid and detailed figures, compositions, and landscapes against sparse and still space. Conjuring miniature dystopias, Ching&rsquo;s work comes across as multiple states born of the human imagination amidst an ecology of the world beyond self.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ching has also explored the use of shaped canvases and various alternative <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">media</a> as a ground for painting such as silkscreen on black iron, 2008; acrylic on galvanized iron and stainless steel sheets, 2009; painting on vinyl records for his participation in the exhibition <b><i>Foreign Chinese in Contemporary Art</i></b>,<b> </b>for the 2010 inaugural Aichi Triennale in Nagoya, Japan; and pyrography on wood, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His work was included in exhibitions such as <b><i>Pulse Art Fair</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009, New York; <b><i>Surrounded by Water</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, Equator Art Projects, Singapore; and <b><i>Panorama: Recent Art from Contemporary Asia</i></b>, 2013, Singapore Art Museum.

He was born in Fukien, China on 11 Jan 1932. She is the daughter of Chi Seng Ong and Tan Chai. Chua-Lua received her education in China. Migrating to the Philippines at a young age, she received further education at the University of Santo Tomas where she obtained her fine arts degree in 1955. Upon graduation, she involved herself in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1957, she began teaching at St. Stephen&rsquo;s High School, where she presided over art subjects, language courses, and others, being also a foreign language supervisor. She taught art at Saint Theresa&rsquo;s College from 1956 to 1964. In 1953, the artist further advanced her skills in the traditional Chinese manner by studying with Professor Tao of Taiwan. In 1979, she was a member of the first delegation of artists formed by the Association for Philippines-China Understanding, which visited five cities in China. Because of her expertise, she was hired as a faculty member of the People&rsquo;s University of China, Beijing, and associate director of the Foreign Language Reference Research Center, Peking, 1980-84. Chua-Lua&rsquo;s artistic output may be categorized into chronological periods. Her <b><i>Dawning</i></b>, 1952, blends Philippine setting with the Chinese watercolor technique. Her second-period works were influenced by Neo-Realism, exemplified by <b><i>To the Fields</i></b>, 1957, and <b><i>Sidewalk Vendor</i></b>, 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her works from this second period used earth colors to evoke the brown Filipino complexion, warm hues for the tropical atmosphere, tilted or cramped space as opposed to the Western linear perspective and boldly stylized shapes of the human limbs to evoke the thickset Filipino physique. The artist&rsquo;s third stylistic phase shows a return to the Chinese scroll tradition, but the images definitively show a more personal touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chua-Lua had three major shows: in 1957 at Northern Motors, Manila; in 1969 at the Philamlife Building; and in 1987 at the Midtown Hotel. Her earliest works in the Chinese <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> style include <b><i>Stork</i></b>, a silk painting for which she won the third prize in a Chinese-sponsored competition in 1951. <b><i>Dawning</i></b>, 1952, won for her second prize at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> (AAP) annual watercolor exhibition. <b><i>To the Fields</i></b>, 1957, won first prize in the abstract category during the Southeast Asian Art Conference and Competition held in the Philippines. <b><i>Sidewalk Vendor </i></b>received the Best Philippine Genre Prize in the AAP Annual Art Competition, 1958.<em><strong> Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born in&nbsp;Bacolod on 5 Nov 1960. He is the son of Co Pau and Pacita Sia. He studied fine arts at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University and interior design at the Philippine School of Interior Design. Co is a former director of the Bacolod Art Association, a member of Pamilya Pintura, and the chairperson of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3449\">Black Artists in Asia</a>.

His stylistically distorted figures&mdash;at times angry, at times sentimental&mdash;inhabit highly colorful metaphysical landscapes that are largely dreamlike but in which can be found familiar images of electric posts, a stopwatch, fish, cars, and the American flag. Co also does small <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> pieces in low-fired terra-cotta accented with soot. Although his subjects are political refugees, factory and sugar farm workers, he imbues them with universalized features expressing human endurance and courage, rather than particularized characterization. He has combined his colorful <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> and raw terra-cotta into successful reliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Ekspresyon</i></b> (Expression), 1983, in Bacolod City. Since then, he has exhibited in Bacolod, Iloilo, Cebu, and Metro Manila; among his shows were <b><i>Pagpapahilabot </i></b>(Intervention), <b><i>There Is Something Wrong with Freedom</i></b>, and <b><i>Philippines &rsquo;83</i></b>, which formed part of his 1985 exhibitions: <b><i>Terracotta <strong>Sculpture</strong></i></b>, 1986, at the Hiraya Gallery, Manila, and <b><i>Framed Allegory</i></b>, 1992, at the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise. Co also had one-person shows in Sydney, Australia, in 1989 and 2002, and in Hong Kong in 2007. He has participated in group exhibitions in Holland, Japan, and Australia organized by the Black Artists in Asia. Co has also participated in a number of group exhibitions such as <b><i>Who Owns Women&rsquo;s Bodies?</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) in 2001 and <b><i>Landscapes in Southeast Asian Art: Works from the Singapore Art Museum Permanent Art Collection</i></b>, Singapore, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Co was a CCP Thirteen Artists awardee in 1990.

Visually compelling, her series of photographs titled <b><i>Terrible Landscape</i></b>, 2005, shown at the Second Singapore Biennale, 2008, involved the skillful staging of leftover food in order to recreate scenes of disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cobangbang&rsquo;s individual works could also be described as quirky and playful, employing craft <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a>, found objects, and discards, as exemplified by her solo exhibition <b><i>Velvet Landing</i></b>, 2010. Her works often find resonance in past collaborative works such as <b><i>Alice and Lucinda</i></b>, a &ldquo;fluid mask persona&rdquo; which Cobangbang and fellow artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3777\">Yasmin Sison</a> embodied beginning 1999 and which led to the producing of zines, photographs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>, culminating in an exhibition of the <b><i>Alice and Lucinda</i></b> archive at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3599\">UP Vargas Museum</a> in Quezon City and MO Space in Taguig in 2012. Cobangbang also collaborated with Mike Crisostomo in <b><i>The Weather Bureau</i></b>, through which the two artists created imaginary environments using set design and studio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> in conjuring an aftermath of a natural disaster as exemplified by the work <b><i>Experiments in Degree Zero</i></b>,<i> </i>2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cobangbang has actively taken part in local and international artist residency programs since 2003. She completed her first yearlong residency in the artist-run space Big Sky Mind, which advocated &ldquo;crossover and collaboration.&rdquo; Cobangbang&rsquo;s involvement with alternative spaces has presented her opportunities to strengthen international linkages as was the case in her curatorial residency under the Philippines-Slovenia Short Circuit Tactical Project, 2010, where she represented <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\">Green Papaya Art Projects</a>. In 2013, she was also artist in residence at San Art, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, where she represented <b><i>The Weather Bureau</i></b>. <b><i>Search and Destroy Missions</i></b>,<i> </i>2000,<i> </i>Cobangbang&rsquo;s first solo exhibition,<i> </i>was held in the artist-run space <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3786\">Surrounded by Water</a>. As part of the collective Surrounded by Water, she witnessed and participated in defining a critical phase where alternative spaces spawned the early careers of contemporary artists from UP. Cobangbang has held several solo shows including <b><i>The Care for Dead Horses</i></b>, 2010, Finale Art File, Makati City, and <b><i>Raping the Muse</i></b>, 2012, Galerie Zimmermann, Kratochwill, Graz, Austria. She participated in group exhibitions like <b><i>Kingdom Come</i></b>, 2013, Blanc Gallery, Quezon City; <b><i>Manila Vice</i></b>, 2013, Musee International des Arts, Modestes, Sete, France; <b><i>Surrounded by Water, Over the Water</i></b>,<i> </i>Equator Art Projects, Gillman Barracks, Singapore; and the <b><i>Bastards of Misrepresentation</i></b><i> </i>series curated by Manuel Ocampo in various exhibition venues such as Freies Museum, Berlin and 8.Salon, Hamburg, Germany, in 2010, and Queens Museum Project Space, New York, and H Gallery Bangkok, Thailand, in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cobangbang received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2006 and was later invited to curate the award exhibition in 2012. She also received the Asian Culture Council Starr Foundation Visual Art Fellowship together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3434\">Yason Banal</a> and Jeona Zoleta in 2012. In recent years, Cobangbang has also developed her commitment to art writing and project management, conducting lectures and other similar work parallel to her curatorial practice. <em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">COBCOBO, JOEY </span></b>(<b>Joey Vendiola Cobcobo</b>) is a painter, printmaker, and mixed media artist. He was born in&nbsp;Umingan, Pangasinan on 6 May 1983. He is the son of Claudio Cobcobo and Marcelina Vendiola. His father is an Igorot while his mother is from Pangasinan. He is married to Ella Aquino with whom he has two sons, Ark Daniel and Bezaleel Buhay. Cobcobo graduated cum laude with a degree in fine arts, major in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a>, from Technological University of the Philippines (TUP), 2004. He has been a faculty member of TUP since 2010 and is secretary external of the Printmakers Association of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cobcobo&rsquo;s work process often involves developing pieces across different art forms&mdash;for instance, images from prints are translated as clay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> that he uses as reference for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>. The work <b><i>Crown Him King</i></b>, which won the Juror&rsquo;s Choice of Excellency during the 2010 Philippine Art Awards, is an example of an oil painting that was developed in this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first solo exhibitions&mdash;<b><i>Black Saturday</i></b>, 2007, and <b><i>Evangelio </i></b>(Gospel), 2008, in Big &amp; Small Gallery, and <b><i>7 Heads and 10 Horns </i></b>in Avellana Art Gallery, 2009&mdash;are all heavily inspired by his Baptist beliefs. His Lola 101 series of exhibitions, 2010 and 2012, were inspired by how his mother became a grandmother after he had his first son. She participated in the art-making process by doing the crochet work against which the prints inspired by his interviews of grandmothers were set. This series also informed the resulting exhibition for his 2013 Koganecho Bazaar, Japan residency, <b><i>Grand Ojisan/Obasan</i></b>. The subsequent exhibition <b><i>I&rsquo;m Doing My Father&rsquo;s Business </i></b>in Avellana Art Gallery, on the other hand, was inspired by his son and is another collaboration in that the images came from his son&rsquo;s drawings then transferred to red bricks used as intaglio plates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his international group exhibitions are <b><i>Invitational Mini-Exhibition</i></b>, Post Office Gallery, The Arts Academy of Ballard Victoria, Australia, 2008; the <b><i>26th Asian International Art Exhibition</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Hangaram Art Museum, Seoul, 2011; <b><i>Pinoy Ako </i></b>(I Am a Filipino), held in various venues in Ho Chi Minh, 2012; and <b><i><strong>Printmaking</strong>, Pinoy Printmakers</i></b>, Philippine Center, Manhattan, New York, 2013. His group exhibitions in the Philippines include those at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\">BenCab</a> Museum, Ayala Museum, and the Ortigas Foundation Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cobcobo was awarded the grand prize in the 2nd Art Petron National Students Painting Competition, 2002, and at the 2003 National Pi&ntilde;ana Art Competition. He was recognized twice by the Philippine Art Awards: as NCR winner, 2009, and as Juror&rsquo;s Choice of Excellency awardee, 2010. He was shortlisted for the Ateneo Art Awards in 2009, 2010, and 2013. Cobcobo received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2012. <em><strong>Written by Iris S. De Ocampo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Francisco V. Coching </strong>(<b><strong><strong><strong>Francisco Vicente</strong></strong></strong> Coching</b>) is a&nbsp;<b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><strong>komiks</strong></a></b> illustrator and National artist for visual arts. He was born in&nbsp;Buting, Pasig, Rizal on 29 Jan 1919. He died on&nbsp;1 Sep 1998.&nbsp;He was the son of novelist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5177\">Gregorio Coching</a> and Juana Vicente. His brother Vito is a sculptor, and another brother, Greco, is a set designer. He was married to Filomena Navales with whom he had six children, two of whom are portrait artists&mdash;Maridel and Lourdes. Francisco left school at an early age to work for the magazine <strong><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\">Liwayway</a></i></strong> where his father was a novelist. Coching apprenticed with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1934, he created his first komiks<i> </i>character, Bing Bigotilyo, for the magazine <b><i>Silahis</i></b> and the year after, Marabini or &ldquo;marahas na binibini&rdquo; (reckless maiden), which was abruptly ended by the onset of war. During the war years, he joined a guerrilla group, the Kamagong Unit of the Hunters-ROTC. After the war, he created <b><i>Bulalakaw</i></b>. However, it was <b><i><strong><strong><strong>Hagibis</strong></strong></strong></i></b>, his next work, that won him fame. <b><i>Hagibis</i></b>, which was inspired by <b><i>Kulafu</i></b> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\">Francisco Reyes</a> and <b><i>Tarzan</i></b> of Edgar Rice Burroughs, ran for 15 years in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and was followed by sequels: <b><i><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ni Hagibis</i></b> (Son of Hagibis) and <b><i>Si Gat Sibasib</i></b> (Gat Sibasib). Coching&rsquo;s creations were sought out by producers who made movies from them, such as <b><i>Hagibis</i></b>, 1947,<b><i> </i></b>with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4348\">Erlinda Cortes</a>; <b><i>Satur</i></b>, 1951, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>; <b><i>Sabas: Ang Barbaro</i></b> (Sabas: The Barbarian), 1951, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a>; <b><i>Palasig</i></b>, 1952, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\">Gloria Romero</a>; <b><i>Maldita</i></b> (Naughty), 1953, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4460\">Rita Gomez</a>; and <b><i>Movie Fan</i></b>, 1956, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4447\">Amalia Fuentes</a>. All but five of his komiks novels were made into movies. His other well-known works are <b><i>Bertong <strong>Balut</strong>an</i></b>, <b><i>Don Cobarde</i></b>, <b><i>El Ligio</i></b>, <b><i>Espada</i></b> (Sword), <b><i>Agilang <strong>Itim</strong></i></b> (Black Eagle), <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a></strong></i></b> (The Native), <b><i>Pedro Penduko</i></b>, <b><i>Dumagit</i></b>, <b><i>Lapu-Lapu</i></b>, <b><i>Salabusab</i></b> (Greedy), <b><i>Pusakal</i></b> (Hardened Criminal), <b><i>Ang Maton</i></b> (The Tough Guy), <b><i><strong>Taga sa Bato</strong></i></b> (Cut on a Stone), <b><i>Talipandas</i></b> (Wayward), <b><i>Vengativo</i></b> (Prone to Vengeance), <b><i>Thor</i></b>, <b><i>Pistolero </i></b>(The Gunman), <b><i>Dimasalang</i></b>, <b><i>El Vibora </i></b>(The Viper), <b><i>Ang Kaluluwa ni Dante</i></b> (Dante&rsquo;s Soul), <b><i>Pagano </i></b>(Pagan), <b><i>Haring Ulupong</i></b> (King Cobra), <b><i>Bulalakaw</i></b> (Shooting Star), <b><i>Waldas</i></b> (Spendthrift), and <b><i>Contravida</i></b> (Villain). Many of these appeared in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>. At his peak, he was writing and illustrating three weekly serials simultaneously. Coching both wrote and illustrated his stories. His works had a strong narrative flow, brimmed with drama, and were punctuated by action and suspense. His illustrative style belonged to the romantic tradition of komiks illustration, which he dominated from 1934 to 1974, the year he retired, authoring 63 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a> novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His last novel, <b><i>El Negro</i></b>, was published in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and was turned into a film in 1974. The style was characterized by dynamic curvilinear lines and tonal modeling with a fluid, undulating effect. The leading male characters are stalwart in build, and of handsome mestizo or Malay looks, with curly hair and rippling muscles. The female leads are beautiful, graceful of build, and usually with long curly tresses. It is a style that gives life to the myths and legends of yore and to fantasies of love and adventure. Coching influenced other artists, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3732\">Nestor Redondo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a>, Emil Quizon-Cruz, and Emil Rodriguez, to pursue the art of komiks illustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An exhibit of his works opened at Nayong Pilipino in 1987. In 2001, an exhibit titled <b><i>Komiks: Katha at Guhit ni Francisco V. Coching</i></b> (Komiks: Stories and Drawings of Francisco V. Coching) opened at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP). In 2009, another exhibit titled <b><i>Francisco V. Coching: Filipino Master Komiks Artist</i></b> was shown in New York and Hawaii. Coching&rsquo;s restored <b><i>El Indio: A Graphic <strong>Novel</strong></i></b> was published by Vibal Foundation. A dual exhibit with National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, titled <b><i>Telling Modern Time</i>: <i>The Life and Art of <strong>Botong</strong> Francisco</i> <i>and Francisco</i></b><i> <b>Coching</b></i>, opened at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> also in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, he received the Makasining ng Komiks Award at the Tanging Parangal for Comics Art given by the Manila Commission of Arts and Culture. In 1984, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Komiks Operation Brotherhood Inc. Other awards include an Award for Excellence by the Pasay City government in 1998 for his contribution to the local art scene and a Gawad CCP para sa Sining for visual arts in 2008. Coching was declared National Artist for visual arts in 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

He was born in&nbsp;San Nicolas, Tondo on 20 Feb 1933. He died in&nbsp;2006. His parents were Florencio Concepcion Sr and Jacinta Balajadia. He finished his early education at Pedro Guevarra Elementary School during the Japanese period and secondary training at Arellano High School in 1949. He was one of the first graduates of the four-year fine arts course at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman. Before he entered UP, he took up cartooning through the Cartoonist Exchange and Correspondence School based in Ohio. Thus, while studying, he illustrated for comic magazines like <b><i>Action</i></b>, <b><i>Halakhak</i></b>, <b><i>Pilipino</i></b>, and <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b>. After college, he obtained a scholarship to study in Italy from the Italian government. He obtained a master of arts degree at the Regge Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome in 1964.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon his return to the Philippines, he joined the faculty of the School of Fine Arts at the University of the East where he served as dean until 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Concepcion&rsquo;s earliest exhibition works were impressionistic scenes executed in thick impasto. In the 1960s, he turned abstract expressionist along a lyrical vein. His characteristic evocation of spatial depth through the texture of his medium complements his keen eye for color harmony or tonal contrast, which he describes as inspired by his deep appreciation of music. Concepcion is also a highly disciplined watercolorist and a master of figure drawing.

He was born in&nbsp;Catbalogan, Samar on 13 Feb 1910. He died in&nbsp;2008. His parents were Juan Congson and Paz Reyes. He was married to Filomena Alday of Tacloban, Leyte. Congson is a self-taught artist who grew up in Manila. He studied at the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning, an international correspondence school based in Ohio, USA. He also took courses in magazine illustrating and figure drawing at the Federal Schools Inc. In 1948, he became a certified public accountant. Congson started his employment at the Manila Electric Company or Meralco in 1930, first as a cleaner of tranvias, then as a meter reader, clerk, chief accountant, personnel manager, and assistant vice president. Before retiring from Meralco in 1973, he was the executive assistant to Eugenio Lopez Sr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Oct 1933, Congson offered his services to the editor and publisher of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></i></b>, AVH Hartendorp, as he thought the position of illustrator could provide him a good source of income. At that time, the magazine was considered a platform for new writers and artists to show their work. His first commissioned illustration for the magazine was for a short story by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5686\">Bienvenido N. Santos</a>, <b><i>Christmas Idyll</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>published in Dec 1933. The Feb 1936 issue of the magazine featured the first cover illustration by Congson. By 1937, Hartendorp noted the growing popularity of Congson&rsquo;s work among the readers of the <b><i>Philippine Magazine</i></b>, composed mainly of American readers, teachers, and students. Congson continued to submit illustration covers to the magazine until it closed in 1941 upon orders of the Japanese occupation forces during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Congson&rsquo;s illustrations and vignettes may be considered social commentary and satire on everyday life in prewar Manila. Infused with humor, his subject matter are Filipinos doing their work or activities with a sense of playfulness. Some examples of his works are the following: <b><i>When the Mistress Is Away</i></b>, 3 Sep 1936; <b><i>The Dog Catcher</i></b>, 5 Nov 1936; <b><i>Fifty-Fifty</i></b>, 6 May 1937; <b><i>Going to the Market</i></b>, 9 Aug 1937; <b><i>Christmas Lantern</i></b>, 13 Dec 1937; <b><i>Cinderella</i></b>, 15 Apr 1938; <b><i>No Gun Powder</i></b>, 17 Jul 1938; <b><i>A Stitch Takes Time</i></b>, 18 Sep 1938; <b><i>Vacation Cruise</i></b>, 22 May 1939; <b><i>Rainy Days</i></b>, 23 Jun 1939; <b><i>Cuya Goes Acourting</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>24 Jul 1939; and <b><i>Yo-yo Enthusiast</i></b>, 29 May 1941. Many of these vignettes are seen from the perspective of two boys observing their elders in unglamorous poses, sometimes with a dog or a cat creating chaos in the scene. <b><i>The Dog Catcher</i></b>, 1936, depicts a grim-faced man holding a net while the two boys hide a dog behind their backs. In <b><i>Cinderella</i></b>, 1938, a woman is depicted coloring her eyebrows by using a blackened <i>palayok </i>(earthen pot), beautifying herself before a small mirror. The irony of the title and the image is apparent to the viewer as a commentary on vanity and resourcefulness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Congson won first and second prizes in a government-sponsored anti-usury poster contest in 1934.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2014, the Ayala Museum held the exhibit <b><i>The Printed Word: The Lost Art of Gabino Reyes Congson</i></b>. <em><strong>Written by Cecilia S.

During the 1930s to the 1950s, when illustration flourished in the country, Coniconde excelled in character studies of political as well as sports celebrities. He created a series of drawings representing various sports like tennis, basketball, and baseball, with faces of the top athletes idealized but their bodies rendered diminutively. He also executed portraits of the country&rsquo;s presidents, rendering them with extremely fine hatching, cross-hatching, and stippling. <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He was born in&nbsp;Para&ntilde;aque, Rizal on 31 Aug 1950. He is the son of Antonio Contreras and Librada Paz. He married Estrella Isla who also became a sculptor and writer. They have a daughter, sculptor Carlota Contreras Korterbay. He finished a bachelor of science degree in commerce, major in accounting, at the Manuel Luis Quezon University in 1974. He is a member of the Concerned ArtistsofthePhilippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contreras held his first one-person show at Galerie Bleue in 1975. He has done <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> using <i>trabieza</i> (discarded railroad tracks made of weathered hardwood), often in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblage</a> with other materials such as indigenous textiles and artifacts. One of his notable works is the giant crucifix titled <b><i>Human Rights Violations</i></b>, which was installed at the Paco train station. In the piece, the Christ figure, made from a single piece of trabieza, powerfully expresses an image of suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contreras has also dealt with ethnic and protest themes revolving around the struggles of indigenous ethnolinguistic communities against displacement from their ancestral land and exploitation by elites, as in his Our Sacred Land series. In the work, he combines masks, anito figures such as the Cordillera <b>bulol</b>, granary deities, and farm implements. Contreras&rsquo;s preferred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">material</a> may be associated with the belief that the<i> </i>anitos dwell in the hollows of tree trunks, radiating a primeval energy and converging the power of ancestral traditions. He has also carved wooden masks of a highly expressive aspect, embellished by various ethnic artifacts, such as implements, real or imaginary weapons, tribal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">jewelry</a>, and costume fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His other works relate to contemporary issues, such as the mock composite musical instrument called <b><i>Noise Barrage</i></b>, whose title refers to a form of protest against the Marcos government, in which urban communities raised a collective sound barrage at a designated time. There is likewise a functional side to his art in his sculpture-furniture combining wood and heavy stone or marble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His solo exhibitions include <b><i>Treasures from Abandoned Wood</i></b>, 1994; <b><i>New Works</i></b>, 1995; and <b><i>Dream Series</i></b>, 1996, all at the SM Art Center, Mandaluyong; <b><i>Bakal, Bote, at</i> <i>Iba Pa</i></b> (Iron, Glass, and Others), 1997, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise, Makati; <b><i>The Trees</i></b>, 1997, the first public sculpture installed in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig; <b><i>Sculptural Hybridity</i></b>, 1999, Art Space, Makati; <b><i>Homage to the Sacred Land</i></b>, 2003, SM Art Walk, Mandaluyong; <b><i>Rostros de</i> <i>Jesus</i></b> (Faces of Christ), 2004, Quezon City; and <b><i>New Works</i></b>, 2012, Contreras Sculptures, SM Art Center, Mandaluyong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was the grand prize winner in sculpture at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> (AAP) Open Art Competition in 1992.

He was born in&nbsp;Panabo City, Davao del Norte on 3 May 1970. He is the son of Ladislao Coquilla and Rosita Alvarez. Coquilla moved to Manila in 1988 after completing a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">comics</a> workshop by Vincent Kua Jr. It was in Manila where he met visual artist and gallery owner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3627\">Alfredo Liongoren</a> who, with his wife gallery owner Norma Liongoren, encouraged him to take up fine arts and later guided his artistic career. Coquilla enrolled in the certificate program in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">College of Fine Arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman</a> in 1990. In 1992, Coquilla became video editor at the UP National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His two-year stint as comics illustrator helped him develop a unique compositional style of rendering crowds in everyday settings. Offering an aerial perspective, his works recreate life and culture on the streets, revealing the vigorous communal functions of solitary and mundane acts. His canvases are playful and imaginative, yet teeming with sociopolitical commentary. He is best recognized for his paintings of cockeyed human figures with ovoid or bulging heads and distorted limbs, their faces turned upward (<i>nakatingala</i>) with their eyes set upon the viewer of the work. His expressive use of form, vivid color, and brushwork is akin to the styles of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\">Danilo Dalena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3442\">Norma Belleza</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3693\">Onib Olmedo</a>, artists from whom Coquilla gained inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His paintings feature vignettes of life in UP and nearby areas, inspired no doubt by his more than two decades on campus as a student and an employee. <i><strong>Oblation</strong> </i><b><i>Run</i></b>, 2004<i>, </i>captures a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of naked male neophytes emulating the iconic school symbol (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><b><i>Oblation</i></b></a>) and partaking in an annual rite of passage as they streak through the campus. In the exhibition <b><i>Drawing on</i></b><i> <b>Board</b></i>, 2012, Coquilla reconfigured the roof of a jeepney as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>, painting the interior with cramped passengers. The installation engages viewers as they find their reflection on the mirror overhead echoing the point of view of the figures in his drawings. Another recurring theme in Coquilla&rsquo;s works is the popular street food <i>isaw </i>(chicken/pork innards). His first painting in this vein was <b><i><strong>Mama</strong>ng Isaw</i></b> (Mr Isaw),<i> </i>a work he submitted as a plate in Prof. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a>&rsquo;s class in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Coquilla&rsquo;s solo exhibitions include <b><i>Top Shot</i></b>,<i> </i>Utterly Art, Singapore, 2010; <b><i>Drawing on Board</i></b>,<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3599\">Vargas Museum</a>, UP Diliman, Quezon City, 2012; <b><i>IN eks</i></b>, Boston Gallery, 2012; and<b><i> Top Face</i></b>,<i> </i>Boston Gallery, Cubao, 2013. His group exhibitions include <b><i>BSP Tanaw Art Competition Exhibit</i></b>,<i> </i>Metropolitan Museum of Manila, 2011; <b><i>Alay 13</i></b>,<i> </i>Boston Gallery; <b><i>12 x 9</i></b>,<i> </i>West Gallery, Quezon City; and the inaugural show at Pinto Art Museum, Antipolo City, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Coquilla received the Award of Excellence from the Shell National Students Art Competition, 1992; the UP Diliman Gawad Chanselor para sa sining biswal<i> </i>and the grand prize in the annual painting competition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>, 1996; Juror&rsquo;s Choice in the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards and the ASEAN Art Award for the work <b><i>K-H</i></b>, 1997.

He was born in&nbsp;Tondo, Manila on 24 Feb 1978. He is the son of Benjamin Gungon Cordero and Marina Hernandez Ramos. Cordero studied at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a>. He graduated in 2001, receiving both a degree in studio arts and the Gawad Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda for Best Thesis. As a student, Cordero also worked as a freelance illustrator for <b><i>McSweeney&rsquo;s Quarterly Concern </i></b>and <b><i>Pulp</i></b>,<i> </i>a music magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cordero&rsquo;s <b><i>My We</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>a large-scale narrative installation that combined <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>,<i> </i>was shown at the 2011 Singapore Biennale and acquired by the Singapore Art Museum. Through illustration, painting, and sculpture, Cordero has put a humorous and often satirical spin on the serious themes and darker issues that shroud Philippine society. His practice often combines classical techniques with unconventional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">media and materials</a>, a track that might be perceived as putting artists at risk when it comes to developing stylistic niches. Yet, Cordero maintains a distinct aesthetic, which is evident in <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2236\"><strong>Nardong Tae</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Nardo the Shit Guy),<i> </i>which features a scatological superhero whose story the artist has told in a fold-and-staple comic book, and whose fan base has expanded through lines of limited-edition figurines and T-shirts. Precisely because of Cordero&rsquo;s pop culture references, his works are generally very readable to local audiences, more so for those attuned to cultural nuances evoked in his image-making. However, even as international audiences may miss out on the multiple facets of Filipino humor informing Cordero&rsquo;s puns and visual jokes, they are nonetheless introduced to how Filipinos take to the grotesque without overshadowing the possibility of finding beauty in strange places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Internationally, Cordero has contributed work and participated in both group and solo exhibitions, beginning with <b><i>Faith in the City: A Survey of Contemporary Filipino Art</i></b>,<i> </i>at the La Salle SIA College of the Arts in Singapore, 2000. This exhibition traveled to the Valentine Willie Fine Art Gallery, Malaysia, in 2001 and was also mounted at the Metropolitan Museum in Manila and at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, both in 2002. He has since also exhibited in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taipei, Fukuoka, Sydney, Melbourne, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley, Austin, Philadelphia, New York, Paris, and London. Cordero was a resident at the Vermont Studio Center in the United States, 2003. This residency was followed by his participation in another residency at the Big Sky Mind Foundation in Quezon City, 2003-04, and in Bangkok University, 2012. Cordero won the grand prize in the painting category at the 8th Annual Freeman Foundation Awards at the Vermont Studio Center during his residency. In 2004, he received the Ateneo Art Award for which he was also a finalist in 2005. In 2006, Cordero was recognized as one of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> Thirteen Artists awardees.<em><strong>Written by Alice Sarmiento</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

She finished AB English at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1954, MA English at Cornell University in 1957, and MA Communications at Stanford University in 1967. She studied the colonial art of Mexico under a scholarship from the Mexican government. She taught at the University of the Philippines Diliman, 1958-79, and was principal of the Diliman Preparatory School, 1987-2000. She was president of the Diliman Educational Corporation, 1969-2000; chairman of the San Leonardo Charcoal Briquetting Corporation, 1980-2000; chairman and director of the Diliman Holding Inc and Asia-Pacific Training Institute, 1994-98; and chief of mission, Class II Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Mexico for the Department of Foreign Affairs, 2000-01.

Coseteng&rsquo;s interests lay primarily in establishing the &ldquo;<i>criollo</i>&rdquo; nature of Philippine Art. Her fascination with Mexican folk art and its influence on Philippine crafts and culture during the Spanish colonial period was a leitmotif that strung together many of her writings, chiefly <b><i>Spanish Churches in the Philippines</i></b>.

His <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>, on the other hand, are massive blocks of unpolished wood, forming structures that suggest altars for primitive rites.

Most of these wall hangings are done discontinuously, by means of a series of horizontal bolsters upon which the fibers or other kinds of material, such as capiz shell squares, are bound. Importance is given to the qualities of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">medium</a>. The fibers are of various striking hues, with strongly tactile textures. The sheen of the capiz shells is brought out fully.

He was born in&nbsp;Sorsogon, Sorsogon on 16 Jun 1911. He died in&nbsp;Manila on 20 May 1977. He was the son of Damian Cristobal and Teodora Nicolas. Cristobal completed his early education at Sorsogon Provincial High School. He obtained a certificate in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts</a> in 1937. Later, he attended the Academie Julien in Paris to study master in figure painting in 1938. In 1939, he studied under Carlo Siviero at the Regge Academia di Belle Arti in Rome, then later transferred to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Florence, under Felice Carena. He staged his first one-person show at UP in 1940. He taught at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) from 1947 to 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cristobal was one of the Thirteen Moderns. Schooled in Europe, his paintings in the late 1930s, though representational, were achieved with impressionist vigorous impasto, although his forms tended to be expressionistic. The artist, however, later reverted to conservative representationalism, characterized by solid modeling and strict adherence to colors inspired by the actual world. This reversion is best observed in his portrait of <b><i>Jorge B. Vargas as President of Boy Scout, Philippines</i></b>, 1950, a straightforward portrait. Cristobal used flat tones of colors for the face and clothes of the subject so that all subsidiary colors would stand out in intensity, providing decorative relief to an otherwise ordinary subject. The subject matter of his works are religious themes such as <b><i>Mother and Child</i></b>, 1950, as well as landscapes, still lifes, and portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cristobal received an award in 1938 at the Spring Exhibition in Paris; the first prize at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>&ndash;Boys&rsquo; Town Carnival for his painting <b><i>Hingutuhan</i></b> (Removing Lice), 1949; and first prize in the Marian Year Centennial Art Competition, for <b><i>Madonna of the <strong>Sampaguita</strong></i></b>, 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2012, the Government Service Insurance System Museum mounted a retrospective exhibit of his works in <b><i>Damian&rsquo;s Son: A Century of Bonifacio N.

He was influenced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a>, particularly with respect to impromptu landscape <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>.

He joined literary circles and frequented the UP campus on Padre Faura. He published his first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a> in the <b><i>Graphic</i></b> around 1931, after which he was invited to join its staff, becoming associate editor before the outbreak of World War II. During the war, he joined the guerrilla ranks while he worked as translator for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> magazine under the supervision of Japanese censors. His short story &ldquo;Paghihintay&rdquo; (Waiting) was chosen as one of the best short stories of 1943. In 1946, he resumed newspaper work at the <b><i><strong>Tribu</strong>ne</i></b>, which became the postwar <b><i>Times</i></b>. In 1949, he helped to establish the <b><i>Daily</i></b> <b><i><strong><strong>Mirror</strong></strong></i></b>. Aside from writing, he did <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">editorial cartoons</a>.

		"text": "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">CRUZ, MARIA </span></b>(<b>Maria Ferreras Cruz</b>) is a painter, intermedia artist, and educator. She was born in&nbsp;Manila on 24 Jan 1957. She is the daughter of Pablo S. Cruz and Maria Brousseau Ferreras. She graduated with a bachelor of arts (BA) in visual arts at the Sydney College of Arts in 1983. She took up postgraduate studies in the same university in 1984, and proceeded to Kunstakademie D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, where she was a student in the class of Professor Klaus Rinke. In 1999, she finished her masters in visual arts at Sydney College of Arts, University of Sydney. Cruz was lecturer at the Canberra Institute of Arts, Australian National University; and at the Sydney College of Arts, University of Sydney, from 1990 to 1999. The following year, she was appointed senior lecturer at the School of Contemporary Arts, University of Western Sydney, where she taught for eight years. She lives and works in Manila and Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The majority of Cruz&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> feature elements of abstraction with strong conceptual tendencies. Process figures importantly in her practice. She has produced numerous text-based paintings employing hard-edged typography set against a solid background. Such works are influenced by the conceptual tradition of prompting the viewer to read words, exposing the structures of language and painting in the process. Appearing either as deliberately ambiguous or provocative, Cruz&rsquo;s text-based art plays on references to popular culture, as exemplified in her works for <b><i>Psychology Today</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2014, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, which excerpted advertorial texts from a 1971 issue of <b><i>Esquire Magazine</i></b>; <b><i>You Have Every Right</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013, Ateneo Art Gallery, Manila, which gathered statements from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>&rsquo;s 1970s sex film <b><i>Nympha</i></b>; and <b><i>No No No</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2004, Penrith Regional Gallery, New South Wales, Australia, which was based on the discography of Yoko Ono. The latter is part of a project the artist began in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Described as &ldquo;visually eclectic&rdquo; (Ewington 1993), Cruz&rsquo;s paintings are a result of using varying techniques, from realistic portraits to the expressive splashing of colors and painting without a brush. The artist&rsquo;s calculated selection of painting method is shaped by particular frameworks, stories, and other information. In the exhibition <b><i>Painting <strong><strong><strong>Ritual</strong></strong></strong>s, Ritual Paintings</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, Galleria Duemila, Manila, the artist rendered patterns formed by organizing the basic elements of line, shape, and color akin to those found in ritual objects such as masks and textiles. As the title suggests, the artist draws attention to the act of painting as habit-forming. Another work that adheres to the process as content is <b><i><strong>One</strong> Million Dollars</i></b>, 2006, Art Space Sydney, Australia, which oscillated from performance to painting and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a>. The multitude of spherical forms stamped on to the spacious wall of the gallery evokes traces of coins or dollars. Cruz&rsquo;s work is a poignant reflection on the interplay of product, value, and labor, and the latter&rsquo;s obscurity in an imbalanced system of relations. Earlier works in this series are smaller in scale, including Cruz&rsquo;s <b><i>Palette with Coins</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2002, Sarah Cottier Gallery, Australia, and <b><i>Coins</i></b>, 2005, Kaliman Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an artist almost always formulaically positioned within the Filipino diaspora, Cruz&rsquo;s work often poses unsettling questions to those encountering it. Among recent showings in this vein was her 2010 association with the loose grouping of artists called the Bastards of Misrepresentation in the Freies Museum, Berlin exhibition, <b><i>Doing Time on Filipino Time</i></b>. In 2003, she co-founded the Shangri-La Collective, a gathering of female artists for an exhibition of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1364\">music videos</a> that imagines a &ldquo;temporary utopia.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cruz received various international grants and residencies including those from the University of Woolongong, Faculty of Creative Arts: The Visual Arts and Crafts Funds Arts Council of Australia; Karl Hoffer Gesselschaft, International Studio, Berlin; Asialink; the PS1 International Studio Program, New York Artist Development Grant; and the Australia Arts Council City of Hobart Contemporary Art Prize.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span class=\"Runrighthead\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">CRUZ</span></span><b><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">, MARINA </span></b>(<b>Marina Rubio Cruz</b>) aka Tun Cruz is a visual artist. She was born in&nbsp;Hagonoy, Bulacan on 3 Mar 1982. She is the daughter of Nicomedes Manansala Cruz and Elisa Domingo Rubio. She is married to fellow visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3796\">Rodel Tapaya</a>. Cruz graduated with honors from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">University of the Philippines Diliman College of Fine Arts</a> in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Objects and history are tightly entwined in Marina Cruz&rsquo;s art. Her realist paintings of the trove of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">dresses</a> from women relatives, flower arrangements from domestic settings, and rooms from her childhood home convey her sensitive understanding of how image and form are able to relay and transform personal history. She weaves a network of life histories through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> of dresses worn by her mother and aunt who are twins, presenting them through paintings filled with delicate details. Cruz paints creases and folds, torn seams, and faded cloth alongside fine spun <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, intricate textile patterns, and dress silhouettes. Through these forms, she crafts stories of resilience and strength. Aged clothing breathes new life in her 2008 exhibition <b><i>Un/Fold</i></b> at the Ateneo Art Gallery. She enlivens dress through images, stories, and words. Encased in laminated frames, depicted in realist paintings, shown inside cabinets, the dresses are transformed into objects that speak through vision, touch, and smell. Through the life stories of her mother and aunt, Cruz creates a chain of connections between past and present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The details of her pieces engage and suffuse us, yet she is able to simultaneously create distance and nearness in the way she renders objects as vessels of meaning. Her exhibitions combine two-dimensional pieces, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a> works, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>. Cruz assembles an archive of forms, tracing personal memory through art that is engaging, brimming with meaning, and indelibly current. Referencing objects from the past and imbuing them with life through her art makes Cruz&rsquo;s versions of history immediate and palpably contemporary. The exhibit <b><i>Flower Arrangements</i></b>,<b> </b>2013, at Finale Art File illustrates how the everyday is contained in the most mundane of forms: tattered dresses, faded blooms, and shrivelled petals. In this solo show, Cruz assembled a garden of budding forms, cast in resin from the petticoats of dresses that once belonged to her mother and aunt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cruz has done solo exhibitions in the Philippines, Taiwan, China, Australia, and Singapore. She participated in group exhibitions including <b><i>Sungdu-an 4: Extensions</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Cagayan de Oro, 2007; <b><i>2nd Dumaguete Terracotta Biennale</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2007; and <b><i>babaylan@kasibulan.net</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP), 2004. Her works have also been shown in international art fairs including Art Stage Singapore, 2008 and 2013; Beijing Art Fair, 2008; and Hong Kong International Art Fair, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She received the Ateneo Art Award in 2008 together with a residency at La Trobe University&rsquo;s Visual Art Center. She was also awarded the Freeman Foundation fellowship at Vermont Studio Center, 2008. She won the grand prize at the Philippine Art Awards in 2007, and received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Tessa Maria T.

Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija 8 Aug 1973. Cross-disciplinary artist. He is the son of Leonicio F. Cruz and Carmen P. Manalad. He is married to the performance artist Raquel de Loyola. Cruz earned his bachelor of fine arts, major in painting, from the University of Santo Tomas (UST), 1995. As a student activist and artist, Cruz was a member of UGATLahi and Kulay Kabataan. It was during this period when his practice acquired a didactic strain of aesthetics running parallel to the discourse of the political left. Cruz specifically took the route of exploring alternative forms such as performance art and effigy making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His background in activism would later manifest in his works, particularly in performance art pieces, installation, and other cross-disciplinary work. Though he is an active participant in the art gallery circuit, Cruz still explores alternative modes of art circulation that do not necessarily involve object-creation. He specifically draws upon notions of trauma and multi-sensorial engagements in his artistic and discursive production. He uses found objects from his immediate environment and employs these as he attempts to intervene and engage with his public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cruz became embroiled in media controversy in 2011 because of his installation <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2273\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2273\"><strong>Poleteismo</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>.

The installation, which dealt with social, political, and religious imagery, initially captured the attention of broadcast media and was repeatedly invoked in undercontextualized accounts in both mass and social media. The controversy led to the premature closure of the exhibition, a senatorial inquiry, and the filing of criminal and administrative cases against the artist, curators, and the CCP. The Office of the Ombudsman eventually dismissed the criminal and administrative cases in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His notable works include <b><i>Banquet</i></b>, 2006, and <b><i>The Great American Experience Series</i></b>, 2009. <b><i>Banquet </i></b>was first performed in the CCP&rsquo;s Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> and was later re-performed in Singapore, 2006, and Switzerland, 2008. <b><i>The Great American Experience Series</i></b> was a performance-installation done at Lunduyan Gallery, Quezon City; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>sburg, New York; and Brooklyn, New York.

Manila 3 Jan 1962. Visual artist, performance artist, curator. He is the son of Antonio Aquino Cuizon and Barbara Fajardo Soler. He is the nephew of visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a>. Cuizon received his bachelor of fine arts degree, major in painting, in 1987 and master of fine arts degree in 2013, both from the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. Cuizon is program coordinator of the university&rsquo;s School of Fine Arts and Design Painting and gallery curator. He became treasurer of the Board of Directors of Filipino Visual Arts and Design Rights Organization in 2011, creative director of slash/art artist initiative in 2006, and resident curator of Nineveh Art Space in Laguna in 2004. He was also a faculty member of Asia Pacific College, 2006-11, an art instructor in Escuela sa Museo of Ayala Museum, 1996-98, and production design assistant at the Philippine Educational Theater Association, 1991-93. Cuizon has been actively organizing workshops, informal education, and talks with professional and nonprofessional artists, and pursuing collaborative projects under various artists&rsquo; collective initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The search for identity and a need to adopt an objective vista of his country and people foreground Cuizon&rsquo;s overriding philosophy about art. Most of his art pieces transcend the usual two-dimensional depiction of meanings and understanding of visual elements. Often employing dual-tone sepia assemblage of objects and acrylic on canvas, Cuizon is inclined toward creating a feeling of embedded depth upon his painting surface. Themes related to personal struggle, social alienation, and identity politics recur in most works. Reflections about colonization of the Philippines as seen in different levels of divergent cultures resound in his portraits. His subjects range from men and women of different social classes to famous figures in politics and media. The play of objects and <i>baybayin</i> texts in his works offers up the artist&rsquo;s distinct temperament.

Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong> <strong><strong>Ballet</strong> Philippines</strong> </strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\"><strong>Bayanihan Philippine National</strong><strong>FolkDance</strong>  <strong>Company</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\"><strong>Tanghalang Pilipino</strong></a></strong>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a></strong>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\"><strong>Cecile Licad</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Lea Salonga</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea O. Veneracion</strong></a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\"><strong>Antonio Maigue</strong></a></strong>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong> <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </strong></a>&rsquo;s novel, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\"><strong>Felipe Padilla de Leon</strong></a> and libretto by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a></strong>.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos.

Started in 2010, <b><i>Pasinaya</i></b> is an annual one-day open-house festival which serves as a gathering of CCP resident companies, patrons, and the general public. Simultaneous events are held in all of CCP&rsquo;s venues, with designated zones for dance, theater, music, literature, film, visual arts, children and family, variety, and the artists market. There are also crash workshops, film screenings, visual arts exhibitions, food booths, and activities for children. Some of the resident companies also perform excerpts from their upcoming shows or past productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outreach and exchange programs include: <b><i>KUTITAP: Isang Piging ng Kabataang Makasining</i></b>, an annual three-day event for children and young people that started in 2009 and is aimed at raising their awareness of and appreciation for indigenous arts, culture, and traditions; <b><i><strong>Ugnayan</strong> sa Sining</i></b>, an annual series of cultural exchanges and community tours featuring some of the country&rsquo;s prominent regional cultural groups; <b><i>Lakbay Sining</i></b>,<i> </i>a national touring program which features performances from CCP resident companies or art exhibitions previously mounted at the CCP; <b><i>Kaisa sa Sining</i></b>, a program which links CCP to regional cultural groups in order to facilitate regional cultural development, exchanges, artistic programs, and collaborations; <b><i>Lakbay Sine</i></b>, a project of CCP Media Arts Division; and <b><i>Lakbay  <strong><strong>Harana</strong> </strong> </i></b>, a joint project of the CCP and Tribung Pilipino Foundation which aims to promote and reawaken the public&rsquo;s, and especially the young generation&rsquo;s, interest and appreciation for Philippine traditional music like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a>, danza, and immortal Filipino love songs. The CCP through its Cultural Exchange Department also provides local tour grants for regional performing groups. It is also active in giving art therapy workshops&mdash;called <b><i>Kalinga ng Sining</i></b>&mdash;in provincial areas devastated by natural calamities or armed conflicts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP has occasionally engaged in film production.

First published in 1994, the <b><i>CCP Encyclopedia </i></b>remains to be the most authoritative and most comprehensive sourcebook on Philippine art, with volumes on the peoples of the Philippines, architecture, visual arts, dance, music, theater, film, literature, and broadcast arts. Prior to the encyclopedia, the CCP also published beginning in 1989, 28 videos and monographs on the seven arts, known collectively as <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i></b>. The first essays on the seven arts were compiled and published in a coffee table book with the same title in 1991. To encourage the staging of more sarsuwela, the CCP came out with the sarsuwela series which made available to scholars and performing groups the scripts and music of the classic Tagalog sarsuwela <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a> </i></b>(After the Darkness),<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></b> </i>(Country Maiden), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a> </i></b>(No Wounds) as performed and staged by Tanghalang Pilipino.

The award is also given to cultural workers who have helped in enriching Philippine art through their works in research, curatorship, and administration. The Tanging Parangal is given to individuals or organizations to honor their outstanding contributions to the development of the arts in the country.The first Gawad CCP Para sa Sining, then called by another name, was given in 1977 to Hubertus Kuhne (for cultural administration). The award was given annually from 1989 up to 1994, and thereafter every three years.

Bongabon, Oriental Mindoro 24 Oct 1950. Painter. Cusi finished bachelor of fine arts at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU), where he received a most outstanding student award in 1979. An intense early inclination for the arts inspired Cusi to study painting at PWU. From 1975 onward, he joined various group shows and entered almost every art contest in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Having grown up in the countryside, Cusi&rsquo;s artistic expression leans toward a traditional orientation. His works are characterized by neat organization, rich harmonious colors, noble themes, or moving anecdotes. He has an intuition for innovative devices that enrich his compositions and render them up-to-date or relevant to current representational expression. <b><i>Magsasarangola</i></b> (The Kite Maker), 1977, shows a child in sleeveless shirt and short pants, seated in a quiet corner, intently polishing bamboo sticks that he is going to fashion into the frame of a flying kite. Juxtaposed with the figure situated at the lower half of the painting is a wall on which can be seen the drawing of an airplane with a parachute, perhaps a visualization of the boy&rsquo;s thoughts. Its sketchy rendition and the realistic representation of the rough wooden texture of the wall, however, stand out as experimental pop or art brut devices felicitously appropriated by Cusi to inject a contemporary sensibility into what could have just been a skillfully executed but regular genre scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cusi received many travel and study grants and was awarded the grand prize at the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines (AAP) Annual Art Competition, 1980, for his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\"><strong>Halik</strong></a> sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>wang</i></b> (Kiss the Rust). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Painter. He was the son of Ildefonso Custodio, employed as a chief cook in the American Navy, and Rosa Velasco. His grandaunt Valentina Velasco, a nun-painter-sculptor, taught him the rudiments of art. He grew up in Tanza and studied at Cavite High School, which granted him a scholarship to the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To earn his keep, he worked as janitor at the Albert Allen Dormitory.

His still lifes stand out for their realism due to this technique. The impasto that rendered the curling petals of a rose, for instance, gave it a distinctive three-dimensionality. He also rendered bamboo leaves, adorning his many paintings of creeks in the same manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Custodio&rsquo;s awards in the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines include second prize, <b><i>Ginataan</i></b> (Assorted Fruits in Coconut Milk) and best landscape, <b><i>Rosario <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><strong>Barong-Barong</strong></a></i></b> (Rosario Shanty), both in 1953; second prize, <b><i>After the Storm</i></b>, 1954; and second prize, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2261\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2261\"><strong>Pantalan</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Wharf), 1955. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

From an early age he was fascinated by the comics, both foreign and local, which he collected avidly. In 1964, he graduated with a fine arts degree, major in advertising arts, at the University of Santo Tomas, where his mentors included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\"><strong>Galo B.

He did a series of highly realistic toilet and graffiti drawings in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1974 to 1979, he produced his powerful Jai-Alai series of paintings, a culmination of the figure drawings rendered in epic perspective. In these paintings done during the bleak martial law years, the betting hall and the swarming masses in search of luck became a metaphor for the human condition, particularly for the Philippine society in crisis. In 1980, Dalena worked on his Alibangbang series. In these paintings, the setting is a popular beerhouse in Cubao, with its night habitues and a-go-go dancers. All the while, the artist continued filling his sketch pads with hundreds of character studies, figure drawings of the down-and-out prowling the streets, and the city&rsquo;s beer joints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From urban sleaze, Dalena returned to his hometown Pakil, where he has found new artistic inspiration in folk customs and lifestyle. What relates the Pakil series that he began in 1984 to the earlier works is the sense of milling crowds, of mingling bodies in a sea of movement during public festivities, especially the dance procession of the <i>turumba</i> for the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores, the <i>komedya</i> performance, and church and home scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Dalena&rsquo;s one-man shows were those at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5217\"><strong>Joy T. Dayrit</strong></a> Gallery in 1969, Solidaridad Galleries in 1972, Regent of Manila in 1978, and Alegria Gallery in 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena received the second prize for <b><i>Rizal Monument, Luneta</i></b> in the on-the-spot contest of the Shell National Students Art Competition in 1964. His awards from the Art Association of the Philippines are: first prize for <b><i>Tres-Seis Dejado</i></b> in 1974, and fourth prize for <b><i>Alibangbang</i></b> in 1979. The Mobil Art Awards gave him the grand prize for his <b><i>Jai-Alai as Metaphor</i></b> in 1980. He was named one of the Thirteen Artists by the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP) in 1972. He received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila in 1996, while the CCP honored him with Centennial Honors for the Arts in 1999.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

She holds a bachelor of science in human ecology from the University of the Philippines (UP) in Los Ba&ntilde;os.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena&rsquo;s early practice was associated with terra-cotta sculpture and documentary filmmaking. She subsequently explored installation and video. She was a member of the Southern Tagalog Exposure, an activist multimedia collective formed in 2001. She directed <b><i>Alingawngaw ng mga Punglo</i></b> (Echo of Bullets), 2003, and <b><i>Red Saga</i></b>, 2004, which won first place in the experimental category, Gawad CCP para sa Alternatibong Pelikula at Video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena made a series of life-size fired terra-cotta figures of women for her first solo exhibition, <b><i>Found Figures</i></b>, 2007. In 2008, she started incorporating found objects, texts, and images in a definitive shifting toward installations. The works <b><i>Erased Slogans</i> </b>and<b> <i>Red Book of Slogans</i></b>, 2008, consist of slogans digitally effaced from archival photographs of Philippine protest actions from the 1950s to the 1970s. She recompiled the expunged texts in a facsimile Mao-inspired little red book installed within a site-specific work evocative of the faculty and student takeover of the UP Diliman campus during martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena continues to explore the aspect of transformation inherent in the artistic process, fusing video with her installation projects. For the <b><i>Sungdu-an 5</i></b> show at the National Museum in 2009, she collaborated with carvers from Pakil, Laguna, to translate her terra-cotta figures into wood sculptures. In the show <b><i>The Present Disorder Is the Order of the Future</i></b>, 2010, Dalena recast these wood sculptures in marble, juxtaposing them against slogans engraved on gray marble slates and video projections of scenery filmed in transit to sites where human rights workers and journalists had been slain. These elements also resurfaced in <b><i>Monument for a Present Future </i></b>at the Singapore Art Museum, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena&rsquo;s installations have centered on gathering material and visual testimonials of trauma and tragedy, particularly human rights violations and natural disasters. <b><i>Time and Place of Incident</i></b>, 2011, is a five-channel video installation that constructs a loose narrative around how Dalena documented both the graves of Philippine journalists slain over the years as well as the sites of these crimes. It was included in the survey exhibition <b><i>The Philippine Contemporary: To Scale the Past and the Possible</i></b>, 2013, at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. The works <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2321\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2321\"><strong>Washed Out</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2012, and <b><i>Tungkung Langit </i></b>(Toward the Sky), 2013, are based on video footage taken in Iligan City in the aftermath of typhoon Washi (Sendong) in Dec 2011. <b><i>Tungkung Langit</i></b> won a special mention in the Premier Pas category of the Visions du Reel Festival in Switzerland, 2014. She has also shown in group exhibitions in Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, and the USA, including <b><i>Giving Form to the Impatience of Liberty</i></b>, 2013, W&uuml;rttembergischer Kunstverein in Stuttgart, Germany, and at the Singapore Biennale, 2013.

Banaue, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> 23 Mar 1964. Painter, sculptor, installation and performance artist. He is the son of Pablo Damag Sr and Inhaybong (Veronica) Bistol. He is married to Jo&euml;lle R&uuml;ttyn. He graduated from the University of the Philippines Diliman in 1984 with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts. He then proceeded to attend the Facult&eacute; de la Sorbonne in Paris where he took up civilisation Fran&ccedil;aise, 1987-89; the Ecole National Sup&eacute;rieur d&rsquo;Arts Plastique de Cergy Pontoise, 1987-90; and the Ecole national sup&eacute;rieur des Beaux-Arts de Paris where he earned his <i>diplome national d&rsquo;expression plastique </i>(nationalhigherdiplomain visual expression), summa cum laude, 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Damag is among a growing number of Filipino artists who have established transnational art practices that breach the traditional bounds of state and international art circuit impositions of identity clustering. He has taken his critical interest in the politics of display, the complicities of anthropology and historiography to produce works of conceptual rigor and sensate provocation. At the heart of his creative impulse lies a critique of the representation of non-Western ethnic cultures in Western cultural arenas, such as museums and spaces of the art market. This impulse is primarily driven by his experiences as an Ifugao jarred by the encounter with his cultural roots through displays in ethnographic museums. In these spaces, he would often see familiar objects from his culture taken out of their context and used in ways far removed from the lived experiences of the people that produced them. Damag&rsquo;s artistic response to this is aggressive on both the physical and cognitives planes. For instance, in <b><i>Modern Grid</i></b>, 2010, he encloses the <b>bulol</b>, the Ifugao rice deity statue, in crisscrossing sheets of glass which appear to cage it, its form appearing as a strong silhouette against translucent layers. In <b><i>Concilliabules des Idoles Dans un Mus&eacute;e</i></b> (Conclave of Idols in the Museum), 1995/2010, he crafts several bulol from synthetic resin and enshrines them in metal scaffolding that appear to pierce or fuse them as structural elements. In evoking the recurring motif of the Cordilleran bulol, which he physically subjects to varying degrees of violation such as drilling, casting then melting, overpainting, chopping into pieces, and so on, Damag places the notion of construction and self-determination squarely in the hands of the subject, presumably himself, who weighs in on presentations and re-presentations of evolving culture. By placing these physical remains in museums and other institutional contexts of display, Damag consciously situates his critical gesture amidst the trafficking of ideas and investments of value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The shaman&rsquo;s knife becomes small components defining the form of a heart in <b><i>Puso</i></b> (Heart), 2013. Other notable works include <b><i>Ifugao Red</i></b>, 2012, a painting formed by betel extract spat on a canvas, and <b><i>The Saliva of an Ifugao as an Artist</i></b>, 2010, where Damag transforms a restroom into an installation by incorporating wooden pestles and betel-chewing ingredients. In most cases, such objects are appropriated as evidences of the simpler, more primitive societies making up one pole of historical evolutionary accounts of human development where modern, Western cultures lie at the pinnacle of progression. As such, he intends to wrest his culture from a faux pure and sacred state and instead assert its being dynamic, evolving, yet enduring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Based in Paris, Damag has exhibited extensively in solo and group shows across Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Paete, Laguna 1805. d. 1888. Painter. His baptismal certificate shows that he was originally named Joseph Luciano de San Rafael. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> theory says that he was a mestizo of Spanish, Chinese, and indio stock and that he adopted the family name Dans upon the promulgation of the decree by Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria ordering Philippine natives to assume new surnames. Another possible theory points to the Dans family coming from Belgium in the 1500s. Painter Araceli Dans, who is married to the great-great-grandson of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3501\"><strong>Jose Dans</strong></a>, said that a certain Dans family from Belgium sent them a genealogical chart which shows a note of &ldquo;Philippines&ndash;1500&rdquo; (Fajardo 2005).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the church of the Santiago Parish in Paete, Laguna, are found four larger-than-life murals&mdash;namely, <b><i>Juicio</i></b> <b><i>Final</i></b> (Last Judgment), ca 1720; <b><i>San Cristobal</i></b> (Saint Christopher), fresco on plaster, ca 1780; another <b><i>San Cristobal</i></b>, oil on panel, ca 1840; and <b><i>El Cielo, El Paraiso, El Purgatorio y El Infierno</i></b> (Heaven, Paradise, Purgatory, and Hell), ca 1850. Only the last two are attributed to Dans. His <b><i>Cristobal</i></b> was hung over the 1780 fresco in order to cover it. According to oral tradition, the fresco did not satisfy the church authorities as it violated iconographic conventions. In it, San Cristobal was depicted in 18th-century buccaneer&rsquo;s costume, complete with a wedge-shaped blade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dans&rsquo;s <b><i>Cristobal</i></b> was painted on 12 planks of wood joined together. According to legend, San Cristobal was a pagan giant who transported people on his shoulders across the lake. One day he carried an infant who became heavier and heavier as they reached the depths of the lake. When Cristobal asked the reason for this, the child revealed himself as Christ who was carrying the globe with him. This revelation caused the pagan&rsquo;s conversion, and he assumed the name Cristobal or Christ&rsquo;s bearer. The painting shows Dans&rsquo;s proficiency as a realistic painter. Both Christ and San Cristobal are effectively modeled, their limbs well drafted. Dans also painted a vast lake in accurate linear perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dans&rsquo;s more important work, <b><i>El Cielo, El Paraiso, El Purgatorio y El Infierno</i></b>, depicts the Catholic view of salvation, showing Adam and Eve at the center and the crucified Christ above them. On the same level with Christ are the seven sacraments, and above the saints is heaven presided over by God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and the Virgin Mary. Below the sacraments are the souls in purgatory, and below them the torturers, monsters, and fires of hell. Dans&rsquo;s church paintings have provided Philippine art history a visual anchor on how religious concepts were negotiated and understood in the context of a colonized society.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Some of these objects he had stumbled upon, retrieved, and salvaged, while others he had kept and collected over the years, such as damaged photographs, glass, metal, galvanized iron, beeswax, books, coasters, and LP sleeve covers. He made use of such diverse media to reflect on themes that revolve around the passage of time and how forces of nature and human action interact in the process. In his works, he reflects on notions of growth and decay, nostalgia and memory, transience and permanence, life and death. His artistic process also alludes to his incursions into the nature of spatio-temporal existence: how deliberate human action navigates around accidents and random occurrences. He subjects his chosen objects to the inevitable effects of wear and tear, allowing the stains of time and neglect, patina, and at times infestations to accrue on their surfaces before subjecting these to scraping, drawing, painting, and other processes. His last work before his death, the installation <b><i>Untitled</i></b> [<b><i>Anus of the Sun</i></b>],<b><i> </i></b>2013, engaged with the space of the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design (MCAD). It was part of the exhibit <b><i>Without a Murmur</i></b>,<i> </i>curated by Joselina Cruz, which marked MCAD&rsquo;s first all-Filipino group show, which also included At Maculangan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3639\"><strong>Lani Maestro</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3795\"><strong>Maria Taniguchi</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His solo exhibitions include<b><i> Illuminated Pages</i></b>, 1983, Hiraya Gallery; <b><i>Palimpsest</i></b>, 1985, De La Salle University Gallery;<b><i> Viewing the Numinous</i></b>, 1986, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP);<b><i> Selected Works</i></b>, 1996, Japan Cultural Center, Bangkok, Thailand;<b><i> Still</i></b>, 1997, Vargas Museum, UP Diliman;<b><i> New Works</i></b>, 2002, The Drawing Room, Makati; and <b><i>And of Time</i></b>, 2010.

He obtained his bachelor of fine arts degree at the University of Santo Tomas in 1957. In 1963, the Italian government awarded him with a two-year scholarship in painting at the Regge Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. David became interested in art conservation at this juncture, and in 1967, he studied at the Instituto di Ristauro di Roma. He joined the team that worked on the rehabilitation of art objects damaged by the floods of Florence. From 1967 to 1969, he took on conservation work for the Corcoran Studio and later for Carolyn Horton, noted author on restoration.

Dynamic movement was evidently one of his concerns. <b><i>Passaggio dal Cielo</i></b> (Passage to Heaven) was painted in bright hues applied with forceful strokes.

Day-ag&rsquo;s mural reliefs and garden sculptures were made of stone, cement, or a mixture of white marble sand and cement.

Baguio City 2 Oct 1979. Intermedia artist. He is the second of the three sons of artist and filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\"><strong>Kidlat Tahimik</strong></a> (Eric de Guia) and artist-scholar Katrin M&uuml;ller de Guia. Kawayan&rsquo;s siblings, Kidlat and Kabunyan, are also intermedia artists. De Guia studied at the Philippine High School for the Arts in 1992-96.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Involving compelling commentaries on identity and the colonial past, de Guia&rsquo;s works are entrenched in the Cordillera where he was born and raised. His affinity with place is reflected in his process of sourcing and refashioning found objects and establishing connections with the local community. Turning to painting, photography, assemblage, video, sculpture, installation, performance, and later on to public art practice, many of de Guia&rsquo;s works employ pastiche and imaging techniques from popular culture, forming layered significations in his art. In the exhibition <b><i>Katas na Pilipinas,</i></b> <b><i>God Knows <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>Hudas</strong></a> Not Pay</i></b> (Philippine Earnings, God Knows Who Does / Judas Not Pay), 2009,<b> </b>de Guia collaborated with the technician Rojer Berdun to revive junked jukeboxes. Recalling present-day appropriations of symbols of colonial legacy, the artist transformed the machines&rsquo; exteriors to make these appear like jeepneys. The lure of television and its repercussions are explored in de Guia&rsquo;s works for the exhibition <b><i>Ice Cold Happiness</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009, held at Soka Art Center, Beijing.<b><i> </i></b>Harking on a similar theme albeit more rooted in the Philippine experience, his Linangaw<b><i> </i></b>(Fit for Flies)<b> </b>series rendered portraits of celebrities and TV personalities by collecting houseflies affixed unto a surface. An assemblage of trumpets made from 35 mm celluloid films depicting a horse about to gallop rounded out the aforementioned series in the exhibition <b><i>A Lot of Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Guia&rsquo;s artistic training is further honed by his exposure to a community of Baguio-based artists who have probed into prevailing conditions of the region. His series of intermedia work for <b><i>Incubator</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2006,<b> </b>imagines rooms of artists who have influenced his practice&mdash;among them, Tommy Haffala, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3405\"><strong>Rene Aquitania</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\"><strong>Roberto Villanueva</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, and his father, Kidlat Tahimik. In 2011, de Guia co-organized the <b><i>AX(iS) Art Project</i></b>: <b><i>Accident Waiting to Happen</i></b>, an art festival held at Burnham Park, Baguio, which involved local and international artists. This was followed by <b><i>To the End of the World</i></b>, 2012, where artists and writers traveled together on a bus along Halsema Highway to reach the Mountain Province. The artists engaged with the local communities and together they created site-specific and ephemeral works. This cumulative and collaborative project grew, and became part of the Singapore Biennale in 2013, where de Guia was selected as one of its curators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Guia received the Ateneo Art Award in 2008 and 2011. As winner, he was granted artist residencies at Omi International Arts Center in Ghent, New York, 2009, and at La Trobe University Visual Arts Centre in Melbourne, Australia, 2012.

Liliw, Laguna 1942. Painter, potter. He studied at the University of Santo Tomas and the University of the Philippines, where he finished a degree in fine arts. In 1967, he held his first one-person show at the Solidaridad Gallery. While in Mexico to study mural painting under the masters, he became interested in and later shifted his attention to pottery. His wife, Ann, and his children are all engaged in pottery. He has lived with his family in Liliw, Laguna; Candelaria, Quezon; and Sagada, Mountain Province. He has dedicated himself to promoting the art of pottery in rural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Guzman won critical recognition in the 1970s with his large murals <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2192\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2192\"><strong>Gomburza</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> and <b><i>Metamorphosis</i></b>. A historical mural, <b><i>Gomburza</i></b> shows the three martyred priests upon a cross which also serves as their garrote, an allusion to the martyrdom of Christ. <b><i>Metamorphosis</i></b> is a powerful, semiabstract composition in red, black, and white. These are considered to be his greatest contributions to Philippine painting and are in the collection of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A recurring theme in the artist&rsquo;s work is the quest for identity through a retracing of the past. Some of his paintings, particularly what he calls &ldquo;historical allegories,&rdquo; contain autobiographical elements that pose the question of his identity as an individual and as Filipino. In <b><i>Indio Sangre Puro</i></b> (Pure Indio Blood), de Guzman identifies the country&rsquo;s heroic period as the 19th-century propaganda movement, which was the inspiration for his historical paintings. Many of his landscapes evoke the setting of Liliw at the foot of Mount Banahaw, known for its millenarian and Rizalist groups, and the source of de Guzman&rsquo;s symbols. His other works are visionary landscapes leaning toward esotericism as these are done in his dramatic painterly style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Guzman received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 1970. In Mar 2015, the CCP held a retrospective of de Guzman&rsquo;s works. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo, updated by Zeny May D.

He learned wood carving from his father who had a shop in their house in Santa Cruz, Manila. His paternal grandfather, Anastasio de Jesus, was also a wood-carver. Romualdo took over his father&rsquo;s shop when the latter died in 1868. It was here that he made his acquaintance with JoseRizal, to whom he gave wood-carving lessons every week.

Simon<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> y de la Rosa was his uncle while Fernando and PabloAmorsolo were his nephews. His first art lessons were from an aunt, Mariana de la Rosa, who taught him at age 10. When he was 22 years old, he painted <b><i>La Perla de Lucban</i></b> (Pearl of Lucban),<b> </b>considered to be his oldest existing work. He studied at Escuela Superior de Pintura, Grabado y Escultura in 1893, under Don <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\"><strong>Lorenzo Rocha</strong></a>. He later enrolled at the Escuela de Bellas Artes y Dibujo under Agustin Saez but dropped out after three years. He also received lessons from LorenzoGuerrero and MiguelZaragoza. In 1908, the Germinal Cigar Factory sent him to Europe as a scholar. The schools he attended included the Academie Julien in Paris and the Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. Back in Manila, together with a number of artists, he became one of the first faculty members of the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. He introduced and taught decorative painting at UP. During the period 1927-37, he became the director of the school. In 1928, he sailed to Europe for the second time with his wife. He painted in Paris for four months and then traveled to Munich, Geneva, Rome, and Madrid. In 1928, he presented a much-acclaimed exhibition of his paintings at Ateneo de Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He is reputed to have produced about 1,000 works in his lifetime. AurelioS. Alvero divides his works into three periods. In the first period, de la Rosa&rsquo;s emphasis is academic, detailing figures but forgetting atmosphere. Works of this period include <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b>, which won the gold medal in the International Exposition of Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1904 and <b><i>The Death of General Lawton</i></b>, which won the bronze medal in the same exposition. The second period, which includes works he did in Europe, shows a transition from focusing on academic figures to greater attention to atmosphere. Examples of this period are <b><i>El<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1936, and <b><i>Marikina Road</i></b>, ca 1939. In his third period, de la Rosa emphasizes plays of colors in the manner of massing and spacing hues. Typical of this period is <b><i>Fishermen&rsquo;s Huts </i></b>on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\"><strong>Balut</strong></a> Island, Tondo, considered by Alvero as his best landscape. Other paintings of de la Rosa are <b><i>Landscape with Dark Trees</i></b>, 1927; <b><i>La Pintora</i></b> (Woman Painter), 1926; and <b><i>La Bordadora</i></b> (The Embroiderer), ca 1926. He also did a <b><i>Riverview of Santa Ana</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1938.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De la Rosa posthumously received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila in 1968. In 2006-7, the <b><i>Fabian de la Rosa (1869-1938) Retrospective Exhibition</i></b> was held at the UP Vargas Museum to honor his legacy. <em><strong>Written by J. B. Guysayko, updated by Cecilia S.

His medium was mostly oil but also pen-and-ink and watercolor. His subject matter ranges from still lifes to genre, historical and tourist spots, rock formations, flora, and, most especially, landscapes. His meticulous and impressionistic brushstrokes endowed his works with a highly textured surface, further enriched with the use of a wide range of color combinations that makes him a colorist. He also did prints showing urban scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De la Rosa is perhaps one of the most exhibited painters in the country, with more than 60 one-person shows since 1970 and more than 145 group shows since 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was a Thirteen Artists awardee of the Cultural Center of thePhilippines in 1972.

Sculptor. He is the only Filipino sculptor prior to the 19th century whose activities are amply recorded. He was a native of San Pablo, Laguna, then an artistic center paralleling, if not antedating, the wood-carving town of Paete. In his unpublished manuscript <b><i>Historia de la Provincia de Batangas </i></b>(History of Batangas Province), 1790, Pedro Andres Castro y Amadeo, later known as Fr Agustin Maria de Castro of the Augustinian order, described de los Santos and his works as &ldquo;a native of San Pablo de los Montes and chief sacristan of its church for forty years. This maestro made the main altarpiece of SanAgustin in Manila and many others. He was also a skillful jeweller and worked with his hands all the silver ornaments of San Agustin, which were excellent. All these works were done under the guidance of Fr Hernando Cabrera, son of Cordova and prior of the Augustinian Monastery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De los Santos executed the tabernacle of San Agustin Church, Intramuros, from a design by Father Cabrera. He is also credited by EsperanzaBunagGatbonton with crafting the ivory crucifix in the same church, which features a realistically agonizing Christ. His most accessible work is the retablo also found in the San Agustin Church. Executed in 1617, this retablo was placed above the main altar, but in 1622, it was transferred to the vestry hall, now the Museum Hall of the convent. This was because its Ionic-Corinthian style no longer conformed to renovations in the church, which were patterned after the then-fashionable baroque style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">If the naturalism of de los Santos&rsquo;s ivory crucifix reflects late Renaissance sensibility, his retablo shows the symmetry of Renaissance architecture. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> feature of this altar is the broken arch pediment, which also shows the influence of the mannerist style. De los Santos&rsquo;s works are testaments to the influences of European sensibility and aesthetic on Filipino art. These also suggest how Filipino artists used and synthesized these influences to create distinct bodies of work. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Guagua, Pampanga 27 Dec 1942. Painter. His family migrated to Davao where he completed his grade school at the University of Mindanao, and high school and collegiate courses at Ateneo de Davao. In 1962-64, he took fine arts courses at the University of Santo Tomas under Galo B.Ocampo. At first, he did sculpture in wood and stone but shifted to painting. Aside from using oil and watercolor, he experimented with the use of lacquer acrylic (car paint) in his search for durability and brightness of color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He had his first one-person show at the United States Information Service or USIS Center, Davao. This was followed by a 1986 two-person show at the Solidaridad Gallery in Ermita, Manila, and another at CM Gallery. His third one-person show was at the National Museum in 1969. In 1980, he held his fourth one-person show at the Heritage Center. He had a 20-year retrospective of his works at the Davao Museum and Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of his works are Davao landscapes and genre, particularly of the cultural communities of the South. He has also done a series of paintings on the Philippine eagle as a double symbol of US imperialism, on the one hand, and of the strength and beauty of unconquered indigenous groups, on the other hand. He is one of the first to employ photocopying as art medium and mode in the interest of popularizing powerful images of the people&rsquo;s struggle. In the gap between his 1969 and his 1980 show, he devoted himself full time to the people&rsquo;s cause. His exploration of alternative mediums encapsulates the realities of struggle and collective action informing art practices in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Vera won awards at the Shell National Students Art Competition: first prize for <b><i>Psyche</i></b>, 1964; first prize for <b><i>Archetype</i></b>, 1965; and second prize for <b><i>Highway</i></b>, 1965.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

His major contribution to religious art, however, is in the works he did for the completion, renovation, and decoration of the Cubao Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception under Bishop Honesto Ongtioco. Between 2000 and 2015, he redesigned the altar and sacristy, the side altars, the ceilings, nave, and the facade and sides of the cathedral. He also painted the portraits of the Four Evangelists for the ceiling above the transept and the portraits of the 12 apostles installed on the walls of the nave, and designed the nine stained glass windows depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary. With various architects and engineers, he also designed the cathedral&rsquo;s rectory, columbary, and bishop&rsquo;s residence. He is also well known for his exquisite designs for priestly vestments and the costumes of important Marian images like the La Naval and the Virgin of Manaoag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In celebration of the centennial of the Philippine Independence and Republic, he mounted an exhibit in 1998 depicting Philippine heroines like Gregoria de Jesus, Teresa Magbanua, Melchora Aquino, and Trinidad Tekson.

As a student of fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas, he learned the basics of etching and woodcut under MarioParial. He studied an archaic Western technique, mezzotint, which results in rich, deep black shades and delicate modulations and nuances of tints, and often combined this method with etching and aquatint.

Iloilo City 18 Mar 1954. Painter. He is the son of AntipasDelotavo Sr and Danara Polines. He obtained his art education at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University and joined the Center for the Advancement of Young Artists and Kaisahan. He was also a member of the ConcernedArtistsofthePhilippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first one-person show at Art Associates in 1977. Portraiture is his forte, but he chooses his subjects from the anonymous crowd in busy thoroughfares. In his portraits of workers, each face is focused separately, marked with the vulnerability of the oppressed by becoming hardy with age and experience borne of survival and struggle. With characteristic economy of means, he has recreated the entire environment: the sights, textures, and smells of the city. In <b><i>Itak sa Puso ni Mang Juan</i></b> (Dagger in the Heart of Mang Juan), the sharp bladelike thrust of the Coca-Cola sign appears to stab the old man&rsquo;s heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His solo shows in 1978 and 1979 at the Ma-Yi Gallery consisted of portraits in oil, again of men and women of the urban poor against a background of whitewashed walls with traces of graffiti in keeping with the theme of the Kalburo (Whitewash) series. Themes relating to the exploitation of women made its appearance in Delotavo&rsquo;s body of work in 1979. In mid-1982, his show <b><i>Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>ng Di Kilala</i></b> (Unknown Heroes) was the product of the artist&rsquo;s sojourn in the haciendas of Central Luzon where he observed the life of sugar plantation workers. His 1983 show at the Hiraya Gallery dealt with the subject of urban construction workers and their alienation from the grand structures they build. His <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2301\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2301\"><strong>Struktura</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Structure), 1990, showed construction workers building the edifices of the Marcos period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Delotavo has had over 13 one-man shows and continues to exhibit works that strongly emphasize his views, specifically that of worker&rsquo;s struggle, alienation, and plays for power. Among his exhibitions are <b><i>Mallcontents</i></b>, 2013, and <b><i>Oplan Noplan</i></b>, 2014, both shown at Art Informal, Greenhills. His exhibition <b><i>Agos</i></b> (Current), 2016, at the Vargas Museum, University of the Philippines Diliman, gave a critical reflection on the Basi Revolt through paintings and installation work. Among his group shows are <b><i>Recolonization: VFA and the Next Hundred Years</i></b>, 1999, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3489\"><strong>Maria Cruz</strong></a>, shown at the Hiraya Gallery, Manila; <b><i>Feast of the Forest</i></b>, 2007, and <b><i>Samu&rsquo;t-Sari: Art for Biodiversity</i></b> (<b><i>Diversity: Art for Biodiversity</i></b>),<b><i> </i></b>2008, both shown in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan; <b><i>GRRROAN&rarr;&gt;GRRREEEN</i></b>, 2013, shown at Liongoren Gallery, Cubao, for the Philippine Art Fair; and <b><i>Picture Life: A Contemporary Still Life Exhibition</i></b>, 2014, shown at Tin-Aw Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Delotavo won the grand prize in the 1979 Art AssociationofthePhilippines Annual Art Competition for his watercolor <b><i>Kapos</i></b> (Lack).

Illustrator, painter. He took up courses in fine arts at the University of the Philippines, but he never finished because he had to work for a living. Thus from 1929 he was employed as illustrator in the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>ne</i></b> and <b><i>Taliba</i></b>. Later he became chief artist of the <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine</i></b>.

His drafting style was robust, his tonal values refined and dramatic, thus apt for the illustration of short stories and serialized novels. Because of his vigorous lines (and bold brushwork in his paintings), VictorioEdades regarded him as a potential modernist, and he enlisted him as one of the Thirteen Moderns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Diego&rsquo;s early period is best represented by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1948, a work containing elements that in two years&rsquo; time would appear as traits of Neo-Realistic genre. <b><i>Capas</i></b> is a poignant recreation of the suffering of Filipino-American forces that surrendered to the Japanese in 1942. It is a close-up of multi-decked bamboo cots where the sick soldiers are lying consumed by disease and hunger. The predominantly brown color scheme suggests the bleak situation while rugged textures and the shallow space where all the bodies are huddled evoke the prevailing discomfort. As chief artist of the <b><i>Sunday Times</i></b> from the 1950s to the early 1970s, Diego hardly had time for painting. He painted again sometime in 1974, turning to genre in a style influenced by magazine illustration but using bright hues. His Carabao Rice<b><i> </i></b>series was his most successful, showing his characteristic vigorous drafting style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Diego won third prize for <b><i>Siesta during <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a></strong></a> Time </i></b>at the second National Art Contest sponsored by the Kapisanan ng Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas or Kalibapi in 19 Jun 1944.

He grew up in the cities of Butuan and Surigao in Mindanao. He graduated with a fine arts degree from the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1979. He was an artist of <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b>, a national daily newspaper. He served as a professor at the UP College of Fine Arts, and dean from 1998 to 2001.

Doloricon found his calling in socially committed art during a period of social and political ferment in the country. At age 18, he became involved with a group of socialist realist painters called Kaisahan, to whom he owes the growth of his social awareness. His works show his deep involvement with people, particularly those from the laboring classes, whom he treats not as an amorphous mass but as interesting individuals. His paintings contribute to a new image and truer characterization of the Filipino. The focus of these characterizations are specific portrayals of the struggles and plight of the Filipino working and farming class. Woodcuts such as <b><i>Hacienda</i></b>,<i> </i>2014, and <b><i>Iron Dragonfly</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1989, present the viewer with exploitation of nature and of the agency and rights of farmers.

Tondo, Manila 12 Feb 1796. d. Manila 26 Jul 1834. Painter. According to his will of 1834, he was the son of Domingo Macario and Erminigilda Gabriela. His parents&rsquo; possession of two Christian saints&rsquo; names instead of a Christian name and a traditional Spanish or Filipino surname confirms that they were Chinese immigrants who converted to Christianity or that they were children of Chinese immigrants who could not claim any important Chinese surname. This fact dismisses earlier suppositions or claims that Domingo was descended from Spanish nobility. He married <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a> Casas with whom he had 10 children, two of whom died in infancy. Domingo established his reputation as an artist by painting lifelike miniatures on ivory. By 1821, he already had such a large following that he had to open his house to take on trainees. On 2 Dec 1823, the Sociedad Economica de Amigos de Pais formalized his workshop as the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura. His appointment as professor was confirmed on 13 Jun 1826. On 9 Apr 1829, he gave the first examinations in the said school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometime in the mid-1820s, Domingo must have met Rafael Daniel Baboom, a Catholic Indian merchant from Madras, who traded in silk. Baboom engaged Damian to paint albums that depicted the fashions and occupations of the various citizens of the Philippines. Damian executed several of those albums. Before World War II, six of these were extant but one was destroyed by fire. Meanwhile the album at the Newberry Library is the only one that Domingo signed individually on all the constituting plates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Only four easel paintings have been ascertained as being painted by him: the <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario dando el Santisimo Rosario al Santo Domingo y Santa Catalina</i></b> (Our Lady of the Rosary Giving the Most Holy Rosary to Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine), ca 1815; <b><i>La Sagrada Familia</i></b> (The Holy Family), ca 1830; <b><i>La Catedra de San Pedro </i></b>(The Seat of Saint Peter), ca 1825; and <b><i>LaInmaculadaConcepcion </i></b>(The Immaculate Conception). The first three are in the possession of his descendants; the last is in the Xavier University Folklife Museum and Archives. All these pieces are done in fine miniaturismo technique. These Domingo paintings were achieved by using five Chinese sable brushes, some equipped with just one bristle. Domingo&rsquo;s brushwork is even finer in the albums of costumes for which he used gouache or water-based tempera on pith paper. According to historian Carlos Quirino, the only existing portrait of Domingo was done by his son Jose, based on a self-portrait on ivory (Quirino 1961). Domingo&rsquo;s paintings provided a better understanding and insight into the appearances, clothing, and occupations of the Filipinos of his time, enriching the study of Philippine history.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Luciano P.

Tangkulan, Bukidnon 9 Jun 1953. His parents are Francisco Francisquete Dominguez and Emiliana Nojeda Sulapas. He is married to Maria Teresa Cheng. A self-taught artist, he began to draw during his elementary school days and started painting when he was in high school. In college, he was first an architecture student at the University of Mindanao and then a fine arts visual communication student at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman. He briefly joined the Kabataan Makabayan from 1971 to 1972, but only began to immerse in the mass movement in 1980, eventually joining UGATLahi Artist Collective and the Concerned Artists of the Philippines in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His influences include Philippine indigenous folk arts, the arts of post-Impressionist European masters, the arts of the Latin American muralists, the arts of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Cuban and Russian protest arts, Japanese and Aboriginal arts, and American Indian folk art. He also cites various local painters, artists, and cartoonists as major influences: in his younger years, Adlao, a movie sign painter, and Suazo, a graphic artist, both based in Davao in the 1960s; in later years, visual artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3524\"><strong>Neil Doloricon</strong></a>, Nune Alvarado, Fred Liongoren, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3699\"><strong>Leon Pacunayen</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although already based in Quezon City, Dominguez values and draws deeply from his Mandaya lineage for his life and art. His works do not only represent or invoke Mandaya folk imagery but participate in the struggles of indigenous peoples by foregrounding their issues and efforts toward self-determination, recognition and protection of their ancestral lands, and preservation of their culture and environment. Distinct for their vividness of color, intricacy of detail, political themes, and folk-indigenous infusions, Dominguez&rsquo;s works have been categorized as social realist, although the complex and finely detailed juxtapositions of images in his works have also led to their being described as naif surrealist. In their highly nuanced appropriations of indigenous narratives, his works take on a mythopoetic quality, tying together the worldview and history of indigenous peoples with the national and democratic struggles of the mass movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Dominguez&rsquo;s most recognizable works are <b><i>Gatilyo</i> </b>(Trigger), 2013, a digitally enhanced copy of his 1984 painting <b><i>Militarisasyon</i></b> (Militarization), which got lost during an exhibit in the early 1990s. It bears an image of the blood-soaked Philippine flag being wrung by iron hands bearing the seal of the Republic of the Philippines and the emblem of the United States of America, dripping into a red sea of people in revolt. His <b><i>Balilig <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2013, depicts the Mandaya healing ritual, a recurring image in his works throughout his career as a painter. Indeed, many of his paintings depict characters and motifs from indigenous folk mythologies, such as the <i>busaw </i>(blood spirit), <i>limokon </i>(dove), <i>balyan</i> (healer), and the great bird Minokawa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dominguez has held solo exhibits, such as the two-part exhibit <b><i>Wa Ya Kila</i></b>, 1984-85, at the Intercon Hotel Gallery and Manila Peninsula, and <b><i>Dayaw</i></b> (Celebration), 2010, at the NCCA Gallery in Intramuros, Manila. He has also joined group exhibits across a number of museums, galleries, and universities all over Metro Manila&mdash;among them, <b><i>Hardware</i></b>, 2001-2; <b><i>Tutok Perspektiba </i></b>(Focus Perspective), 2006-7; <b><i>Pahina&rsquo;t Kuadro Alay para sa Manggagawa </i></b>(Pages and Frames as Offering to Laborers),<b><i> </i></b>2007; <b><i>Tutok Kargado</i></b> (Focus <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>ded), 2008; <b><i>Kapital </i></b>(Capital),<i> </i>2010; <b><i>Placards</i></b>, 2011; <b><i>Against the Current</i></b>,<i> </i>2013; <b><i>Kasama II</i></b> (Companion II) and <b><i>Pumapapel</i></b> (Acting to Be Noticed), both in 2014; and <b><i>PortrAYAL: Faces for Freedom</i></b>, 2015. He has also exhibited his works internationally, such as in the <b><i>Ethno ExpoTravelling Exhibit</i></b> from 1995 to 1997 in Europe; <b><i>Missie Zendings Kalender </i></b>in the Netherlands, <b><i>With or Without You</i></b> in Australia, and <b><i>Dream for My Planet</i></b> in France, all in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2013, he was awarded the Nippon Foundation Asian Public Intellectual research and art grant, which took him around Thailand and Indonesia to immerse with indigenous peoples&rsquo; groups. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Jashil R.

Lake Sebu, South Cotabato 3 Aug 1924. d. 30 Apr 2015. Textile weaver. Her father was Kambay Kinteg and her mother was Luan Kasing Sengid. Belonging to the Tboli people, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3527\"><strong>Lang Dulay</strong></a> learned to weave <b>tnalak</b> cloth at age 12, when she first &ldquo;dreamed&rdquo; of a tnalak design. As a master weaver, Lang Dulay has been recognized for her role in preserving the traditional designs of the tnalak. Her textiles are valued because of the &ldquo;fine even quality of the yarn, the close interweaving of the warp<b> </b>and weft, the precision in the forms and patterns, the chromatic integrity of the dye, and the consistency of the finish.&rdquo; At the time of her death, eight of her grandchildren had learned to weave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tnalak weaving uses abaca fibers using the tie-dye process. The process begins with stripping the stem of the abaca plant to extract the fibers. The threads are then dried, then manually tied into bands strand per strand. These strands are then set on the &ldquo;bed-tying&rdquo; frame made of bamboo, on which strands are laid out to resist the dye chosen by the weaver. Using natural dyes from plants, the traditional colors of tnalak cloth are red, black, and the natural color of the abaca. Using a backstrap loom, the design of the tnalak emerges through the<b> ikat</b> process where the weft threads are woven through the warp threads, binding the cloth together. As the whole process needs a great deal of attention and concentration, Tboli weavers usually abide by behavioral taboos during this time. Accordingly, they abstain from sex and avoid illness by ceremoniously passing a single abaca thread all over the body before beginning to weave. Lang Dulay never washes the tnalak with soap and avoids using soap when she is dyeing the threads in order to maintain the pureness of the abaca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Tboli, tnalak weaving is traditionally done by women. Called &ldquo;dream weavers,&rdquo; these weavers have explained that they get their inspiration for their designs from their dreams. Lang Dulay has said that the spirit of Fu Dalu would come to her dreams and show her tnalak designs. In her lifetime, she executed over a hundred designs, including the <i>bulinglangit</i> (clouds), the <i>bankiring</i> (hair bangs), and the <i>kabangi</i> (butterfly), aside from designs consisting of stylized crocodiles, butterflies, flowers, mountains, and streams. Each tnalak cloth is uniquely designed. The last tnalak that Lang Dulay wove was acquired by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a>. The cloth featured her spelled name &ldquo;LANG DULAY&rdquo; vertically woven into the lower part of the textile (Espejo 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The value of the tnalak cloth has changed over time. Before the 1960s, the Tboli bartered tnalak for horses and the textile was considered precious enough as dowry in wedding rituals. The introduction of the cash economy has affected the designs of the tnalak as designs are now imposed by buyers. Despite the fact that the modern designs are priced higher and easier to weave, Lang persisted in weaving the traditional designs which are complex and took longer to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lang Dulay was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 1998. The award helped her train 46 weavers from the time of her conferment until her retirement in 2011.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Cecilia S.

Manila 9 Mar 1976. Painter and performance artist. She is the daughter of Marcelino Jacela Dy and Helen Obe&ntilde;a Caba&ntilde;eros. She took up bachelor of arts in interdisciplinary studies at Ateneo de Manila University. She graduated in 1998 and began work toward a master&rsquo;s degree at the College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dy&rsquo;s work as an illustrator and performer taps into the pulse of simple things. Her subjects exist in nature along with the human body, as the artist has taken on hair, plant life, fabric, and water to explore and elevate concepts of depth, symmetry, and repetition. By using charcoal, Dy not only whittles down her medium as she nears completion; she progressively closes the gap between skin and surface, using her bare fingers to achieve gradients and literally drawing herself closer to her work. Dy has distinguished herself not only for her large-scale works on paper but also for pieces done in situ that merge illustration and performance, blurring the boundaries and valuation between process and product. This sensibility is also expressed in Dy&rsquo;s other pursuits, most notably her role as the founder of Polecats, the pole acrobatics dance troupe organized in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1999, Dy had her first solo exhibit titled <b><i>Apples in the Garden of Eden</i></b>, a series of oil paintings shown in Bistro 110, Makati City. This was followed by her participation in <b><i>Secret Diaries</i></b>, 2000, her first group show, at Surrounded by Water, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. A later work, <b><i>Curtains Matching Carpet</i></b>, 2007, is an ephemeral and participatory piece, through which the artist&rsquo;s fascination with hair was translated into a large drawing of strands on the walls of the Silverlens Galleries in Makati. In 2008, she took part in <b><i>Beyond Frame: Philippine Photomedia</i></b>,<i> </i>curated by Gina Fairley at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia, where Dy once again combined illustration with performance in <b><i>Running with Scissors</i></b>, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in Sydney that an obsession with seascapes and flora began to take hold of Dy as she created <b><i>Soaplands</i></b>, 2009, shown at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP).<i> </i>The theme also propelled Dy to do <b><i>Between the Sea and Sky</i></b>, 2009, at Silverlens Galleries. The large-scale charcoal drawing of the Sydney Harbour that Dy rendered in <b><i>Between Sea and Sky </i></b>was then scaled up to 3.6 meters by 18 meters, and was created over the span of three weeks for the 2010 Busan Biennale in Busan, South Korea. Dy collaborated with photographers Juan Caguicla and Corinne de San Jose, illustrating over and around their photographs in <b><i>To Cut a Long Story</i></b>, 2006, at the Lumiere Gallery in Makati and <b><i>A Very Short Flowering Season</i></b>, 2011, at the Silverlens Galleries. She is also credited as a production designer, contributing work to full-length independent films such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\"><strong>Auraeus Solito</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1257\"><strong>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a>os</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Blossoming of Maximo Olivares</i></b>), 2005, and Quark Henares&rsquo;s <b><i>Rakenrol </i></b>(Rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; Roll), 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dy was shortlisted twice for the Ateneo Art Awards: for <b><i>Curtains Matching Carpet</i></b> in 2008 and <b><i>Soaplands </i></b>in 2009.

Dagupan, Pangasinan 23 Dec 1895. d. 7 Mar 1985. National Artist for visual arts. He was the son of Hilario Edades and Cecilia Edades. He married Jean Garrott, an American who also later taught English and drama at the University of the Philippines. Their daughter Joan is also a painter. Edades received his early education in town schools. In 1919, he left for the United States where he studied architecture and fine arts at the University of Wisconsin in Seattle during the school year and worked in the salmon canneries of Alaska during summer. In 1922, the traveling exhibit of the Armory show opened his eyes and that of the American public to the artistic ferment in Europe led by Cezanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso, Duchamp, the surrealists, and the Dadaists. While the exhibition drew outcry from the conservative public, it gave Edades the direction he was looking for. Deviating from the academic style, but retaining much of its qualities such as its somber palette, he did two key paintings in 1928: <b><i>TheSketch</i></b> (sometimes called <b><i>The Artist and His Model</i></b>) and <b><i>TheBuilders</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Edades returned to the Philippines in 1928, he embarked on a crusade to change the course of Philippine art, which was then dominated by painter FernandoAmorsolo and sculptor GuillermoTolentino. Barely a month after his return, Edades had a one-person show in December at the Philippine Columbian Club. It was met with shock and disdain by a public accustomed to Amorsolo&rsquo;s rural idylls. Edades decided to shift strategy: it was through teaching that he would conduct his campaign. In 1930, Edades helped organize the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Department of Architecture, where he also served as its acting head. The inception of the Department of Architecture subsequently led to the fine arts program. And in 1935, he was appointed director of the university&rsquo;s College of Architecture and Fine Arts, putting UST at the forefront of modern art. Among Edades&rsquo;s students in UST were National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\"><strong>Ang Kiukok</strong></a>, Jerry Elizalde Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\"><strong>Antonio Austria</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3432\"><strong>Manuel Baldemor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3442\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>Norma Belleza</strong></a></strong></a>, Charito Bitanga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\"><strong>Danilo Dalena</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\"><strong>Angelito Antonio</strong></a>, Jaime de Guzman, Veronica Lim, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\"><strong>Ramon Orlina</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3699\"><strong>Leon Pacunayen</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3523\"><strong>Edgar Doctor</strong></a>, and Rhoda Recto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The year 1934 provided him with a new opportunity to reach the public through art when he was commissioned by the architect JuanNakpil to do a mural titled <b><i>Rising Philippines</i></b> for the lobby of the Capitol Theater on Escolta St. For his assistant, Edades chose CarlosV.Francisco aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a> Francisco, the illustrator for the <b><i>Philippine Herald</i></b>, who in turn brought GaloB.Ocampo. Together, they formed the first triumvirate in modern Philippine art. Their first collaboration was followed by other murals for the State Theater, and for the private residences of Vicente and Ernesto Rufino, owners of Capitol and State, and Juan Nakpil, through whom these murals were commissioned. They also did the mural for the ceiling of the house of President Manuel Quezon in Pasay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, the famous press battle between the modernists and conservatives erupted. In an interview with A. B. Saulo for an article in the <b><i>Monday Mail</i></b>, Edades fired the first shot by bewailing the conservative orientation of art and its insistence on the bright aspects of life while excluding the dark side of reality as a valid artistic subject. In addition to Edades, those who spoke for the modernists included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\"><strong>Salvador P. Lopez</strong></a></strong></a> and JoseGarciaVilla; the conservatives had Ariston Estrada, IgnacioManlapaz, and Fermin Sanchez on their side. The debate was interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1948, this time with Edades and Tolentino on opposite poles, debating the merits and demerits of modern art on the pages of <b><i>The Sunday Times Magazine</i></b> and later <b><i>This</i></b> <b><i>Week </i></b>magazine of the <b><i>Manila Chronicle </i></b>broadsheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1937, Edades, Ocampo, and DiosdadoLorenzo organized the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3420\"><strong>Atelier of Modern Art</strong></a>, which led to the public foregrounding of a group of artists Edades perceived as emergent modernists and whom he christened the Thirteen Moderns. This gesture boosted the cause of modernism with new talents. The support system for modernism was further strengthened with the founding of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> in 1948 and the PhilippineArtGallery in 1951. The struggle between modernists and conservatives came to a head in the AAP annual exhibition in 1955, which was marked by the walkout of conservatives who charged that the modernists had unfairly won.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modernism opened the way to new artistic idioms, as well as enlarged the subject of art to span the entire range of human experience. Edades not only introduced modernism to the Philippines but also gave it his guidance and related it to the issue of national identity. He envisioned an art in which the artist was to pursue his original vision, while discovering his identity as Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His iconic works <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2298\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2298\"><strong>The Sketch</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> or <b><i>The Artist and His Model</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2156\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2156\"><strong>The Builders</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, both dated 1928, are examples of the distinct visual language of Philippine modernism. <b><i>The Sketch</i></b> presents the viewer with a painter and his work in progress, while another person oversees his work. It might seem to the viewer that the painter is working on a portrait of the woman, but upon close inspection on his sketchbook, it seems that he is rather working on a still life of fruits arranged on a table in front of them. For a rather ordinary and self-absorbed scene, <b><i>The Sketch</i></b> gives both viewers and students of art history plenty of questions with regard to form and content, and in this respect the work is sometimes treated as an allegory on painting, or of the painter&rsquo;s process and philosophy on art. In <b><i>The Builders</i></b>, the canvas is filled with laborers, bodies contorted and twisted to emphasize work and movement. The warm, deep colors of this work also enhances a sense of difficulty and struggle, and the clamor of a busy construction site&mdash;one can feel the heat and strain upon the laborers, and the frenzy of work furthered by two figures trying to lift a heavy steel object. In various respects, <b><i>The Builders</i></b> represents the massive structural, economic, and cultural growth that was occurring in Philippine cities during the early part of the 20th century at the expense of the working class, until this growth was interrupted and ultimately stunted by the repercussions of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among other works of Edades in the pre-World War II period are <b><i>Mother and Daughter</i></b>, <b><i>Japanese Girl</i></b>, and <b><i>The Wrestlers</i></b>, all in 1927;<b><i> Dr. Frederick Staarr</i></b>, <b><i>My Sweetheart</i></b>, <b><i>The Artist and the Model</i></b>, <b><i>The Picnic</i></b>, and <b><i>The Market</i></b>, all in 1928; and <b><i>Woman with Idol</i></b>, undated. After the war, he did <b><i>Joan</i></b>, 1949; <b><i>Modern Maria</i></b> <b><i>Clara</i></b>, 1955; <b><i>Two Young People</i></b>, 1964; <b><i>Esther</i></b>, 1965; <b><i>Stella</i></b>, 1966; <b><i>Preparing for the Picnic</i></b>, 1968; <b><i>Susan</i></b>, 1971; <b><i>Poinsettia Girl</i></b>, <b><i>Nude</i></b>, <b><i>Bringing in the Catch</i></b>, and <b><i>Demoiselles de Davao</i></b>, all in 1976; and <b><i>Purita</i></b>, 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Edades received the Pro Patria Award during the Rizal Centennial Celebration in 1961 and the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila in 1964. He was proclaimed National Artist for visual arts in 1976. The retrospective exhibit <b><i>Edades: From Freedom to Fruition</i></b> was held in 2011-12 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>, with the publication of the book of the same title. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Nueva Ecija 1945. Painter, printmaker, and theorist. He took up his art studies at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. In 1967, he formulated the concepts of dissectionism, communalism, and compartmentalism. In 1975, his book <b><i>The Aesthetic of Dissectionism</i></b> was published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1984 to 1985, he launched three exhibits side-by-side, each one expressing his aesthetic views on the concepts of dissectional art, communal art, and compartmental art. In 1985, his exhibition catalog <b><i>Dissectionism in the Nuclear Age</i></b> was listed in the <b><i>Art in America 85-86 Annual Guide to Galleries, Museums, Artists</i></b>. In 1989, Embuscado exhibited his works at Smokey Mountain, a landfill in Tondo, Manila. In 1992, Embuscado taught &ldquo;communal art&rdquo; in response to the garbage-dependent life of Smokey Mountain communities. He was particularly focused on teaching children. Embuscado&rsquo;s work infuriated state authorities as he associated the poor&rsquo;s decrepit existence with the garbage-like quality of Filipino life. He protested, exposed, and exhibited this inhumanity, both in his writing and art. This politically charged exhibition in the summer of 1992 was censored both by the government and the National Museum. In 2000, Embuscado published <b><i>Compartmental Art</i></b> wherein he characterized his &ldquo;declarations&rdquo; as communal human intercourse, and a dissectional beginning working toward unity amidst ethnic (cultural and artistic) diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Embuscado&rsquo;s works express his view of existence as a spiritual, rather than a material and physical, undertaking. The figures in his works, as with the face of Jesus in <b><i>The True Christ</i></b>, take on abstracted and fragmented forms. Each line and dot, expressed as jabs of ink or color, appear to stand on their own and yet share a connection or an affinity to others, as these are assembled on the canvas in order to form a coherent, albeit unnatural image. His style is elucidated further in many of his essays. In <b><i>The Two Christs</i></b>, Embuscado relates his dreams in which Christ appears. He writes: &ldquo;the false Christ is dying but the True Christ is not.&rdquo; He relates too of an &ldquo;existence separate from nature,&rdquo; and that the True Christ as a &ldquo;dissectional man&rdquo; is not a historical figure for &ldquo;the history of the world belongs to the speculative matters &hellip; a composition of organic form.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Movement-D</i></b>, an ink work in the possession of the Ateneo Art Gallery, is composed of layers of geometrical lines and shapes, forming a complex and dynamic image. In <b><i>Dissectionism in the Nuclear Age</i></b>, he speaks of a &ldquo;common center&rdquo; that is dissected, fragmented and one that blurs the boundaries rather than clarifies distinct planes of existence showing the essence of things. Despite being highly theoretical, Embuscado manages to relate his worldview and philosophical pronouncements to the context of his time. Eschewing the existence of art for art&rsquo;s sake, which he says draws upon a dead context, he attempts instead to speak to current conditions of political instability and poverty in relation to material conditions, as well as spiritual and intellectual concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Embuscado officially represented the Philippines at the India Triennial in 1968 at Delhi, India; Sao Paulo Biennial with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>, 1969; and the first Biennial of Contemporary Painting in Italy, 1969.

Manila 21 Apr 1970. Painter. He is the son of Jose Escora and Leticia Hipolito and the brother of artist Fernan Escora. He is mostly self-taught but was able to take units in studio arts at the College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A mixture of surrealism, hyperrealism, and graphic design characterizes Escora&rsquo;s body of work. His earlier pieces were surrealist in orientation as these displayed a preference for portraying human figures with exaggerated anatomical features. Works in his solo exhibit <b><i>Caf&eacute; Ennui</i></b>, 2001, however, were more clearly about playing up the human body and its fleshiness. The oil paintings <b><i>Piece of Meat as Woman</i></b> and <b><i>Piece of Meat as Man</i></b> are made up of headless and armless bodies set upon a table ready for consuming. This show contrasts with another solo exhibit <b><i>Synthetic Solitude</i></b>, wherein Escora&rsquo;s flat-looking, cartoonish, graphic design-inspired portrait paintings are much less fleshy but still amiable as human beings. Armed with the skills needed for hyperrealist rendering, Escora later became known for work that combined gritty imagery and pop art influences. An occasional club disc jockey, Escora is not only familiar with the members of this subculture made up of habitu&eacute;s of the night who have appeared as subjects of his portraits&mdash;he is also one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Escora held his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Paintings</i></b>, 1996, at the Penguin Caf&eacute; Gallery. This was followed by <b><i>Drawings</i></b>, 1999, at The Drawing Room. He has also had solo exhibitions in Boston Gallery, Big+Small Art Co., Pinto Art Gallery, SM Megamall Art Center, Kish, and Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise de Manille. Escora has also had solo shows in Utterly Art Exhibition Space and Taksu, Singapore, and at Ark Gallerie, Indonesia. In 2009, he undertook <b><i>Mapping Asia</i></b>, a solo exhibition which was a special project of the China International Gallery Exposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Escora has been part of local group exhibitions in the UP Vargas Museum, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), GSIS Museo ng Sining, Ayala Museum, Ateneo Art Gallery, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a>, Boston Gallery, and The Drawing Room.

Painter, teacher. He was the son of Manuel Espiritu, an acclaimed painter in the 19th century, and Anselma Pindon. When his parents died, Espiritu was raised by his uncle Anselmo, also an acclaimed painter and sculptor. He graduated from the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts in 1928 as a self-supporting student. His paintings graced the covers of <b><i>Graphic</i></b> and <b><i>PhilippineMagazine</i></b> in the 1930s. He taught art at the Instituto de Mujeres, and he founded the Academy of Fine Arts in his house in Sampaloc in 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Espiritu is a painter of original subjects in the conservative tradition. Since technique and style are limited by the rules of academic painting, Espiritu sought to widen realistic expression by introducing new subjects. In 1940, he painted <b><i>Old Woman Pounding Buyo</i></b>. Although the theme was common, Espiritu innovated the rendering of the subject by painting a full figure seated in a room with a bamboo floor flooded with light. Espiritu also painted <b><i>Madonna of the Lanzones</i></b>, which showed the Virgin and the child holding a cluster of lanzones. He also did Christmas genre scenes which show a country road strategically lit by Christmas lanterns. Espiritu&rsquo;s widening of realistic expression is a testament to artists being able to work within certain restraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Espiritu won first prize at the 1938 Bureau of Education-sponsored art exhibition for his <b><i>Portrait of Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</i></b>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Visual artist. His parents are Alfredo Z. Esquillo Sr and Estrellita Dorado. Esquillo graduated in 1993 with a fine arts degree in painting from the University of Santo Tomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Esquillo&rsquo;s art involves astute observations of Philippine culture and history, engaging themes of identity, veneration, survival, and the persistent performativity of the self, often realized through the ethos of salvation which Esquillo articulates as transformation. He gathers material from folklore, cult rituals, and historic archives, as he explores these themes in richly composed, meticulously rendered paintings, and ingeniously staged mixed media works which include assemblages, installations, videos, and performances. His works show the strong influence of both social realist painters and magic realists. Esquillo composes complex scenes of individuals or throngs of people in ritual settings: be it a crowded procession, an imagined assumption, or an apocalyptic scene. His paintings explore a multilayered geography of existence and faith. From Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, to domestic spaces, to visions of destruction and deliverance, Esquillo traverses both inner and outer landscapes: that which he calls <i>loob</i> (inner self), <i>labas</i> (the larger world or beyond self), and <i>lalim </i>(depth). Similar to his manifold interest in spirituality, existence, and being, he takes his brush to unconventional grounds&mdash;painting on rubber sheets (ethyl-acetate vinyl), canvas strips woven into ground resembling mats, and pineapple fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>kinley</i></b>, Esquillo&rsquo;s contribution to the exhibition <b><i>The American Effect: Global Perspectives on the United States 1990-2003</i></b> at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2003, is a provocative work depicting a grim figure clad in Victorian attire cradling an infant. Cloaked in dark velvet cloth are eagle claws, the barrel of a gun, and a foreboding grimace, all hidden from the unwitting infant in the adult&rsquo;s lap. This is the artist&rsquo;s commentary on Philippine relations with the United States: from the deceptions of benevolent assimilation to strains of neocolonialism operating well beyond the Philippine declaration of national independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These reflections on Philippine history spill over to the artist&rsquo;s observations of contemporary faith practices, which in several senses are hybrid and multifarious as seen in his joint exhibitions with artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3577\"><strong>Renato Habulan</strong></a>: <b><i>Semblance / Presence</i></b>, 2012, National University of Singapore Museum, and <b><i>Loob</i></b>, 2014, Jorge B. Vargas Museum, University of the Philippines Diliman, 2014. The works in these exhibitions focus on the leader of a local cult, Lauro, who believed himself an incarnation of Christ. Both Esquillo and Habulan chronicled Lauro&rsquo;s life through photographs and videos, immersing themselves in the context of faith amid the din and clamor of city life. Esquillo specifically essays a piercing scrutiny of belief, through paintings, sculptures, and video. He depicts Lauro as a reincarnation of Christ reinterpreted in searing realism with respect to different aspects of salvation. In the context of Esquillo&rsquo;s visual grammar, each and every form conveys a crucial balance between belief and skepticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Esquillo won the grand prizes for the Metrobank Painting Competition, 1993, and the Philip Morris ASEAN Art Awards, 1995.

Agno, Pangasinan 4 Feb 1894. d. ca 1950. Painter, sculptor, teacher. Fabie received certificates in painting and sculpture in 1917. Throughout his stay in the University of the Philippines (UP), he received six medals and a number of honorable mentions in various classes. He was the only sculptor who avidly supported VictorioEdades&rsquo;s campaign for modern art. He enrolled again at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Architecture and Fine Arts when Edades organized these courses in that school. Fabie, therefore, obtained another degree of fine arts in UST. Fabie was immediately recruited to the UST faculty, serving as a professor till his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fabie was active in both painting and sculpture. His paintings are executed in the academic tradition, solidly defined by strong but finely modulated lighting as in the work <b><i>Man with a Newspaper</i></b>, 1925, found at the UP Vargas Museum collection. Under the influence of Edades, he seems to have had adopted thick impasto. His paintings are also found at the Central Bank collection, the UST Museum Gallery, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fabie&rsquo;s sculptures stand out for their daring stylization. Forsaking the classicism espoused by GuillermoTolentino, his sculptures were characterized by bold contours, stylized poses, and modernistic cold polish. In line with the modernistic movement spearheaded by Edades and the architect JuanNakpil, Fabie&rsquo;s style is thus linked to the shift to art deco as it complemented the murals of the Edades Atelier and Nakpil&rsquo;s theater lobbies. Only one of Fabie&rsquo;s sculptures seems to be extant today&mdash;namely, the <b><i>Lady with Mandolin</i></b>, 1940, at the National Museum. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Manila 18 Feb 1940. Painter, stage designer, art educator, curator. She is the daughter of Valeriano F. Fajardo and LibertadVillanueva, a folk dance scholar. Her sister, MaryJoan, is a dancer and choreographer. She holds a degree in agriculture from the University of the Philippines (UP) in Los Ba&ntilde;os, 1959, a master&rsquo;s degree in art education from the University of Wisconsin, USA, 1967, and a doctoral degree in Philippine studies from UP Diliman in 1997. She has taught abroad, at the Wisconsin public schools of Madison and Stevens Point; and locally at Ateneo de Manila University and the College of the Holy Spirit. In 1976, she became a faculty member of the UP Department of Humanities (renamed Department of Art Studies in 1989), where she served as chairperson from 1985 to 1991. She also served as curator of the UP Jorge B. Vargas Museum from 1995 to 2001. Upon her retirement in 2005, UP honored her with the title Professor Emeritus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She studied printmaking under Manuel Rodriguez Sr, which led to a body of artworks in the graphic arts embodying personal introspection on the themes of self-liberation. She is known for her Baraha ng Buhay Pilipino<b><i> </i></b>(Playing Cards of Filipino Life) aka Tarot Card series in the late 1980s, which appropriated the images of the babaylan<i> </i>(shaman), <i>gaga </i>(fool), <i>salamangkero</i> (magician), among others, to provide commentary on various thematic tableaux of her paintings. Art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a> described Fajardo as the &ldquo;High Priestess of Tarot,&rdquo; explaining that the tarot as a device allowed the artist to &ldquo;not only deal with the personal vicissitudes of an individual but also touches on the large movements of a country&rsquo;s collective experience&rdquo; (Guillermo 2001, 93). Fajardo found inspiration from Philippine history and myths, interpreting the colonial past in the light of contemporary issues of migration, human rights, political corruption, and women&rsquo;s rights. Her series on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a><b><i> </i></b>in the mid-1990s featured the epic myths of Panay, exploring issues of history, ecology, women, and power.<i> </i>She also utilizes diaries or letters as handwritten narratives to frame the discourse of <i>bayani</i> or heroes/heroines in Philippine history, inscribed in the border of her paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fajardo had her first solo exhibition of paintings in 1974 at the Kalinangan ng Lahi Gallery in Quezon City.

He studied fine arts history in the University of the Philippines (UP) and in Philippine Women&rsquo;s University and then became a fellow at the Virginia Center for Creative Art in Virginia, USA, 1988. Feleo was the chief designer of Comite de Festejos, an art and design workshop, and visiting teacher-artist at the Philippine High School for the Arts in Mount Makiling, Laguna, until 2007.

His works reflect an imagination, which is simple, naive, playful, wise, and elemental. In his art, he consciously uses ethnic images like the anitos<i> </i>and <i>pintados</i> (literally, &ldquo;painted&rdquo; or tattooed natives), folk icons like San Miguel, the crucified Christ and the Virgin Mary, and popular images like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/135\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has held several one-person exhibits&mdash;among them, <b><i>Sapin-Sapin</i></b> <b><i>ni Feleo</i></b> (Feleo&rsquo;s Layer upon Layer), Hiraya Gallery, 1985; <b><i>Sapin-Sapin sa Kahoy at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>in</i> </b>(Layer upon Layer on Wood and Glass), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), 1987, and Fukuoka Art Museum, Japan, 1988; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3541\"><strong>Roberto Feleo</strong></a></i></b>, Centro Provincial de Artes Plasticas y Disefto, Havana, Cuba, 1989.

His first one-person show of sculptures and paintings was at the Asian Institute of Tourism, Quezon City, in 1983; his subsequent shows were at the Art for Architecture Gallery at Tradewinds in 1989, and at the Ayala Museum in 1990. He served as director of the Coordinating Center for Visual Arts of the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines, 1989-90. As a practicing architect, he was an executive trustee of the Center for Philippine Architecture under the United Architects of the Philippines.

With these works, he began his Formal and Spatial Pattern series in painting, sculpture, and architecture through which he worked on various theories, principles, and methods involved in the organization of forms and spaces. In an open setting, Fernandez&rsquo;s sculpture assumes the character of lines in oriental calligraphy interacting with the surrounding space. Also in regard of the figure-space theme is a series made of bands and wire mesh which are curved, twisted, or folded in order to bring out the values of plasticity and flexibility. Space interpenetrates into the figure and around it in these pieces. In later works, the metal planes are cut into basic figurative shapes, painted in various hues, and lightly treated with acid for textural interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UP College of Architecture launched in 2006 the Honrado R.

Santa Ursula, Betis, Pampanga 24 Jun 1900. d. 9 Sep 1992. Sculptor and furniture maker. Juan&rsquo;s father was a fisherman and as a young man, he assisted his father in this regard. He was, however, more attracted to the carving of the saints and paintings in the BetisChurch and engaged in honing his skills on his own. At age 16, he jumped aboard a passing barge going to Manila. In Manila, he apprenticed with MaximoVicente in the latter&rsquo;s atelier on R. Hidalgo, Quiapo. Juan received nothing for the next few years but food and shelter in exchange for his labor. But he learned the crafts of carpentry and wood carving, furniture making, and sculpture, especially the making of <b>santos</b><i> </i>(carved religious figures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After four years, he became the shop&rsquo;s foreman. Flores was so talented that his reputation grew among the other workshop owners. By 1918, he was working closely with established names like IsabeloTampinco and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3681\"><strong>Graciano Nepomuceno</strong></a>. After six years in Manila, feeling he had enough training to be on his own, he went back to Pampanga. The commissions from Manila kept coming. He once made a bust of Pres Manuel Quezon and this led to other commissions, notably that of Gregorio Araneta, then secretary of justice and finance. It was through Araneta that Flores met Gregorio&rsquo;s son, Luis, who put the sculptor&rsquo;s expertise in woodcraft and firsthand knowledge of santos to some other use. In the late 1950s, Flores accompanied Luis all over the country in search of good santos and antiques for the latter&rsquo;s collection. Wherever they went, Juan picked up apprentices: in Bicol, Marinduque, Leyte, Cebu, Surigao. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>Furniture</strong></a> makers in many parts of the country acknowledge a great debt of knowledge toFlores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Flores&rsquo;s art abided by the classical tradition, inspired by pictures of masterpieces of Western art.

She holds a bachelor of fine arts in painting obtained in 1987 from the University of the Philippine College of Fine Arts, and graduate units in master of arts in the fine arts and design at Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before her graduation, her first full-time job until 1989 was as a writer for Radio-Television Malaca&ntilde;ang under the helm of television director Maria V.

Flores is also an educator, teaching multimedia and art students at De La Salle College of Saint Benilde, PWU, Asia-Pacific College, and Philippine High School for the Arts. Serving in various capacities as juror, discussant, and organizer in various projects and art events, Flores is also contributing writer, editor, and author whose works have been published here and abroad.

In her critique of heart and home, Flores combines the sublime, the absurd, and the carnivalesque as endeavors to create new icons about women. This strategy is apparent in such works as <b><i>Kasal </i></b>(Marriage), 1994; <b><i>Uyayi kay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4587\"><strong>Paraluman</strong></a> </i></b>(Lullabye for Paraluman), 1999; <b><i>A Line of History</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2006; and her contribution to <b><i>Baraha ng Buhay </i></b>(Tarot Cards of Life), 2008, a mural project directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a>, installed at the PETA building in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Flores&rsquo;s artworks are inseparable from her work as organizer, advocate, curator, and educator. Since 2005, she has served as project director of TutoK, an initiative of visual artists for advocacy projects on issues such as human rights and freedom of expression. She is also co-founder of Salingpusa, 1985-92, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3761\"><strong>Sanggawa</strong></a>, 1994-98, collaborative groups that participated in major exhibitions here and abroad, and eventually left a number of significant works in museums in Japan, Singapore, and Australia.

San Fernando de Dilao (now Paco), Manila 28 Oct 1839. d. 12 Mar 1904. Painter, decorator. Flores descended from a family of artisans originally from Balayan, Batangas. His uncle Pio de la Rosa taught Simon the rudiments of the arts when he was in his teens. Later, he enrolled at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, studying under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\"><strong>Lorenzo Guerrero</strong></a> and LorenzoRocha.

During this time, he might already have made the acquaintance of Msgr Ignacio Tambungui who introduced him to the wealthy families of several towns of Pampanga for whom he executed many portraits and religious paintings.

All these are known for the fine miniaturistic detailing of the embroideries of the pi&ntilde;a dresses of the sitters, their elaborate jewelry, as well as the appurtenances in their homes. Among Simon&rsquo;s religious paintings are <b><i>El Bautismo de Cristo </i></b>(The Baptism of Christ), <b><i>SanRoque</i></b>, <b><i>Parabola de la Mujer Arrepentida</i></b> (Parable of the Repentant Woman), <b><i>LaInmaculadaConcepcion </i></b>(The Immaculate Conception), and two versions of <b><i>La Virgen Maria</i></b> (The Virgin Mary), inspired by a painting of Carlo Dolci.

In 1892, he won the highest honors for <b><i>Despues de la Ultima Cena</i></b> (After the Last Supper) and <b><i>El Prendimiento </i></b>(The Arrest) in the art contest to commemorate the tercentenary of San Juan de la Cruz. In 1895, he won a silver medal for <b><i>La Expulsion</i></b> (The Expulsion), his entry in the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition).

His painting <b><i>Kaingin</i></b> (Swidden), 1945, which heralded modernism in its strong sense of design and rhythm, won for him the grand prize in the historic first national art exhibition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> held at the National Museum in 1948. Francisco, along with Edades and Ocampo, were commissioned to do a number of murals for theater lobbies and private residences such as that of the architect Juan Nakpil. These murals featured stylized figures in flowing curvilinear lines: nymphs dancing or playing the flute, often against a background of tropical vegetation. Through these works, the artists contributed toward developing Filipino imagery, drawing inspiration from the customs and traditions of the people, as well as from the familiar environment. In the quest for a Filipino modernist idiom, Francisco, who chose to be based in his fishing village of Angono, observed Philippine folk aesthetics and researched Philippine history, customs, and traditions. He arrived at an idiom which was both Filipino and Asian in the fresh colors of the folk, the flowing curvilinear lines in rhythm creating decorative patterns, and the particular disposition of space that satisfies the Filipino penchant for covering the entire field. Filipino, too, was his sense of the communal life: the crowds of people in interaction as they engage in trade, enjoying themselves in fiestas or uniting in common struggle. His images of women were drawn from mythology such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/164\"><strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></a>, from history and legend such as Princesa Urduja, from customs of the past such as the maiden carried on a hammock across the mountains of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a></strong></a>, and from contemporary folk such as the woman preparing fish for sinigang. Fisherfolk were among his favorite subjects since he lived in a fishing village. He showed his closeness to the folk in paintings like <b><i>Camote-Eaters</i></b>, his last and unfinished work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Francisco&rsquo;s first important mural was done for the 1953 International Fair held in Manila. On the theme of <b><i>Five Hundred Years of Philippine History</i></b>, its scope covered the legendary origin of the Filipino with the first man and woman Malakas at Maganda springing from the primal bamboo, up to the administration of then incumbent president Elpidio Quirino. The mural was finely executed in wood by the Paete wood-carvers. Foreign visitors to the fair were impressed by Francisco&rsquo;s mural, which received full coverage in <b><i>Newsweek</i></b>, but local appreciation was apparently lukewarm since it was promptly dismantled and carelessly disposed of after the fair. Francisco&rsquo;s major masterpiece is the mural for the Bulwagang Katipunan of the Manila City Hall, commissioned by Manila mayor Antonio Villegas during his administration. <b><i>Filipino Struggles through History</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1964,<b><i> </i></b>chronicles the history of Manila from the first great rajahs of Tondo, the Spanish colonial period, Balagtas, Rizal, and the Revolution of 1896, the American colonial period, the Commonwealth, up to the Japanese occupation. It is the veritable history of the entire nation itself. In this work, Francisco often integrated several historical episodes, in smaller scale, under one period. The episode groups, however, are not static but flow into each other by means of various linking devices such as a winding river, flames branching out, or clouds coiling in spirals. The murals are marked by artistic vigor and inexhaustible inventiveness, a lively characterization of the numerous historical personages, unifying all through an admirable sense of design. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>&rsquo;s figure makes a visual impact as he is shown forging onward, leading the Katipunero with their long bamboo spears, rifles, and bolos. Among the many dynamic scenes is the encounter between Limahong and the Spanish soldiers in the thrust and counterthrust of weapons. A smaller mural is the <b><i>Pageant of Commerce</i></b> in four sections: two sides on the history of Philippine trade, from commercial relations with China and Arabia to the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade; a section on the development of modern industry in factories, travel, and communication; and the central one of a Filipino couple in native costume, the woman slipping a coin into a bamboo <i>alkansiya</i> (coin bank), with the spirit of commerce hovering above. He also did the murals <b><i>Life and Miracles of Saint Dominic</i></b> for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a>, 1954, and the <b><i>Stations of the Cross</i></b> for Far Eastern University, 1956. He worked with Victoria Edades and Galo B. Ocampo on the mural <b><i>Rising Philippines</i></b> for the Capitol Theater and murals for the Golden Gate Exposition, the State Theater, and the houses of Pres Manuel Quezon, Ernesto Rufino, and Vicente Rufino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1944, Francisco won three major prizes at the Botica Boie-sponsored Kapisanan ng Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas or Kalibapi painting contest: first prize for <b><i>Angelus</i></b>; second prize for <b><i>Frugal Meal at the Farm</i></b>; and third prize for <b><i>Angono Fiesta</i></b>. His <b><i>Kaingin</i></b> won first prize in the 1948 painting competition of the Art Association of the Philippines. He was awarded Most Outstanding Alumnus by the UP School of Fine Arts in 1959. He received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila, and the Republic Cultural Heritage Awards, both in 1964. He was proclaimed National Artist for visual arts in 1973. In 1989, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> held an exhibit of his works titled <b><i>Botong: Alay at Alaala</i></b> (Botong: Offering and Remembrance). In celebration of his birth centenary, an exhibition of over 40 works titled <b><i>Botong Francisco: A Nation Imagined</i></b> opened in 2012 at the Ayala Museum.

Quiapo, Manila 18 Jun 1865. d. 28 Mar 1936. Sculptor. He was the son of Angel Francisco and Leonor Dionisio. Francisco apprenticed under the sculptor SoteroGarcia at age 14. He also took up private lessons in painting under LorenzoRocha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Francisco gained public recognition for the first time when he won first prize for his entry in the competition commemorating the tercentenary of Santa Teresa de Avila. In 1884, he established a shop on Dulumbayan (presently Rizal Ave) where he made images of saints. In 1885, he was appointed Escultor de la Comandancia General de Marina (Sculptor of General Marine Command). On 1 Apr 1887, Francisco sailed for Spain to participate at the Exposicion General de Filipinas (Philippine General Exposition) in Madrid. There, he obtained a scholarship for four years at the Escuela Central de Artes y Oficios. Sailing back to Manila in 1891, he arrived in time to participate in the competition held to commemorate the tercentenary of San Juan de la Cruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American colonial period, Francisco was one of the founding faculty of the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. Together with his students, he executed the sculptures gracing the entrances of the different colleges at the old UP campus in Padre Faura. Today, only two sculptures of Francisco seem to be in existence&mdash;namely, the bust of Do&ntilde;a Filomena Ortiz and the nymph adorning the fountain at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a>ida Vargas Residence in Tagaytay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from winning first prize in the Santa Teresa de Avila art competition, Francisco also won for his works in clay and marble a bronze medal and a diploma at the Exposicion Universal de Barcelona (Barcelona Universal Exposition) in 1889. He also received an honorable mention at the Madrid Exposition of 1891. This was the same year he received first prize for his maquette of <b><i>El</i></b> <b><i>Genio Coronado por las Bellas Artes</i></b> (Genius Crowned by the Fine Arts), an allegorical piece. For the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas<b><i> </i></b>(Philippine Regional Exposition) in 1895, Francisco entered <b><i>Ultimos momentos de los Numantinos</i></b> (Last Hours of the Citizens of Numancia), a study in plaster and a mortuary bas-relief on marble.

His style involves a heightened sensitivity to tone, as well as to the reflections and shadows of bodies and objects, as seen in his paintings of children playing in the water. Here the bodies of the children are carefully modeled in light and dark, and the water sparkles with tiny points of light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gajo sometimes paints solitary figures seated as though in contemplation in a rice field. In these works, he brings out the gritty textures of the earth and the spiky rhythms of the rice stalks growing densely together. The natural light source is clearly defined, and the shadow cast by the single figure further enhances its solitariness&mdash;an uncommon condition in the countryside where a strong collective spirit marks seasonal activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gajo&rsquo;s first individual show, <b><i>The Farm</i></b>, was at the Hidalgo Gallery in 1971, followed by <b><i>Pasakay</i></b> at Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>.

Galang studied fine arts at the University of the Philippines from 1962 to 1966, the first two years of his education made possible through the M. M. Castro Scholarship. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galang&rsquo;s work could be taken as typical of early Philippine modernist practice, given his broad experimentation with material and visual grammar. Ironically, this experimentation was critically received either as wholly committed to social commentary or purely self-indulgent. His early work was alternately associated with Art Brut and Arte Povera as was the case of his peers RobertoChabet, LeeAguinaldo, and RayAlbano, all of whom were involved in exploring processes and materials outside the usual norms of artistic practice at the time. Galang&rsquo;s piece for the Paris Biennale consisted of three long wooden bars laid out on the floor. Another famous work consisted of a plain white canvas collaged with discarded shoes, among other objects, encrusted at the bottom of the frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galang&rsquo;s later body of work demonstrates a leaning toward abstraction and minimalism bordering on the conceptual. He continuously questioned the concept of painting and sculpture and this questioning would shift his process of work from producing surfaces and objects that were blotched, stained, punctured, roughened up with sand, to creating the slick geometric abstract paintings in his final years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under the auspices of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>, Galang figured in at least three exhibitions with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\"><strong>Virgilio Aviado</strong></a> and Benedicto Cabrera within two decades beginning 1965.

Galang had his first solo exhibition at the Gallery Indigo in 1967.

Carcar, Cebu 4 Feb 1945. Painter. Brought up by his mother, Josefa Emnace Galicano, Romulo grew up as the personal student of his uncle, the Cebuano maestro MartinoAbellana. At age 13, he became part of his uncle&rsquo;s household. The close relationship of maestro and apprentice made Galicano the direct and immediate heir to Abellana&rsquo;s artistic heritage. His mastery of color and tone, figure drawing, composition, techniques, and materials came from lessons he learned from his early youth. His first drawing is dated 1959. In 1963, he showed evidence of precocity in portraiture, with JuanLuna as one of his early influences. In 1967, Galicano came to Manila to take up fine arts at the University of the East. Even if Galicano already had a solid training in figure drawing, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\"><strong>Florencio Concepcion</strong></a> taught him abstract design. For a year, in 1968, he painted expressionist works, still lifes with spare elements; from 1969 to 1975 he had an impressionist period with Abellana&rsquo;s influence predominating. This was also his Dimasalang period, where he worked with fellow artists Emilio<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>rCruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5194\"><strong>Andres Cristobal Cruz</strong></a>, IbarradelaRosa, and Sofronio Y. Mendoza aka SYM, figurative painters who promoted on-the-spot painting. Since 1976, Galicano has done tonal paintings, mostly atmospheric scenes of the seacoasts of Cebu and Pangasinan. He painted domestic interiors, portraits, folk genre, and still lifes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galicano identifies himself as a post-realist as he merges representation and abstraction to produce works that cohesively evoke both the aesthetics of realism and modernism. Galicano believes that the strength of a figurative painting lies in its underlying abstract structure which often has a mathematical basis, thus pointing to classical affinities in his work. For him, a painting goes beyond recording reality because it has its own internal formal relationships. He is known for incorporating a vertical line as an integral part of the artwork, whether these are portraits and genre scenes, as a means of &ldquo;reconciliation between opposite poles and the merging of the subjective and the objective&rdquo; (romulogalicano.com).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1972 to 2011, Galicano held 19 solo exhibits in various galleries in Manila, San Juan, Quezon City, Makati, and Cebu. He has also participated in group exhibitions held in Manila and Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galicano&rsquo;s <b><i>Kangkongan</i></b> (Vegetable Vine Swamp) won third prize in the painting competition of the Art AssociationofthePhilippines in 1977. He also won third prize in the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards in 1994, and grand prize at the International Portrait Competition held in 2005 in Washington, USA.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by Alice G.

Paombong, Bulacan 27 Sep 1912. d. 7 Nov 1989. Painter. The son of Jacinto Galvez and Rosa Geronimo, Miguel peddled vinegar in jars during his teens. In his early 20s in 1932, he went to Manila to stay with his uncle TeodoroBuenaventura, painter and professor at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. He stayed with him for four years, doing household chores; in return Galvez attended Buenaventura&rsquo;s classes in UP, although he was not officially enrolled. Observing his talent, the UP professors encouraged him to take free lessons in their classes. An early work of his, <b><i>Copy of Gericault&rsquo;s Raft of Medusa</i></b>, 1935, shows that Galvez learned all that was needed in academic classical techniques and pictorial skills. In 1948-49, he became art instructor at the Manila Wesleyan Colleges. During that term, he also opened a gallery in Mabini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galvez&rsquo;s paintings may be classified into four periods. The first, from the 1930s to 1948, his classical period, produced mainly genres and landscapes, solidly conceived and structurally elegant compositions done in rigorous impasto. <b><i>Banaba Tree</i></b>, 1943, <b><i>Barrio Scene</i></b>, 1943, <b><i>Mandaluyong</i></b>, 1947, exemplify this period. His second period, from 1949 to 1952, encompassed his decorative phase. By decorative is meant his use of the classical skills toward the creation of landscapes, all correct in terms of technique and structure but no longer showing the vigor of his early period. From 1953 to 1965, he went into an experimental phase. Perhaps bored with representationalism, Galvez went into semiabstraction, experimenting with neorealist expressionism, the cubism of VicenteManansala. <b><i>Newsboys</i></b>, 1955, shows exaggeratedly elongated forms. His fourth period begins around 1967, when he returned to straight representationalism, the style he used until his demise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galvez had his first one-person show at the showroom of Hans Kasten and Associates in 1948. He was represented in the International Exhibition in Kuala Lumpur in 1953. He traveled with the Traveling World Tour-Exhibit sponsored by the De La Rama Steamship <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in 1955. He held eight solo exhibitions in his lifetime, the last being in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galvez was honored as the country&rsquo;s Outstanding Landscape Painter in 1950 by the San Miguel Corporation. He won second prize for <b><i>Abandoned</i></b> in the oil painting category at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> competition in 1949. In 1953, his oil painting <b><i>Dice</i></b> was chosen by the AAP to join a selection of outstanding Filipino paintings to represent the country at the International Exhibition held in Kuala Lumpur. In 1956, Galvez also won second prize at the Philippine Tourist and Travel Association art competition for his painting <b><i>Pista sa Nayon</i></b> (Rural Fiesta).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Pinili, Ilocos Norte 13 Aug 1924. Textile weaver. Her parents are Timotea Bigsot and Catalino Galinato. She is the widow of Crespin T. Gamayo. A weaver of the traditional cloth called <b>inabel<i> </i></b>(Ilocano handwoven cloth),<i> </i>Gamayo learned her craft from her aunt when she was 16 years old. Gamayo grew up at a time when women learned to weave by copying the patterns and weaving process of elders. She taught herself the traditional patterns of <i>binakol</i>,<i> inuritan</i> (geometric design), <i>kusikos</i> (spiral forms similar to oranges), and <i>sinan-sabong</i> (flowers). She is able to recreate designs that she has seen elsewhere, a skill that is important in recreating designs that are in danger of disappearing from collective memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She received her first loom when she was 19 years old and this lasted her 30 years. The sturdy frame was made of <i>sag&rsquo;gat</i> or hardwood, which her father obtained from the area they lived in at the time. The loom had three foot pedals with wide horizontal beams to support the warp and a longer lengthwise frame to keep the threads in place. The arrangement of the threads on the loom is the most important step in the weaving process requiring good eyesight. A mistake at this point could result in faulty design in the finished product. The shuttle is threaded through the warp and under the strands, while operating the foot pedals which raise or lower the corresponding column of fibers that enable the shuttle to pass through. The process requires dexterity with good coordination of the eyes, hands, and legs, and could be hard on the back muscles of the weaver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gamayo&rsquo;s<i> </i><b>abel</b> blankets are valued for their high thread count and its being woven uniformly, and for its intricate designs that use as much as five colors. Just prior to World War II, she used to spin her own cotton on which she applied beeswax. However after the war, she had to rely on commercial threads bought in the market. Gamayo prefers using linen, because it is malleable to the weaver&rsquo;s touch. The best abel cloths are strong, lasting for generations. These gradually get softer from frequent handling, but still retain their form for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gamayo has taught weaving to her cousin&rsquo;s daughter-in-law and her sister-in-law, and also to other women in her community. In 2012, she was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA. She was featured as the &ldquo;Grandmother of Abel Iloko&rdquo; in the exhibit <b><i>Abel Iloko</i></b>, 2014, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Cecilia S.

This hard-edge painting style is a stream of geometric abstraction that privileges fullness of color, economy of form, and symmetry of structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Gan&rsquo;s hands, however, hard-edge painting becomes total geometric construction as his picture edge is often part and parcel of the picture frame that spans the canvas. Sometimes, he would saw off a perfect right angle from a corner of his frame, and echo this shape at the center of his work. <b><i>Reflective Symmetry</i></b>, 1970, a lacquer painting on wood, in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) collection, illustrates Gan&rsquo;s predisposition for boxlike structure and immaculate surface, which he achieves with the use of patterns defined by masking tape and color applied with a spray gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Love in an Empty Drawer</i></b>, 1971, hard-edge delineations assimilate soft-edge forms in an efficiently calculated composition of soft tints of white, beige, blue, and gray. All in all, minimal hard-edge art as exemplified by the works of Gan, is reflective of an orderly, efficient, and structured mind, or an aspiration for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, Gan exhibited at the CCP and the Luz Gallery.

His father was AntonioGarcia Granda, famous engraver and professor of engraving at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. He received his early education at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He began his studies in painting at UP in 1926. In 1938, he left for Rome to study at the Regge Accademia di Belle Arti. Two years later, he became a scholar at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.

In 1941, his <b><i>Indays</i></b> (Women) created a sensation in Madrid during his solo exhibition at the Circulo de Bellas Artes de Madrid. It projected Garcia as the Filipino Gauguin, his painting being a trio of nude women with their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>n features emphasized. Due to its indigenized sensibility, the painting was also reproduced in <b><i>Shin Seiki</i></b>, the sleek cultural magazine of the Philippines during the Japanese occupation. In 1945, Garcia presented important paintings including the portrait of General Borbon at the National Exposition of Fine Arts in Madrid.

He explored spatial concepts in the show<b><i> Summer Haze </i></b>followed by <b><i>Shadow, Transparency</i></b>. The paintings, of predominant brown hues with color accents, placed value on subtlety of hue and tone, creating soft fleeting movements with an op art effect.

Quezon City 11 Jul 1978. Painter and installation artist. She is the daughter of Nestor Garcia and Nora Medina. A graduate of the Philippine High School for the Arts, Garcia started joining group exhibitions in 1999 and graduated with a degree in fine arts, major in painting, from the University of the Philippines in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcia&rsquo;s practice is characterized by a mastery of realism, the employment of the photographic image, and a strong conceptual approach to art making. Born to doctor parents who owned a hospital in Marikina City, Garcia first started using X-rays as a material for her works in 1999. This exploration of media was recognized in her work <b><i>See Saw</i></b>, 2000, a diptych of a chainsaw wrapped in cloth, captured in two panels comprised of an oil-on-canvas painting and an X-ray film on lightbox. Simultaneously representing a singular object through two different imaging techniques, Garcia&rsquo;s work emphasized how the visual is dialectically comprised of both surface and structure. She continued to explore the possibilities of the radiographic material in later shows, such as <b><i>False Apparitions</i></b>, 2012, where X-rays of icon statues of saints were desacralized in a sense even as the objects were also bathed in a halo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcia&rsquo;s paintings have been noted for their precise photorealistic quality, across great variations of scale and subject matter. In 2006, Garcia started producing a series of portraits showing sitters from behind and would later on explore the representation of abject spaces and desolate landscapes. In 2010, Garcia started exploring the use of photo assemblage, using techniques from decoupage or paper tole (creating 3D pictures from a number of flat prints) crafts. She would also engage in collaborative exhibitions with other contemporary Filipino artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3834\"><strong>MM Yu</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcia&rsquo;s work was included in the Prague Biennale in the Czech Republic, 2009, and the 3rd Fukuoka Triennial at the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum in Japan, 2005. Apart from exhibiting locally, she had solo exhibitions in Singapore, 2012, and Berlin, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>See Saw</i></b> won the grand prize in the Philip Morris Group of Companies ASEAN Art Awards in Singapore and the juror&rsquo;s choice distinction in the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards. Garcia was also a finalist in the Metrobank Young Painter&rsquo;s Competition in 2000. Following these three successive distinctions, Garcia held public exhibitions of her works and received the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Thirteen Artists Award in 2003 and the Ateneo Art Award in 2005.

At an early age, Garcia apprenticed himself in the shop of Jose Arevalo. Later, he set up an atelier of his own in his house on Santa Rosa (now Regidor) St. His work flourished from his friendship with Juan Sales, a famous contractor of religious works during his time. Many of the wood-carving orders for images of saints, altars, and carrozas (processional floats) were given by Sales to Garcia for execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The figures of the evangelists, San Pedro (Saint Peter) and San Pablo (Saint Paul), on the facade of the prewar ManilaCathedral and La Purisima Concepcion (The Immaculate Conception) in the same church were carved by Garcia. The last image was the first reproduction of a famous painting by Murillo in the Philippines, the coloring of which was done by FelipeRoxas. The images Maria Magdalena, La Veronica, San Juan (Saint John), and the Se&ntilde;or en el Huerto (The Lord in the Garden), housed in the Recollect Church, Manila, were considered his better works. His other works remain unknown as it was not the practice of wood-carvers and other artisans during the Spanish colonial period to sign their works.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E.

San Quintin, Abra 27 Mar 1941. Hat maker. His parents are Francisco Garcia and Concepcion Callos. He is married to Dolores C. Garcia and they have five children. Garcia is a casque hat maker. In the Ilocos region, this headpiece is locally called <b>kattokong nga tabungaw</b>,<i> </i>an all weather headgear made of <i>upu</i> or gourd (<i>Cucurbitaceae</i>). He learned the craft from his grandfather when he was 15 years old. Primarily a farmer who cultivates rice and tobacco, Garcia plants gourd after the harvest season. He then transforms the yield into traditional tabungaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process of creating the hat involves hollowing out the upper portion of the gourd, polishing and varnishing the outer surface to produce a bright orange sheen which also improves its durability. The inside part of the hat is matted with woven <i>uway </i>(rattan) while the brim is decorated with a <i>puser</i> (bamboo) weave. It usually takes Garcia at least seven days to finish one tabungaw, using hand tools that he personally developed. He is known to have innovated his own process of hat making by studying the properties of his raw materials&mdash;gourd, rattan, and bamboo&mdash;in terms of pliancy and resistance to decay. He has also developed different patterns and remains open to exploring new designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Limited by the availability of his materials, especially by the amount of the harvested gourds, Garcia is able to create <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> hats in a good year, which is then sold in Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur, as well as in agricultural fairs organized by the government. Aside from farmers who buy the tabungaw, the hats are also bought as gifts or as souvenirs. The gourd hat is sturdy and reputed to last three to four generations with proper care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcia was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 2012.

Unlike his contemporaries in the American period, Garcia preferred to paint urban scenes to rural genre subjects. His approach to <b><i>Jones Bridge</i></b>, 1939, and <b><i>Walls of Intramuros</i></b>, 1939, are enlivened by a vigorous brushwork and rich palette that depart from the dark hues of the conservative tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcia won honorable mention for <b><i>Communal Cooperation</i></b> at the second Kapisanan ng Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas or Kalibapi National Art Competition in 1944 and third prize for <b><i>Peasant&rsquo;s Daughter</i></b> at the Art Association of the Philippines competition in 1951.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

His aggressive brushwork and vivid color palette provide contrast to the somber themes he renders, such as in <b><i>Sagrada Familia</i></b> (Holy Family), 2002, where he fuses the sacred and banal by placing the Holy Family in a jeepney, literally communing and commuting via the iconic ordinary Filipino&rsquo;s means of transit. <b><i>Rush Hour</i></b>, 2006, is painted on canvas of a jeepney interior, showing driver and passengers in a cramped space. <b><i>Mendiola</i></b>, 2010, references the street leading to Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, the seat of state power, where rallyists and demonstrators traditionally converge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garibay&rsquo;s enduring attachment to the daily travails of the struggling Filipino proceed from his first solo exhibition <b><i>Pasada</i></b> (Driver&rsquo;s Daily Grind), 1993, done at Liongoren Art Gallery. Since then, he has continued to turn out work in a signature style occasionally loosening up in terms of compositional density. Garibay has had countless exhibitions from local to international venues, and has been behind several artist initiatives such as TutoK, the Cavite-based collective Anting-Anting, and Bakawan. In 1994, he received both the Diwa ng Sining Award from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the first prize in the painting category of the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Competition.

Davao City 30 Dec 1948. Painter. He is the son of Emilio Gaston Jr and Luz Paredes. He graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts in 1971 from the University of Santo Tomas. After graduation, he worked at the Ayala Museum for some time, then as a photographer in Mindanao in 1972. A year after, he left for New York to further his studies at the Art Students League. He later moved to study the Italian language at L&rsquo;Universita de Perugia per gli Stanieri in Perugia, Italy, in 1973. He initially experienced difficulty with his art training in Europe but later earned recognition as a London-based artist. He became a lecturer at various colleges and organizations in the United Kingdom, while also teaching portrait painting from 1998 to 2004. He returned to the Philippines in 2010 and set up a studio at St. Clare Montessori Center, Caloocan City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held a one-person show at the Ateneo Art Gallery in the 1970s and left a number of paintings in its collection. These are examples of veristic surrealism because of their dreamlike juxtaposition of images from widely different contexts, as in the female nude resting on the inverted dome of a cathedral in <b><i>Ginhutikan </i></b>(Whispered To)<b><i> </i></b>on whose borders can be found several unaccountable scenes of an electrocution, a cup breaking, along with a peaceful domestic scene. Another painting, <b><i>Allora</i></b>, shows a beautiful and winged sci-fi Amazon with occult signs. Gaston&rsquo;s figurative style is clear and precise of line, the colors luminous, and he is able to achieve rare effects with color and tone to suggest glowing, as in high heat. His subjects are arresting in their originality; they raise questions rather than answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1970, he won the first and third prizes for his works <b><i>Nagapalangga</i></b> (Loving) and <b><i>Muyat Sigay</i></b>, respectively, in the Shell National Students Art Competition. In 1987, he became a representative of the Philippines to the United Nations Educational Scientific Organization at Cagnes-Sur-Mer, France.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

She is married to Marc Tequi, and they live in Paris, France. She finished her bachelor of fine arts in 1964 at the University of the Philippines (UP), and two years later she earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in English from the same university. In 1967, she earned a diploma in painting from the Regge Accademia di Belle Arti de Roma, Italy. In 1968, she took special studies in graphic arts at Pratt Institute on a Rockefeller grant. After a teaching stint at UP, she took up residence in Paris as housewife and mother of three.

In printmaking, she has worked in several media: colored etching on zinc plates, engraving on copper, and collage with handmade paper. In Paris, she also learned the technique of viscosity printing, which enables several colors to be registered simultaneously. Her first prints displaced classical imagery by subsuming it in a pop context. Her next series juggled images from the Apocalypse within a pinball machine game with its range of options, conveying a subtle warning on the nuclear threat, as in <b><i>Commentary on the Apocalypse</i></b>, 1970. Using the format of the Quattrocento predella, she also combined images from the Apocalypse with salient figures from the political scene in allusion to Philippine contemporary issues as in <b><i>Predella</i></b>, 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She has had more than 40 solo shows since 1970 in the Philippines, France, and the United States, including <b><i>Prints and</i></b> <b><i>Collages</i></b>, Luz Gallery, 1980; <b><i>The Graphic Works of Ofelia Gelvezon</i></b>-<b><i>Tequi</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), 1985; <b><i>Painting and Prints</i></b>, Galerie Telford, Paris, 1990; <b><i>Paintings</i></b>, Luz Gallery, 1995; <b><i>Paintings and Prints</i></b>, Philippine Center, New York, 1998; <b><i>Still Life Paintings</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 1999; <b><i>Prints and Collages</i></b>, The Drawing Room, 2001; <b><i>Prints</i></b>, Hiraya Gallery, 2004; <b><i>Paintings</i></b>, Pinto Art Gallery, 2005; <b><i>Perigord Still Life</i></b>, Alliance Total Gallery, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise de Manila, 2008; <b><i>Peintures</i></b>, Salle du Chateau du Limeul, Dordogne, 2009; <b><i>Vessels</i></b>, an exhibition of stoneware pottery, Ben Cab Museum, 2011; <b><i>Pots and Gourds</i></b>, Galerie Hans Brumann, 2011; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3569\"><strong>Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi</strong></a>: Paintings and Prints</i></b>, Bulwagan ng Dangal, UP Diliman, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gelvezon-Tequi&rsquo;s awards include first prize at the Printmakers Association of the Philippines Competition in 1969; a gold medal for the print <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>Retablo</strong></a></i></b> at the 35th Art Association of the Philippines Annual Art Competition; Mariang Maya Achievement Award in Graphic Arts from the Sigma Delta Sorority Alumnae Association, Manila, in 1983; Quatrieme Mention, XVIII Salon Ile de France in 1985; the Distinguished Alumni Award for Culture and Arts from UP on its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>th anniversary in 1998; the Michiko Takamatsu Prize in 2002 and the Lucien and Suzanne Jonas Prize in 2003, both from the Salon des Artistes Fran&ccedil;ais, Espace Auteuil, Paris.

He is both artisan and owner of one of the remaining burnay kilns in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. Burnay pottery refers to the red-clay earthenware pots turned off a potter&rsquo;s wheel and fired at very high temperatures, thus making it more durable than terra-cotta. The kilns are enormous, some of them half as long as a city block. The pottery methods used are identical to those in the pottery craft of Fookien in southern China. The pots come in three forms: <b>tapayan</b> or <b>banga</b>, round water jars found in rural homes; the <b>bagoongan</b>, ovate fermenting jars used in Ilocano-speaking regions; and the <b>asinan</b>, small ovate jars for storing salt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of the five burnay kilns still active in Vigan, four are no longer in the hands of their original owners and are run as strictly commercial ventures. Go is the only <b>burnayan</b> owner involved in the creative process, which he learned from his father. Dedicated to preserving this unique tradition of Vigan, he operates his own family kiln, working alongside another potter in turning out the claypots with his own hands. Go inherited from his father the old burnayan which was built in 1935. While maintaining the traditional forms, methods, and materials, he has explored new forms and directions in the potter&rsquo;s art. Although no one in his family has shown the same enthusiasm for this traditional folk art, he shares his skills and talents with the community to ensure the survival and growth of burnay pottery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, Go was named Manlilikha ng Bayan, one of the first folk artists to receive the award, for &ldquo;continuing with conviction the ancient and traditional craft of high-fired Burnayan pottery within his community.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosalinda Galang, updated by Cecilia S.

They often went on expeditions to paint landscapes together. In the early 1970s, he studied the techniques of Andrew Wyeth and this led him to hyperrealistic painting. He staged his first one-person show at the Hidalgo Gallery in 1972 and has had nine solo exhibitions, including shows at the Finale and West Gallery at SM Megamall in Nov 1992. Shortly after, Goy took a hiatus from the exhibition circuit to devote his time to mastering his craft without the influence of trends in artistic styles. Goy resurfaced for ManilArt 2013 where he exhibited 23 of his works spanning four decades of artistry, from 1971 to 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His most remembered works include <b><i>King Fisher</i></b>, 1975, which features rich red marshy humus and patches of puddles captured in bluish grey that provide variety to the almost monochromatic color scheme, and <b><i>Pahinga</i></b> (Rest), 1977, which shows a cow nestled in the foreground amidst grass in a sprawling meadow. In the background is a cart full of worn objects evoking distance. Generally, his paintings are meticulously detailed and exude a rich optimistic feeling in contrast to the desolation of the American farms recorded by Wyeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1957, Goy won first prize in the Bureau of Travel and Trade Industry painting contest.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Initially committed to making space for promising artists based in the region, it has been run as a gallery, performance space, classroom, and residency space for collaborations and exchanges among artists engaged in alternative media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Co-founded by artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3747\"><strong>Norberto Roldan</strong></a>, Donna Miranda, Manny Chaves, and curator Bobi Valenzuela, GP opened in 2000 on Maginhawa St in Teacher&rsquo;s Village, Quezon City. Its inaugural exhibition was <b><i>The Umbrella Country</i></b>,<i> </i>a group show named after a semiautobiographical novel by Bino Realuyo. The exhibition featured works from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\"><strong>Nunelucio Alvarado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3474\"><strong>Charlie Co</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a>, all of whom were already established names in social realism at that juncture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Positioned as a noncommercial, artist-run platform, GP later aimed to create an environment for experimentation, research, and representation, setting off a momentum from which artists could mobilize and organize themselves and take active roles in cultural production. A turning point in GP&rsquo;s programming took place when it was selected by University of the Philippines fine arts professor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3793\"><strong>Gerardo Tan</strong></a> as venue for a group show titled <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>,<i> </i>curated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, featuring the works of the graduating class studio majors of 2000. Some of the emergent curators that have since been able to establish platforms for themselves after incubating projects at GP include Lian Ladia and Merv Espina. They belong to a new generation of artist organizers who no longer work in a purely exhibition-centric curatorial mode as they have initiated projects online, and through pirate radio, with some of these projects taking a more-research-based or discursive mode as opposed to an art production/object-making approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2002, Green Papaya was, along with Big Sky Mind, listed by the Japan Foundation in their directory of independent spaces. Green Papaya relocated to T. Gener St in Quezon City in Aug 2008 and elected a board of directors from within the arts community, all of whom share a belief in the role of alternative and artist-run spaces in keeping the creation and consumption of art dynamic and relevant. GP was invited to London&rsquo;s Tate Modern Gallery for No Soul for Sale Festival of Independents in 2010. GP was appointed in 2012 as the Philippine partner organization to smARTpower, which is part of the US State Department&rsquo;s cultural diplomacy program administered by the Bronx Museum of Arts in New York.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice Sarmiento</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><i>Papayapost</i>, n.d.; Roldan 2014.</p>\r\n"

Makati 1 Nov 1970. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a> artist. She is the daughter of fashion designer Helena Carratala and photographer Xavier &ldquo;Wahoo&rdquo; Roces Guerrero. Guerrero&rsquo;s partner is painter and photographer At Maculangan with whom she has a daughter. Guerrero began her art studies by taking a course on film at Film in the Cities, Minnesota, 1991, and went on to anthropology and philosophy at the New School for Social Research, New York, 1989. She earned her bachelor of fine arts, major in painting, at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts, 1998. Guerrero is among a generation of artists who studied with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> and who then pursued not only an individual creative practice but also embarked on art initiatives that included curation, continuing education, documentation, and the enabling of the circulation of work of fellow artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guerrero&rsquo;s body of work straddles diverse media though she is more largely associated with video and installation. While Guerrero&rsquo;s fairly early work would most logically be construed as conceptual image-making with particular emphases on time, action, and possibly the thwarting of intent, she does acknowledge a strong desire to keep publicly engaged to some degree. This can be seen in several unrealized proposals for public art projects and in her work <b><i>Outpost</i></b>, 1998, a collaborative installation she intended as a symbolic occupation of a site tied to both past and present. In it, she coaxed visitors to take on a space at the old Leandro Locsin-built Ayala Museum for the one-night event called <b><i>Post</i></b>, curated by artist colleague Jet Melencio. Later on in her practice, Guerrero applied this principle by opening up artist-activated sites to residencies, exhibitions, workshop-seminars, curated slideshows which collectively pose a parallel learning space for visual artists to meet each other, including those in transmedia fields such as music and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her solo exhibitions include <b><i>Mind/Matter</i></b>, College of Fine Arts Dirty Room, 1994; <b><i>The Revolving Door</i></b>, Finale Art File, and <b><i>Natural Disasters</i></b>, College of Fine Arts Dirty Room, 1995; <b><i>Leaving Utopia</i></b>, College of Fine Arts Dirty Room, 1996; <b><i>Old and New</i></b>, De La Salle University Art Gallery, 1999; and <b><i>State of</i></b> <b><i>Color</i></b>, MO Space, 2012.

Aside from teaching painting in the homes of prominent Manila families, he also gave lessons in drawing at the Colegio de Santa Isabel, La Concordia, and Instituto de Mujeres.

He developed the tendency of breaking down forms along cubistic concepts but through transparent layers of color. By the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, he had evolved tightly knit compositions transforming genre themes into stylized overlapping layers of planes with grainy texture enhanced by embossment. This grainy feel and his undulating lines and monochromatic hues were recognized as his personal innovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gutierrez held his first one-person show at CM Arts Gallery, Timog Ave, Quezon City, in 1969.

Tondo, Manila 30 Mar 1953. Painter. He is the eldest son of Juan Habulan and Alicia Rentoria. He is married to Sylvia Zarsadias with whom he has four children. Through a scholarship, Habulan was able to enter the University of the East School of Fine Arts in 1970-76, during which time he took special tutorship in portraiture under Virginia Jacinto, 1972-76, and a glass blowing course at the National Science and Development Board, 1975. In 1977, Habulan was sponsored by two institutions to travel around Luzon and for a month lived with the Mangyan of Oriental Mindoro. These experiences soon found their way into Habulan&rsquo;s canvases as he infused ethnic imagery into his painting of social themes. In 1979, Habulan held his first one-person show, <b><i>Sa Lupa ng</i></b> <b><i>Katahimikan</i></b> (In the Land of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a>). Since then, Habulan has steadily held one-person shows and participated in more than 25 group shows. He was one of the major members of Kaisahan, a group of socially committed artists during the period of the Marcos dictatorship. His art has also brought him to other countries like Japan, South Korea, Thailand, India, Singapore, and Canada, either as a delegate or as a commissioned artist to do murals. He is also a member of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Applying realistic figurism, Habulan&rsquo;s art seeks to portray the contrast between the rich and the poor by painting landlords and tenants, the <i>ilustrados </i>(educated native) as represented by Maria Claras in their fineries, the poor and deprived as typified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a>, and the ragged and bent <i>sacada</i> (seasonal cane worker). Habulan later shifted his themes from class struggle to the role of religion and tradition, still in the light of social justice. Habulan is also known for his long-standing collaboration with fellow artist Alfredo Esquillo since the 1990s, where they both have employed their realist inclinations in depicting the Black Nazarene devotions in Quiapo, Manila. Such collaborative efforts took fruit in their joint exhibits at the National University of Singapore Museum in 2012 and at the Vargas Museum in 2014, where their work consisted of multimedia art forms, including film and sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He received the Thirteen Artists Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in 1990 and is an active teacher of several generations of emergent artists.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rachel Mayo, updated by Rina Corpuz</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Guazon 2014; Vargas Museum 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

Baguio City 15 May 1957. Photographer and cinematographer. He is the son of Sabas C. Hafalla and Josefina B. Dulay. He attended John Hay Elementary School, and Baguio City High School, 1974. He studied aircraft engineering at FEATI University, 1978, and took film workshops at the University of the Philippines Film Center, 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Known for documenting the scenes and people of the Cordilleras and their ways of life, Hafalla captures arresting photographs showing communities of individuals in both everyday and ritual contexts. He was cinematographer of the documentary <b><i>Bontoc Eulogy</i></b>, 1995, directed by Marlon Fuentes and Bridget Yearian. Among his noted exhibits are <b><i>Images of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> </i></b>at Hiraya Gallery, 1986, and <b><i>Images of the Cordillera</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), 1988-89, and at the Malaca&ntilde;an Museum, 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His photographs capture not only his subjects&rsquo; physical appearance but also their spiritual character. His monochromatic and high-contrast photographs of residents of the Cordilleras bear quiet depth. He portrays these individuals amidst their possessions and homes, subtly implying the connectedness of these people to their places of living from which meanings of the objects and practices around them emanate. These photographs do not easily lend themselves to touristic purposes as they are more intent in capturing the aura of the environment and its people, and the history that is contained within and around these sites. Hafalla&rsquo;s photographs also create a dialogue between the old and the present Cordilleras not only through juxtaposition and use of youth as subject matter but also by presenting individuals who continue to practice and carry out traditional rituals and customs amidst a changing landscape and ways of living. Hafalla believes that items, as well as symbols and rituals, may help young Cordillerans connect to their ancestors. His photographs can also be seen as a testament to the culture of Cordillerans who persevere despite changes occurring within and around their communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hafalla received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 1992. His work <b><i>Cliff</i></b><i> <b>Hanger: Death Rite</b></i> won the Documentary Award from the Humanity Photo Awards in Dazo City, China, 2006, and in Guangzhou, China, 2009. The same film was also accorded the Performance Award in Beijing, China, 2013.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Zeny May D.

San Francisco County, California 4 Jun 1960. Photographer. Not much is known of the life of H. W. Harnish. Accounts tell us that he was a Private of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> D, 14th US Infantry, and served in the American campaign against Muslims in 1898. His last known rank according to records of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs was warrant officer. He served in both the Spanish-American War, 1898, and the First World War, 1914-18. Current available information maintains that after being discharged (the exact date for this is not known), he and his wife <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Peas Barnes ran a photograph gallery in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, known as the Mrs. H. W. Harnish Gallery. The works of Harnish are known through a photographic collection at the University of the Philippines Library consisting of more than 500 glass negatives, slide plates, film negatives, and prints taken between 1898 and 1907. It is uncertain whether these photographs were taken while he was in active service or were shot as commissioned work or as a hobby, or whether some of the photographs were taken by Mrs Harnish herself, after whom the gallery was, in fact, named.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The photographs were rendered in either black-and-white or were colored by hand. They were taken with what could have been a Penny Picture camera. They consisted of peoples, scenery, and structures from different parts of the Philippines. These &ldquo;Filipino and Moro&rdquo; views, accompanied by more than the usual short caption, were sold as postcards in the United States and Europe. Some shots were taken inside the studio, while others were shot against natural settings. Harnish took individual and group portraits of American soldiers and civilians stationed in Zamboanga, as well as portraits of local Filipino families. A variety of ethnolinguistic groups, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a><i> </i>and Itneg of the north, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Subanon, and Maranao of the south, were likewise represented. Scenic images included seascapes with ships, coastal and riverine views, and everyday activities. Structures included images of residences, religious buildings, military barracks, hospitals, and civic infrastructure, such as bridges, streets, and roads. Except for the colored plates, the photographs were generally &ldquo;unmediated,&rdquo; although in the case of portraits, the sitters were often &ldquo;posed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These photographs may be interpreted in a variety of ways, and some have read the images to have been framed from an orientalist perspective or, more specifically, the American colonial administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;civilizing&rdquo; agenda. It is highly possible that as a foreigner, Harnish&rsquo;s perception of the Philippines was from a vantage point of difference, surfacing, whether wittingly or unwittingly, his biases against other races and ethnicities. At the same time, the photographs may be seen as evidence of aspects of life in a period in the Philippines&rsquo; past which are now difficult to access. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

Hechanova Jr</b>) b. Kabankalan, Negros Occidental 29 Mar 1939. d. 31 Aug 2014. Painter, printmaker, sculptor. He studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas and graphic arts and printmaking at Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. He was active in painting and printmaking, doing abstract works, before he shifted to sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a series of highly innovative sculptures, Hechanova introduced the use of aluminum and transparent plexiglass combined with wood. His works thus show the influence of the constructivists who used chrome and plexiglass to achieve virtual volume in sculpture and bring out its spatial dimension. The elements of his work are basically structures made from large transparent cubes and rectangular blocks. The artist employs a highly original approach to his materials. In his art, geometric formality and impersonal technological aspect is mocked by a central assemblage of painted metal parts, randomly twisted and warped. This creates a striking contrast between order and chaos, controlling reason and arbitrary impulse, altogether creating the impression of a streamlined structure with an unpredictable, irrational core. He also did large sculptures in wood, such as the wheel-like Mandala which consists of irregular spokes revolving around a center. Again, it continues a persistent concern for contrasting formal structure with unpredictable elements, regular form with irregular details, reason with creative intuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first one-person show was at the Northern Motors Showroom in 1966.

He later held another show at the Agra Gallery in Washington, DC, where he took up residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hechanova received awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: second prize, <b><i>Algae</i></b>, 1966; first prize, <b><i>Perspectus #7</i></b>, 1967; honorable mention, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a></i></b>, 1967; third prize, <b><i>Political Epilogue</i></b>, 1967; and major award, <b><i>Allegory in Aluminum</i></b>, 1968.

Isabela 20 Feb 1951. Visual artist. His parents are Eduardo Santos and Clara Abarca. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3581\"><strong>Hermisanto</strong></a> studied at the College of Fine Arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) in the 1970s and is counted among early Filipino practitioners of environmental and site-specific art. Hermisanto was one of several artists included in the Los Ba&ntilde;os <b><i>Site Works</i></b>, 1981, perhaps the first outdoor installation and site-specific art exhibition organized in Luzon. Participating artists were advised to use materials found on site. Hermisanto&rsquo;s piece had three 15-foot pieces of thick vines tied to trees opposite each other. Floating above ground, they traced three strong lines across the clear skies. Birds later on perched on them. Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a>, writing about the piece in the same year, described it as a pleasant alternative to the electrical wires that marred the view of the skies. Hermisanto&rsquo;s vines may very well have alluded to electric wiring, subtly posing the organic against the synthetic, the crafted against the manufactured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His installations are often large-scale, open-frame structures incorporating materials from nature like bamboo and vine. This preference for natural materials can be discerned not only in his site-specific works but in his mixed media pieces as well. The artist has used rice husks and grains, for instance, to make abstract forms on a two-dimensional ground. Spheres, horizontal and vertical spans in solid colors combine the natural and the synthetically abstract, yet even in these formal gestures a sentiment for the cycles and patterns found in nature is discerned. These mixed media works make up the bulk of his solo exhibitions, which include <b><i>Booth #15</i></b>, 2014, for the Sikat Pinoy art fair at Megamall, and the double segments for <b><i>Dalawang Daan</i></b> (Two Routes),<b> </b>2014, at a Lipa medical center and the Executive House at the UP Campus. Hermisanto&rsquo;s <b><i>Palayan ni Hermisanto</i></b> (Hermisanto&rsquo;s Ricefield) was shown at the Avellana Gallery in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hermisanto collaborated many times with artist Junyee on site-specific projects in 1992 and 1993. Their series featuring bamboo works was called <b><i>Putok sa Buho</i></b> (a local expression meaning &ldquo;coming out of nowhere&rdquo;; <i>buho</i> is similar to bamboo). This was shown at the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise de Manille and the Sining Makiling Gallery at UP Los Ba&ntilde;os. Hermisanto&rsquo;s preference for the pliant bamboo is evident in <b><i>Ode to Mother Nature</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2003, done for the first Bagasbas Beach Eco Arts Festival in Camarines Sur. In this work, bamboo poles were lashed with rattan as pieces of wood and coconut tree husks dangled at various heights from the tips of the poles, making the structure appear like a fish trap when seen from underneath. In 2013, Hermisanto helped Junyee realize the latter&rsquo;s proposal for PLOT at the UP Diliman <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> Garden. It was a network of cans tied to each other to make their tingling sound resonate when pulled from certain nodes. This inclination toward a participative and performative element in site work also informed Hermisanto&rsquo;s frequent collaborations with other artists, such as his teaming up with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a> in her seminal Mano-Mano performances in the 1990s as well as his individual work in the Philippine International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a> Festival. Hermisanto has consistently mounted solo and group exhibitions since the 1980s. His works were included in numerous group exhibitions such as <b><i>Broadstrokes II</i></b>, 2011, at the Corredor at the UP College of Fine Arts, and <b><i>Sampu&rsquo;t Isang Daliri</i> </b>(Ten Plus <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Finger), 2014, at Gallery Astra. Hermisanto&rsquo;s works have also been included in group exhibitions abroad: Singapore in 1995, Thailand in 1993 and 1992, and Italy in 1992.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by Tessa Maria Guazon</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">ArtsHub 2013; ASEF Culture 360 2015; Espina 2014; Galleria Duemila 2003a.</p>\r\n"

In 1947, he won a Don Ramon Roces scholarship through a competition. This enabled him to attend the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts. Honing his skills in anatomy was part of his training as illustrator. When he completed the year, he was employed by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\"><strong>Ramon Roces Publications</strong></a> as illustrator. He stayed with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> for 15 years, from 1948 to 1964, as cover artist and illustrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Herrera is one of the few who mastered the art of history painting. In 1964, he resigned to be on his own as a full-time painter. Having trained at the UP School of Fine Arts, he considered FernandoAmorsolo as his dominant influence. From the maestro, he derived the sense of history, tradition, and national identity. From the beginning, he had always considered himself an impressionist, working in a painterly idiom while remaining in the academic tradition. In 1976, he put up an art school in Greenhills, San Juan, where he does individualized teaching. Herrera was the founder of the National Society of Filipino Artists and became its president in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Herrera won awards from the Art Association ofthe Philippines: second prize, <b><i>Adamyo</i></b>, 1951; special award, <b><i>After the Rain</i></b>, 1951; honorable mention, <b><i>Siga</i></b> (Bonfire), 1953; second prize, <b><i>Rosary</i></b>, 1953; and best Philippine genre, <b><i>Sunday Menu</i></b>, 1954.

Vigan 9 Sep 1976. Painter, sculptor, writer, curator. He is the son of Hermenegildo Hilario and Juliet Jaramillo. He was a visual arts major at the Philippine High School for the Arts from 1990 to 1994 and studied painting andart history at the College of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines Diliman from 1994 to 2000. He is the curator of Pinto Art Museum. From 2005 to 2008, Hilario taught art at the Philippine High School for the Arts. He has also participated in conferences here and abroad, including the Multifaceted Curator, held in Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia, 2006. From 2004 to 2007, he served as secretary of the National Committee on Art Galleries of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Prior to this, he was project officer of the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards, Ayala Museum, 1997-2001, and Sambayan (National Art Festival) 1998.

Coming from a family of santo makers, Hilario draws from the rich iconography of religious wood carving as well as a childhood interest in astronomy, dreams, and the paranormal. These sources lend his works a magical and dreamlike quality. In the installation he collaborated on with Joel Ajero, <b><i>It Was a Paradisical State: The Body Was Allowed to Be a Body</i></b>, 2012, four-legged animals with human heads gaze impassively at the viewer, challenging us to draw out its secrets. In <b><i>Flight of the Astral Body</i></b>, 2011, a maiden with night sky wings rides on the artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;trademark&rdquo; <i>aniwaas</i>, a birdlike creature with a human face. While perched atop the bearded head of saint are exquisite corpses, playful yet austere in their introspective air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first solo exhibit <b><i>Kristuhan</i></b> in 1996 at Hiraya Gallery, Manila.

Balian, Pangil, Laguna 20 May 1914. d. 1984. Painter, illustrator. After his elementary and high school education in Laguna, Icarangal enrolled at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts where he finished his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1933. In 1938, he also finished his degree in architecture at the University of Santo Tomas. To help support his studies, Icarangal worked as illustrator for the magazines <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> and the <b><i>PhilippineGraphic</i></b>. After earning his degree in architecture, he also taught subjects in the same field. During World War II, he served as a guerrilla officer. He migrated to the United States soon after the war, but he constantly visited the Philippines, residing for long periods to enable him to show his works in several group exhibits and to join various national art competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Trained in the classical tradition, Icarangal belonged to the classical realistic school during the first period of his career. His deftness in the representational style understandably served him well in his career as illustrator for fiction in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and <b><i>Graphic</i></b>. His second period began after visits to the Philippine Art Gallery, which led to experiments in the semiabstract style. His geometrization of the human form and his rendering of shapes through layers of colors indeed show the influence of VicenteManansala&rsquo;s transparent cubism. Icarangal&rsquo;s paintings, however, are different from Manansala&rsquo;s in his preference of dark and somber hues and heavy shading that might have been derived from his experience as illustrator. He also executed figural wood sculptures in which his shapes were also articulated geometrically while his textures were rough to evoke the brawns of the Filipino peon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Icarangal continued to participate in Philippine shows until 1960 when he joined an art publishing company in the United States. His paintings were reproduced in the <b><i>Encyclopedia of the Philippines </i></b>by ZoiloM.Galang, and he is represented in the National Museum Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stylization along abstract simplification but still inspiring reverence characterized his <b><i>Madonna in Wood</i></b>, which won an honorable mention at the ArtAssociation ofthePhilippines (AAP) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> competition in 1951.

Sinait, Ilocos Sur 18 May 1912. d. New York, New York 1 Jun 2000. Painter. Venancio&rsquo;s parents were Victorio Igarta and Monica Claris. As a child, Venancio was so interested in art that he walked on foot to Badoc, Ilocos Norte, a town adjacent to his own to the north, in order to see a 19th-century oleograph of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> in the aforementioned town, Luna&rsquo;s birthplace. At 18, he left the Philippines to seek a better life. For four years, he shifted from one farm to another, north to south in California. Later he moved to New York and landed a menial job in an exclusive psychiatric sanitarium. While waiting for errands, he watched the nurse paint flowers on food trays. Called to perform a chore, the nurse left her painting and Igarta automatically took over her work. When she returned, she was so impressed with what he did such that she encouraged him to take formal lessons. Igarta first attended classes at the National Academy of Design, New York, under Charles Curran and Leon Kroll, then in 1938 at the Art Students League of New York under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Palmer. In that year, he first earned praise from a critic named Emily Genaver who wrote in the <b><i>World Telegram</i></b>: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> could learn a lot about color by looking at Igarta&rsquo;s paintings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was the first Filipino to exhibit a painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. The piece was <b><i>Northern Philippines</i></b>, which was hung beside works of Rufino Tamayo, Willem de Kooning, Henry Moore, and Ben Shahn. <b><i>Northern Philippines</i></b> became the cover of the May 1942 issue of <b><i>Fortune Magazine</i></b>. It showed how Igarta was trying to create a style that expressed the temperament of his country. This he evoked by using earth colors, slanting up his perspective, and depicting images recalling his old Sinait, Ilocos Norte, such as a woman balancing a jar on her head, carabaos, and nipa huts. <b><i>Banana Bloom</i></b>, 1946, illustrates the same tendency; this time the canvas is filled up with a close-up of the banana flower, the lines of its petals dominating space such that the subject itself becomes an abstract composition. The key of the composition <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a></i></b>, 1947, lies in the rendering of the visual image in close-up, until the lines of bamboo tubes, the nodes, and young branches become mere abstract compositional elements. All these works prefigure the neorealism that was yet to be inaugurated in 1950. In 1949, Igarta was &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; and claimed by his Filipino compatriots in New York. His painting <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a></strong></a> Scene</i></b>, reproduced in the <b><i>Art of the Philippines 1521-1958</i></b>, is characterized by a surrealistic feeling sensed in the treatment of small figures in a wide space enriched by grain-fine dabs of paint presaging the works of PrudencioLamarrosa, another Ilocano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1991, the Metropolitan Museum of Manila hosted <b><i>Ang Pagbabalik ni Igarta</i></b> (Lopez 2014), showing the artist&rsquo;s neo-expressionist portraits and interpretations of scenes from <b><i>Biag ni Lam-Ang </i></b>(Life of Lam-Ang). Igarta exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Arts; Des Moines Art Center, Iowa; Dayton Art Institute, Ohio; and Artisans Gallery, New York City. On the day of his death, Igarta had another show with other Asian American artists titled <b><i>Milieu Part III</i></b>, scheduled to open at the Asian American Arts Centre. Igarta was included in the <b><i>World Biography</i></b>, 1948. In 1991, a coffee-table book of Igarta&rsquo;s works was released by Celia Zenaida Aborro and Shehbaz Saframo. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Iloilo 5 Feb 1900. d. 2 Sep 1957. Painter. She is the daughter of Nicolas Iglesias and Ernesta de la Rama, prestigious embroiderer of genre scenes on pi&ntilde;a. She married Francisco Jinete Rodriguez, a hacendero from Negros Occidental. Maria&rsquo;s sister was Monserrat Iglesias, a prominent soprano before World War II. During her early years, her family transferred to Manila. She took her elementary and secondary education at the Santa Isabel College and Philippine Normal School. She began her studies at the University of the Philippines (UP), first studying music. She obtained her certificate in painting in 1927. During her UP years, she consistently bagged the medals of the annual competitions, and in the yearly exhibitions sponsored by the UP President&rsquo;s Committee on Culture, she always merited the praise of critics. She also figured in art exhibitions held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a> de Manila, for which reason she was the only woman represented in the collection of the National Museum (then called National Gallery of Arts) prior to World War II, with her <b><i>Portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\"><strong>Emilio Jacinto</strong></a></i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maria Iglesias is the Philippines&rsquo; most highly acclaimed woman painter during the American colonial period. In 1928, Maria Paz Mendoza-Guanzon&rsquo;s <b><i>The Development and Progress of the Filipino Women </i></b>included a picture of Maria Iglesias surrounded by seven large canvases that showed her undoubtable skills as portraitist and landscape painter. In style, these paintings resembled those of FabiandelaRosa. Of these pieces, none seems to have survived the war. Also in 1936, an American art critic reviewing the UP annual exhibition wrote: &ldquo;Miss Maria Iglesias had among her exhibited pieces 2 first-rate landscapes.&rdquo; Her extant paintings are found in the UP Vargas Museum, the National Museum, and her daughter&rsquo;s collection. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Manila, 23 Jul 1960. Installation and multimedia artist, curator. He is the son of the broadcaster Edgar U. Ilarde and Sylvia Arrastia. His brother Rico is a filmmaker. Ilarde earned his degree in fine arts, major in painting, at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ilarde&rsquo;s work, ranging from installation to collage, is influenced by both conceptual and minimalist art practice and by his collaborations with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a><b> </b>since the 1980s. His installations are produced using a broad range of found objects such as a smashed up Volkswagen Beetle to artists&rsquo; tools and materials. Shows such as <b><i>Painting as Something and as the Opposite of Something</i></b>, 2010, at the Finale Art File reconstitute everyday materials as abject monuments to modernity. In <b><i>The Triumph of Painting</i></b>, for instance, Ilarde appropriates a used boxing ring canvas sourced from the Elorde Boxing Gym. This was framed and suspended as if it were a painting within the gallery space. Other installation works explored the process of collecting things like pencil stubs, erasers, and used paint tubes. His collage series, starting in 1999, made use of objects found in artists&rsquo; studios&mdash;discarded pencils, measuring implements, sketches, cutouts, and even hardened paint pigment transformed into sculptural material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He likewise utilizes the exhibition space itself as part of the work, deliberately altering it physically, reconfiguring it away from being merely an area of containment to a site in which space itself is imagined as meaning-making material and a way to surface various processes of artistic production. Since 2001, Ilarde&rsquo;s work increasingly explored the concepts of erasure, excavation, and void in relation to the exhibition space. In the show <b><i>White Cube</i></b>, 2001, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), he extracted layers of paint from the actual gallery walls and displayed the result as a literal white cube, remaking both time and space in a single form. Variations of the excised cube appear in later installations in 2004 and 2009, when Ilarde distilled this into single resin cubes in further acts of excavation and erasure, transforming remnants of walls into material objects placed on display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ilarde held his first one-man exhibition at the Ayala Museum in 1987, and has subsequently staged at least 17 one-man exhibits since then. From 1983 onward, he participated in various group exhibitions in Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore. These include <b><i>Market Forces &ndash; Erasure: From Conceptualism to Abstraction</i></b>, 2014, at Osage Hong Kong and at the City University of Hong Kong; <b><i>No Talking Points</i></b>, 2012, TAKSU Singapore; and <b><i>Complete and Unabridged, Part I</i></b>, 2011, La Salle Institute of Contemporary Arts, Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ilarde served as the exhibition director of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3720\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></a></strong></a> Galleries</strong></a> from 1984 to 1985. He has curated numerous exhibitions of Philippine contemporary art in the Philippines and in Singapore beginning 1980. These include shows at the CCP, UP College of Fine Arts, Jorge B. Vargas Museum, Mag:net Galleries, West Gallery, Finale Art File, Mo_Space, and SM Megamall Art Center. Ilarde was selected for the 1980 <b><i>Young Arts in Asia Now</i></b> exhibition at the Hong Kong Art Center. He also received the top award in the painting category of the 1981 Art Association of the Philippines competition. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Lisa Ito-Tapang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources: </strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Ilarde 2013; Ito 2014c.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

Jolo, Sulu 14 Jan 1936. d. Manila 16 Dec 2014. Sculptor, photographer. National Artist for visual arts. His parents were Jamasali Allih and Asia Imao. Raised by a maternal uncle, Captain Abdurahim Imao, he finished his elementary at the Jolo Central School (now Muhammad Tulawie Central Elementary School) and secondary education at the Sulu Trade School (now Hadji Butu School of Arts and Trade). He married Grace de <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">l</span>eon of Santo Tomas, <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">p</span>ampanga, who died in 2012. They had four sons: Abdulmari Jr, Josemari, Juan Sajid, and Alkarim&mdash;all visual artists. He earned a bachelor of fine arts from the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1959 and a master of fine arts from the University of Kansas in 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a sculptor and painter, he drew his inspiration from the Tausug and Maranao artistic traditions of southern Philippines, particularly design motifs from <b>okir</b> (traditional Tausug and Maranao sculpture) wood carving, which he reinterprets in a contemporary idiom. His art evolved by employing four distinct but interrelated themes: Islamic calligraphy; the <b>sarimanok</b>, a mythical bird with a fish in its beak; the <b>sari-mosque</b>, a design combining the sarimanok and the form of the mosque; and the <b>sari-okir</b>. He executed these themes through different sculptural processes, mainly metal casting, welding, embossing or repousse, as well as painting. He made use of different mediums, mainly brass and bronze, in sculpture. Imao combines okir and Arabic calligraphy to create sculptural variations in the name of Allah. Imao&rsquo;s art has a highly developed technological basis in his moulds of dolomite or white carbide stone, ignited or fossilized coal, or raw marble dust, technologies that have been widely adapted in the Southeast Asian region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first solo exhibit in 1960 was held at the Contemporary Art <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">g</span>allery in Mabini.

His sculpture <b><i>The South Pacific Trail</i></b> was displayed for two years at the New York Museum of Modern Art.

Manila 11 Oct 1934. Painter, pianist, writer. She is the daughter of Pablo Rivera and Lourdes Consunji. She married George Ingle in England and had three children. After her graduation from college in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a> in 1953, Ingle went to Madrid in 1954, and then to France to take up informal studies in drawing and painting at the Academie Julien. The following year, she went to Regent Street Polytechnic in London. Her stay in England marked a milestone in her piano career when she passed the final performance examinations given by the Associated Board of Royal Schools of Music in 1975. She worked as an employee of the Philippine Embassy in London, 1957-67. She returned to Davao in 1975 where she continued her dual career as a pianist and painter, and later took on environmentalism as a vocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ingle&rsquo;s paintings of women and children are done with much tenderness and delicacy. Linear in style, the figures are individualized like portraits, while beyond the sensitive particularity of the women is a penetrating insight into the small, continually shifting gestures and postures of a relational body language that tells of elusive inner moods and attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ingle&rsquo;s literary talents have not been neglected. She wrote a novel on the local landed class, as well as a prize-winning biography,<b><i> Edades: Kites and Visions</i></b>, 1980, of the pioneer modernist VictorioEdades, who had settled in Davao. Her biographical work on Edades eventually became the basis of the script of a documentary drama about the artist, released in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ingle participated in a group show of women artists in Mar 1993 at the Liongoren Gallery. In Sep 2000, Ingle participated in another exhibit, <b><i>Seven Women: Windows of Davao</i></b>, at the Gallery M of the Barcelo Royal Mandaya Hotel in Davao, with the aim of celebrating womanhood and nature in 58 works by seven Davao-based women artists. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Calbayog City, Samar 2 Mar 1943. Painter. He went to Calbayog Elementary School, Samar, 1950-56, and finished high school at Christ the King College in 1960. He is married to Annabella Isidro, and their daughter Tricia has studied fashion and interior design. Isidro studied fine arts, majoring in advertising, at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), 1961-65. He also took up postgraduate studies in advanced painting at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) College of Fine Arts in 1968. He was a faculty member of the PWU College of Fine Arts, 1969-75, and served as its director, 1975-77. He also taught at the fine arts department of the College of Holy Spirit, 1972. In 1985-87, he was the art director of Studio Five Designs Inc in California. In 1983, he was the president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> as well as the president of the Philippine Association of Printmakers in 2000 and 2001, and organized its Traveling Print Workshop and Exhibition in 2001-3.

His <b><i>Seinegung</i></b> (Affection), 1966, which appeared in Philippiniche Malerei, Germany, showed concern for meaningful organization through forms emphasizing the plasticity of the oil medium. In the early 1970s, Isidro returned to figuration in works using acrylic on metal etching. But his shapes led him to realize the potential of bold lines for calligraphic abstract expression. In the mid-1970s, his works turned pure abstract with bold but impersonal gestures of the brush conveying dynamic mental and emotional configurations. This stage is represented by his Festival series in the exhibition <b><i>Insights into Philippine Contemporary Art</i></b>. In this series, Isidro&rsquo;s calligraphic gestures were made sleek because he coated his surfaces with thick polishes of lacquer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He had his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Lunar Series</i></b>, in 1969 at the Solidaridad Galleries, followed by other solo exhibitions at the Luz Gallery, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1980, 1995, 1996; Gallery A, San Francisco, 1990, 1991; I.S.

After that, he and his family migrated to Manila (Izon 1993). In college, he took fine arts at the University of the Philippines and started working in the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a> </i></b>when he was 22 years old. Together with Jose Pereira, Izon did the prewar editorial cartoons of the <b><i>Free Press</i></b>. When Pereira left the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> in 1938, Izon took over Pereira&rsquo;s box on page one of the periodical until it was shut down during the Japanese occupation in 1942. Izon joined the &ldquo;underground&rdquo; movement during the occupation and became captain of President Quezon&rsquo;s Own Guerrillas (PQOG), doing the illustrations for the guerrilla news magazine <b><i>The Liberator</i></b> (Izon 1993). He also worked for the US Office of War Information, creating the illustrations for the leaflets dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki before the fateful bombing of these two places (Izon 1993). He resumed his job as editorial cartoonist of the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> when the periodical reopened in 1946. In 1972, censorship under martial law closed down the critical <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b>. When the periodical resumed its publication in 1986 after the fall of the Marcos regime, Izon rejoined the periodical, doing the page-one editorial until his demise in the mid-1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from creating editorial cartoons, Izon served as a photographer and did some of the photo shoots for the cover of the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i> </b>(Izon 1993). He also painted portraits and landscapes and held art showsin several venues locally and in other countries. He held art shows at the Gallery Amerisia in Washington, DC, and the Galerias Internationales in Dover Delaware in 1978 (Izon 1993). He also exhibited his paintings at theManila Peninsula in 1982 and at the Hidden Treasure Gallery in 1983 (Izon 1993).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Izon&rsquo;s illustrious career spanned the prewar and postwar periods. His works accompanied the most stinging and controversial editorials of the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b>, the magazine described as &ldquo;the most uncompromising proponent of adversarial journalism in the country&rdquo; (Maranan 2007). Izon&rsquo;s visual satires were as acerbic as the written editorial they accompanied. Pointed as they were, his cartoons also had a poetic quality capable of strong symbolism and metaphor. Izon&rsquo;s style displayed a range of characteristics drawing from somber realism to hyperbolic humor. Like the works of his predecessor Jose Pereira, Izon&rsquo;s cartoons had a narrative, almost filmic quality. Unlike Pereira&rsquo;s playing up of his famous cross-hatching technique, Izon&rsquo;s works highlighted tonal gradation through smudging and shadowing.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Izon 1993; Maranan 2007.</p>\r\n"

He is the son of Sergio Dioquino Jarque and Salvacion Ta&ntilde;on Quieng. He earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts, major in advertising, in 1995 from the Technological University of the Philippines, where he also began teaching in 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jarque&rsquo;s first solo exhibition, <b><i>Unparalled</i></b>, 2001, was held at the Avellana Art Gallery. Here he first demonstrated a resolute inclination toward a constructivist strain of abstraction that can be seen in his body of works. Jarque has consistently shown carefully built-up, textured surfaces borne of impasto painting, wood, metal, and glue. Jarque&rsquo;s work suggests an ambivalent attitude toward structure where the deftly composed topmost surface still retains an unfinished or gruff texture, perhaps to serve as foil to the cold minimalist feel of his pieces. His later works suggest a readiness to move away from the flat and planar through excursions into the more definitively sculptural.<b><i> </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Unparalled</i></b> was followed by solo exhibitions mostly at the Avellana Gallery, such as <b><i>Inside Out</i></b>, 2005; <b><i>Surface Tension</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Blocks</i></b>, 2009; <b><i>No Moving Parts</i></b>, 2010; <b><i>Assymetry</i></b>, 2011; <b><i>Scratch Build</i></b>, and <b><i>Monotonic</i></b>, Blanc Gallery, 2012; <b><i>Disassemble</i></b>, 2013; and <b><i>Fill</i></b>, 2014, Finale Art File.

Manila 2 Apr 1970. Painter and intermedia artist. She is the daughter of Edilberto A. Javier and Aurora T. Guillen. She received her bachelor of science degree in nursing from the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila in 1991. She then took up painting at UP Diliman where she received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts in 1997. She was part of the collective Surrounded by Water between 1999 and 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3596\"><strong>Geraldine Javier</strong></a>&rsquo;s early works are paintings that tend to be photorealistic. Often replete with decorative elements, she creates implied textures that balance the sleek paint surface of her canvases. Her paintings for <b><i>Butterfly&rsquo;s Tongue</i></b>, 2009,<b><i> </i></b>West Gallery, feature banal subject matter, ranging from children at play, appropriations of romantic works and religious imagery, as well as floral motifs, either embedding insects or integrating embroidered figures, or both, on canvas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Javier&rsquo;s exhibition <b><i>Always Wild, Still Wild</i></b>, 2011, at Finale Art File demonstrates one of her forays into installation. Javier recreates an orchard based on personal memory, recalling a place of &ldquo;childhood wonder.&rdquo; Here, she evoked a nostalgic setting where the artist&rsquo;s figure can be found embroidered on a handmade hammock, against the backdrop of a tree mural with fibrous nests, and framed animal figures adorned with tatting lace. The pressed leaves that lend a sensual quality to her works can also be found in her prints depicting the changing seasons as well as inventive configurations of insects and skeletons. A poetic reflection on evolution and natural history, she produced these in line with her residency at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute, which culminated in the exhibition <b><i>Playing God in an Art Lab</i></b>, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist&rsquo;s solo exhibitions from 2011 to 2013 reveal a more active engagement with installation. Javier&rsquo;s alter ego, Madame A, is conjured in her later exhibitions as an important part of the narrative. Referencing sacred spaces such as museums and chapels, Javier sets up environments to showcase her penchant for painting, working with minutiae, collecting, encasing, preserving, and exhibiting. These exhibitions include <b><i>Curiosities</i></b>, 2013,<b><i> </i></b>UP Vargas Museum; <b><i>Chapel of Many Saints and Sinners</i></b>, 2012,<b><i> </i></b>Equator Art Projects Gallery, Singapore; and <b><i>Museum of Many Things</i></b>, 2011,<b><i> </i></b>Valentine Willie Fine Art, Singapore. In 2013, Javier&rsquo;s solo exhibitions include <b><i>Stuck in Reverse</i></b> at Arndt Gallery, Berlin, Germany, and <b><i>Beyond the Veil</i></b> at Arario Gallery, South Korea. She has participated in numerous group exhibitions such as <b><i>Asia Looking South</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011,<b><i> </i></b>Arndt Gallery; <b><i>Prague Biennale</i></b>, 2009, Prague, Czech Republic; and <b><i>Beacons of Archipelago</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2010, Arario Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Javier received the Thirteen Artists Award in 2003 and the Ateneo Art Award in 2004.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

Manila 12 Jan 1958. Printmaker. He is the son of Rodolfo Jocano and Aleli Catli. He married Ana Gallego. Studying fine arts at the University of the Philippines, he worked closely with his printmaking teacher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\"><strong>Virgilio Aviado</strong></a>. He has since gone full time into printmaking, and has been active in graphic arts workshops of the Philippine Association of Printmakers in the late 1980s and the Mariposa Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jocano keenly developed etching and aquatint techniques in his prints, which are characterized by fine intricate lines, gentle rhythmic movement, low tonal contrast, great variety of texture, and well-balanced design. In terms of subject matter, he has preferences for dreamlike images, pursuing the path of the surreal and the occult in Aviado&rsquo;s earlier style. He treats erotic themes in a subtle, magical way, recomposing human internal organs with botanical forms. Thus a man with an ambivalent kidney-shaped body may grow a scrotum and phallus in his chest, or ginger-like roots would sprout female breasts as in his etching <b><i>Raw Plant</i></b>, 1978. <b><i>Atlas</i></b>, 1978, also an etching and aquatint work, is drawn like a zoologically dissected human specimen juggling his own internal organs in the air. The artist also loves to create X-rayed images, combining these with circular forms that appear like magnified cells seen through a microscope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jocano has won at least three major awards for his graphic works in the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Art Competition, the highest of which was the grand prize in 1979, which included a scholarship grant for three months at the International Yoshida Hanga Academy in Japan. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

The museum is located at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in Quezon City. It was named after the politician and collector-philanthropist Jorge B. Vargas. Vargas, 1890-1980, donated his art, library, personal archives, numismatic and philatelic collections to his alma mater on 1 Mar 1978. Prior to the transfer of the collection to the university, Vargas had housed these objects in Kawilihan,<i> </i>his family compound located in Mandaluyong City. The museum officially opened on 22 Feb 1987 with President Corazon C. Aquino as guest of honor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Vargas art collection covers turning points in Philippine art and sociopolitical history, providing a survey of works from the late 19th-century Spanish colonial period, the American and Japanese occupations, the post-World War II years, until the end of the 1960s. There are over 500 artworks documented in the museum catalogue, majority of which are paintings, drawings, or prints, along with 21 pieces of sculpture.

Within the museum premises is the Vargas Archives, made up of documents, books, and other objects related to Vargas and his family (Vargasiana); Manuel L. Quezon (Quezoniana); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> (Rizaliana); Sports; Law; as well as Philippine periodicals and serials circulated during the Commonwealth period and the Japanese occupation. In 2011, the significance of the Quezon Papers was inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World, citing the Vargas Museum as one of the custodians of this documentary heritage.

Previously operating under the UP College of Fine Arts, museum programming was turned over to the UP College of Arts and Letters in 1995. Since then, Vargas Museum has been headed by a faculty-curator appointed by the dean of the college. Past and present curators include Aurora Roxas-Lim, 1989-94; Ma.

He was the son of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a> Sr and Asuncion Tanig. He graduated from the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1953 with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts and was the first magna cum laude of the UP College of Fine Arts. In 1954-55, the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica of the Spanish government awarded him a painting grant to Madrid. A year later, he finished his master&rsquo;s degree in painting under a Fulbright-Smith-Mundt grant. He also received a grant from the John D. Rockefeller III Fund and Ford Foundation to paint in New York from 1967 to 1969. He was dean of the UP College of Fine Arts, 1970-78. Joya had initially wanted to become an architect, but the mathematics and science subjects discouraged him. At UP, he was exposed to the paintings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>. Among his other early influences were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Magsaysay-Ho. His first works were mostly representational. During the late 1950s, he gradually shifted to abstract painting and became one of the leading proponents of abstract expressionism. Joya has also done paintings in ceramics, as well as sketches in pentel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held many one-person shows here and abroad starting in 1954 at the Philippine Art Gallery. He represented the Philippines with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a> in the 1964 Venice Biennial. In 1981, a retrospective of his works was held at the Museum of Philippine Art. In 2011, another retrospective titled <b><i>Joya: Balik-Tanaw</i></b> (Joya: A Retrospective) was held at the National Museum. Showing 73 art pieces, it also marked the artist&rsquo;s 80th birth anniversary and the launch of the Joya Festival 2011. In 2012, the UP College of Fine Arts presented the exhibition <b><i>Jose Joya: Scholar, Artist and Mentor</i></b>, which focused on the life of the National Artist at UP as Joya&rsquo;s academic career spanned 39 years, 1957-95, during which he was a great influence on students and faculty. In 2013, on the 10th anniversary of Joya as National Artist, an exhibition titled <b><i>Joya: A</i></b> <b><i>Modern Native</i></b> was held at the Rockwell Tent.

His work assembles, binds, or weaves together into various shapes organic materials such as dried pods, twisted roots, banana pulp, coconut shells, twigs, and coconut fiber. He makes mobiles of strong and supple vines formed into rustic garlands.

She married Rafael Ledesma with whom she has four daughters. She was born to a hacendero clan whose ancestors have been part of the historical moments of the country. She had her elementary education at Assumption Convent in Iloilo. At age 12, she entered the Philippine Women&rsquo;s College in Manila, where she was elected the class president in Grade 7 and became active in the Student Council. In her junior year in high school, she enrolled at the Escuela de Bellas Artes&mdash;later known as the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts&mdash;and had lessons there thrice a week with contemporaries such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Magsaysay-Ho and others (Laya 1994). Kalaw-Ledesma first wanted to be a painter and took up fine arts at UP, but upon the prodding of her mother switched to education afterward. During her time at the university, she was a corps sponsor of the ROTC and the Lakambini of the Nucleo Solteril, a society of professionals. She was also part of the Kahirup Club, organized by the prominent families from Iloilo, Negros, and Cebu (Laya 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite her various activities, her love for the arts did not diminish, and in 1947 she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> and became its first president. The art association began as an organization of the graduates of the UP School of Fine Arts. As more artists who were not from UP joined the meetings, the group became an open association. The AAP held shows annually, showcasing the paintings of the modernists, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3640\"><strong>Anita Magsaysay-Ho</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, and the &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; such as Simon Saulog and Cesar Lopez. The annual show also included paintings of less established artists side by side with the professionals. Then less experienced painters like Sanso got their first taste of recognition from these shows. A proponent of modern art, Kalaw-Ledesma and other artists were aware of the &ldquo;stagnation&rdquo; of Philippine art during the 1950s and tried to bridge the gap between Philippine art and its counterpart overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She wrote <b><i>Philippine Art Gallery: The Big Little Room</i></b>, 1987, and coauthored with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5347\"><strong>Amadis Ma.

They collectively painted a mural on women&rsquo;s work that toured with the Cry of Asia theater. They researched and did surveys leading them to conclude that images of Filipino women in the arts did not fairly represent women&rsquo;s views and strengths, that careers of women artists were generally protracted vis-&agrave;-vis those of their male counterparts, and that traditional art organizations depended heavily on female labor for the larger benefit of male members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1989, KASIBULAN was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He is considered the finest brass artist in Tugaya, a community by the Lanao lakeside in Lanao del Sur, Mindanao, the only place in the Philippines that has continued the art of traditional brass casting. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the oldest methods of technology, the lost wax process of brass casting involves making a prototype of the final product in beeswax and encasing it in a clay mold. When the clay-and-wax form is heated, the wax model melts away, leaving its imprint on the clay mold. Molten brass poured into the hollow clay mold fills the shape of the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; wax. The clay mold is then broken to reveal the brassware in all its glory. Although this tedious craft process can be found in other areas in the country, the Tugaya brass casters are distinguished by the excellence of their work, as shown in their elaborate Maranao <b>okir</b> (traditional Tausug and Maranao sculpture) designs and their ability to produce massive pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Laidan learned the craft in his youth when brass casting was a common skill practiced in practically every household in Tugaya. One of the few practitioners of the art left in the village, he specializes in designing intricate motifs on the surface of all brass pieces done by him and his two partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was conferred the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 1990 for &ldquo;continuing with artistry the ancient process of Maranao brass casting using traditional materials and methods.&rdquo;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosalinda Galang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

Tagudin, Ilocos Sur 24 Jul 1945. Painter. He is the youngest of five children of Eugenio Lamarroza and Iladia Leal, the youngest of five children. He took fine arts courses in both the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1963, and the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University in 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lamarroza won critical attention in the 1960s with his experimental abstracts of wide-ranging techniques. His first one-person show in 1969 consisted of works in mixedmedia, including brass sheets, molding paste, solidified polyester, and canvas. His second one-person show in 1971 was the highly innovative Frame series consisting of the frame in acrylic and molding paste enclosing an empty space. Marked by vigorous invention, Lamarroza&rsquo;s <b><i>Population Explosion</i></b> made use of small figures of children&rsquo;s heads done in modeling paste composed in a grid with a surrealist effect. This was followed by the Laoag (Light) series, which was his own version of op art in serial abstract motifs still in a grid pattern. Here he exhibited a fine control of tones to create the optical perception of light emanating from the painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1976, Lamarroza began his long <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2126\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2126\"><strong>Amburayan Queen</strong></a></strong></a> series. This draws upon his childhood in Barrio Ambalayag between the Amburayan and Chico Rivers. Complementing the central image of the regal yet ever changing Amburayan Queen are the mountain-river landscapes which introduce the ecology theme, the artist lamenting the death of the river due to mining. His landscapes developed a surrealist quality that stemmed from his rich technical resources, proffering realist passages and then deconstructing them by showing the work as the artist&rsquo;s autonomous domain into which abstract or geometric elements may be introduced at will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2010, Lamarroza had a homecoming exhibition, <b><i>The Colors of Amor Lamarroza</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>at the Beata Angelico Gallery, his first in UST, as part of <b><i>Artistang Tomasino Ako </i></b>(I Am a Tomasian Artist), a series of art exhibitions throughout the year in preparation for his alma mater&rsquo;s quadricentennial celebration. Previously, Lamarroza had exhibited his works at the National Museum, Ayala Museum, and the Metropolitan Gallery, and had touring shows in Washington, Seattle, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Jakarta under the auspices of the RP-US Development Council of Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lamarroza won the international competition with a well-disseminated work featuring grids with symbolic motifs in mixed media. He won awards in the Shell National Students Art Competition: third prize for <b><i>Blue Girl and the Butterfly</i></b>, 1965, and second prize for <b><i>Maya</i></b>, 1966. From the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines, he won second prize for <b><i>Manila &rsquo;70</i></b>, 1971, and honorable mention for <b><i>Landscape Machine</i></b>, 1974. He received the Sadiri Ti Tagudin Award in 1978. He won second prize for <b><i>Amburayan Vision</i></b> in the Mobil Art Awards in 1982.

Saint Gallen, Switzerland 22 Feb 1983. Painter and installation artist. He is the son of Walter Langenegger and Daisy Argueza. Langenegger studied fine arts at the University of the Philippines from 2004 to 2005 and was among the first batch of fine arts students of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan College in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Langenegger&rsquo;s first exhibit was a group show called <b><i>Under Construction</i></b>, 2003, curated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> at the artist-run space Big Sky Mind. For the exhibit, artists created works revolving around the idea of the city and the environs of Cubao in Quezon City. Langenegger&rsquo;s piece for the show was an installation comprised of found objects such as animal skull, bones, clothes, dried leaves, grass, and rice. This was quickly followed by successive group exhibitions in 2005 and 2006 in Manila and New York, paving the way for his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Can You See My Balls?</i></b>, 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Langenegger has often been cited for his work in painting, which merges pictorial realism with carnivalesque and pastiched elements of contemporary reality. Going beyond displays of irreverence and the grotesque, his works function as phantasmagoric fables. His works often appropriate images both Biblical and art historical and incorporate these with observations of local realities around the Philippine archipelago. Despite their eclectic subject matter, Langenegger&rsquo;s works have, over the years, returned to a notion of absurdity underlying the sublime, the beautiful, and the picturesque. The artist also employs humorous puns and wordplay to further complement his works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Langenegger has also infused new media and installation as intrinsic elements to his painting. In 2011, he transferred images on light boxes and utilized video, clay, and oil on canvas for the work <b><i>The Sun Is Warm and Life Is Easy in Quezon City and the Men as Women, and the Women as Children</i></b>,<b> </b>2012, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) Thirteen Artists awardee show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His work has been included in exhibits held in Australia, Austria, Hong Kong, Germany, Malaysia, and the USA, including group exhibitions of Philippine art held at the Goliath Visual Space, New York, 2005; <b><i>XII Filipino Contemporary Artists</i></b>, 2008, Singapore; <b><i>How&rsquo;s My Painting?</i></b>, 2009, MOP Projects Sydney; the <b><i>Bastards of Misrepresentation</i></b>, 2010, Freies Museum, Berlin; and <b><i>VOLTA 6</i></b>, 2014, Basel, Switzerland.

He is a minimalist in color, using either black or white. He is also a minimalist in the sense that his works show the influence of Zen aesthetics, which gives importance to the role of insight and creative intuition. His early works in black wood with relief elements showed an abstract and geometric orientation. In his white works he used techniques such as scratching, incising, and charring in combination with the use of found objects to convey meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lao Lianben was one of the first artists who used indigenous materials in assemblage in the 1970s. For instance, he superimposed twigs and small branches on carved and etched wooden panels. There is often a play of contrasts between free organic shapes and the geometric order of the panel design in his works. At times they subtly dwell on the ecological theme, as when the found object, a twig, is slightly charred by fire, signifying the destruction of the forests. The found object, plucked from the bosom of nature, takes on an aura of magic and ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first one-person show at the Solidaridad Galleries in 1973.

Betis, Pampanga 5 Dec 1959. Sculptor, painter. He is the son of Alfonso Layug and Rita Tadeo. He studied architecture and fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas. Growing up in a family of artists in a community known for wood carving, Layug began training in sculpture when he was eight years old. Among his mentors were Juan Castro and Pedro Datu. In pursuit of improving his skills, he researched in various parts of Europe and in 2007 trained as an apprentice under Jose Antonio Navarro Arteaga in Seville, Spain. He is the owner of Betis Galleria in Pampanga, a workshop of ecclesiastical artists working with and under Layug&rsquo;s guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Layug produces religious images, church altars, tabernacles, as well as <b>retablo</b> (altar screen with niches for saints images) and <i>carroza </i>(processional float) for major churches and private collectors in the Philippines and abroad. Aiming to digress from traditional local sculpture, Layug translates into his works what he has learned by way of his Spanish training and research on European religious art. The scale, anatomical details, vesture drapery, and chromatic palette of his images echo the realism of high European church art rather than Spanish colonial Philippine church art tradition. He achieves such realism by transforming materials using age-old finishing techniques he learned in Spain. His process starts with the making of a clay model before carving the wood, as learned from Arteaga. His finishing process involves a tedious seven-way treatment including <i>dorado</i> (gilding) and <i>estofado </i>(creation of brocade-effect). In keeping with this technique, the wood is gilded with gold or silver leaf and then painted over with different patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first major project, the restoration of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a> gate in Intramuros, came in 1981 while he was still finishing his bachelor&rsquo;s degree. After training in Spain and establishing Betis Galleria, Layug was commissioned by local and national church and state officials. His most notable works include a retablo made in honor of San Lorenzo Ruiz and San Pedro Calungsod, which he donated to the Pontifico Collegio Filippino in Rome, on the occasion of the canonization of Pedro Calungsod in 2012. Layug also made the image of Our Lady of Palo for the Leyte Mass and the Crucified Christ for Luneta Mass of Pope Francis during the latter&rsquo;s Pontifical visit to the Philippines in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Layug sees his pursuit of a career as an ecclesiastical artist as a way of giving back to the Roman Catholic faith while also supporting the advocacy to revive and sustain the art and industry of wood carving in Betis. To reach a wider audience, he collaborated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4500\"><strong>Armando Lao</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4543\"><strong>Brillante Mendoza</strong></a> in the film <b><i>Dukit</i></b> (<b><i>Carved in Wood</i></b>), 2013, which pays tribute to the wood-carving industry of Betis. Layug received the Presidential Medal of Merit for Ecclesiastical Art in 2009 and the Juan D. Nepomuceno Award for Arts and Culture from Holy Angel University in 2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Dino Carlo Santos</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Banal 2014; <i>Business <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></strong></a></i> 2013; GMA Network 2015; NCCA 2013.</p>\r\n"

Although he did not finish his art studies, his stay in the university proved to be pivotal in his artistic career as this is how he met contemporaries Mark Justiniani, Marcel Antonio, the younger <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3452\"><strong>Elmer Borlongan</strong></a>, and teacher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> to whom Lea&ntilde;o attributes the development of his curiosity and penchant for exploring methods and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Together with Justiniani, Borlongon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3547\"><strong>Karen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a></strong></a>, Lea&ntilde;o founded the artist collective Salingpusa,<i> </i>a group established in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a></strong></a> under the auspices of their main patron&mdash;the geriatrician-collector Dr Joven Cuanang. Borne from the struggles of artists who were then at incipient stages of their individual careers, the camaraderie, friendship, and artistic collaborations of Salingpusa&rsquo;s artists resulted in various projects ranging from group exhibitions to the collaborative painting of murals. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> such collaborative mural is the massive <b><i>Karnabal </i></b>(Carnival), 1992, now housed in Cuanang&rsquo;s Pinto Art Museum. This expansive art space served at various points as Lea&ntilde;o&rsquo;s home, garden, and creative laboratory for years. As de facto museum architect and landscape artist, Lea&ntilde;o continues to work on this still ongoing project which officially opened to the public in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lea&ntilde;o started out as a painter turning out both figurative and abstract pieces combining traditional pigment and industrial materials. He later displayed a heightened interest in space and keen attention to locale and topography as seen in the inherent site-specificity of his installations and the way he considers how built architecture can be made to negotiate with the intrinsic territorial qualities of the spaces within Pinto Museum. Among his exhibitions are <b><i>Drawings</i></b>, 1997, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3835\"><strong>Reggie Yuson</strong></a>, Gallery 139, and <b><i>Alay 12 </i></b>(Offering 12), 2009, Boston Gallery, while solo exhibitions include <b><i>Quiescence</i></b>, 2002, and <b><i>Anthropometrics</i></b>, 2009, Sitio Remedios. His 1988 work <b><i>U-Turn</i></b>, strikingly made up of decapitated bodies and horses whirling amidst an apocalyptic scene, won him the first prize at the Metrobank Foundation National Painting Competition. A mural titled <b><i>Supremo</i></b>, 1993, depicting animals preying on a human brain, was acquired by Fukuoka Art Museum, Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When he was selected as one the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Thirteen Artists in 1994, he created an intricate and multilayered installation for the exhibition called <b><i>Diptych: ICU</i></b>, consisting of elements like soil, tree trunks, dextrose bags, seeds, coco fiber, plastic, and aluminum. Conceptualized around the time that mall culture was still emergent, he included blown up stills of mall interiors he discretely shot while roaming one of the giant commercial edifices in Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another notable installation is <b><i>Intelligent Man Rethinkin</i></b>,<i> </i>a work he did in Fukuoka, Japan, where he facilitated a multisensory experience by constructing an enclosed space of four panels of plexiglass, within which one could hear the sound of trickling water in the background. Terra-cotta soil mounds with twigs wedged into them were strategically situated around the outside walls&rsquo; surface. Tin cans he collected around the area dotted the wall of mounds, but these were visually overpowered by the decomposing organic materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lea&ntilde;o&rsquo;s other international engagements include participation in the Osaka Triennale with <b><i>The Last Full Show</i></b>, 1993, and a residency at the Fourth Australia and Regions Artists&rsquo; Exchange: Torque in 1995 during which he was also a visiting artist at the Australian National University School of Art.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Thea C.

Lebajo</b>) b. Tacloban, Leyte 11 Sep 1941. Painter. His son Nikulas is also a painter. He took up art studies at the University of the East, 1966-67, and the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, 1967-68.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lebajo was a product of the ferment in Philippine art in the late 1960s, which was absorbed in the exploration of abstraction. Consistently inclined toward surrealism, he infused his works with images that evoke the realm of dreams or the bizarre. <b><i>Park #17</i></b>, 1971, for instance, is a composition of found objects mounted on wood. The materials consist mainly of painted metal impressed with groupings of circular bottle caps or button-like coin-sized objects with a small hole at the center. The squarish shape of the work suggests a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of a park. A secondary square within the painting, one side of which extends into a straight-edged wing, evokes a cold sensation. Inside the square could be seen eyelike objects arranged in a series. In <b><i>Crowd I</i></b>, 1979, Lebajo used the plasticity of the oil medium to create a sleek bubbly surface that is bizarre, but the orange and blue paints tone down the eerie feeling and make the piece attractive. In <b><i>Imaginary Landscape</i></b>, 1979, he fused the cold shapes of hard-edged abstraction with a surrealistic treatment of space, such that the painting acquired a depth with the shapes suggesting a mysterious dimension of reality. Lebajo created surrealistically themed works while employing a realist technique in the late 1980s. This brought him both material success and favorable criticism from galleries and collectors here and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He staged his first solo exhibition at the Solidaridad Galleries followed by another at the Luz Gallery in 1971. Lebajo has been doing individual exhibitions since 1969, mostly in Metro Manila. His other exhibitions are <b><i>The Mind&rsquo;s Eye</i></b>, 1990, Chicago Cultural Center, West Gallery, and <b><i>Mindscape</i></b>, 1987, Le Plaza Hotel, Basel, Switzerland. Since 1974, he has participated in group exhibitions in West Germany, 1977; Hong Kong, 1980; Chicago, USA, 1991; Paris and Malaysia, 1998; and Bangkok, Thailand, 2001 and 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lebajo won several awards at the Shell National Students Art Competition: second place, on-the-spot painting for <b><i>Chinese Garden</i></b>, 1967; first place for <b><i>Twice Born</i></b>, certificates of merit for <b><i>Pathways to Ajanta</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a></i></b>, and second place for <b><i>4 Squares to 2 Circles</i></b>, all in 1968.

Naga, Camarines Sur 2 Jan. Painter. He is the son of Christopher Lee and Fortunata Federizon. Creativity was abundant in the family of six children, with Lee&rsquo;s brothers carving their own mark in their respective fields. Roque Lee or &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\"><strong>Roxlee</strong></a>&rdquo; is a filmmaker recognized as a pioneer in independent film animation, who, together with his brother Mon, created <b><i>Cesar Asar</i></b>, a popular comic strip that ran in <b><i>Manila Bulletin</i></b> from 1980 to 2000. Ruben, on the other hand, was the cinematographer for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\"><strong>Lav Diaz</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1117\"><strong>Batang West Side</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>West <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a>venue</i></b>). Another member of the clan, Mon&rsquo;s son Topel Lee, ventured into independent and eventually mainstream filmmaking primarily associated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before his formal tertiary education, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3617\"><strong>Romeo Lee</strong></a> did a brief stint in vocational school where his teachers frequently asked him to draw machine parts directly on the blackboard. This, coupled with his relentless attachment to anything that allowed him to sketch at a young age, developed his acuity in drawing instinctively without guidance and formal studies. In 1984, Lee entered the College of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman and received his bachelor of fine arts in advertising (now visual communications) in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the UP College of Fine Arts, he met art contemporaries <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3765\"><strong>Soler Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3588\"><strong>Nilo Ilarde</strong></a>, and his frequent conspirator, collaborator, and often enabler, Manuel Ocampo. Their friendships revolved around art and punk music, among other things. Even running paved the way for gathering together in the Fine Arts Running Team or FART, an informal group that emerged in jest. Asserting his varied interests apart from visual art, Lee pursued other campus collaborations. A member of the UP Mountaineers, he headlined and emceed the infamous &ldquo;Elvis&rdquo; concerts for years until its last run in 2006. He was also involved in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\"><strong>Auraeus Solito</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/598\"><strong>Manhid</strong></a> </i></b>(Numb), a musical based on Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s novel <b><i>Midnight&rsquo;s Children</i></b> and <b><i>X-Men</i></b> comics. In this production, Lee performed with another UP Diliman icon, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, and members of the UP Tropa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\"><strong>Experimental</strong></a> Theater <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. Lee&rsquo;s lingering presence in the university led to his emergence as a punk icon, his reputation as master of stage mayhem, and appellation as the &ldquo;Wild Thing,&rdquo; which extended beyond his undergraduate days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a visual artist, Lee&rsquo;s roughshod aesthetic sense and pack-rat sensibility may be regarded as influential upon a succeeding generation of artists of a variably punk inclination including Manuel Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3484\"><strong>Louie Cordero</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3610\"><strong>Robert Langenegger</strong></a>. Lee was already active in several group exhibitions prior to his first one-man show <b><i>Oil-Lee</i></b> at West Gallery, 1990. His subsequent exhibitions illustrated his wit with playful puns he inscribed as show and work titles, all of which have been crafted eponymously. As a free agent, untethered to a particular gallery, Lee continues to create works for various museums, galleries, and alternative spaces in Manila. He has also shown internationally in countries such as Australia, Hong Kong, Germany, Singapore, and the USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lee&rsquo;s paintings are reflective of his endearingly eccentric and electric persona, with canvases filled with oil renderings of cheeky, humorous, and sinister visages. Aside from paintings, he has also done photography and installation work for exhibitions such as the photo assemblage-installation <b><i>Leestory</i></b>,<i> </i>1999, as well as the parodying of publicity machinery in the &ldquo;multi-media extravaganza&rdquo; (Caruncho 2003, 2) two-man reunion show with Ocampo titled <b><i>Lee Almighty</i></b>,<i> </i>2003. In the latter show hosted by Mag:net Gallery, the duo played with various platforms to carry out a provocative commentary on media chatter and the machinery that perpetuates it.<i> </i>In the solo exhibition <b><i>ArtinformaLEE</i></b>, 2014, Lee continued to assert that the tangible work on show is not the bottom line as art reverts back to the penchant for theatrics and everyday performance. Lee has also been part of other notable group exhibitions by the project cum artist collective Bastards of Misrepresentation, in multisite exhibitions in Berlin with <b><i>Doing Time in Filipino Time</i></b>, 2010, and <b><i>Bastards of Misrepresentation: New York Edition</i></b>, 2012.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Thea C.

Tondo, Manila 2 Apr 1917. d. Manila 7 Apr 1994. National Artist for visual arts. He was the son of Manuel S. Legaspi Sr and Rosario Torrente. He was married to Vitaliana Kalugdan. They have five children, one of whom, Celeste, is one of the pioneers and founders of the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit. He finished his elementary grades at Washington Elementary School, Sampaloc, Manila, in 1929, then went to Arellano High School. In 1931, he entered the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts and after a semester, switched to commercial art under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\"><strong>Irineo Miranda</strong></a>, graduating in 1936. In the same year, he worked as a staff artist of the advertising department of Elizalde &amp; Co. Inc. Legaspi pursued art studies abroad as a scholar at the Cultura Hispanica in Madrid, 1953-54. He subsequently entered the Academie Ranson in Paris. In 1968 and 1969, he was the Philippine representative to the Sao Paulo Biennial for graphic art and for painting, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Legaspi espoused the cause of modern art from its early years and nurtured it to full maturity with his fellow pioneering modernists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\"><strong>Galo B. Ocampo</strong></a>, Hernando R. Ocampo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>. Up to his death, he was the most active surviving member of the Thirteen Moderns. While his work shows the influence of cubism, the rigorous approach of cubism&rsquo;s intellectual phase in Legaspi&rsquo;s works gave way to the more harmonious aspect of cubism&rsquo;s synthetic phase. There is a facetting of figures into larger planes, which overlap and cut through space in transparent curvilinear rhythms and which achieve a richly textured orchestration of hues and tones. Except for his earlier monochromatic canvases, Legaspi&rsquo;s paintings fully release the expressive potential of color, creating a sensuous chromatic ambience with a variety of subjects from dancers and flower gardens, to dynamic street scenes. His early paintings, from the period immediately before and after World War II, reflect his personal reaction to the national trauma. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2226\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2226\"><strong>Man and Woman</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (also titled <b><i>Beggars</i></b>), 1945, is rendered in an expressionist idiom involving distortion. It shows a couple in rags amidst the skeletons of buildings which are broken like surrealist sculpture. Another important work, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2188\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2188\"><strong>Gadgets</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1947, done in two versions, reflects the increasing importance of machines in the postwar industrialization period, as well as what the artist perceived was the insidious threat of humans metamorphosing into machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Legaspi spent many years as magazine illustrator and artistic director in advertising agencies, while he took time in between his work to do paintings. In 1963, he held a one-person show at the Luz Gallery. This marked the beginning of an active phase with major pieces, such as <b><i>Chiaroscuro</i></b>, in which rocks and stone quarries become his central image and symbol, and in which structure is the predominant concern. Spatial depth is suggested by the darker tonalities of the recesses in the granite rock that half conceals organic forms, like curling fetuses, embedded within. In these and subsequent works, Legaspi strove toward an artistic language based on the integrity of shapes and figures that would convey an entire range of values, from strength to sensitivity, power to grace, dynamism to lyricism. In 1968, Legaspi finally left advertising to devote his time to painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His subsequent works significantly modified the cubist idiom by his use of rhythmic curvilinear lines and planes contrary to the angularity of the original style. From 1974 onward, his paintings became more chromatic, sometimes even effulgent with color, with layers of transparent passages creating prismatic effects. His figures dynamically cut through space in gestural movements. Light enhances color and form or dematerializes and dissolves human form into airy transparencies, creating resonances in space. The human figure, in its well-articulated muscular and structural frame, increasingly becomes an eloquent vehicle for expression, while a play of contrasts ensues between organic form and geometric structure, transparency and solidity, the flexible and the inexorable, tensions that generate the vitality of Legaspi&rsquo;s art. In 1976, Legaspi did a number of multilayered paintings on wood panel to give actual depth and shadows to the illusion of spatial movement. He also produced a large diptych with a crucified torso spanning the two panels; graffiti of the times are scattered over the wall-like background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the 1970s and 1980s, Legaspi worked on paintings that dealt with universal human experience, as seen in <b><i>The Survivor</i></b>. At this time, large heroic canvases, done in his dynamic style, convey the surging, straining movements of human beings in aspiration, struggle, and triumph. Aside from being dramatic metaphors of the human condition, these are also visual correlatives of inner moods. The artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;biota&rdquo; imagery explored organic and visceral movements beneath the surface where human beings are one with nature, woven of the same tissue as the trees. The images of struggle and nightmare transpose onto the imagery of art the emotional tensions of the everyday that seek resolution in dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1978, <b><i>Forty Years of Legaspi: A Retrospective Exhibition</i></b> was held at the Museum of Philippine Art. Ten years later, he held three simultaneous exhibits: <b><i>A Retrospective Show, 1978-88</i></b>, National Museum; a drawing exhibit, Finale Art File; and <b><i>Pamana </i></b>(Heritage), an oil painting exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, which featured his Jeepney series in which the dynamism of the imagery brought together the spatial and temporal dimensions, dream and reality, the past and the present.

Manila 1959. Painter, sculptor, and performance artist. Initially planning a medical career, he was first trained in the sciences, earning degrees in zoology and biology from the University of Santo Tomas. He shifted to the arts when he took graduate units at the College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, in 1985. He was an artist in residence at Art in General, New York, in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He is known for his provocative imagery often described as gruesome and disturbing. His oeuvre draws inspiration from across a range of sources, from the stark conditions of Philippine society to its rich visual culture. From Catholic iconography, he appropriates the grisly details of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and the martyrdom of saints. The everyday realities of violence, poverty, and corruption that are turned into spectacles in popular films, for instance, also find their way into his drawings and sculptures. Adding more layers to his corpus of works is his investigation of the human psyche, memory, sexuality, and the body, as exemplified in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2267\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2267\"><strong>Phlegm</strong></a></strong></a><b><i> </i></b>series from 2000 to 2002. The way he renders these subjects plays a key role in achieving the character of his art. Noted for meticulous treatment of details, the figuration comes off as shockingly truthful and real. His background in the sciences proves to be instrumental, allowing him to be detached from his images of violence and horror and to approach them in a clinical manner that lends them a more haunting effect. In his pastel drawings of people, for example, the minimalist appearance, muted colors, and linear clarity command attention from viewers, forcing them to confront the troubling imagery presented. At times, his drawings in pencil or charcoal resemble childlike scribbling, evoking a nightmarish character. All told, Legaspi&rsquo;s art is notable for its daring stance in exploring themes and images that would otherwise be regarded as taboo, unsightly, or discomfiting yet operating deeply in Filipino life. His works are ultimately reflective of the workings of Philippine society, especially its harsher facets, and lead us to confront the realities often swept under the rug by those with delicate &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo; and conservative values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Legaspi has exhibited widely in solo and group shows both locally and internationally.

Davao City 6 Nov 1965. Sculptor, photographer, installation artist, art educator. He is the son of Cesar Leonardo and Lorna Cua. He is married to Athenie Jill Sahagun. He was a visual arts major in the Philippine High School for the Arts in Makiling, where he graduated in 1982 and received the most outstanding visual arts student award. He earned his bachelor of fine arts, major in sculpture, in the University of the Philippines (UP), where he received the Outstanding Student Artist Award from the UP President&rsquo;s Committee on Culture and the Arts in 1986 and graduated cum laude in 1987. In 1992, he received the Monbusho Scholarship for Master Program in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a>. He graduated with a master of fine arts in sculpture and received the outstanding sculpture award at the Kyoto Seika University in 1994. He also holds a research certificate in Japanese Ceramic Aesthetics and History from the Kyoto Seika University and a certificate in Japanese culture and language studies from the Osaka University of Foreign Studies. In 2011, he received a grant from the Asian Cultural Council, which enabled his residency at Headlands Center for the Arts, California, and PointB, New York. Leonardo considers himself to be primarily an art educator, serving as a faculty member of the Philippine High School for the Arts since 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Leonardo&rsquo;s work is a fusion of organic forms, mythological stories, traditional art elements, and his own experiences as a teacher. He is known to use wire and fiberglass materials but also incorporates other materials, including found objects. His art demonstrates his fascination with the organic forms and movements that are abundant in his environment, and manifests in his use of shapes from nature, space, light, translucency, and wind-inspired kinetic elements. He takes much of his inspiration from images and his experiences in Mount Makiling, where he first resided as a student of the Philippine High School for the Arts. In the urban environment of Manila, he first began to use wires to &ldquo;draw&rdquo; figures. His first solo exhibition done as a UP student in 1986, <b><i>Studies in Wire</i></b>, was a result of this. Studying in Japan allowed him to learn additional techniques in sculpture and to incorporate aspects of Japanese culture in his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">References to other places he has lived in can also be found in his work, such as elements from traditional art forms in Mindanao, where he spent his childhood. His family&rsquo;s trips during his youth to the beaches of Davao developed his interest in boats that resulted in works like the <b><i>Balanghai</i></b>, 1997, displayed at Fort Bonifacio Global City. Inspired by the large boat used by early Malay settlers in the Philippines, the three sails of the <b><i>Balanghai</i></b> kinetic sculpture represent the country&rsquo;s three major island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The sails respond individually to shifts in wind but may also respond in unison, billowing or moving forward, when a strong wind comes along. The motif was used again for the Cinemalaya trophy beginning in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his significant commissioned artworks are the 42-foot outdoor bamboo installation <b><i>Sibol: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a> Day at CCP</i></b>, 2006, at Liwasang Kalikasan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) Complex, meant to be a bouquet of flowers for Mother Earth; a large-scale sound sculpture <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Boat</i></b>, a 400-piece sound sculpture that wails with the <i>amihan</i> or February wind, installed at the CCP front lawn for Pasinaya 2008; La Salle <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>mo</i></b> Sculpture, 2014, at the Henry Sy Building in De La Salle University; and <b><i>Elsa</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2014, a sculpture of actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a> in her role in the film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Miracle</i></b>)<b><i> </i></b>at the sand dunes of Paoay, Ilocos Norte.

Santa Cruz, Manila 26 Feb 1922. d. Quezon City 18 Mar 2016. Painter. His parents are Ricardo Leynes and Enriqueta Garcia. Leynes studied at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts. Among his teachers were FernandoAmorsolo, IrineoMiranda, Macario Peralta, Toribio Herrera, PabloAmorsolo, and VicenteAlvarezDizon. PabloAmorsolo advised him to master drawing first, after which all the rest would follow. He was on his fourth year when World War II broke out in 1941. During the war, he supported himself by carving <i>bakya</i> or wooden slippers and painting them. After the war, he first worked in a sign shop and did oil portraits. For seven years, Leynes was an illustrator and cover artist for the RamonRocesPublications where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a> also worked. While Leynes then recognized only the style of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, Manansala slowly changed his attitude and opened his eyes to modernism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a painter, Leynes first experimented in different styles, such as abstraction, expressionism, and cubism. It was in 1976 that he discovered the realist style of the American painter Andrew Wyeth. He joined a number of artists to form the group of Magic Realists, including Ger Viterbo, Jaime Roque, and Joselito Barcelona aka Jeb. In 1977, they joined a group show with other artists titled <b><i>Macrovision</i></b> at the Impressions Gallery. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the pieces that Leynes exhibited there was the painting titled <b><i>Bigas</i></b> (Rice), 1974. Because of the warm reception to the painting, Leynes realized that he had finally discovered his personal style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Leynes&rsquo;s <b><i>Balara Hills</i></b> won an honorable mention in the painting contest of the Art Association ofthePhilippines in 1951.

Manila 1 Jun 1954. Photographer. She is the daughter of Lim Cha and Agrifina Velasco. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3623\"><strong>Tita Lim</strong></a> initially started her studies in political science, then shifted to fine arts. She was in residence at the College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines (UP), for only two years in 1975-77 before the call to join the local family business pressured her to finally discontinue her studies. In 1987, she decided to go to the United States, where she pursued her bachelor in fine arts, major in photography. She completed her degree in 1990 at the Academy of Art College, San Francisco, after which she returned to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1990s, Lim had four solo exhibitions: <b><i>Perception and Other Realities</i></b>, 1991; <b><i>Altered Images</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Recent</i></b><i> <b>Photographs</b></i>, 1993; and <b><i>Women</i></b>, 1996. The works in these exhibitions consisted of a range of &ldquo;painted photographs&rdquo; and photo collages&mdash;images produced by methods other than that of a straight print. Lim would scratch, bleach, burn, or paint her negatives, sandwich positives, manipulate the camera while shooting, or &ldquo;tamper&rdquo; with paper during and after printing. She talked of these experiments with considerable relish, admitting to the surprising effects which some of these mediations created. To a considerable extent, this creative vocabulary has become a sort of trademark for her. While some may find Lim&rsquo;s photographic mediations intriguing, the imagery could be quite puzzling. In fact, many of Lim&rsquo;s works are replete with her own personal symbolisms but she is intrigued by what other people may read into them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In between these solo exhibitions, Lim also participated in several group shows of Art Manila, a conglomerate of galleries. As an artist affiliated with the Hiraya group, she was represented in the shows in 1991-92 and 1994. Art Manila&rsquo;s 1994 catalogue had Lim&rsquo;s work, <b><i>Bambina in Wonderland</i></b>, on the cover. After this spurt of creative energy in the 1990s, Lim&rsquo;s art production slowed down somewhat, as she embarked on graduate studies, teaching, and giving photography workshops. Nevertheless, she still managed to contribute works to group exhibitions which included <b><i>WOWB: Who Owns Women&rsquo;s Bodies?</i></b>,<i> </i>2000-01; <b><i>Titamarialmairma: Conversations with 19th Century Artists</i></b>, 2002; <b><i>balaybay@kasibulan.net</i></b>, 2004; and <b><i>Four Faces of Woman Dance-Exhibit</i></b>, 2006. Many of these works have a decided slant toward women and gender issues, subjects close to Lim&rsquo;s heart, though expressed in her quietly provocative visual language. As a Filipino-Chinese, Lim&rsquo;s photographs have also led her to explore issues of mixed heritage and identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an artist-photographer, Lim has generally stayed clear of commercial photography. She prefers to exhibit in small, alternative spaces, and maintains her fascinating relationship with photography through a continued exploration of the new technologies it has to offer. Apart from her creative practice, Lim has also involved herself in cultural work through Baglan Art and Culture Initiatives for Community Development.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

Legazpi, Albay 28 Jan 1920. d. San Francisco, California 15 Sep 1990. Fashion designer. Slim first developed her fashion design practice through the encouragement of her family. Her father, Don Luis Samson Lim Katiam, ran a textile and clothing business, and some of the jusi she used in her <i>ternos </i>(three-piece matching ensemble)<i> </i>was even handwoven and handspun by her mother, Margarita Navera Diaz. In 1959, Slim married Hubert Lewis Higgins, with whom she had two children, Mark and Sandra, who would later run the design school she opened with her sister Purificacion. Slim obtained her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts in 1944, major in painting, from theUniversity of Santo Tomas in Manila, where she took classes under National Artist Carlos &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a>&rdquo; Francisco. To enhance her design practice, she would pursue further studies in fashion design at the Traphagen School of Design in New York, returning to Manila in 1952. Between courses in advanced pattern making at Traphagen, her tireless search for inspiration would lead her to attend over 27 couture shows in Paris, France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1947, she opened her atelier in Malate with her sister Purificacion and her friend Consuelo Barberan. They became known for sculptural pieces through her cleverly drafted patterns and draping techniques. The shop eventually moved to Taft Ave. Slim and Purificacion established the Slim Fashion &amp; Arts School in 1960, basing their curriculum on their extensive professional experience. &ldquo;Slims,&rdquo; as it is popularly known, has since produced designers and entrepreneurs such as couturier <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3753\"><strong>Joe Salazar</strong></a> and clothing and shoe designer Cesar Gaupo. At the New York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1964, Slim costumed the<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, creating a black-and-white version of theMaria Clara, which was admired by photographer and fashion designer Sir Cecile Beaton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Slim received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Filipino Designer&rsquo;s Group in 1987. Her last collection was presented at the 1990Manila Fashion Designers Awardswhere she was also posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame. Slim received the Achievement Award at the 1997 Filipino Fashion Achievement Awards. From Nov 2009 to May 2010, a retrospective exhibition of Slim&rsquo;s body of work was held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. In May 2014, two ternos designed by Slim were acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museumin London: a white cotton silk piqu&eacute; with an asymmetrical balloon skirt and bow, adorned with raffia leaves and flowers, a piece created for First Lady Leonila Garcia in 1957; and a dove gray French silk satin gown modeled by 1956 Miss Philippines, Edith Nakpil Rabat, which appeared on the cover of <b><i>SLIM: Salvacion Lim Higgins: Philippine Haute Couture, 1947-90</i></b>,<i> </i>2009, edited by her son Mark Higgins.

Her paintings convey the closeness and warmth of mother and child, emphasizing the feminine role of nurturing the young. Thus, in her paintings she brings out the qualities of tenderness, solicitude, and maternal care. To convey these values, she uses soft lines and light warm, pastel hues for the mother and child, capturing the textures of delicate rosy skin. In outdoor setting, the sunlight is tempered and nature, including the trees, has an overall protective quality over the growing children. The warm and happy atmosphere of her paintings implies that women find fulfillment in motherhood, which has a positive self-enhancing value rather than a negative one impeding self-realization. This does not go against feminist groups who have rediscovered the positive role of nurturance for women, not only of their immediate families but of society as a whole. Veronica Lim-Yu has also derived valuable inspiration from the ordeals of her highly political family of publishers in their exile during the Marcos years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her first solo show was at the PhilippineArtGallery in 1962.

After earning her college degree, she founded the fine arts department of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University in 1950, where she taught and administered for 13 years. In 1963, she reorganized the art program of the Ateneo Grade School, eventually heading the art department until 1972. She pioneered the teaching of art through television as studio teacher in the Ateneo Educational Television from 1964 to 1968 after which she founded, together with BrendaFajardo, the Philippine Art Educator&rsquo;s Association (PAEA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">PAEA launched programs of training and seminars to introduce creative approaches to teaching art at preschool, primary, and secondary levels for public and private schools in 13 regions of the Philippines.

Hiba-iyo, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental 15 Jan 1944. Painter and performance artist. He is the son of Vicente Liongoren and Fernanda Aritcheta. He married Norma Crisologo with whom he has two children who are also artists: Erik who is a photographer, and Hannah whose practice is in illustration and design. Liongoren graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP). He received three major scholarships in college, including the JoseJoya Sr Memorial Foundation and the Purita<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w-Ledesma scholarships. He and his wife run the Liongoren Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1960s, at age 22 and still in school, Liongoren&rsquo;s work already showed experimentation with materials like burlap, rope, sand, and glue. These he incorporated into his oil paintings, most of which were done in black, white, and grey. During this period, Liongoren and his classmates began to combine abstraction and figurative forms in their paintings. Liongoren&rsquo;s work generated much attention and won many awards. But the pressure soon drove Liongoren to withdraw from the art scene for five years. He reemerged in 1971 with his new works still combining abstraction and figuration, but now with strong religious undertones, brighter colors, and more details. From the mid-1970s until the present, Liongoren has been painting what he terms as abstract landscapes, which explore the medium of paint: oil, acrylic, and watercolor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Liongoren&rsquo;s exhibitions include <b><i>Twenty Years of Philippine Art</i></b>, Luz Gallery, 1966; <b><i>Sixteen Young Artists</i></b>, Northern Motors Showroom, 1967; <b><i>Twenty Artists</i></b>, IRRI, 1967; <b><i>Thirteen Artists</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), 1972; <b><i>First CCP Annual of Paintings and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a>s</i></b>, 1976; <b><i>Museum Artists</i></b>, Museum of Philippine Art, 1979; <b><i>The Nature of Influences: CAMP Annual</i></b>, 1987; <b><i>Sikat: Two Decades of Philippine Art: 1969-89 </i></b>(Famous/Shine: Two Decades of Philippine Art: 1969-89), CCP, 1989; <b><i>Fifty Years of Philippine Abstract Painting (1949-91)</i></b>, CCP, 1991; <b><i>Bayan ni Nanding versus the Post Modern World </i></b>(Nanding&rsquo;s Town versus the Post Modern World), Manila Contemporary, 2009; and <b><i>Art after 40: New Concepts</i></b>, Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>, 2008. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most important international exhibitions he participated in was the <b><i>Philippine Contemporary Art Show</i></b>, 1975-84, in Japan, the United States, and Europe.

His protest action in a performance using ashes during public mobilizations against Malaca&ntilde;an&rsquo;s intervention in the 2009 National Artist Awards selection process continues to be one of the most poignant images of artist&rsquo;s resistance to the manipulation of validation channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Liongoren held a major comeback exhibition in 2011 at the Gallery Jose in Marikina City, where he showcased 30 watercolor paintings that delivered an apocalyptic message about the dangers of environmental degradation. In 2014, he teamed up with his firstborn son, Erik, in a fund-raising exhibit titled <b><i>Balesin on My Mind</i></b>, the proceeds of which went to rehabilitation efforts for areas ravaged by the 2013 typhoon Yolanda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Liongoren received the British Council Scholarship to the United Kingdom in 1979.

Iligan City 5 Mar 1946. Sculptor. She was earlier known as JulieLluch Dalena during the time of her marriage to DaniloDalena. She is the daughter of Pacificador Lluch and Concepcion Moneja. Her artist-daughters are the filmmaker Sari, transmedia artist Kiri, and sculptor-painter and musician Aba. Lluch finished a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy at the University of Santo Tomas in 1967. She was active in the women&rsquo;s desk of the ConcernedArtistsofthePhilippines, and she co-founded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>KASIBULAN</strong></a> or Kababaihan ng Sining at Bagong Sibol ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lluch excels in the sculptural medium of painted terra-cotta. Her first works consisted of variations of cactus forms, hearts, and buttocks which made witty comment on the relationship of the sexes. She proceeded to do portrait-busts in actual size, among the first being those of NickJoaquin and JoseGarciaVilla. <b><i>Philippine Gothic II</i></b>, 1985, is a tableau in half figures of Julie and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\"><strong>Danilo Dalena</strong></a>, and their dog. The male figure is an image of the Filipino macho, the female figure that of the harassed and long-suffering wife, who is, however, just about ready to shed her illusions of domestic bliss and rebel against conventional male-female roles. A wry note is provided by the black male dog, scratching itself with sheer animal pleasure. <b><i>SiPicassoatAko</i></b> (Picasso and I), 1985, shows Julie as housewife in extreme distress over the burnt fish on the frying pan. She is surrounded by Picasso-inspired figures: a spiky cubist dog; a harlequin doubling as her child; and her cactus sculptures, some broken into pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lluch has since then proceeded to do more sculptures with feminist themes, such as the woman contemplating herself before a mirror and becoming aware of her distinct identity, as well as mythico-symbolic figures, such as the woman shouting from within a burning house, the mermaid swimming against the strong currents, and veiled Mindanaoan women in various postures of prayer. Lluch has also done numerous half-figure portraits of men and women in a style that faithfully captures not only the subject&rsquo;s physical attributes but, more importantly, their witty and lively characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lluch won third prize for <b><i>Portrait</i></b> in the sculpture competition of the Art Association ofthe Philippines in 1979. She was a Thirteen Artists awardee of the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP) in 1990. In 1997, Lluch won the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award for sculpture from the city of Manila. In 2008, a retrospective on Lluch&rsquo;s work, <b><i>Yuta: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a>works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3629\"><strong>Julie Lluch</strong></a></i></b> was held at the CCP.

Crispin&rsquo;s greatest influence, however, was Eugenio Lopez, his grandfather, a portraitist of <i>principalia</i> (elite) families of Bulacan province.

This penchant may be observed in <b><i>Study of an</i></b> <b><i>Aeta</i></b>, 1944, in which a tribesman holding a spear is shown standing under glaring sunlight. Almost the entire surface of the man&rsquo;s body is rendered in bright tones strongly contrasting with the deep shadows in his cheekbones, neck, and ribs.

San Isidro, Nueva Ecija 25 May 1906. d. 12 Aug 1984. Painter. He was the son of Emilio Lorenzo and Bonifacia Magno. Lorenzo finished his bachelor of fine arts with honors from the University of the Philippines (UP). He also attended the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, Spain, and the Regge Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, Italy. Although trained in the academic tradition, he was one of the pioneering modernists after VictorioEdades. His first one-person show was at the Philippine Columbian in 1935. He taught at the University of Santo Tomas before World War II, and afterward headed its Department of Fine Arts for 26 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As one of the Thirteen Moderns, Lorenzo developed his own distinct artistic personality. Unlike the Neo-Realists VicenteManansala and CesarLegaspi who went into the new subject matter of postwar urban life, Lorenzo did not depart from the Amorsolo countryside. He continued to paint nipa huts in rural landscapes. The difference, however, lay in the style. Influenced by impressionism, he painted in a vigorous and spontaneous painterly style, the brushstrokes with traces of pigment lending actual texture. He worked in fresh colors&mdash;greens, oranges, and yellow&mdash;and their violent complementaries.

De Loyola was a voice major at the College of Music, University of the Philippines Extension Program, in 1996. She studied fine arts, major in painting, at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU), 1998-2001.

In <b><i>Subsisting Sustenance</i></b>, 2006, she dons the form of multiple-breasted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> goddess Mebuyan, fusing song and movement as her custom-made &ldquo;breasts&rdquo; are emptied of red paint and ripped open. In <b><i>Blemish</i></b>, 2009, she stains piles of white laundry with red, beating fabric with a stick while an audio recording calling out hundreds of names of slain Philippine activists plays in the background. This work would later be part of the exhibition <b><i>The Triumph of Philippine Art</i></b>, 2013, at the University of Southern California Fisher Museum of Art, Los Angeles.

This was followed by successive invitations to perform locally and abroad.

Manila ca 1821. d. ca 1885. Painter. His father was the watchman of Malaca&ntilde;an Palace. As a child, he used the palace watchtower&rsquo;s telescope to observe the life at Manila Bay and its environs. These impressions of childhood would surface in several of his watercolor paintings and in his <b>letras y figuras</b> (letters and figures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lozano is described by Rafael Diaz Arenas in <b><i>Memorias Istoricas</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Memories), 1850, as a &ldquo;landscape painter &hellip; a watercolorist without rival in the country.&rdquo; He also painted the capture of Balanguigui in several episodes which were displayed in the fiestas of Santa Cruz. Of these episodes, the <b><i>Martirio de Fray Pascual Iba&ntilde;ez </i></b>(Martyrdom of Fr Pascual Iba&ntilde;ez) is preserved in an engraving by Carlos Borromeo in 1851.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lozano was also the foremost practitioner of the letras y figuras, a visual art form that enjoyed patronage in the 19th century. In this genre, human figures, buildings, plants, and animals were painted and arranged to form the contours of letters spelling out the names of individuals. The capital letters of the name were cleverly formed by trimmed foliage to provide support for the human figure in various activities. The skill of the artist was seen in how naturally he could integrate the figure to form part of the letter. With each letter only a few inches high, the art of the miniaturist came into play in the finely delineated figures of great variety and the exquisite details of their costumes. The other letters of the name, often on two or three levels, were situated in a lighter background of landscapes.

Apart from their artistic value, they are a good visual documentation of Manila in the late Spanish period. Other letras y figuras by Lozano are <b><i>BalvinoMauricio</i></b>, <b><i>Francisco de Yriarte</i></b>, <b><i>Views of Manila</i></b>, and <b><i>Jose Feced y Temprado</i></b>.

Badoc, Ilocos Norte 24 Oct 1857. d. Hong Kong 7 Dec 1899. Painter. His parents were Joaquin Luna de San Pedro y Posada and Laureana Novicio y Ancheta. He had four equally famous brothers: Manuel, b. 1855, a violin virtuoso; Jose, b. 1861, a physician; Joaquin Damaso, b. 1864, governor, congressman, and senator; and Antonio, b. 1866, writer and general of the Philippine Revolutionary Army. On 7 Dec 1886, Juan married Paz Pardo de Tavera y Gorricho aka Chiching, with whom he had two children, AndresLunadeSanPedro, who became a famous architect, and Maria de la Paz who died young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Lunas transferred to Manila in 1861, enabling Juan to finish his high school at Ateneo de Manila. In 1869, he enrolled at the Escuela Nautica, where after five years of theoretical courses and practical sailing to Asian ports like Hong Kong, Amoy, Singapore, Colombo, and Batavia, he obtained the certificate of <i>piloto de altos mares tercer clase</i> (pilot of the high seas third class). While in port for six months, he took up landscape painting at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura. Eventually, he received private lessons from LorenzoGuerrero, who, perceiving his potentials, urged his parents to send him to Spain for further studies. In 1877, Juan executed <b><i>Barrio al Lado del Rio</i></b> (Village by the River) and <b><i>Vista de un Barrio con Kapok</i></b> (Barrio Scene with Kapok Trees). Toward the end of that year, he sailed for Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Luna enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San<i> </i>Fernando in Madrid. There he obtained <i>accesit</i> (outstanding) in color composition and antique studies but did not stay long. Instead he apprenticed himself with Alejo Vera, a professor of the said school, whom he accompanied to Italy in 1879 when the latter went to fulfill commissions there. Upon arriving there, Luna visited the ruins of Pompeii and Naples and made some 40 studies of excavated classical sites and objects, now in the collection of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. At this time he finished his miniature <b><i>Autoretrato a Edad 22 </i></b>(Self-Portrait at 22) on charcoal, and <b><i>Dafnis y Chloe</i></b> (Daphnis and Chloe). The latter would soon win for him a silver palette from the Centro Artistico-Literario de Manila. When Vera went back to Spain, Luna remained behind, staying with the Benlliure brothers, with whom he was to develop a loyal friendship. He stayed in Rome until spring, 1884, finishing there such pieces as <b><i>La Bella Feliz y la Esclava Ciega</i></b> (The Happy Beauty and the Blind Slave), <b><i>La Muerte de Cleopatra</i></b> (The Death of Cleopatra), and the portrait of PedroPaterno. <b><i>Cleopatra</i></b> won for him a silver medal at the Madrid Art Exposition of 1881. For this achievement, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a> de Manila granted him a four-year scholarship upon the recommendation of Francisco de Paula Rodoreda. In 1883, he started painting the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, which won for him a gold medal at the Madrid Art Exposition the following year. A colossal multifigure scene depicting dead gladiators being mourned by their relatives at the basement of the Roman Colosseum, the <b><i>Spoliarium</i></b> was identified by JoseRizal as an allusion to the exploitation of the Philippines by Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Luna transferred to Paris in Oct 1884 but he shuttled back and forth to Madrid as his works, particularly portraits, were now in demand. His presence was also needed by fellow Filipinos who were pushing for reforms in the Philippine colony from the Madrid government. In 1885, he executed <b><i>ElPacto deSangre</i></b> (Blood Compact) and <b><i>Miguel Lopez de Legaspi</i></b>, pieces sent to Manila in return for his aforementioned scholarship. He also started <b><i>La Batalla de Lepanto</i></b> (The Battle of Lepanto), commissioned by the Spanish Senate upon the influence of King Alfonso XII to be hung beside <b><i>La Rendicion de Granada </i></b>(The Surrender of Granada) by 1878 grand prize winner Francisco Pradilla Ortiz. By this gesture, the king hoped to compensate Luna who was not given the grand prize for <b><i>Spoliarium</i></b>. Although public sentiment felt he deserved the award, it was withheld from him by a biased jury. In 1886, Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>Damas Romanas </i></b>(Roman Ladies) won a diploma of honor at the Munich Salon, and in 1887 his <b><i>Mestiza en su Tocador</i></b> (Mestiza Lady at Her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><strong>Dress</strong></a>er) won a similar award at the Exposicion General de las Islas Filipinas (General Exposition of the Philippine Islands). In November of the same year, the Queen Regent Maria Cristina unveiled both Luna&rsquo;s and Pradilla&rsquo;s paintings at the Madrid Senate where both are still hanging. From 1884 to 1890, Luna also executed city scenes like <b><i>En el Palco</i></b> (At the Theater Box), 1884; [<b><i>Street Flower Vendors</i></b>], 1885, which captured part of the funeral cortege of Victor Hugo; many views of villages and beaches in Normandy; and several portraits of himself, his wife, and children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nurtured in the academic classical canons then prevalent all over the Western world, Luna followed the conventional steps in attaining professional success, such as obtaining prizes with colossal Graeco-Roman canvases in the grand Classico-Romantic manner at the prestigious art salons of Europe. By 26 May 1889, however, in his letter to Javier Gomez de la Serna, he avowed his disillusionment with the historical canvas thus: &ldquo;all historical painting is false starting with the very concept, and those who think that correct drawing, good composition, brilliant coloring and a lot of adornment are enough to make it valid are mistaken.&rdquo; This statement, however, does not signify Luna&rsquo;s break with the academic tradition nor his sympathy with impressionism, as many critics earlier presumed, but rather his leaning toward the more progressive faction of the Salon&mdash;&ldquo;the dissident [one]&rdquo; that he described on 5 May 1890 to Rizal. Luna first signaled this involvement with <b><i>Le Chifonier</i></b> (The Ragpicker), showing an old man in tattered clothes carrying a basket of rags, which he showed at the Champs-de-Mars in 1889. By 1891, he was reading <b><i>Le Socialisme Contemporain</i></b> (Contemporary Socialism) by E. de Lavelaye and through this concern, he attained the highest honors he was ever to achieve&mdash;namely, his acceptance as member of the Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts. This entitled him to exhibit as many as 10 pictures at the Champs-de-Mars without going through the jury. He gained this acceptance through the merits of <b><i>Les Ignores </i></b>(also known as <b><i>Heroes Anonimos </i></b>or<b><i> Los Desherados</i></b> in Spanish and <b><i>Poor Man&rsquo;s Burial </i></b>in English), which he showed at the Champs-de-Mars in that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1892, Luna finished <b><i>Parisian Life</i></b> and <b><i>Peuple et Rois</i></b> (People and Kings), which he intended to send to the Chicago Universal Exposition of that year. However a tragedy aborted his plans. On 22 Sep 1892, he shot his wife and mother-in-law. Acquitted by the French court on 3 Feb 1893, Luna left Paris for Madrid with his son Luling. On 12 Jul, he moved to Portugalete, Bilbao, where he executed two worker themes, <b><i>La Colada </i></b>(The Strainer) and <b><i>Interior de los Talleres del Acero Robert</i></b> (Interior of the Robert Steel Foundry). In May 1894, after an odyssey of 17 years, Juan returned to Manila with his son and his brother Antonio. In the summer of 1896, he went to Japan with his student GastonO&rsquo;Farrel. Juan did as many as 20 paintings in Japan. In Aug 1896, he was arrested together with his brothers by the Spanish constabulary for complicity in the Katipunan rebellion. Cleared eventually, he left for Spain to work for the pardon of his brother Antonio. During his homecoming period, he painted many portraits such as <b><i>Gobernador General Ramon Blanco</i></b>, <b><i>LaBulaque&ntilde;a</i></b>, those of his parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, and nieces. He painted landscapes like Taal Volcano, Marikina, etc, and genre scenes like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2303\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2303\"><strong>Tampuhan</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Lover&rsquo;s Quarrel). Back in Spain, he received news of the overthrow of the Spanish rule in the Philippines. Upon the establishment of the Philippine Republic, he was appointed diplomatic agent of the Hong Kong Junta and later a member of the diplomatic missions to Paris and the United States to work for the recognition of the new government in those countries. Luna died in Hong Kong on his way back to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Publications on the life and works of Luna include <b><i>Luna</i></b>, 1975, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r Cruz; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>: The Filipino as Painter</i></b>, 1980, by Santiago Pilar; <b><i>Juan Luna Drawings: The Paris <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a></i></b>, 1998, written by Jun Terra based on the collection of Dr Eleuterio M.

Manila 29 Nov 1926. National Artist for visual arts. He is the son of Valeriano K. Luz and Rosario Dimayuga, an interior designer of Lipa, Batangas. He is married to Teresita Ojeda. They have four children. He finished a three-year certificate course in art at the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1949. Later, he continued his studies at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, and at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris. After coming back to the Philippines, he became president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> in 1952. Among the other positions he held were executive director, Design Center of the Philippines, 1973-87; director, Metropolitan Museum of Manila, 1976-86; and director, Museum of Philippine Art, 1977-85.

This is evident in his geometrized and elongated treatment of figures, as in <b><i>Candle Vendors</i></b>, 1952, and <b><i>Street Musicians</i></b>, 1951. In his works between 1957 and 1964, such as his Carnival series and Cyclist series, Paul Klee&rsquo;s influence becomes more evident. In his more linear paintings, he has been compared to American painter Frank Stella. He also did explorations into burlap collage, its expressive qualities dependent on texture, tonal play, color contrasts, and composition. Between 1966 and 1970, he did large-scale sculptures in various media: marble, wood, and metal. Some of his huge abstract sculptures may be found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), the Philippine International Convention Center, and the Philippine Plaza Hotel.

In the mid-1970s, he experimented by merging representation with expressionistic gestures using a brush. He painted realistic genre scenes highlighted by layers of color applied in straight bands that evoke the rhythm of linear patterns created by the contours of the Banaue rice terraces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Madarang won first prize in painting at the Marian Year Art Contest of 1958.

She moved to Canada in 1982 and studied at the Banff Centre in Alberta, and later pursued her master of fine arts at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her major works in the 1980s deal with the theme of political violence. In these works, she pays tribute to the victims whose lives were lost due to their political beliefs, even as the artist herself confronts her own fear, having witnessed such circumstances. She evokes the harrowing experiences of killings, torture, and disappearances through the use of texts and by juxtaposing disturbing images of mutilated bodies and body parts with a range of objects, such as flowers, leaves, candles, bedsheets, frames, and windows. Included in this series are <b><i>Poem without a Country</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Suspended Voices</i></b>, 1987; and <b><i>The Heart Is Stronger Than the Hand</i></b>, 1989. <b><i>The Dark Depths</i></b>, 1986, an installation consisting of electrical cables, broken glass, and black tar paper with written comments on torture victims, bagged the Biennale Prize in the second Havana Biennale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another thread running through Maestro&rsquo;s works is the interrogation of the idea of space, how it is occupied and how it affects people. Inspired by philosophic traditions, this inquiry has opened her creative exploration to a multitude of concepts associated with the notion of space, such as emptiness, silence, absence, a sense of belonging, inclusion, and the home. Notable in this trajectory is the large-scale installation <b><i>Je Suis Toi</i></b> (I Am You), 2006, at the 11th-century Romanesque church of Saint Nicolas in Caen, France, where she creates an environment by filling the church with benches constructed from scraps of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3639\"><strong>Lani Maestro</strong></a> represents a transnational consciousness informed by her life as a migrant Filipino artist living in Canada and later France, and working across the globe. Her art practice resonates with a sensibility that took root in the Philippines and is inflected by her constant mobility in the international art scene while still keeping ties with her roots. This movement across space has allowed her to produce works that communicate universal human experiences localized in different contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She has been active internationally, exhibiting in numerous venues, and has represented both the Philippines and Canada in biennales and triennales worldwide. Among these are the Canadian Biennial of Contemporary Art, 1989; the fifth International Istanbul Biennale, 1997; the third Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, 1999, Brisbane; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a></strong></a> Biennial, 2000; Busan Biennial, 2004; and the Sharaj Biennial, 2008. Some of her solo shows are <b><i>Perspectives</i></b>, 1993, in Toronto; <b><i>Cradle</i></b>, 1996, in Buffalo and New York; <b><i>To Dream Sleep</i></b>, 1998, in Paris; <b><i>Quiet Rooms</i></b>, 2001, in Montreal; and <b><i>Her Rain</i></b>, 2011, in Winnipeg and Vancouver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 1978 and the Hnatyshyn Foundation Visual Arts Award in 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a> and Ryan Franics Reyes</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Hnatyshyn Foundation 2014; Je Suis Toi 2006.</p>\r\n"

Manila 25 May 1914. d. 5 May 2012. Painter. She is the daughter of Ambrosio Magsaysay and Amalia Corpus. She is married to Robert Ho. She studied at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts under Fabian de la Rosa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3739\"><strong>Vicente Rivera</strong></a> y Mir, and Fernando and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3397\"><strong>Pablo Amorsolo</strong></a>. She also studied at the School of Design under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> and Enrique Ruiz. From there, she proceeded to the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. While in the United States, she affiliated with the Art Students League in New York where she took courses in oil painting, graphics, and figure sketching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early 1940s, Magsaysay-Ho&rsquo;s works showed the influence of Amorsolo in choice of subject and in treatment of light and color. However, her works had very modernist tendencies, such as the use of expressive distortion and concern for design and rhythm. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\"><strong>Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</strong></a> did much to situate Magsaysay-Ho&rsquo;s art in the modernist movement of the 1950s. The original Neo-Realists expanded to the PAG group, which included Lydia Arguilla, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3752\"><strong>Nena Saguil</strong></a>, and Magsaysay-Ho as its women artists. In her paintings of the PAG period, which had as subjects women harvesting fruits, gathering sheaves of grain, or selling fish in the market in their baro&rsquo;t saya<i> </i>and bandanna, Magsaysay-Ho emphasized movement and bustling interaction by means of bold, vigorous brushstrokes, and strong tonal contrasts of light and dark. In the 1960s, she opened up her compositional space and allowed a more leisurely disposition of her women figures which became clearly articulated and separate, the better to bring out the relationship of their movements and serial rhythms. In these later works, the lines tended to soften with a more consistent modeling, the light and dark tones creating a more harmonious and mellifluous effect hinting choreographic grace. The style developed into paintings with movement and greater interaction among the figures. Her work of the 1970s showed the artist exploring a new style influenced by Chinese calligraphy, and a secondary quasi-writer atmosphere. While her subjects were still the same native women, she randomly spattered her canvases with delicately controlled ink blots, which suggested rock formations, vegetation, or waves in the sea. Her concern had evidently become purely formal: balancing the interest and variety of the human gestures and movements with the dynamic and assertive power of the ink blots. A distinct period in the mid-to-late 1980s may be called her Green <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a> after its predominant coloration. The predominant green is the hue of leaves, fruit, and vegetables; the women figures themselves share this quality symbolically as they themselves become like plants and fruit in nature. By this time, the physical type of her sisterhood is clearly defined through the oval face with high cheekbones, narrow eyes, and brows softly curving up to the temples. In the late 1980s, Magsaysay-Ho began to paint large half-figures. She filled the pictorial field entirely with female figures surrounded by baskets, fruits, or tame birds hopping around them. In place of spontaneity and lightness, which characterized her earlier period, her figures and forms acquired a solidarity of mass rendered in a highly refined manner. Her colors became very Asian, using stark contrasts such as burnt sienna and yellow greens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2001, she had an exhibit at the Crucible Gallery, and one of her works featured an interaction of three artists: herself, Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>.

Paco, Manila 17 Apr 1954. Painter, illustrator, multimedia artist. He is the youngest of nine children of Martin Magtibay and Maria Benavidez. He is married to Bernadette Lagasca. His mother was a <i>modista </i>(dressmaker) who painted in textile in the 1950s. He earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in political science at the Baguio Colleges Foundation, then went on to take architectural drafting in the same school. He took units in anthropology and enrolled in painting and drawing workshops at the University of the Philippines, then pursued further art lessons at the Oomoto School of Traditional Japanese Art and at the Royal Art Academy in London, England. He also explored printmaking, handmade-paper making, book art, installation and performance art, and woodworking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While still in school, Willie was a volunteer art teacher for the Christian Children&rsquo;s Fund in the Good Shepherd Sister&rsquo;s Convent at Baguio City. He found early employment as illustrator for the local publication <b><i>The Northern Edition</i></b>, hand drawing the covers of this magazine and providing illustrations to the stories about the people and the culture of the Cordilleras.<b><i> </i></b>From 1981 to 1983 he was in the art department of Brent International School in Baguio City, performing various duties such as artist in residence, academic head for art studies, and art coordinator. He taught art at the Yokohama International School in Japan in 1983-85 and at the Manila Waldorf School in Quezon City in 2007-9. In 1986, he was a photographer for the <b><i>Cordillera News Agency</i></b>. In 1987, Magtibay was part of the group of artists who founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a>. He participated in many shows with this group from 1987 to 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Magtibay&rsquo;s art is shaped by a common thread of fellow artists of his generation like Santi Bose, Ben Cabrera, Pandy Aviado, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>. They strived to go against the grain of classical Western artistic practices and search for the Filipino in art. Willie did this through an exploration of found objects and the use of indigenous materials. He delved into Philippine cultural traditions to make use of native symbolisms as elements in his art. An example is his mixed media work <b><i>The Portrait of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1241\"><strong>Mumbaki</strong></a></i></b>. A geometrically designed Itneg blanket is the base of this mixed-media assemblage where beads and a miniature rice god amulet are included as elements in the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the spirit of the true mixed media artist, Magtibay is exploring spirituality and symbolism through a new medium: digital art. His works show skill in color and composition. He juxtaposes old pen-and-ink illustrations and photographs with found images from the Internet. He turns some of these into assemblages with wood, digital art printouts, and other objects. Just as he started doing art by going to the mountains and drawing what he saw of Cordillera culture with the only goal of &ldquo;drawing like Durer,&rdquo; so he is tackling this medium of the Internet for the sake of doing the best art he can&mdash;without the end-goal of exhibits, without sponsors or collectors, without an audience except the ones in his online artists&rsquo; group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He had his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Cycle of Life</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) in 1991. He received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 1992 and represented the Philippines in the 4th Havana Biennale in Cuba on the same year. He went to the South East Asia Art Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, as a Philippine representative in 1993 and at the Artists&rsquo; Regional Exchange ARX 4 residency program in Perth, Australia, from 22 Feb to 29 Mar 1994, where he was named Outstanding Asian Artist in the Perth Institute of Contemporary Art and the Northern Territory Gallery in Darwin.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Kelly P.

The term &ldquo;Malaca&ntilde;ang&rdquo; emerged when journalists in the 1950s heard and spelled it as such and the populist president Ramon Magsaysay adopted it during his term. Today, its stewards use the term Malaca&ntilde;ang when referring to the executive seat of power, offices, and complex, and Malaca&ntilde;an when referring to the palace. To describe the palace&rsquo;s use of space and its collections of art and furnishings is to reflect on each administration&rsquo;s notion of its role in the state. No one list covers these collections, but written and oral memoirs, archival photographs, and documents help fill the lacunae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spanish gave the name Malaca&ntilde;an to the idyllic district by the Pasig where in 1654 the government purchased a country estate for use by the governors-general and captains-general. After the 1863 earthquake destroyed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\"><strong>Palacio</strong></a> del Gobernador in Intramuros, Malaca&ntilde;an became their principal residence up to 1898. After a series of natural disasters and over two centuries of neglect, reconstruction work began in 1883. Photographs from that period show a settled grandeur and dignity: high-ceilinged Victorian-Edwardian halls, formal dining and salon furniture in local hardwood and rattan <b>solihiya</b> (woven wicker/rattan), gilded mirrors, and iron and glass chandeliers. Balconies looking onto the Pasig had wicker furniture interspersed with potted and hanging plants. A carved 1877 couch bearing Spanish arms remains one of the oldest pieces in the palace today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Royal Order of 29 Jun 1845 mandated that portraits of all captains-general and governors-general be displayed in the palace (Montero y Vidal 1895, in Quezon et al. 2005, 47). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>&rsquo;s portrait of Fernando Primo de Rivera, 1880-83, and F&eacute;lix Resurrecci&oacute;n Hidalgo&rsquo;s commissioned painting of Gomez Perez de Dasmari&ntilde;as, 1590-93, survived and are now in the National Museum. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> continued the tradition, and his portraits of Francis Burton Harrison, 1913-21, and Frank Murphy, 1913-21, the latter the 11th and last American governor-general, are likewise in the museum. Amorsolo&rsquo;s later portraits of Philippine presidents are on display in Malaca&ntilde;an&rsquo;s Reception Hall, as is Luna&rsquo;s magnificent <b><i>Pacto de Sangre</i></b> (Blood Compact), 1886, which is at the end of the hall, at the top of the main staircase where Governor-General Harrison had installed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The prewar Commonwealth period under Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osme&ntilde;a (1935-42) saw Malaca&ntilde;an swiftly fill with people, politics, and parties. Crates from Quezon&rsquo;s 1937 European tour included three massive Czechoslovakian crystal chandeliers for the Reception Hall. Also for this room were a carved barrel vault and panels by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\"><strong>Isabelo Tampinco</strong></a> and a magnificent table built by prisoners who were later pardoned in gratitude for their fine craftsmanship. These renovations symbolized Quezon&rsquo;s authority and triumph over enormous resistance to independence. In stark contrast was the subdued takeover by Jose P. Laurel, president of the Second Republic under the Japanese, 1942-45. Mrs Laurel refused to move into what she considered the Quezon residence. Executive Secretary Jorge B. Vargas notably expanded the collection then by commissioning Amorsolo to paint <b><i>Muslim <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/202\"><strong>Vinta</strong></a></i></b>, undated, and by purchasing Miguel AranquiznaZaragoza&rsquo;s <b><i>The Violinist</i></b>, undated, and Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>Una Bulaque&ntilde;a</i></b>, 1895, the latter work since given over to the National Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With reparation funds poured into public works, the Third Republic under Manuel Roxas, 1946-48, saw few additions to the palace. It was under Elpidio Quirino, 1948-53, that Malaca&ntilde;an underwent its first postwar refurbishment. In Castilian Filipino style, his administration replaced the Victorian upholstery and wallpaper, stored tapestries, and purchased new drapery, beds, a piano, a harp, an Aubusson carpet, and Louis XVI-style furniture. For the Council of State Room, Tampinco carved another table. Ramon Magsaysay, 1953-57, man of the masses, brought in people rather than furnishings to Malaca&ntilde;an. Over 80,000 people took up his invitation to visit in one day. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong></a>, 1957-61, returned Malaca&ntilde;an to its previous formality. Living simply, the billiard and chess room was his modest legacy. In tandem with Diosdado Macapagal&rsquo;s anti-corruption new era years, 1961-65, Mrs Macapagal denounced what a staff member described as outright thievery: &ldquo;Servants had been helping themselves to the silver, china, and had stripped the residence of everything movable.&hellip; Every evening they left for home carrying cases and even crates of goods belonging to the Palace&rdquo; (Quezon et al. 2005, 245). The First Lady also brought in from the Luneta (today Rizal Park) and the 1950s Manila World&rsquo;s Fair Francesco Riccardo Monti&rsquo;s <b><i>Four Freedoms </i></b>and adorned Heroes Hall with busts commissioned from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a> of national heroes Rajah <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1763\"><strong>Lakandula</strong></a>, Gabriel Silang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>, Marcelo del Pilar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a>, Emilio Aguinaldo, Manuel Quezon, and Jose Abad Santos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ferdinand E. Marcos, 1965-86, ordered the complete demolition of Malaca&ntilde;an complex in 1979 (Lico 2003, 40). Much of the furniture and architectural embellishments of previous administrations would disappear, like the Tampinco panels and the Commonwealth-era stained glass doors and sky light. Heavily fortified, Malaca&ntilde;an Palace doubled in floor space from 5,653 sq m in 1965 to 11,510 sq m in 1978. Under martial law, 1972-86, state-sanctioned art and state-funded architecture combined to produce a site governed by indigenized and cosmopolitan aesthetics. An iconic symbol of this period was the renovated Ceremonial (now Rizal) Hall&mdash;rendered bulletproof and missile-proof&mdash;featuring two gilded thrones under an embroidered presidential seal and enormous Rococo-style wooden chandeliers carved by artisans from Betis, Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Corazon C. Aquino, 1986-92, consciously rejected all links with the previous regime, choosing instead to live in the Arlegui Mansion and work in the Premier Guesthouse. A two-volume photo inventory of Palace contents that Mrs Marcos commissioned for its 1979 re-inauguration helped the Cory administration conduct their own inventory of the Palace collections. Much of the furniture listed in storage&mdash;formal chairs, tapestries, drapes, side tables, urns&mdash;had vanished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Succeeding administrations Fidel V. Ramos, 1992-98, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, 1998-2001, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 2001-10, and Benigno S. Aquino III, 2010-16 would each have their own policy regarding their residency in the Malaca&ntilde;an. A major renovation was conducted during the Estrada administration, installing the largest of the three Czech chandeliers that Quezon purchased in 1937 in the lobby. Designer Chito Antonio added to this repurposed furniture, gilded mirrors, and Italian antiques from the nearby Goldberg Mansion and to the palace, the wall-papered interiors, bleached wood paneling, and stuffed modern couches, introducing the luxurious comfort of a boutique hotel. Renamed Bonifacio Hall, this space today houses official meeting rooms, state guest suites, and office space for senior officials. Malaca&ntilde;an, after nearly three decades of transformation from &ldquo;regal residence to the residence of a periodically-changing, democratically-selected chief executive,&rdquo; is considered a symbol of the legitimacy and authority of the president of the Philippines (Quezon et al. 2005, 305). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Lico 2003; Montero y Vidal 1998; Quezon et al. 2005.</p>\r\n"

Santa Cruz, Manila 20 Jan 1928. d. 10 Jun 2017. Painter. He was the son of Dan Santos and Juliana Malang. He married Mary San Pedro. They have four children, two of whom are painters&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3766\"><strong>Steve Santos</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3765\"><strong>Soler Santos</strong></a>. At the age of 10, he studied drawing under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3454\"><strong>Teodoro Buenaventura</strong></a>. When he was 19, he decided to stop schooling and join the staff of the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b> art department under noted cartoonist Liborio (Gat) Gatbonton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, <b><i>This Week</i></b> magazine had a column called Legal Info that explained the Philippine legal system, and it was complemented by Malang&rsquo;s humorous sketches. In 1956, he also drew for a pictorial feature called &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Law&rdquo; for the same magazine. Malang made some cartoons and illustration strips from 1947 to 1967 including <b><i>Labuyo</i></b> (Chili), a serial published in Sinagtala, 1947. He also established <b><i>Bituin <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><strong>Komiks</strong></a></i></b>. Malang created the daily comic strip <b><i>Kosme the Cop</i></b>, which first appeared in <b><i>This Week</i></b>. This was a weekly cartoon that showed &ldquo;the exploits of a high strung policeman as he patrolled his beat.&rdquo; Later, Kosme retired as a cop and became known as <b><i>Kosme the Cop (Retired)</i></b>, which was about &ldquo;the henpecked husband who gets into all kinds of scrapes.&rdquo; Kosme moved to the <b><i>Chronicle</i></b>, the first Filipino cartoon character in a daily English strip. Malang also launched <b><i>Chain Gang Charlie</i></b>, &ldquo;the convict who has a thousand and one uses for his ball and chain&rdquo; and <b><i>Beelzebub</i></b>, &ldquo;the devil whose tail is an indispensable accessory&rdquo; for <b><i>Pageant Magazine</i></b>. His other characters include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4772\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\"><strong>Bentot</strong></a></strong></a> and Osboy. In 1955, Malang, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3568\"><strong>Liborio Gatbonton</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\"><strong>Larry Alcala</strong></a>, Hugo Yonzon, and Elmer Abustan, opened Bughouse, the country&rsquo;s first cartoon gallery but it closed down after a year despite positive public feedback. Gat and Malang also launched a comic book also named <b><i>Bughouse</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His editorial cartoons for the <b><i>Weekly Graphic</i></b> reflected his visual commentaries on the social ills of Philippine society&mdash;government corruption, crime, unemployment, police abuse, and incompetent politicians. A series that came out in the <b><i>Weekly Graphic</i></b> is called <b><i>Malang&rsquo;s Menagerie</i></b>, one big picture, a montage of &ldquo;sight-gags&rdquo; or uncaptioned jokes that Malang called &ldquo;village-scapes&rdquo; that were set in a barrio or in the city, a graduation event, New Year&rsquo;s Eve, a neighborhood&mdash;in a tableau of scenes that tells an amusing story. Journalist Armando Malay suggested that Malang adopt a single moniker, and use his mother&rsquo;s surname to sign his cartoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1960s, he decided to become a full-time painter, after a two-decade career as a cartoonist and editorial artist. Among his works is <b><i>Barrio Fiesta</i></b>, an oil on canvas commissioned in 1958 by the Ayala Corporation for the FGU-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\"><strong>Insular Life Building</strong></a>. His first one-man show at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\"><strong>Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</strong></a> was sold out, followed by many more successful solo exhibitions. He is acknowledged as a master colorist, and he has received acclaim for his Barung-Barong (shanty) series, floral abstractions, scarred landscapes, and his signature women vendors. He is a senior member and former head of the Saturday Group of artists. In 1966, together with other prominent painters, Malang launched the project &ldquo;Art for the Masses,&rdquo; which allowed art, through reasonably priced prints, to be made available to a wider audience. In 1972, Malang studied at the Otis Art Institute under a special grant. Two books have been published on his work, <b><i>Malang: Paintings and Drawings</i></b>, 1981, and <b><i>Malang&rsquo;s</i></b><i> <b>Women: Thirty Years of Art</b></i>, 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Malang&rsquo;s solo exhibitions include <b><i>Malang&rsquo;s Women II</i></b>, 1984; <b><i>In the Beginning</i></b>, 1991; <b><i>Women: 30 Years of Art</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Malang at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></a></i></b><i> <b>6750</b></i>,<i> </i>1993; <b><i>Malang Gouache and</i> <i>Prints</i></b>,<i> </i>1993; <b><i>Drawing</i></b>, 1994; <b><i>Women Vendors</i></b>, 1995;<b> <i>Landscape</i></b>,<i> </i>1995; <b><i>Women</i></b>,<b> </b>1996; <b><i>Malang: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a></i></b>, 1997; <b><i>Malang: 50&rsquo;s to the 90&rsquo;s Retrospective</i></b>, Metropolitan Museum, 1997; <b><i>A New Phase for Malang</i></b>, 1998; <b><i>Malang Celebrating</i> <i>Seventy</i></b>,<i> </i>1998; <b><i>Colored</i></b><i> <b>Drawings</b></i>,<b> </b>1999; <b><i>Small Works</i></b>, 1999; <b><i>Recent Works</i></b>, 1999; <b><i>April Show</i></b>, 2000; and <b><i>Malang Celebrates the 21st Century</i></b>, 2000. In Mar 2007, he had an exhibit titled <b><i>The Forgotten Malang</i></b>, which showcased a wealth of comic strips, cartoon characters, and drawings. Another exhibit in 2009, <b><i>Malang Drawings</i></b>, was a collection of some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> drawings in pen-and-ink, watercolor, gouache, acrylic, charcoal, and crayon shown in celebration of the artist&rsquo;s 81st birthday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1957, Malang was included in the list of &ldquo;Twelve Artists in the Philippines&mdash;Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo; put together by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3414\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Lyd Arguilla</strong></a></strong></a>, founder of the PAG. The following year, he received the Award for Editorial Design from the Art Directors Guild of the Philippines. He consistently won in the competitions held by the Society of Philippine Illustrators and Cartoonists, which named him Artist of the Year in 1964. Malang won awards in the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Art Competitions: second prize, <b><i>Street Fight</i></b>, 1951; third prize, <b><i>Traffic</i></b>, 1953; honorable mention, <b><i>The Yellow Sky</i></b>, 1959; second prize, <b><i>Quarter Moon</i></b>; and an honorable mention for <b><i>Gate to Intramuros</i></b>, 1963.

Bulacan, Bulacan 13 Jun 1821. d. Tondo, Manila ca 1886. Painter. He was the son of AntonioMalantic <i>el</i> <i>mayor</i> (the elder) and Maria Pascual. This information was based on the discovery at the Archdiocesan Archives of Manila of Malantic&rsquo;s application for marriage license in order to marry his third cousin Josefa Nicandro. The artist was in his early 20s when the Academia de Dibujo resumed operation in 1845 and he might have studied there. Prior to the arrival of Agustin Saez, the teachers of the school were Enrique Nieto y Zamora, Ventura del Arco, Luis Perez Domine, Nicolas Enrile, Jose Bosch, and Manuel de la Cortina, from whom Malantic could have learned his techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Malantic was a miniaturist&mdash;that is, he achieved realistic representation by rendering every particular aspect of an object fastidiously with every brushwork finely applied and concealed. This is evident in his portraits where all details of dress such as delicate embroidery designs, as well as appurtenances attesting to the prestige of his sitters, have been limned meticulously. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the most refined portraitists in the 19th century, Malantic is only known today from four signed works&mdash;namely, the portraits <b><i>Don Narcisco Padilla y su nieto Felix</i></b> (Don Narciso and His Grandson Felix), 1859; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Francia </i></b>and <b><i>InocenciaFrancia</i></b>, 1870; and <b><i>La Divina Pastora</i></b> (The Divine Shepherdess), 1855, the last being a religious painting. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Bautista, Pangasinan 25 Nov 1911; d. Quezon City 17 Sep 1984. Painter, muralist, illustrator. He is the third child of Sotero Manalad and Alejandra Yabot. He studied fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1930-32 and was a contemporary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> and Vicente S. Manansala. He then worked as an illustrator for <b><i>The Herald</i></b>, and partnered with his brother Wagas Manalad as production manager at the Philippine Advertising <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, where he would work on and off from 1935 until his resignation in 1967. Starting in 1947, he was also employed as chief illustrator at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\"><strong>Ramon Roces Publications</strong></a>. He also worked briefly for Advertising Associates as chief artist. He became a co-founder of the Bulacan-based Lakan Sining group of artists in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although educated in the then prevailing conservative style at UP, Manalad nonetheless utilized a modern style in composing and rendering his subjects, which were primarily focused on historical and mythological scenes culled from Philippine literary texts. Manalad was a key member of a Filipino muralist movement that started in the late 1930s. He was an assistant for mural projects under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> and Enrique Ruiz. The demand for murals from the private sector peaked in 1945-46 and for government-commissioned murals during the martial law period in 1974-76. Manalad&rsquo;s murals exhibit a propensity for flowing compositional elements that relate strongly to Carlos Francisco&rsquo;s works, while also hewing to blocklike renditions of human subjects reminiscent of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>&rsquo;s murals. His first major mural was <b><i>Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao</i></b>, 1945 (now destroyed), at the US Army Snack Bar No. 11 near Ayala Bridge in Manila, for which he had as assistants Manuel Certeza and Vicente Manansala. This was followed by <b><i>Mother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1945 (also destroyed), for the US Army Officer&rsquo;s Club at San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City. In 1946, Manalad did murals for the staircase and second floor lobby of the Life Theater in Quiapo. In 1974, he was commissioned by First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos to do a mural called <b><i>Philippine Arts and Culture</i></b>, and another on the First Lady&rsquo;s social and cultural projects (both now lost). In 1976, he was chosen by Bulacan governor Ignacio Santiago to paint a mural for the provincial capitol building, <b><i>The History of Bulacan</i></b>, completed with the assistance of<b> </b>many noted Bulakenyo artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manalad illustrated the history of the Philippines in charcoal and ink for <b><i>The Philippine Saga</i></b>,<i> </i>1947, written by Jaime de Veyra and H. Otley Beyer. His last major opportunity to image history came when he was asked to illustrate the various scenes of Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1011\"><strong>Tadhana</strong></a></i> </b>books from 1978 to 1979. Thirty-eight out of a total of 102 scenes from his Tadhana<b><i> </i></b>series made up his first and only solo exhibition on 7-14 Oct 1980 at the Galerie Bleue in Rustan&rsquo;s Makati. These works were subsequently purchased by Mrs Marcos and housed at the Santo Ni&ntilde;o Shrine in Tacloban. Another series of historical <b>tipos del pais</b><i> </i>(country scenes) drawings were done in 1979 to decorate the Coconut Palace, and is now in the care of the Government Service Insurance System Museum.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Reuben R.

In his fifth grade of primary education, he attended the workshop of well-known artist-teacher FernandoSena at the Antipolo Municipal High School. He later took up advertising at Far Eastern University where he graduated in 1990. He joined the Salingpusa group of young artists when he was in first year college and benefited much from the encouragement of the group. He worked for two years as a designer at the Modern Paper Products company where the hands-on experience in working with design strengthened the basis of his art. Through the joint activities of Salingpusa, many of its members, including Manalo, were able to gain critical notice and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manalo became known for his social commentary works on the moral influences of societal forces on children and simple folk.

While practicing his art, he also served as director of an advertising agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manalo was one of the earliest Filipino artists influenced by pop art, perhaps because of his experience in the advertising industry. He expressed this in his appropriation of pictorial devices and techniques earlier exclusive to advertisement design in his paintings. Art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3740\"><strong>Alfredo Roces</strong></a> in his commentary on the artist&rsquo;s solo exhibition in 1967 described his style thus: &ldquo;Manalo, who earns his bread in an advertising agency, utilized the color pages of magazines as a starting point for his paintings and collages. The artist paints patterns over the surface or puts an overlay of tracing paper (an advertising technique) and makes ink drawings on the surface. The overall effect is a transformation of the colored magazine page into background and surfaces for Manalo&rsquo;s flat motifs. The muted effect of a tracing overlay creates a sense of depth or fantasy.&rdquo; In the 1970s, Manalo became identified with the avant-garde of local contemporary art for his hard-edged shapes and evenly painted acrylic surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first one-person exhibition at the Philippine Art Gallery in 1963 and has held other shows since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manalo won first prize in painting, modern art category, for his <b><i>Original Sin </i></b>at the Shell National Students Art Competition in 1960. The following year, he won second prize for <b><i>Exhibit A</i></b> in the same category in the same contest. In 1963, his <b><i>O Blushing Moon, Now You See It, Now You Don&rsquo;t</i></b> was adjudged the best relief at the 2nd Graphic Arts Competition sponsored by the Art Association of the Philippines.

Macabebe, Pampanga 22 Jan 1910. d. 22 Aug 1981. National Artist for visual arts. He is the son of Perfecto Q. Manansala and Engracia Silva. He finished his elementary grades at Intramuros Elementary School (now Araullo), Manila; and first year at the Manila South High School. He married Hermenegilda (Hilda) Diaz, with whom he had one child; their granddaughter, Ronna Manansala, is an artist. As a newsboy and bootblack in Intramuros, he expressed his early creativity designing kites and making charcoal sketches. At 15, he studied under turn-of-the-century painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3711\"><strong>Ramon Peralta</strong></a> while doing signboards for a painting shop. He entered the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts in 1926, and graduated in 1930. In 1927, he was awarded <i>medalla</i> or first prize for <b><i>Coloring from Life</i></b>. He worked as a sign painter at the Manila Advertising <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in Calle Meisic, from 1931 to 1932; and as an illustrator for the<b><i> Philippine Herald</i> </b>in 1932. He was chief layout artist for <b><i>Photonews</i></b> and <b><i>Saturday Evening News </i></b>magazine during the 1930s. He undertook further studies and training at the Ecole de Beaux Arts in Banff and Montreal, Canada, 1949, under a UNESCO Art Fellowship, and in the USA and in France at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of the University of Paris, 1950, where Manansala had a brief stint under Ferdinand Leger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a member of the Thirteen Moderns and the Neo-realists, Manansala was at the forefront of the modernist movement in the country. With the issues of national culture and identity in focus after World War II, his works became, as did those of the other early modernists, reflective of the social environment and expressive of the native sensibility. He held his first one-person show at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a> in 1951. Manansala consistently worked in the figurative mode, with the exception of a few abstract works. Shunning Amorsolo&rsquo; s rural idylls, he developed a new imagery based on the postwar urban experience. The city of Manila, through the vision of the artist, assumed a strong folk character. He painted an innovative mother and child, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong>Madonna of the Slums</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1950, which reflected the poverty in postwar Manila. Besides the mother-and-child, his subjects included jeepneys, <i>barong-barong</i> (shanties), cockfighters, families gathering for a modest meal, and Quiapo women vendors of various goods. His women vendors sit veiled and hunched over their wares, their brown impassive faces like the archaic <b>bulol</b>, block-like with broad planes, their large bare feet projecting from the hem of their <i>saya </i>(long skirt). He did still lifes of native fruits, vegetables, and dried fish in the setting of a native kitchen with its folk utensils, <i>palayok</i> (clay pot), <i>kawali</i> (frying pan), and <i>almires</i> (mortar) against capiz windows. The cubist aspect of Manansala&rsquo;s work rests largely on the geometric facetting of forms and in the shifting and overlapping of planes. But his facets and planes are broader than in original cubism as they bring out larger rhythms. Here and there, he incorporates linear decorative patterns, as in the ironwork curlicues of gates and windows. In his work, he developed the style of transparent cubism, which was generally shared by his fellow Neo-Realists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\"><strong>Romeo Tabuena</strong></a>. Unlike analytical cubism, which arbitrarily fragments and dissects the figure into complex abstract compositions with only clues of the subject remaining, Manansala stayed close to the figure which he simplified to its basic geometric shape. He went through a black-and-white phase of crucifixions and Madonna-and-child paintings, but, on the whole, he used color in all its folk vibrancy, sensuous appeal, and evocative power. In composition, his works often feature lines of perspective with receding, although shallow space; but recession in depth is simultaneously defined by lines and planes that create spatial ambiguities. His still lifes have a tapestry-like quality. The various objects from the domestic context are not fragmented but left integral, occupying the entire visual field, with bright elements on a dark, ambiguous space and at times showing the influence of 17th-century paintings of Dutch interiors with their checkerboard motifs. As a whole, Manansala reinterpreted or indigenized cubism as he drew his themes from the familiar Filipino environment. Manansala&rsquo;s vision of the city and his sensibility to his subjects would influence numerous artists who took up his folk themes within an urban context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among those who show his influence are Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos, with his own version of folk romanticism in paintings that convey the fragile, makeshift character of the 1950s, and others from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) where Manansala taught for a time. These include artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\"><strong>Antonio Austria</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\"><strong>Angelito Antonio</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3704\"><strong>Mario Parial</strong></a>. Like him, they drew their inspiration from the folk, their occupations, and pleasures. He also influenced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3432\"><strong>Manuel Baldemor</strong></a>, whose roots are in Paete, Laguna, as well as some Laguna lakeshore artists. Manansala&rsquo;s art exemplified a solution to the problems of the 1950s in terms of the use of modern Western idioms and their local transformation, and in terms of the subject matter and content of art reflective of a people&rsquo;s identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manansala won first prize for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><strong>Barong-Barong</strong></a> No. 1</i></b> (Shanties No. 1) in the 1950 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong></a> Exhibition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>. His awards from the AAP also include third prize for <b><i>Banaklaot </i></b>(Fishermen) and honorable mention for <b><i>I Believe in God</i></b>, 1948; second prize, <b><i>Kahig</i></b> (Scratch), 1953; second prize, <b><i>Fish Vendors</i></b>, 1955; third prize, <b><i>Best Served, Well-Gained</i></b>, 1955; second prize and also best in show, <b><i>Give Us This Day</i></b>, 1962. In 1940, he won first prize for <b><i>Pounding Rice</i></b> at the UST National Art Exhibition, Filipiniana Division, and in 1949, the Best Poster of the Philippine Republic, USIS Poster Contest, and second prize for the Philippine National Red Cross design. He received the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1963. He also received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila in 1970. He was proclaimed National Artist for visual arts in 1982. In 2012, the Museum of Kapampangan Arts, Holy Angel University, Angeles City in Pampanga inaugurated its Manansala Gallery, which holds the artist&rsquo;s pencil and watercolor works, the Parisian Boudoir series, the UP <b><i>Stations of the Cross</i></b> studies, and other memorabilia, including the artist&rsquo;s National Artist medallion. In 2014, on Manansala&rsquo;s 104th birthday, a tribute titled <b><i>Si Manansala at ang Masaganang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a> </i></b>(Manansala and a Prosperous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2196\"><strong>Harvest</strong></a></strong></a>) was held at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Ba&ntilde;os where two of his murals were originally hanging in the IRRI dining area before going on loan to the National Museum.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Painter. He took up fine arts at the University of the Philippines. His art was shaped when pure abstraction was gaining ground in the country as exemplified in the works of FernandoZobel de Ayala who explored problems of depth on the canvas through fine tonal gradations. Maramag explored similar problems on canvases, usually square-shaped with evenly laid colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Curator RayAlbano in a critique on the artist summed up Maramag&rsquo;s achievement thus: &ldquo;Maramag was the leading master of the spray gun, having had the authority and experience to play around with it. He managed to complicate his surface by masking, using masking tape, shaping his surface, taking chances. His language was complete with nuances of expression and illusion possible for such a look.&rdquo; This mode of work is demonstrated in Maramag&rsquo;s <b><i>Untitled</i></b>, 1978, in acrylic which was part of <b><i>Insights into Philippine Contemporary Art </i></b>sent to Washington, DC, in 1978. He created the illusion of endless space on the center of the canvas&rsquo;s surface from which straight-edged bands of color seemed to emanate and fold up on each other. In 1980, he delved further into concerns with illusory space in <b><i>Title A</i></b>, in acrylic, a shaped surface, his entry in <b><i>Five Directions </i></b>at the Museum of Philippine Art. Here two opposite corners of his painting were curved instead of straight, a device that heightened the illusion of projection of the triangles meeting at the center of the painting. Maramag staged his first one-person show at the Indigo Gallery in 1967, followed by five others at the Luz Gallery and at the CulturalCenterofthe Philippines (CCP). He belonged to the first group of Thirteen Artists chosen for their outstanding achievement by the CCP in 1970. In Sep 2012, his works along with those of select Thirteen Artists awardees, were exhibited at the CCP. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Bulacan 23 Jan 1941. Sculptor. He is the son of Severino Marcelo and Inez Cruz. He married Lilia Enverga. Marcelo finished bachelor of fine arts, major in sculpture, at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1962, then took graduate studies at the University of Hawaii and Pratt Institute, New York. He was an East-West scholar to the United States, 1964-65. He held his first exhibit in open air at the UP campus during his graduation. In 1964, he exhibited at the Seattle World Fair and the New York World Fair. It was much later, in 1980, that he held his second one-person show, followed by a series of shows in different galleries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcelo spent the 1960s as Rizal Park designer and sculptor. He did the large ebony carabaos flanking the steps to the Quirino Grandstand. The medium associated with him is adobe stone, as seen in his figures of <b><i>Captivity</i></b>, <b><i>Contemplation</i></b>, and <b><i>Challenge</i></b> on the UP Diliman campus. The medium of sharply hewn bedrock is used to advantage in his large-scale works expressive of massive strength, permanence, and solidity. Because of its hardness and gritty texture, adobe lends itself best to the artist&rsquo;s simple and broad treatment of the human figure, not concerned with detail but composed in terms of the integral whole. The figures, whether turned inward to themselves or bent backward into a tense arch, are generally cubistic with flat surfaces meeting at sharp angles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcelo has worked with smaller figures with stylized features and linear patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Adobe resists polish, and the severe blocklike orientation of the figures give his sculpture a &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; quality echoing the native <b>likha</b> (icon). Marcelo received awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: second prize, <b><i>Man and Crocodile</i></b>, 1960; first prize, <b><i>Superstructure</i></b>, 1961; first prize, <b><i>Captivity</i></b>, 1962; and second prize, <b><i>Offering</i></b>, 1963. He received the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1961. In 2009, the works of Marcelo, along with several UP alumni, were featured in the opening exhibition of the UP Bulwagan ng Dangal University Heritage Museum. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

As one Hong Kong art critic said: &ldquo;Just as some people review films, others review politics, Marcelo reviews life. His Filipino intelligence and sensitivity give him an understanding of people and situations, and he&rsquo;s got the courage to stab with his pen anything pretentious, stupid, or just downright funny&rdquo; (Bondoc 1985).

Santa Cruz, Manila 23 Feb 1859. d. ca 1917. Painter. He came from a family of artisans. He finished high school at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1877, where he obtained <i>sobresaliente </i>(outstanding) in art under Fr Antonio Sabater. After this achievement, he was asked to render some plates for the deluxe edition of Father Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas </i></b>(Plants of the Philippines). In 1878, one of his drawings was featured in the newspaper <b><i>La Ilustracion del Oriente</i></b>. In 1882, he won a silver medal for his entry in the contest commemorating the 300th anniversary of Santa Teresa de Avila. From this time, Martinez became one of the most prestigious painters of Manila. Six of his landscapes were sent to Madrid in 1884; a year later, he held a solo exhibition at the Tienda de Catalanes. He served as illustrator for magazines like <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>. He was also renowned for his portraits of several governor-generals, and of members of the Paterno, Tuason, Tambunting, and Escudero families. He also helped decorate the San SebastianChurch and the SanIgnacioChurch in the 1890s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of Martinez&rsquo;s works known today are genre pieces like <b><i>The Pasig River </i></b>(Central Bank Collection) and <b><i>Panguingueras </i></b>(Luis Ma. Araneta Collection). These pieces show him to be a <b>costumbrista</b> whose treatment of local custom themes is imbued with incisive realism. Thus, he avoided idealization, emphasizing instead the peculiar features of his sitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1904, FelixMartinez obtained a bronze medal for his overall collaboration at the Saint Louis Universal Exposition, another bronze medal for <b><i>Portrait of an Old Woman</i></b>, and an honorable mention each for <b><i>Holy Water Fountain</i></b> and for <b><i>Manila Bay</i></b> in the same exposition. Not all old paintings signed &ldquo;Martinez&rdquo; were done by Felix.

He depicts portraits from storybooks as though from an innocent, eager child&rsquo;s point of view. Not concerned with individualized character, he is rather engrossed with bringing out a comical fantasy of playful figures in quasi-naive renditions in black supplemented by two other flat colors. A charming, primitivistic design results from an intimate knowledge of wood grain and skillful handling of the carver&rsquo;s chisel. Most notable of his woodcut prints are <b><i>Moses and the Flaming Tree</i></b>, <b><i>Queen Elizabeth</i></b>, <b><i>Adam and Eve</i></b>, <b><i>Statue of Liberty</i></b>, and <b><i>The Juggler</i></b>, all done in 1969-70, and founded on a &ldquo;single image&rdquo; approach to space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the group exhibitions he participated in were the First Indian Triennale of Art in New Delhi in 1968, the Fifth International Exhibition of Colored Graphic Prints in Switzerland in 1970, the Sepia Print Show in New York in 1973, the <b><i>Kutingting</i></b> at the Cultural Center of thePhilippines Main Gallery in 1975, and <b><i>The Art of Fine Print: A View of 25 Years</i></b> at the Museum of Philippine Art in 1980.

Sagada, Mountain Province 18 Apr 1909. d. Sagada, Mountain Province 24 Jun 1995. Photographer. He was the son of Jaime Masferre and Mercedes Pins, a Kankana-ey. He married Nena Bansiong Ogues. His father was a soldier in the Spanish colonial army, who settled in Sagada after the Spanish ceded the islands to the United States in 1898 (Newton and O&rsquo;Hehir 2014). Masferre spent most of his childhood in the mountains of Sagada. As a child, he studied in Spain, and later at the St. Mary&rsquo;s Mission School before going to Baguio to continue his education at the Mountain Province High School, 1926-28. He began teaching at St. Mary&rsquo;s in 1931 before learning and practicing photography in 1934, setting up his own studio in Bontoc. He earned money through photographing people who came to Bontoc from more remote regions, and who took trips around Sagada. It was then that he began to document the Cordillera and its people, a project he continued for two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was inspired by the shots of Dean C. Worcester in photography magazines such as <b><i>National Geographic </i></b>and American picture magazines like the <b><i>Picture Post</i></b>. When his mother died in 1935, Masferre realized the weakening of the traditions of the Filipinos who lived in the mountains in the North because of the modernization of the metropolitan centers in the lowlands (Newton and O&rsquo;Hehir 2014). In 1951, his studio made only a modest profit, so he decided to stop working full-time and focus on farming oranges. His son Jaime took over his studio (Newton and O&rsquo;Hehir 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although a practitioner of photography since the 1930s, Masferre&rsquo;s skill in the art was not fully appreciated until late in his career, when he started showing his works to the public in the 1980s. Masferre&rsquo;s 1,000 or so photographs have been exhibited in and out of the Philippines: in Manila, 1982, 1983, 1988; Copenhagen, Denmark, 1984; and Tokyo, Japan, 1986. Among his most moving works are the portraits <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2218\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2218\"><strong>Lakay Kabayo</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Old Horse), 1950, and <b><i>Woman Wearing Beads of Bistakaw Seeds</i></b>, 1956. His photographs (in the form of print and postcards) have traveled the globe with tourists who visit Bontocor Sagada. His work was compiled into a book titled <b><i>E. Masferre: People of the Cordillera</i></b>, 1988, published by Mobil Corporation and distributed to schools, museums, and libraries in the Philippines. His work was recognized in the 1980s as an effort to rediscover Philippine culture before the Spanish colonization. In 1989, he exhibited in Les Recontres Internationals de la Photographie in Arles, France, one of the world&rsquo;s most prestigious photographic exhibitions. In 1990, the Smithsonian Institution bought 120 of his original prints. They were exhibited for six months in the main rotunda of the American National Museum of Natural History, and traveled to Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Connecticut (de Villa 1995). In 2000, 33 of his prints were exhibited in the National Gallery of Australia (Newton and O&rsquo;Hehir 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Masferre is regarded as a pioneer in Philippine photography. &ldquo;The power and clarity of Masferre&rsquo;s photographs, the greatness of his work, lies in his feeling for and knowledge of his subject matter &hellip; the rice terraces, the planting, the weavers and potters at work, and the strong faces that meet one&rsquo;s gaze with great integrity&mdash;Masferre preserved all of these in timeless images that transcend ethnography and imbue documentary with deeper meaning&rdquo; (Masferre 1988).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Pauline Mangilog, updated by Ariel Pinzon and Roberto Daniel Devela</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">de Villa 1995; Masferre 1988; Newton and O&rsquo;Hehir 2014; Tibaldo 2015; Your <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Voice 2012.</p>\r\n"

Adept at line drawing, he stylized his human figures into robust but graceful forms. In 1976, he produced a body of work in experimental intaglio. An example is <b><i>Abakada</i></b> (Syllabary), a posterlike etching with the main figure of a shaman in ethnic woven skirt and the headgear-mask of a wild boar, combined with enlarged texts and numbers and anatomical drawings of two horses. In his 1980 series of prints, he delved deeper into the subject of human fear of the unknown. He enlarged familiar objects into monstrous proportions while contracting human and animal forms to a much reduced scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held several one-person shows, including <b><i>Prints</i></b>, 1976, at the Art Associates Gallery; <b><i>Mga Recycle at Iba Pa</i></b> (Recycled Things and Others), 1977, at Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>; and <b><i>Koladsining</i></b> (Collage Art), 1978, at the Rear Room Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mayo won awards from the Art AssociationofthePhilippines: first runner-up, 1976; first prize in Graphic Arts, 1976; and honorable mention, <b><i>10 Balls</i></b>, 1977. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Singalong, Manila 23 Mar 1938. Artist, poet, art community organizer. He is the eldest of four children of parents <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Medalla</strong></a> Sr and Juanita Angkay Cortez who migrated from Cebu to Manila. In 1949, he moved from the Ermita Catholic School to the Philippine Normal School Training Department where he finished elementary at age 11, receiving his only academic diploma. Medalla was a voracious reader and basically an autodidact, attending high schools in the University of the Philippines (UP) system via Manila and Diliman, and St. Mary&rsquo;s in Sagada, Mountain Province. In 1954, UP President Vidal Tan allowed the 16-year-old Medalla, already a published poet at that time, admission to the College of Liberal Arts without a high school diploma. Not long after, his professors recommended that Medalla receive a grant from the George Jonas Foundation to attend Camp Rising Sun, an international summer camp for gifted writers in Rhinebeck, New York. In the autumn of 1954, American poet Mark van Doren enabled Medalla&rsquo;s admission into Columbia University to attend classes in philosophy, modern drama, classical literature, Greek drama, as well as workshops in poetry and music. Medalla spent much of this time meeting poets and painters in Greenwich Village, including New York-based Filipino poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\"><strong>Jose Garcia Villa</strong></a> and Filipino painter Alfonso Ossorio, a close friend of Jackson Pollock. It was at this juncture that Medalla began to seriously draw and paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Medalla works out of Bracknell, England. His success comes as a result of over 50 years of working around, but rarely within, the established systems of European, American, and Philippine museums, art journals, and commercial galleries. He was at the forefront of the science, technology, and art wave of the 1960s (he co-founded Signals London and <b><i>Signals News Bulletin</i></b>),<b> </b>the tumultuous political movements of the 1970s (he founded Artists for Democracy and Exploding Galaxy), the anti-materialistic wave of the 1980s (he roamed Europe giving proto-art performances), and the postmodern triumph of the 1990s when anything was possible (he founded the all-inclusive London Biennale). His Kinetic and Participation Art works&mdash;particularly <b><i>Cloud Canyons</i></b> (aka <b><i>Bubble Machines</i></b>) and <b><i>A Stitch in Time</i></b>&mdash;pointed to alternative uses of the environment, materials, and spectators as these innovations challenged traditional understanding of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Medalla&rsquo;s works have been exhibited in important international art fairs and exhibitions such as <b><i>Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form</i></b>, 1969, Bern, Switzerland; <b><i>Pioneers of Participation Art</i></b>, 1970, Oxford, England; and <b><i>Documenta 5</i></b>, 1972, Kassel, Germany. After the publication of Guy Brett&rsquo;s <b><i>Exploding Galaxies</i></b>, 1995, demand for his works took off in other major cities. These include <b><i>Flux Attitudes</i></b>, 1996, New Museum, New York; <b><i>L&rsquo;inform</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1996-97,<b> </b>Centre Pompidou; <b><i>Live/Life: British Art Today</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1996-97, Musee de la Ville de Paris and Centro Cultural do Belem, Lisbon; <b><i>Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949-79</i></b>, 1998, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; 2nd Johannesburg Biennale with the theme Trade Routes: History and Geography, 1998; <b><i>A Fruitful Incoherence: Dialogues with Artists on Internationalism</i></b>,<i> </i>1998, Institute of International Visual Arts, London; <b><i>Live in Your Head: Concept and Experiment in Britain 1965-75</i></b>, 2000, Whitechapel Gallery, London; <b><i>Force Fields: Phases of the Kinetic</i></b>,<b> </b>2000, Hayward Gallery London and Museu d&rsquo;Art Contemporani de Barcelona; <b><i>Century City</i></b>, 2001, Tate Modern, London; <b><i>Pulse Art, Healing and Transformation</i></b>, 2003, Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) London;<b><i> Happiness: A Survival for Art and Life</i></b>, 2003, Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; <b><i>Art and the 60s: This Was Tomorrow</i></b>, 2004, Tate Modern, London; <b><i>Changing States: Contemporary Art and Ideas in an Era of Globalisation</i></b>, 2004, Institute of International Visual Arts, London; <b><i>Anywhere in the World &ndash; David Medalla</i></b>, 2005, ICA London; <b><i>Filipiniana</i></b>, 2006, El Cuartel de Conde Duque, Madrid; <b><i>Metropolis Rise: New Art from London</i></b>, 2006, Temporary Contemporary, London; <b><i>Performa: Chosen Word</i></b>, 2007, Second Biennial of New Visual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Art Performance</strong></a>; <b><i>Deformes Festival of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>2007, Chile; <b><i>Documenting Live</i></b>,<i> </i>2008; <b><i>16th Biennale of Sydney: Revolutions &ndash; Forms That Turn</i></b>, 2008; <b><i>Death of the Audience</i></b>, 2009, Wiener Secession, Vienna; <b><i>This Could Happen to You: Ikon in the 1970s</i></b>,<b> </b>2010, Ikon Gallery Birmingham; <b><i>Overflow</i></b>, 2011, More Space Gallery, Las Vegas; and <b><i>Migrations</i></b>, 2012, Tate Britain, London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art critic Guy Brett, <b><i>Artscribe</i></b> contributor Brandon Taylor, Happenings historian Frank Popper, and <b><i>Third Text</i> </b>founder-editor Rasheed Araeen have asserted that Medalla&rsquo;s propositions were some of the most elegant and insightful strategies in British art. These longtime supporters and others have doubtless weighed in on Medalla&rsquo;s subsequent presence in catalogs and biennales intent on reevaluating contemporary art history. Not surprisingly, it is among polyliterate audiences on the global stage that Medalla&rsquo;s works and ideas receive warm circulation and appeal. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot, with notes from Rachel Mayo</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Araeen 1979; Benitez-Johannot 2012a; Brett 1995; Popper 1975.</p>\r\n"

Lingayen, Pangasinan. Sculptor. She is daughter to Maximo Viray Mendoza, a dental surgeon, and Eugenia Sison Rico, a teacher. She finished her secondary education at St. Joseph&rsquo;s College and her bachelor of philosophy at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in Manila. As a child, Mendoza&rsquo;s earliest experience in art was doll making, using fabric as a soft sculpture to create dolls in national dress. As a student, she studied drawing under GaloB.Ocampo and watercolor painting under ArturoLuz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon after college, Mendoza traveled widely. She took special studies in art and culture at the Grailville College in Loveland, Ohio, where she also did sculpture in clay and paper. Later she traveled to Europe, taking postgraduate studies in Vogelenzang, Netherlands. Then she came back to Asia to live and work for almost three years in Indonesia as a teacher of Western culture. There she studied Bahasa, the art of batik making, the wayang, and gamelan. She then moved to Malaysia and Singapore, where she held workshops for youth and women. In Singapore, she was in charge of the Philippine participation in the United Nations Festival and the Mabuhay Merdeka Orang Choklat Summit celebrating the Maphilindo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1960s, Mendoza returned to the Philippines disappointed at not finding any clay art in the galleries. Thus she decided to focus on this. Going back to her parents&rsquo; hometown in Labrador, Pangasinan, she explored its mountains and riverbeds to find an abundance of red clay and natural silica for use in her art. Soon she completed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> clay art pieces and opened her studio in Cubao to an appreciative audience. This was followed by her first solo exhibition held at the Manila Hilton Art Center, on the theme <b><i>Two Birds of Happiness</i></b>, interpreting forms of Ibong<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/111\"><strong>Adarna</strong></a> (Adarna Bird) and the <b>sarimanok</b> (a mythical bird with a fish in its beak) in terra-cotta. Soon she exhibited with stoneware artists Jaime and Anne De Guzman, receiving positive reviews from critic AlfredoRoces. She participated in the Concurso Internacionale della Ceramica d&rsquo;Arte Contemporare in Italy, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a>ide Art Festival in Australia, where she exhibited at the Lombard Art Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mendoza has dedicated her life and career to teaching clay sculpture, not only in her own studio, but in various provincial workshops under the auspices of the Design Center Philippines and the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines. With the support of the Ceramic Council of the Philippines, she organized the Potters Guild with the aim of cultivating appreciation and use of clay as medium for art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mendoza continues to work and exhibit free forms of terra-cotta with her group called Luad (earth), which includes CharitoBitanga and Lia Tayag, and with the women artists of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>KASIBULAN</strong></a> or Kababaihan ng Sining at Bagong Sibol ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She also affiliated with the Christian Art Society of the Philippines and the Society of Philippine Sculptors. In Sep 2014, Mendoza, participated in the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s National Art Fair. With the help of KASIBULAN, they launched her book titled <b><i>Labrador</i></b>, which contains a rich narrative of the artist&rsquo;s ancestry and place.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, updated by Roberto Daniel Devela</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Ghettomanila 2014; Mendoza 2009; Tobias-Papa, n.d.</p>\r\n"

Cebu City, Cebu 14 Dec 1948. Painter. He is the son of Teofilo Mendoza Sr and Clemencia Ilanan. He is the third of the three Mendoza artist-brothers, the other two being Sofronio aka SYM and Teofilo. He excels in landscape painting, especially in watercolor. He studied for a few semesters at the University of the East College of Fine Arts. The public took notice of his art when, as a relatively unknown, he won the grand prize in the 29th Annual Art Competition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>. His entry, a watercolor rendering of <i>barong-barong</i> (shanty), won over the abstract works and numerous genre and landscapes because of its technical excellence and fresh treatment of a familiar subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has used monochrome to advantage, using clear but subdued browns, greens, or blues in a wide range of tones to create an art of restraint and quiet reflection. At the same time, the subtle tonal modulations add a subdued emotional mood that hints at the pain and yearning that course through the dark <i>esteros</i> (estuaries) and the sagging structures of the poor. In the welter of details that make up the perverse baroque of the slums, the unifying devices of monochromatic hue and linear rhythm put the diversity of elements under control. A theme that has recently emerged in his work is the contrast between the rot and slime of poverty and the healthy organic growth of trees and vegetation. From images of the urban slums, he has shifted to the rural landscape, particularly images of the native house completely integrated with its setting of lush tropical greenery. His paintings of houses capture the folk air, with hanging plants and <i>masetera</i> (flowerpots) all in a row. Much of his recent work is in oil on canvas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mendoza won the grand prize for <b><i>Bahay I-Composition </i></b>(House I-Composition) in the AAP competition in 1976. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Sculptor. A toymaker&rsquo;s son, Mendoza went on to take fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas, which enabled him to take on color separator duties in a publishing house. His sculpting practice, however, has roots in his serving as apprentice to National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a> at the suggestion of Mendoza&rsquo;s former professor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3650\"><strong>Ildefonso Marcelo</strong></a>. Mendoza eventually went on to finish studies in bronze casting under Prof Elden C. Tefft at the University of Kansas in 1969, after which he assisted his teacher in teaching the sculptural technique. He was at one time a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Philippine Sculptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mendoza worked with Marcelo on the carabao and tamaraw sculptures guarding Rizal Park. Mendoza&rsquo;s own major achievements in sculpture are his bronze cast of the fiery, expressionist monuments of <b><i>Gabriela Silang</i></b>, <b><i>Pio del Pilar</i></b>, and <b><i>Sultan Kudarat</i></b>, all popular landmarks in the Makati business district. Although he is most adept at realistic rendition, he has also explored abstraction and stylized representation in various large-scale media. He also designed and executed the sculptural relief map of the Philippines and the sculptural children&rsquo;s playground at the Rizal Park. Since 2001, Mendoza, has been aggressively exhibiting nonfigurative modernist work in annual solo exhibitions at the Crucible Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mendoza won awards from the Art Associationofthe Philippines: first prize, <b><i>Bisig</i></b> (Arm), which he did together with Francisco Cruz and NapoleonAbueva, 1968; second prize, <b><i>Kasaysayan ng Isang Lungsod</i></b> (History of a City), 1971; first prize, <b><i>Population Control: Economic Determination of City&rsquo;s Growth</i></b>, 1971; grand award, <b><i>Taon-Katauhan </i></b>(Year-Humankind), 1973; first prize, <b><i>Baguis </i></b>(Line), 1974; first prize, <b><i>Pagpapanatili ng Buhay</i></b> (Maintaining Life), 1976; and grand prize, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a></i></b> (Metamorphosis), 1979.

Pateros, Rizal 9 Jun 1867. d. 12 Mar 1939. Painter and sculptor. She was the second child in a family of five children born to Venancio Mendoza and Evarista Gotianquin. She married <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3840\"><strong>Crispulo Zamora</strong></a>, 1871-1922, on 10 Jun 1892 (Manuel<i> </i>1955, 488). They had seven children and 16 grandchildren. Zamora was a silversmith and a classmate of Pelagia at the Escuela de Dibujo y Pintura. The couple established an engraving business, Crispulo Zamora and Sons Inc, in Quiapo, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pelagia is the first known woman sculptor in the Philippines. She studied modeling under Manuel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> (Zaragoza 1982, 374). She was the first female student to be accepted at the Escuela de Dibujo y Pintura. Mendoza was 22 years old when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\"><strong>Lorenzo Rocha</strong></a>, director of the Escuela, accepted her. According to Alejandro Capitulo in his biography of Pelagia titled <b><i>Women in History: Do&ntilde;a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3662\"><strong>Pelagia Mendoza</strong></a></i></b>, she completed a course in painting in 1892 and another course in sculpture in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pelagia won first prize in sculpture for a wax bust of Christopher Columbus at the Columbus Quadricentennial Art Contest held on 12 Oct 1892. Pelagia had not yet completed her course on sculpture when she won the contest. Upon winning the competition, she landed on the front page of <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina </i></b>on 21 Oct 1892. It is safe to say that Pelagia&rsquo;s winning the competition marks the very first time a woman artist broke into and entered this public domain of art. Pelagia&rsquo;s bust of Columbus also reaped honors internationally. Pelagia also won the second prize at the Chicago Universal Exposition, 1892, for her bust of Columbus at the Quadricentennial celebrations of the explorer. This honor makes Pelagia the very first woman artist in the Philippines to have earned international recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the same year, Pelagia also won a diploma of honor for work done for the art contest celebrating the tercentenary of San Juan de la Cruz. Pelagia&rsquo;s achievements as a sculptor also led to her being recognized with the Cruz de Merito Civil (Cross of Merit) by Governor-General Despujol. Pelagia was also acknowledged for her skill in painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Crispulo Zamora died in 1922, it was Pelagia who took over the engraving business. Probably, the business and her many chores as wife and mother took her more and more away from her art. None of Pelagia&rsquo;s works survive today, having been presumably destroyed during World War II. Despite the loss of her works, Pelagia Mendoza&rsquo;s contribution to the visual arts is significant, particularly for women in the visual arts of the 19th century. She demonstrated that women could excel in the male-dominated fields of painting, sculpture, and business. Pelagia died after two months of illness at the age of 72. She was buried at the Manila North Cemetery. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eloisa May P.

SYM studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas, 1963-65, and the University of the East, 1965-68.

Upon moving to Manila in 1962, SYM took up an impressionist palette similar to his contemporaries&rsquo; works in Mabini, but also learned modern abstract composition from mentors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\"><strong>Florencio Concepcion</strong></a>. His works from 1968 to 1994 utilized impressionistic and academic realist techniques focusing on heritage scenes, urban landscapes, and wharf scenes. Since 1995 he has employed futurist and Cubist techniques for his nudes, landscapes, and, in particular, still lifes as a means of combining his interest in modernist styles with his subject matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first solo exhibition, <b><i>SYM</i></b>, was held at the National Library in 1969.

Bulacan 20 Oct 1945. Sculptor. Born to Conrado Sr, a civil engineer, and Concepcion Camacho, a former schoolteacher, Mercado is the youngest of three sons. After graduating with a fine arts degree from the University of Santo Tomas, he worked as art director for a local advertising firm until he decided to pursue a full-time career in art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, Mercado did a series of sculptures consisting of aluminum doors with small and barred arched windows from which a Christlike figure seemed to look out. In the context of the times, they seemed to be making a subtle comment on the lack of freedom in the martial law period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His recent works with figures trapped within an open-cage structure of metal rods repeat, although in a different form, the theme of enclosing, if not imprisonment. For his more recent sculpture, he no longer uses solid metal planes but instead uses structural rods which he creates by welding, bending, and twisting into single figures and open-cage constructions. These bring out linear design rather than volumetric form in sculpture defined by lines interacting within a circumscribed space. Generally, there is the impression of figures, human or animal, such as horses and giraffes, entrapped in a web or struggling in barred enclosures. In the open-cage constructions, the numerous thin rods that form both figures and their setting and that come into different angles of interactive relationship create a wiry tension, as well as lively three-dimensional play between the sculptural medium and inner and outer space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mercado has exhibited his works in solo and group shows both locally and internationally.

This shows the artist as a superb representationalist, masterfully employing light and shadow to dramatize the dignity and beauty of the sitter, at the same time suggesting the details of her costume in impressionistic sweeps reminiscent of Amorsolo. Miranda used the same approach in his illustrations; characterization and local color were always established, but all these appear impressionistic or concisely captured due to his mastery of technique. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Textile weaver. Her father was Datu Bansalan Barra. Her husband was Agton Monon with whom she had six children. Belonging to the Tagabawa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> indigenous community, Monon learned the process of <b>inabal </b>weaving tradition from her mother starting at the age of 12. Together with her younger sister, Monon created handwoven tube skirts that are traditionally worn by the Bagobo. Due to her excellent weaving skills, her husband paid her parents a higher bride price. Later on when her husband died, she managed their farm and took care of her six children. Her income from weaving supplemented the family income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Using the<b> ikat</b> weaving process, Monon began with the stripping of the abaca plant to get at the fiber strands. These were then dried and tied by hand for the dye resist process. The dyed strands were then tied to a bamboo frame, at which point the design could be defined. Monon did her weaving from home, isolating herself during this process to ensure concentration on her work. She held a solid reputation for the quality of her textiles along with the intricate designs that she created, which could be traced back to at least a hundred years (Tacio 2009). She is said to have favored the <b>binuwaya</b> (crocodile), one of the hardest designs to make in the Bagobo repertoire. Monon&rsquo;s work in the collection of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts exemplifies the exemplar of binuwaya designs with hexagons encasing the crocodile motif at the center, x&rsquo;s forming rhombuses on one side, and the<i> </i><b>binaglay</b><i> </i>or stripe motif (Respicio 2003, 61).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Until the 1950s, the tradition was still flourishing as wild abaca was still abundant in the area. Later on, the Bagobo weavers had to plant their own abaca fields to supply the demand for their own fabric weaving. In recent years, traditional Bagobo dress was only worn on special occasions, rather than in everyday life. Before the advent of cheap machine-made fabrics sold in the market, the common types of Bagobo tube skirts were called the <b>sinukla<i> </i></b>and <b>bandira</b>. In comparison, Monon&rsquo;s traditional Bagobo woven cloth, measuring 3.5 m x 42 cm in length, took three to four months to finish, at a rate of one abaca tube skirt per month. Monon taught the younger women in her community the value of diligence, perseverance, and discipline as necessary attitudes of a good weaver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To honor her commitment to preserving the Bagobo textile weaving tradition, Monon was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 1998. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Cecilia S.

The artist draws upon media techniques to deliver commentary by manipulating the videos and sounds via repetitions, pauses, effects, zooming, and unexpected juxtapositions.

Cremona, Italy 6 Sep 1888. d. San Juan, Metro Manila 11 Aug 1958. Sculptor and teacher. He was the son of Alessandro Monti and Angela Clementi. He came from a family of sculptors known primarily for funerary and architectural works. In 1905, he completed a four-year program at the School of Design of the Academy of Fine Arts in Brera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a>, where he gained strong classical training and studied ancient statuaries and works by Renaissance masters. His personal style shows strong influences from Art Nouveau and later Art Deco, which were current in Europe then. Monti worked with the traditional materials and techniques of carved marble and cast bronze. His commissioned works were mostly funerary sculptures for the rising middle class and monuments commemorating World War I heroes in Cremona and neighboring cities in Northern Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Monti left Cremona in 1929 after his short-lived victory in a monument project was taken away from him. He traveled to San Remo, then to Nice, and then to New York. It was there that he met Filipino architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\"><strong>Juan Arellano</strong></a> who was sent to the United States to study theater design under Thomas Lamb. By Oct 1930, Monti had already reached Manila and had begun his many collaborations with Juan Arellano, who was then principal architect at the Bureau of Pubic Works. Their collaborations include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a>, 1931; the Tayabas Capitol, 1935; the Negros Municipal Plaza; and the former Iloilo City Hall, 1936. At this time, Monti&rsquo;s work shifted in terms of material from primarily being of marble and bronze to using more concrete cast as this was locally accessible. His style also leaned toward the more simplified Art Deco, which complemented the buildings that Arellano had designed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Monti settled in Manila and, in 1930, was joined by his wife Antonia Giovanna Adrianna Chiappa and two of three daughters, Liliana and Sandra. Their eldest daughter Angiola was left to the care of relatives. Between 1932-33, Monti worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a> on the execution of the latter&rsquo;s winning entry for the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>. They were also assisted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3461\"><strong>Anastacio Caedo</strong></a> and Conrado de Leon, who later founded the House of Precast. Monti made his last visit to Italy with Tolentino in 1933 for the final casting of the Bonifacio monument figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Between 1935 and 1937, he also accepted commissions in Hong Kong for the Hong Kong <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a></strong></a> Bank and the Repulse Bay Hotel. In 1938, he collaborated with architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\"><strong>Pablo Antonio</strong></a> for the <b><i>Preventorium</i></b>, now known as the White Cross Children&rsquo;s Home in San Juan. They worked together on the sculptural elements consisting of concrete cast figures of playing children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Monti also produced portraits of prominent personalities, among them President Manuel Quezon and his wife Aurora, President Manuel Roxas, Eulogio &ldquo;Amang&rdquo; Rodriguez, and Cardinal Rufino Santos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Monti and his family lived in the interment camp at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) during the war. After World War II, Monti&rsquo;s projects were mostly for private clients including schools and churches. He produced sculptures, such as <b><i>Pieta</i></b> and <b><i>Virgin Mary with Angels</i></b>, both in 1947, for two Manila chapels of the former Funeraria Paz Building, 1947, designed by architect Otillo Arellano. He made a second cast of the <b><i>Pieta</i></b> for another church project, <b><i>Our Lady of Sorrows</i></b>, 1948, designed by architect Arsenio Topacio. In 1949, he completed four large-scale concrete bas-relief panels for the lobby of the Far Eastern University Administrative Building designed by architect Pablo Antonio. These panels depict scenes in Philippine history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He accepted a teaching post at the UST College of Architecture and Fine Arts and was the first to teach courses on sculpture. His students include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J. Elizalde Navarro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3807\"><strong>Virginia Ty-Navarro</strong></a>, Leonardo Hidalgo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3699\"><strong>Leon Pacunayen</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3801\"><strong>Ting Ping Lay</strong></a>. From 1949 to 1953, he executed 15 large-scale concrete cast figures at the top of the UST Main Building depicting the three virtues of faith, hope, and charity, as well as Western philosophers, writers, and thinkers. Later projects include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a>, Quezon City, 1954, with architect Jose Zaragoza; Sta. Maria Church, Iloilo City, 1957; the Espiritu Santo Church and Parochial School, Tayuman, 1957; and Don Bosco Institute, Mandaluyong, 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Monti&rsquo;s most ambitious project was the 1953 Philippine International Fair, which he took on in collaboration with architect Otillo Arellano. For this they executed several large-scale concrete cast free-standing figures including <b><i>Filipinas</i> </b>and the <b><i>Four Freedoms</i></b>; five multi-figure tableaux as allegorical representations of local industries, music, and the arts. Of these, only the <b><i>Filipinas</i></b> has remained intact while the <b><i>Four Freedoms</i></b> was broken in pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was conferred the Papal Order of Saint Gregory the Great on 17 Aug 1958. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Ma.

Moreno&rsquo;s gowns may be considered emblematic of the 1950s and 1960s fashion. In stark contrast to the stiffness of his silhouettes, Moreno created intricate beading, fringe, appliqu&eacute;s, or embroideries, generously placed across the chest, hip, and along the train, to accentuate the curves of the high-society women he handpicked as his models and muses such as Pearlie Arcache, Bambi Harper, Joji Felix Velarde, Maita Gomez, and Tony Parsons. Moreno has dressed up prominent names in both local and international politics and entertainment, such as American First Ladies Betty Ford and Pat Nixon on their visits to the Philippines, Queens Sirikit of Thailand, Margaretta of Bulgaria, Sophia of Greece, Princesses Margaret of Britain, and Suga of Japan. He also designed the gown that Hollywood legend Rita Moreno wore when she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for <b><i>West Side Story</i></b> in 1962. However, Moreno was not limited to custom creations for upper-class clientele. He was also commissioned to design costumes for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His work has been exhibited at the World&rsquo;s Fairs inSeattle, Washington,andNew York City, as well as photographed for international publications such as<b><i>Vogue</i></b>, <b><i>Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</i></b>,<b><i>Holiday</i></b>, and<b><i>Le Figaro</i></b>.

Cainta, Rizal 1 Jun 1973. Intermedia artist and exhibition designer. His parents are Isabelo Umando Mu&ntilde;oz and Clarita Mogan. He studied painting at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> in 1993. He was part of the erstwhile collective and artist-run space Surrounded by Water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Michael Mu&ntilde;oz is recognized for his paintings and installations that incorporate religious imagery and texts from the Roman Catholic tradition. Mu&ntilde;oz&rsquo;s exposition of the canon is exemplified by his use of Latin excerpts and titles for his works; the appropriation of iconic images by Renaissance and Baroque painters; and his thorough research on biblical narratives and official releases from the church. He combines figurative painting with the materials and methods of carpentry and weaving, as well as machine-fabricated glass and lights, digital etchings on wood, and found objects. Framed as contemporary art, his works are votive and philosophical expressions exploring theology and the origins of the church. <b><i>Ichthus </i></b>(Jesus Christ God Son Savior / Fish), 2009, is a text-based plasterwork pieced together by dovetail joint. The sturdy construction alludes to the foundation of the Church. Casting a silhouette of the Greek characters from the light box, the work evokes the confluence of Western and Eastern traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mu&ntilde;oz&rsquo;s works attempt to circumvent religious controversies such as those that deal with intolerance and the predominance of materialist philosophy, and social rifts resulting from the collision of scientific and sacred truths. Contemporary in form, his approach to these long-held issues is often didactic. His work titled <b><i>Caput Adami </i></b>(Adam&rsquo;s Head), 2010, is a longitudinal installation of plaster skulls foregrounding a backlit cross. By introducing a religious symbol in an archaeological display, the work juxtaposes Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution with the story of creation as revealed by biblical texts. The aforementioned examples seem to convey a stark departure from his early works that explored secular themes&mdash;particularly, socialist propaganda in images, as well as subject matter drawn from social realism. Regardless of form, the artist&rsquo;s body of works intimates his inclination to probe the work of ideological structures in shaping consciousness and constructing histories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist&rsquo;s works for the exhibition <b><i>Cognitio Cristo </i></b>(To Know Christ), 2014, depict the four apostles Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John who chronicled Christ&rsquo;s revelation through the gospel accounts. Following classical religious iconography, Mu&ntilde;oz poses the seamlessly cut out image of the animal symbolizing the evangelist as negative counterpoint to each of the sleek portraits. Preceding this inquiry on evangelization is <b><i>Provincia Philippinensis </i></b>(Philippine Province),<b><i> </i></b>2012, an exhibition consisting of six assemblages that recasts the process of conversion from the perspective of religious orders that evangelized the Philippines. The aforementioned exhibits proceed from a series of exhibitions begun in 2010 that would lead to a sustained reflection on Christianity; among these are <b><i>Deus Historiae</i></b> (God of History),<b><i> </i></b>2010; <b><i>Christiadum </i></b>(Saga of Christ),<b><i> </i></b>2011; and <b><i>Aetas Martyrum </i></b>(Age of Martyrs),<b><i> </i></b>2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the exhibition design projects Mu&ntilde;oz undertook were those done for the Museo ng Kalinangang Pilipino in 2003 and Manila Contemporary in 2008. In 2005, he co-founded with Mitzi Icasiano the Manlilikha Artisans&rsquo; Support Network, an organization that promotes indigenous traditions through research and exhibition projects. Mu&ntilde;oz was conferred the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

Apalit, Pampanga 12 Oct 1949. Silversmith. His parents are Jose Mutuc and Natividad Tubig. He is married to Leticia A. Mutuc and they have five children. His son Eduardo Jr also learned the process of<b> pukpuk<i> </i></b>(hand hammering).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initially a farmer, Mutuc was 29 years old when he became a wood-carving apprentice to Carlos Quiros who made furniture in Pampanga (Pangilinan 2015). His initial motive was to supplement his income from tilling the land to feed his family. After six years of making furniture, a colleague taught him the process of silver plating, which was often used to emulate gold and silver leaf in the decoration of saints and religious screens found in colonial churches. The objects produced through this process serve primarily as ornaments for ecclesiastical purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For Mutuc, the process of metalwork called pukpuk or <b>pinukpuk</b><i> </i>(to hammer) begins with a detailed drawing of the design which is then transferred unto a block of wood by chiseling. After covering the wood with a metal sheet, the artist carefully hammers the surface of the metal using a mallet and an old rubber slipper to transpose the design in wood. The metal sheet is then dipped in molten silver, then worked over through additional hammering and polishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mutuc has been commissioned to create retablos, mirrors, candelabras, altars for churches, and <i>karosa </i>(religious floats). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his first works is a tabernacle for the parish in Fairview, Quezon City, commissioned by Mons Fidelis Limcauco. While he bases his designs on traditional religious art from the Spanish colonial period, Mutuc also infuses his own design ideas into his projects. To avoid unnecessary cost overruns that come with revisions, the artist considers the size of the project. Some of his works have measured up to 40 ft, featuring fine and detailed craftsmanship. For example, Mutuc is known to use different molds for cherubs to give each figure a unique character. He is also fond of using the design motif commonly called <b>callado</b>,<i> </i>which depicts intertwined leaves and flowers embossed on silver-plated yellow brass (Pangilinan 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mutuc was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 2004. Mutuc&rsquo;s residence and workshop is located in Apalit, Pampanga, a province subjected to flooding from the nearby Apalit River, resulting in damages to his woodblocks. He teaches youngsters in the neighborhood the process of silversmithing. <em><strong>Written by Cecilia S.

The organization was amalgamating from as early as 1969, as students from across various universities were motivated to political action by the writings of the Communist Party of the Philippines chairman Jose Maria Sison. Art and architecture students and professionals from various universities like the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, Far Eastern University, FEATI University, Ateneo de Manila University, University of the East, and University of Santo Tomas, came together to push for social realist and protest art. Although the group&rsquo;s members were already participating in the student movement prior to the establishment of NPAA, its creation allowed them to focus on the role of art and culture in society and the revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">NPAA&rsquo;s works included social realist paintings, murals, newspaper publications, and editorial cartoons depicting the mass struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism. NPAA also created placards, murals, and other materials used in demonstrations and protests. The students of the UP College of Fine Arts published the newspaper <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, which circulated mainly within the UP Diliman campus. As part of the Konsehong Tagapag-ugnay ng Rebolusyunaryong Sining or KONTRES, the group participated in the exhibit <b><i>Sining ng Bayan</i></b> (People&rsquo;s Art), converting Plaza Miranda to a people&rsquo;s art gallery. They also worked with theater groups, like Samahang Demokratikong Kabataan (SDK) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2967\"><strong>Gintong Silahis</strong></a>, in the staging of performances during rallies in Plaza Miranda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The original NPAA headquarters was located in Kamuning Road, Quezon City. It was raided and subsequently vacated after the declaration of martial law in 1972. Despite their cameras and other equipment being confiscated, the group continued to operate and protest against the Marcos dictatorship. They endured the persecution, garnering even more members, until at least 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During a speech delivered at the UP Sunken Garden by then defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile, the Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps Green Beret <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> conducted a sitting strike while NPAA unrolled a large manila paper mural down from the library rooftop depicting the struggle of the masses against the dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A problem with leadership eventually led to the disbanding of the organization. However, some members continued their work in the underground and regional circles. NPAA is one of the earliest, if not the first, social realist art group in the Philippines. It served as a precursor to similar groups such as Lingkod Sining and Kaisahan. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byKelly P.

The narrative of this collection traces the lineage of the country&rsquo;s prehistorical and precolonial provenance through recovered artifacts, documentation of former and extant practices, and selected pieces from the museum archives. The archaeological collections include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2227\"><strong>Manunggul jar</strong></a>,890-710 BC,a late Neolithic period jar used in burial rituals signifying an ancient worldview of the afterlife; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/386\"><strong>Tabon cave</strong></a> skullcap, 14500 BC, considered one of the country&rsquo;s earliest human remains excavated in Palawan; and representative text in the ancient system of writing called the<i> baybayin </i>script. The artifactsrecovered from the <i>San Diego</i> galleon that sank in 1600 near Fortune Island, Batangas, makes up a major part of the permanent exhibition. The ethnographic collection highlights the different cultural practices of Filipino people groups based on the character of the country&rsquo;s geography and social relationships articulated through diverse economic systems, lifeways, religious worldviews, language, and everyday material culture. These include examples of culturally significant objects from Northern and Southern Philippines in the form of textiles, carvings, metalcraft, and examples of traditional houses. <em><strong>Written by Clod Krister Marlan V.

ELIZALDE </span></b>(<b>Jeremias Elizalde Navarro</b>) b. San Jose, Antique 22 May 1924. d. 10 Jun 1999. Painter, sculptor, National Artist. He was the son of Emiliano Navarro and Paz Elizalde. He married artist Virginia Ty. He graduated with a bachelor of fine arts, major in painting, from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1951, and pursued advanced studies at the Art Students League in New York, USA, in 1953. He also did special studies in story and commercial illustrations. A versatile artist, being both painter and sculptor, he taught art at UST and at Randwick University in Sydney, Australia. He held his first one-person show at the PhilippineArtGallery in 1954. He represented the Philippines at the Sao Paulo Biennial, Brazil, in 1969 and 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a sculptor, Navarro introduced masks in contemporary Philippine design by carving a series in hardwoods. His masks call to mind archaic deities. They merge the human with the animal, transcending gender definitions and going beyond the familiar gamut of human emotions to the alien and strange. In his linear sculpture using rods and pipes, he emphasized the interaction of figure and space. <b><i>Echo</i></b> features two rows of upright rods ending in open circles; the idea of the echo arising from the serial repetition of the circles suggests open mouths or channels of sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarro was among the first contemporary artists who did assemblages of found objects and metal parts in a variety of forms to create freestanding works. As a painter, he has done abstract and figurative works in oil and watercolor. His abstracts spontaneously combine geometric elements in strong, vivid hues. He did a series of figurative works drawing inspiration from Balinese art and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarro was also a prolific writer particularly in his later years when he turned to poetry and art criticism. Serving as art editor of UST&rsquo;s <b><i>Varsitarian</i></b> from 1949 to 1951, and producing criticism for broadsheets, his alma mater UST sought to honor this aspect of his work by establishing the annual JEN National Workshop in Criticism on the Arts and Humanities beginning in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarro won first prize in the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines for <b><i>Baguio</i></b> in the second watercolor exhibition in 1952. He was conferred the National Artist Award of the Philippines for visual arts in 1999. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

Ermita, Manila 24 Aug 1921. d. 22 Dec 1973. Painter. He was the son of Feliciano Navarro and Hipolita Capulong. He belonged to the batch of students at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts whose studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Most of his classmates perished in the Bataan Death March. After the war, in 1948, he established his shop in Ermita. Navarro was the most disciplined and most acclaimed disciple of the classical tradition. Unlike most of the affiliates of the Amorsolo school who opened art galleries in the Mabini area, he consistently produced works of high quality, even in the small landscapes he sold to tourists and middle-class consumers in his shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarro&rsquo;s skills as a realist in the old academic tradition are evident in <b><i>Semaphore, Intramuros</i></b>, 1939, which exhibits masterly drawing and full modulation of colors. Although he naturally took up subjects similar to Amorsolo&rsquo;s, he consciously strove to evolve a coloring unique to his works. Greens and browns appear often in his landscapes; he eschewed Amorsolo&rsquo;s yellow, orange, and pink tones. He deliberately avoided painting the proverbial brilliant tropical sunlight and strove for his own identity in art. He also excelled in aerial perspective. His canvases depicting scenes in the medical profession show his mastery of complex compositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarro received numerous prizes in various art contests and exhibitions. In the conservative painting category of the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines annual exhibition, he won honorable mention for <b><i>Two Forces</i></b>, 1951; first prize for <b><i>Early Risers</i></b>, 1954; and first prize for <b><i>Sidewalk Vendors</i></b>, 1955. <b><i>Trader&rsquo;s Boat </i></b>garnered the Calendar Prize and a third prize in 1951; <b><i>San Juan River</i></b>, best prize, 1959. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Manila 4 Aug 1979. Photographer, multidisciplinary artist, and curator. She is the daughter of Efren Navarroza and Edita Cinco. Her grandfather, Cristituto Roa Navarroza Sr, was a professional photographer. She graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in communication arts in 2002 from De La Salle University, where she was mentored by Dr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3775\"><strong>Judy Freya Sibayan</strong></a>. She pursued continuing education at the International Center of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a> in New York, with support from the Asian Cultural Council and was given a scholarship in the Instituto Europeo di Design, Madrid, where she completed the program European Master of Fine Art Photography (Master Fotografia de Autor). She came under the tutelage of Antoine d&rsquo;Agata through a scholarship from the Angkor Photography Festival in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Navarroza also does installation art, and works as a commercial photographer, doing editorial work and commercial commissions. She is the singer of the post-punk band The Late Isabel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The range of images in her photographs includes fictional scenes, installations, fabricated still lifes, landscapes, and self-portraits. The substance of her earlier work included personal poetry, such as in <b><i>Polysaccharide: The Dollhouse <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2005, and <b><i>Saturnine: A Collection of Portraits, Creatures, Glass, and Shadow</i></b>, 2007, and mythologies of personalities such as in her self-portraits as Frida Kahlo in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> A&ntilde;os Entre Nosotros / 100 Years Between Us</i></b>, 2008, which was commissioned by the Instituto Cervantes de Manila. Navarroza&rsquo;s initially highly dramatic, stylized, and wistfully introspective tenor appears to have shifted to more concentrated examinations of a broader state of affairs, recently in relation to questions of power and the environment. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> particular example is her series on the nature of landscapes, the photographic medium, visual culture, and contemporary society. This is demonstrated in <b><i>Ultramar</i></b>, her portfolio project at Instituto Europeo di Design, Madrid. She exhibited <b><i>Ultramar Part 1 Falling into Place Gathered Throng</i></b> in 2012 and continued the series with <b><i>Ultramar Part 2: Hunt and Gather, Terraria</i></b>, 2013. The latter consisted of photographs of terraria made from material collected through a public call made out to Metro Manila residents to participate in foraging around the metropolis for a project dubbed <b><i>Project Terraria</i></b>. Both <b><i>Ultramar</i></b> exhibitions were done in Silverlens Galleries, an art space that also represents Navarroza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarroza has participated in the following international exhibitions: <b><i>Verso Manila: Contemporary Art from the Philippines</i></b>, 2009, in Turin, Italy; the annual touring exhibition <b><i>CUT: New Photography from SouthEast Asia</i></b> organized by VWFA Kuala Lumpur, 2010; <b><i>ASEAN-Korea &ldquo;Emerging Wave&rdquo; Asian Contemporary Photography Exhibition</i></b>, 2010, in Seoul, Korea; the <b><i>Asian Art Biennale</i></b>, 2011, in Taichung, Taiwan; and the <b><i>2012 Tokyo Month of Photography </i></b>presented by the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography.

Photography festivals in which her pieces have appeared include the Angkor Photography Festival in Cambodia, Noorderlicht Photography Festival in the Netherlands, and Photo Ireland in Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Navarroza received the Ateneo Art Award for <b><i>Polysaccharide: The Dollhouse Drama</i></b>, 2005, and <b><i>Saturnine: A Collection of Portraits, Creatures, Glass, and Shadow</i></b>, 2007; Prix de la Photographie Paris, 2009; Portfolio Preis, Germany, 2010; International Photography Awards, 2010; Lumi Photographic Art Awards, Helsinki, 2011; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Thirteen Artists Awards, 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byIris S.

Conceived as both a movement and an organization, Neo-Angono aims to produce art that invigorates and responds to contemporary Angono experience, sensibility, and consciousness. A nonprofit, artist-centered entity that is committed to experimentation and collaboration, it also seeks to keenly respond to the many forms of creative expression that emerge from and develop within the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Neo-Angono recognizes the significance of research and education in the arts, and has periodically given free seminars and workshops on the visual arts, including painting, sculpture, glass etching, and silkscreen printing as well as poetry, theater, and music to young people. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the major activities of the group is its eponymous annual public art festival, during which poetry readings, concerts, film screenings, and works of performance and installation art are offered up for the participation and enjoyment of people, locals and tourists alike. The installation and performance pieces tend to revolve around significant social issues, such as human-rights violations and extrajudicial killings, or questions of history and nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2007, the National Press Club (NPC) commissioned Neo-Angono to produce a mural on press freedom. NPC later drew the artists&rsquo; and public ire for altering what the collective had submitted without permission, allegedly because of pressure from the Presidential Security Group (PSG). Members of the PSG had dropped by the NPC office a day before the painting was to be formally unveiled&mdash;a ceremony to which President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had been invited&mdash;and had supposedly objected to &ldquo;leftist marks&rdquo; in the work, which contained a number of references to controversies under the Arroyo administration, including the disappearance of activist Jonas Burgos and the NBN-ZTE scandal. The NPC had then apparently tried to get the Neo-Angono to change the mural, but, as the members of the collective were not available, hired an unnamed artist to make the necessary revisions. This act was widely condemned as violative of the right to freedom of expression and the law on intellectual property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Neo-Angono is headed by Ian Lomongo. Previous officers and board directors include the collective&rsquo;s pioneers: Ramon &ldquo;Chitoy&rdquo; Zapata, Wire Rommel Tuazon, Carlos &ldquo;Totong&rdquo; Francisco II, Kyo Zapanta, Cherryl M. Villaflores, Keiye Miranda-Tuazon, Richard Gappi, Lomongo, Arturo Sanchez, Philip Anorico, Allan Alcantara, Peter Natividad, Isidro Santos, Neliza de Leon, and Rem Vocalan. The advisers of the group are artists Nemesio Miranda Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\"><strong>Mideo Cruz</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3743\"><strong>Iggy Rodriguez</strong></a>, art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a>, and poet-musician Jesus Manuel &ldquo;Jess&rdquo; Santiago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the members of the collective live and work in Angono, Rizal, which has produced two National Artists&mdash;namely, Carlos &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a>&rdquo; Francisco (visual arts) and Lucio San Pedro (music).

Another genre work is that of a boy playing <i>sipa</i> (traditional game that requires kicking and balancing the rattan ball on his ankle).

Santa Cruz, Manila 4 Sep 1871. d. 7 Sep 1922. Sculptor. Both his father Pedro Nepomuceno and his grandfather were wood-carvers. He married Faustina Mijares with whom he had 10 children. He was a member of the Centro de Escultores, Manila. His subjects were influenced by his reading of such books as Joseph Feuhrich&rsquo;s <b><i>Triunfo de la Religion de Jesucristo</i></b> (Triumph of the Religion of Christ), 1865, and Felix Torres Amat&rsquo;s Spanish translation of the Vulgate, <b><i>La Sagrada Familia </i></b>(The Holy Family), 1883-84, both of which had copious engravings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nepomuceno carved figures of saints, which were the order of the times. However, his <b><i>Espiritu y Material </i></b>(Spirit and Matter), a sculptural piece that depicted a priest embracing a nude girl, drew protests from the religious orders of Manila. During the American regime, his other work, <b><i>13 de Agosto</i></b> (August 13), was presented to the Saint Louis Exposition in 1904 but was again rejected. The figure of a Filipino woman brandishing a bolo against a lion and an eagle was too reminiscent of the two struggles of the Filipino people for freedom. Nepomuceno also designed and constructed floats such as the <b><i>El Ultimo Adios </i></b>(The Last Farewell), which won a silver medal in 1906, and the <b><i>El Triunfo del Patriotism Sobre la Muerte</i></b> (The Triumph of Patriotism over Death), which won a gold medal in 1907. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E.

General Santos City 2 Feb 1986. Sculptor, multimedia artist, and designer. He is the son of Carmel Chua and Ang Luan New Jr. He studied at the Philippine High School for the Arts in Mount Makiling, Laguna, in 1999-2003 and finished his bachelor of fine arts in studio arts, major in sculpture, at the University of the Philippines in 2007. Trained in three-dimensional work, New fabricates visual and tactile elements and enables representation through the introduction and appropriation of different fictional characters fleshed out from mythologies, science fiction, popular culture, and local worldviews. His manipulation of materials creates installations and built environments that employ an experiential sense of playful strangeness and conjured imaginations and fantasies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Balete</i></b>, 2009, exhibited at the Ateneo Art Gallery, is a visual reinterpretation of the <i>balete </i>or banyan tree of Philippine mythology. It is an interactive installation that was crawling, hanging, and towering biomorphically in its monumental scale on the exterior of the building structure of the gallery. <b><i>Balete </i></b>used materials like orange flexible conduits coiled together, with the surface of each tube tied and locked with white cable ties. The white cable ties were tediously installed all throughout the installation, creating an impression of unwelcoming prickly fur that was rough and itchy when touched. The work was spatially parasitic as the art was reliant on and disruptive of existing structural elements on-site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New&rsquo;s Chimera<b><i> </i></b>series is a science fiction version of the ancient mythological hybrid monster. It consists of round fiber-reinforced plastic shaped into an odd spaceship-like alien insect with many legs and one large eye. New created the eye and body of the chimera through the traditional technique of metalwork called <b>pukpok</b> (beat), a manual process of beating metal sheets to create designs and ornamentation. <b><i>Chimera</i></b> imposingly greeted visitors of the 4th Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale, 2009, as it was installed at the exhibit entrance area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">According to New, he projects his infantile creative imagination upon his works. These impulses shape the playful, incomprehensible creatures and adventurous spatial environments which are site-specific and engaging to publics activated through the artist&rsquo;s different modes of reinventing and reshaping of form. New has also served as set designer for productions done at Casa San Miguel, Zambales, and works by Sipat Lawin Ensemble and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\"><strong>Dulaang UP</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New was awarded the Ateneo Art Award in 2009 and the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byClod Marlan Krister Yambao</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Albay 29 Sep 1944. Painter. He is the son of Herinel Nuyda, a writer, and Evelyn Suntay, an Olympic swimmer. He finished with a degree of bachelor of fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas in 1965. He received two study grants to France in 1971 and 1974. Nuyda is also a recognized lepidopterist and is presently chairperson of the Insect Society of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nuyda staged his first one-person show in 1965 at the Manila YMCA Exhibition Hall. Then already involved in the study of butterflies, his paintings were inspired by the design patterns in the wings of the said insect. Blown up into abstraction, these were called <b><i>Mindscapes</i></b> by the artist. Nuyda&rsquo;s art is essentially surrealistic in sensibility, and most of his shows and paintings were titled <b><i>Search</i></b>. Held at the Solidaridad Galleries in 1967, the Search series depict light-defined geometric shapes floating in space or solidly anchored, or surrounded or veiled by mists of colors. Sometimes the geometric shapes meet or interlock to form walls or to open to corridors with glowing effects of light suggesting depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nuyda won two awards from the Art AssociationofthePhilippines: second honorable mention, <b><i>Search 39</i></b>, 1967, and second prize, <b><i>Search</i></b>, 1969.

Santa Rita, Pampanga 16 Oct 1913. d. Virginia, USA 12 Sep 1985. Painter. He studied at the University of the Philippines and holds the distinction of being the only Filipino to study heraldry abroad and to hold membership in the International Institute of Genealogy and Heraldry in Madrid. During World War II, he did intelligence work for the guerrilla movement and became a captain. As his cover, he did stage backdrops for the Associated Artists group headed by FernandoPoeSr. In the 1960s, during the administration of President Diosdado Macapagal, Ocampo served as curator of the Presidential Museum of Malaca&ntilde;an and, subsequently, as director of the National Museum and technical adviser on heraldry in the president&rsquo;s office. During this time he also taught art at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) and at the Far Eastern University, where he became head of the Department of Fine Arts in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ocampo staged the revolt against academic conservatism in the 1930s together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> and CarlosV.Francisco. The triumvirate launched a crusade to stimulate artistic development along modernist lines. In 1934, they created murals&mdash;early works in interaction&mdash;for the lobbies of the Capitol and State Theaters, which expressed their new artistic credo and the rising nationalist consciousness at the height of the Commonwealth era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ocampo soon developed his own artistic personality. A key painting of the period was his <b><i>BrownMadonna</i></b>, 1938, which indigenized the image of the Virgin Mary. <b><i>Moro Dancer</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> Dance</i></b> were celebrations of indigenous culture in lively colors and designs. These paintings are characterized by a modernist sense of design, linear rhythms, and fresh colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s Ocampo&rsquo;s art was haunted with images of the war he had just lived through. The flagellant theme, fully brought out in <b><i>Ecce Homo</i></b> (Behold the Man), arises from harrowing experiences of the war. Christ, crowned with thorns and hooded with the flagellant&rsquo;s veil, stands with arms bound together, while in the skies, warplanes zoom, trailing smoke or releasing a fleet of parachutists. In <b><i>Shades of Things to Come</i></b>, 1955, a flagellant lies prostrate, his arms forming a cross on the ground, while shadows of airplanes are reflected on the sand. These paintings in brown tones convey the feeling of the modern wasteland, littered with the debris of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The flagellant theme would undergo a significant stylistic change in the mid-1950s with the large painting <b><i>Christ in Flagellant</i></b>. Here the entire space is filled up with figures, including that of a hooded Christ on the cross. The receding space in previous works is now replaced by a vigorous design sectioned as in stained glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist was sent to Rome in 1956 by the archbishop of Manila to train for the work of designing stained glass for the ManilaCathedral. For the cathedral he did the seals of different archbishops of Manila and various images and attributes of the Virgin Mary in the country. He also did the designs for the stained-glass windows of SantoDomingoChurch in Quezon City, and the <b>sarimanok</b> (a mythical bird with a fish in its beak) for the Philamlife Building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was only in 1973, at the age of 59 and after his years in government service, that Ocampo held his first one-person show at Galerie Bleue. For this exhibit he produced a new series titled <b><i>Anthropographic Designs</i></b>, in which he paid tribute to the Tabon man. His fieldwork with Robert Fox in Palawan inspired him with images of the early Filipino: Adam and Eve growing from the ancient stalagmites and reflecting the ever-changing hues of the mysterious caves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His 1982 retrospective at the Museum of Philippine Art brought out all his themes, although the &ldquo;flagellants&rdquo; had shifted from their original somber mood to a more positive tone&mdash;the hooded figure of <b><i>Ecce Homo</i></b> now sits on a space missile in a lunar landscape. He expanded the ethnic theme to include the Ati-Atihan where masked figures cavort in gaudy revelry. In 2013, the exhibit <b><i>Mysteries and Colors: Galo Ocampo</i></b> was held at the UST Museum to celebrate his birth centenary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ocampo won awards from the Art AssociationofthePhilippines: second prize, <b><i>Pounding Rice</i></b>, 1951; honorable mention <b><i>Igorot Dance</i></b>, 1951; special award, <b><i>Weary Traveller</i></b>, 1951; and the first Rotary Golden Anniversary Award, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han</i></b>, 1955. He received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila in 1964. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo, updated by Cecilia S.

Ocampo. b. Santa Cruz, Manila 28 Apr 1911. d. Caloocan City 28 Dec 1978. National Artist for visual arts. He was the son of Emilio Ocampo and Delfina Ruiz. He married Irene Illovato in 1932, but she died in 1945. His second wife was Cresenda Valenzuela. Painter Karen Ocampo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> is his granddaughter. In 1931, he started working at the Philippine Education <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. In 1935, he worked as executive secretary of the National Paper Mills Inc. After the war, he worked in the script department of Palaris Feler and FernandoPoe Productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He began as a writer in English. He was one of the organizers of the Veronicans, a young writers&rsquo; group that included FranciscoArcellana, Estrella Alfon, N.V.M. Gonzalez, Manuel Viray, and Angel G. de Jesus, among others. His house at Maypajo, Caloocan, served as a frequent venue for their meetings. As a Tagalog fictionist, he is known for his prizewinning <b><i>Bakya </i></b>(Wooden Slippers) and <b><i>Rice and Bullets</i></b>, both showing a consciousness of the proletariat. During the Japanese occupation, Ocampo turned to writing in Tagalog and wrote plays for the stage, becoming the chief scriptwriter and assistant director of the Associated Artists. The Japanese also appointed him censor for the stage and for the <b><i>Taliba</i></b> newspaper, at the same time that he had an intelligence assignment as second lieutenant in Straughn&rsquo;s Guerrillas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He also became editor of the <b><i>Manila Sunday Chronicle Magazine</i></b>. He was producer-director of the FilipinoPlayers Guild, which specialized in radio programs, 1950-53. He became executive director and senior vice president of Philprom, 1958-68.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Together with CarlosV.Francisco, GaloB.Ocampo, and other modern artists, he was a member of the Thirteen Moderns founded in 1938. With VicenteManansala and CesarLegaspi, he formed the triumvirate of Neo-Realists. He was also a leading member of the Saturday group of artists which met regularly at the Taza de Oro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ocampo identified the several stages in the development of his art: 1929-34, Amorsolo period; 1934-45, proletarian period; 1945-63, transitional period; 1963-68, mutants period; and 1968-78, visual melody period. Since FernandoAmorsolo was the dominant artistic influence in the 1930s, most artists who began painting before the war, including Ocampo, emulated Amorsolo, although unsuccessfully, as Ocampo did not take formal studies in the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts where the maestro was based, preferring to pursue art on his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ocampo&rsquo;s proletarian period reflected the debate in the 1930s between &ldquo;proletarian art&rdquo; and &ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; which was also an issue in the United States at the time. It was during this period that World War II broke out, resulting in widespread dislocation, hunger, and misery. Under such conditions, his paintings showed the stark realities of the time, such as the painting of an emaciated man staring at an empty plate with high-rise buildings in the background to imply the wide class gap of the period. Another was the painting titled <b><i>Calvary</i></b>, 1948, which showed the triple crucifixion of Christ flanked by two thieves against the background of factories spewing smoke. In the same period, his triptych <b><i>Tatlong Larawan</i></b> (Three Pictures) also developed the religious theme. These paintings, while still largely figurative, were not in a realist style but were rather expressionist in their distortion and their use of garish colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His transitional period, 1945-63, was a period of intense creativity in painting. His works from this period became more stylized and showed an increasing tendency to abstraction in their primary concern for design, color, and texture. Some of his more complex and highly textured paintings, such as <b><i>Fiesta</i></b>, are of this period. It was also during this time that the PhilippineArtGallery (PAG) opened its doors to modernist painters and Ocampo, Legaspi, and Manansala made the PAG their second home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of his paintings of the 1960s belong to his mutants period. He derived inspiration from <b><i>The Beginning of the End</i></b>, a science-fiction fantasy film on the mutants and strange forms spewed forth by nuclear explosions. The painting <b><i>Dancing Mutants</i></b>, for instance, shows fingerlike shapes with a nervous, quivering quality. Toward the end of the 1960s, he developed into the visual melody period in which he brought back tonalities into his abstract designs of organic shapes, creating a richer form of abstraction. An example of this style is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1969, which was executed into a tapestry for the main theater of the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP). Its central motif is a bright flame which casts oscillating shadows and reflections on the surrounding design of red and yellow elements. Ocampo himself said that the work represented &ldquo;the full flowering&rdquo; of his visual melody period. It also represented the final maturation of the abstract style of the artist in painting the search for the Filipino spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His got awards from the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines: sixth prize, <b><i>Nude with Candle and Flower</i></b>, 1948; first prize, <b><i>Arabesque</i></b>, 1950; second prize, <b><i>Man and Carabao</i></b>, 1950; first prize and special award, <b><i>Ancestors</i></b>, 1951; honorable mention, <b><i>Intramuros</i></b>, 1951; third prize, <b><i>Fifty-Three E</i></b>, 1954; honorable mention, <b><i>Fifty-Four A</i></b>, 1955; second prize and purchase prize, <b><i>Nativity</i></b>, 1958; and first prize, <b><i>Circe</i></b>, 1969.

He is the son of Candido Ocampo and Loreta Marquez. He finished his elementary education at Don Bosco Technical Institute in 1970, his high school at St. Paul&rsquo;s Seminary in 1974. He took up fine arts at the University of the Philippines. From 1984 to 1986, he studied mask making at the Art Institute of Indonesia in Yogyakarta, becoming the first Filipino artist to be granted a scholarship from the Dharmasiswa Republik Indonesia. Ocampo taught art at De La Salle University, 1977-79, and at the Ateneo de Manila, 1988-89. In 1999, Ocampo with gallerist Jamima Pajati, established the Philippine International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a> Festival. Ocampo was executive director of Lingap Sining, an association of Filipino artists, and was also an executive council member of the Visual Arts Committee of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although his early works were canvas oriented, Ocampo became absorbed in multimedia and installation works that sought to recreate the precolonial roots of Philippine art found in textiles, animistic ritual offerings and practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1992, Ocampo mounted <b><i>Sutra</i></b> (Fiber Works) at the Pasilyo VictorioEdades, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), a transmedia activity-exhibition giving evidence of the typical wit, philosophical depth, and inexhaustible inventiveness of the artist.

In his later works, Ocampo explores the theme of Filipino cultural identity, marked with collaborative and participatory processes. For example, <b><i>Diaspora</i></b>,<b> </b>2005,<b> </b>was a participatory piece that delved into the displacement felt by Filipino migrant workers.<i> </i>In 2010, Ocampo received the Dodjie Dy Award for Culture and the Arts as the &ldquo;Most Outstanding Visual Artist in Isabela&rdquo; where he is based as a cultural organizer.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Paris, France 7 Sep 1879. d. 12 Jun 1942. Painter. The son of Jose O&rsquo;Farrell and Marie Blocquel, he is often mistaken for a Frenchman or Irish because of his family name. His mother was a Frenchwoman and he was born in Paris. But Chinese and Filipino blood also ran in his veins because his father was a Chinese mestizo. The first O&rsquo;Farrell, John Christopher, was the captain of a British merchant ship trading in Manila in the 18th century. In 1805, John married Catalina Tuason, granddaughter of Son Tua, the ancestor of the landed Tuason families of Manila. Catalina and John had a grandson, Mariano. Mariano in turn married Eugenia de Ocampo, and this couple sent their son Jose to study in Paris, where he met Marie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gaston took up his early education at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion and at the Colegio de San Jose de Calasanz, both in Manila. At age eight, he began his art lessons at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in Intramuros, then studied privately under FelixMartinez. When JuanLuna came back to Manila in 1894, Gaston took further studies from him. The two developed a special liking for each other, for both could paint and practice their French together. In May 1896, the two visited Japan. During this sojourn, both executed many views of the Komagatake and Kamakura regions. It is believed that the Japan trip was made primarily to deliver a message to Jose Ramos, an activist who settled in Japan, soliciting arms for the Katipunan movement. The Katipunan was discovered upon Luna&rsquo;s return from Japan followed by his arrest and imprisonment along with his brother. While Luna was away in Spain working for the pardon of his brother Antonio, Gaston studied at Ateneo de Manila where he obtained a Perito Mercantil equivalent to business management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gaston painted many artistically significant paintings of which several have survived. His self-portrait at age 16 and his <b><i>Interior del Estudio de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> </i></b>(Interior of Juan Luna&rsquo;s Studio), 1895, show the maturity of his talent at an early age. At the Saint Louis Universal Exposition of 1904, his <b><i>Portrait of Juan Luna </i></b>received a bronze medal. At the exhibition sponsored by the Sociedad Internacional de Artistas de Manila in 1908, he received a gold medal for <b><i>Portrait of Se&ntilde;orita X</i></b>. He also received a bronze medal at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915 for <b><i>Umagang Tahimik</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a>ful Morning). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his extant historical canvases is the <b><i>Betrayal of the Katipunan</i></b>, which shows Teodoro Pati&ntilde;o at the confessional. The priest was posed by the Uruguayan consul, Mr Delfino, while Pati&ntilde;o was posed by Gaston&rsquo;s faithful messenger.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Ozamiz City, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>mis Occidental 19 Nov 1977. Visual and sound artist. He is the son of Ireneo L. Olavides and Nena Bodiongan. Olavides began teaching illustration and aesthetic theory courses in 2012 at the College of Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Design and Art, under the school&rsquo;s design foundations department. He is also a musician and plays the guitar, performing and recording first with Elemento in 1999, then with Pastilan Dong! in 2013. He graduated from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a>, where he received his bachelor of fine arts, major in painting, in 2000. Upon graduating, he was employed by Tower Records, Philippines, where he worked both on and off the shop floor, designing graphics and handling all aspects of its retail merchandising activities, until its closure in late 2006. In 2007, he began selling used books and records from his own shop, Timbooktu on Katipunan Ave, where his literary, musical, and pop cultural interests further crystallized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The closing of Timbooktu coincided with the beginnings of his practice as a full-time visual artist. His first solo exhibition was <b><i>X &amp; M</i></b>,<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a>, 2007. This was followed shortly after by <b><i>Futuramanila</i></b>, 2008, a group show with 22 other contemporary Filipino artists at the Osage galleries in both Singapore and Hong Kong where Olavides&rsquo;s large-scale collage <b><i>Agos</i></b> (Flow), 2007, was exhibited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Olavides&rsquo;s professional experiences in a hybrid corporate entity like Tower Records and as an independent retailer are evident in recurring themes in his work. As an artist, he makes use of multiple forms of print and audiovisual media through various modes of collage, sampling audio, video, and print materials; recontextualizing the homogenous agenda of global media outlets to make them fit contemporary Filipino realities. His tendency to bombard his audience through musical and visual experiments captures the tensions between the monotony and subjectivity of modern life, where cultural expression is conscripted into furthering movement along the various channels of neoliberal capitalism. By framing the static and noise of everyday existence, placing these in quadrants or cutting these into verse, Olavides attempts to make sense of a widely accepted deluge of sameness, laying bare this imposed standardization, and opening it to critique and conceptualization. Olavides is a visual artist whose works present a critical view of contemporary pop culture even as it betrays a fixation with its media and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Olavides&rsquo;s short film <b><i>Pagbangon sa Katapusan </i></b>(Rise at the End,<i> </i>2012) was shown at the 11th Sharjah Biennale in 2013. He was selected as one of the CCP Thirteen Artists for 2012 and was among the Metro Manila winners of the Philippine Art Awards in 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice Sarmiento</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Manila 25 Dec 1969. Painter, printmaker, and curator. He is the son of painter and printmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\"><strong>Romulo Olazo</strong></a> and Patricia Tria. He is married to Lyn Yusi. He received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts, major in painting, from the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts, 1992. He serves as an instructor at the UP College of Fine Arts while pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in fine arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Olazo grew up in a home that doubled as a printmaking studio called 101 Workshop. It was in this space that artists like his father, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3666\"><strong>Fernando Modesto</strong></a>, Illeana Lee, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\"><strong>Nonon Padilla</strong></a> would pull prints, with the young Olazo as spectator, even occasional <i>salingpusa </i>(hanger-on/kibitzer). Despite his having spent his formative years around artists and the daily making of art, it was only in his junior year in high school at Jose Abad Memorial School that his interest was undeniably piqued. It was about the same time when his father taught printmaking at the same school. It was the senior Olazo who encouraged his son to enter the Art Association of the Philippines annual print competition in which his work bagged the third prize in 1986. The young Olazo would go on to catch the critical attention of both artists and critics, and join his father on trips to the Thomas Jefferson Library where he saw documentaries on American abstract expressionist painters like Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. It was within a minimalist strain of abstraction that Olazo found an eventual fit, albeit with a lot of leeway for experimentation and personal nuance. Chabet&rsquo;s influence came in the form of exposure to modern tendencies as well as a shared keenness toward taking on different media, methods of manipulating materials, and playing with form. Olazo&rsquo;s art practice eventually broadened in scope to include paintings, prints, and installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As seen in a particular generation of Chabet&rsquo;s students, Olazo&rsquo;s paintings are characteristically highly textured and come with impastoed surfaces. The tactile and graphic nature of his works alludes to a highly gestured process that subtly brings imagery to the fore. However, the enabling of form makes up only a fraction of his motivations. For Olazo, the artistic process is intimated with his spirituality, ideologies, and an engaged and constant dialogue with his own and other artists&rsquo; bodies of work. His exhibition <b><i>Hotel Painter</i></b>, 2013, questions and challenges the place of abstraction beyond the auspices of a limiting decorative bent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Olazo continues to do solo and group exhibitions in various galleries, museums, and art spaces in Manila. He has also shown in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and New York. In 1987, he participated in the 8th Biennial Internacional de Arte Valparaiso, in Valparaiso, Chile, and in the 3rd International Biennial Print Exhibit at the Taipei Fine Arts Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He received the grand prize for his work in the Philippine Association of Printmakers Open Graphic Arts Competition in 1987.

Calatagan, Batangas 21 Jul 1934. d. 18 Aug 2015. Printmaker, painter. He was the son of Vivencio Olazo and Simeona Gamez. Olazo was married to Patricia Tria with whom he had three children; son Jonathan is also a visual artist. He studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Olazo is associated primarily with his Diaphanous series consisting of paintings, some as large as 213.4 x 457.2 cm, which are produced through an original collograph technique that the artist developed himself. As paintings, they are made of exceedingly fine transparent screens composited as overlapping layers that create patterns of relative transparency and density. In these works, which are often in classic black-and-white, color is usually restrained to cool monochrome blues and greens, and occasional yellows. With this particular technique, he is able to achieve light ethereal effects or luminous passages that emanate from the thin films that filter the light from the surface, evoking increasing depths. The artist approaches color as objective phenomenon, although he does not exclude nor negate the subjective dimension, for such a subtle art may easily be expressive of highly nuanced states of feeling. In his explorations, Olazo has often modified the layering technique by crumpling and folding the delicate diaphanous tissues, by heightening tonal play in thin, sharp facets, and by superimposing brisk gestural strokes to stimulate the surface. The artist has a figurative side that produces elegant nudes and tonal watercolor landscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first solo show was held at the Luz Gallery. In 1974, he held his solo show at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). In 2008, Olazo&rsquo;s solo exhibition <b><i>AZOOL </i></b>consisting of the artist&rsquo;s variably tinged blueworks was awarded the Museum Director&rsquo;s Choice of the Year and shown at the Artist Space, Ayala Museum. In 2009, Ayala Museum with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/80\"><strong>Paseo</strong></a> Gallery organized <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\"><strong>Romulo Olazo</strong></a>: A 40-Year Retrospective</i></b>. In 2012, Olazo&rsquo;s 40th solo exhibition, <b><i>Diaphanous by the Sea</i></b>, was shown in Mactan City, Cebu. Another solo exhibition, <b><i>Romulo Olazo: Black and White Redux</i></b>, was held at Paseo Gallery, SM Megamall Art Center, Mandaluyong City, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early in his career as a young artist, from 1963 to 1968, he won several awards in the annual art competitions of the Philippine Advertising Counselors, a local advertising company in Manila. In 1969, he participated for the first time in a national show, the 22nd art exhibition of the Art Association of the Philippines. In 1971, he won first prize for <b><i>Sepia II, 2nd Ed</i></b>, and third prize for <b><i>Shame</i></b>, both collagraphs in the mixed media category of the annual competition of the Philippine Association of Printmakers. He won again in 1972 the second and the third prizes in the mixed media category of the same competition. This was the same year he was named one of the CCP Thirteen Artists awardees. In Jul 1976, he won special mention at the Philippine National Bank&rsquo;s 60th Anniversary Art Competition with his work <b><i>Diaphanous 52</i></b>. In 1979, his entry <b><i>Permutation No. 2-A Book</i></b> won honorable mention at the 11th International Biennial Exhibition of Prints in Tokyo. In 1980, his <b><i>Transparencies and Permutations</i></b> was a finalist in the Mobil Art Awards, and he received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. In 1981, Olazo was selected as one of the Five Outstanding Living Artists recognized under the Mobil Art Awards for Philippine Art, along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\"><strong>Ang Kiukok</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>.

Manila 18 Jul 1973. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a> artist. He is the son of Danilo Oliveria and Elizabeth Cordero. His formal art education consists of painting units earned at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University and the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Fine Arts, 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oliveria&rsquo;s body of work is made up of oil paintings, mixed media collages, sculpture, and installations. Culling texts and images both from the virtual and the tangible, Oliveria takes what is seemingly an overwhelming pile of material and repurposes these for imaginatively new configurations. The bits and pieces that make up the elements of his work come from the everyday, from books, magazines, even the dizzying goldmine that is the world wide web. His approach does not come from an intrinsically value-laden nor ideologically driven academic bent. Rather, he reframes the images and uses them to create visual puns and provocative annotations that sting nonetheless. His image-making is sometimes jarring, while others are judiciously composed. This ability to travel back and forth between the categorical and the liminal underlies Oliveria&rsquo;s unpredictability, counterposed to a palpably committed temperament and a sense of awareness especially about the conditions and contexts influencing the enterprise of art and how the artist figures in the art world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oliveria has shown extensively through solo and group exhibitions in a variety of art spaces in Manila from galleries and museums to artist-run and alternative spaces. He frequently exhibited at the now-defunct Mag:net Galleries and was part of the artists&rsquo; collective that ran Surrounded by Water. In his exhibition <b><i>Truth Adjustment</i></b>, 2008, Mag:net Gallery, Katipunan, a series of paintings were posed as a conversation ongoing amidst a procession of tombstone plaster casts. About 50 casts coax viewers to recognize their obsession with the superfluous rhetoric that often circumvents discursive channels of meaning and significance. Also in 2008, Oliveria was one of the artists selected by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a> to participate in <b><i>No Soul for Sale</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>a festival cum exhibition of independent art spaces and collectives from all over the world brought together as an eclectic mix of practices, projects, and programming. Set in the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern, London, the exhibition component of the Philippine delegation was later restaged at Taksu, Singapore, as part of Philippine Art Trek IV 2010 under the title <b><i>Serial Killers: From Tate Modern to TAKSU Singapore</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oliveria is one of the artists making up the loose group Bastards of Misrepresentation, a project/collective that showed <b><i>Doing Time in Filipino Time</i></b>,<i> </i>2010, Freies Museum, Berlin, followed by the multisited exhibition <b><i>Bastards of Misrepresentation: New York Edition</i></b>, 2012. Oliveria has also shown in Jakarta, Hong Kong, Beijing, Sydney, Tasmania, and Graz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was a part of the first batch of artists in residence under the Big Sky Mind Artists Projects Foundation in Cubao, 2003-04. This was followed by a three-week artist residency in Tetra Art Space in Fukuoka, Japan. The program was facilitated by curator Mizuki <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1158\"><strong>Endo</strong></a>. In 2012, he conducted his residency at Galerie Zimmermann Kratochwill, Graz, Austria. Oliveria was one of the three winners of the inaugural Ateneo Art Awards in 2004 for his exhibition <b><i>Instinct vs. Learning</i></b>,<b> </b>Mag:net Gallery.

Painter. He was the son of Luis Olmedo and Lourdes Velozeo. He was married to Bienvenida Rodriguez with whom he had two children. He graduated from the Mapua Institute of Technology in 1959. His first one-person show was at the Solidaridad Galleries in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Olmedo painted in the figurative expressionist style. While most of his works consist of faces of people, these are not portraits in the sense of physical likeness but are rather haunting soul portraits of humans warped and distorted by anguish and suffering, victims of social injustice as well as of their own tortured psyches. As such, they do not necessarily convey a palpable physical presence but are more like wraiths and orphans from a gray limbo. While many of the faces are universalized, without clues or props to suggest a specific context of class or occupation, there are also a large number that are evidently society&rsquo;s victims, such as the <i>sakada</i> (seasonal cane workers), the bar girls of Mabini, and the hungry poor. His gallery of &ldquo;portraits&rdquo; date back to the artist&rsquo;s <b><i>Singkong Suka</i></b> (Five Centavo Worth of Vinegar) in the 1960s with its inhabitants of the run-down corner store and cheap joints. He described his art as &ldquo;imploding&rdquo; into an inner universe where bodies glow from within like phosphorescent creatures in unfamiliar waters, at the same time that on a social plane they convey the sense of dehumanization and alienation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was gold medalist in the 1979 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> Annual Art Competition and his <b><i>Faces of Torment</i></b> was one of the five finalists in the 1980 Mobil Art Awards. In 1979, he was the Philippine representative to the international competition of painters in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France, and in 1988 to the international competition of painters in Baghdad, Iraq.

Manila 27 Jan 1944. Sculptor, architect. He was born to Capt Vicente Orlina and Paulina Gahol. He is married to Lay Ann Lee with whom he has three children. He obtained a degree in architecture from the University of Santo Tomas in 1965, after which he put up the architectural firm Ramon G. Orlina and Associates. He was the president of the Society of Philippine Sculptors, 1986-88; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>, 1992-99; Philippine National Committee of the International Association of Art, UNESCO, 1992-99; and director of the Artists&rsquo; Association of the Philippines Foundation Inc, 1998-2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For his 1975 first one-person show, <b><i>Reflections</i></b>, Orlina chose glass as his medium. In 1976, he developed sculptural form using glass when the Republic Glass Corporation in Pasig, Rizal, gave him access to the cullets or slabs of residual glass for use as his raw material. Orlina developed an appropriate technology to transform these into sculpture. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his first major works was <b><i>Arcanum XIX Paradise</i></b> <b><i>Regained</i></b> for the lobby of the Silahis International Hotel. Measuring 1.8 x 3.2 x 0.6 m, this showed an optimum use of the medium, its multifaceted green transparent blocks capturing the light like cut emeralds. This work opened the way for him to study studio glass technology in Czechoslovakia, Paris, and New York. Orlina&rsquo;s work consists of glass murals and table sculptures sited within an architectural setting. While achieving harmony and integrity of form, he creates a lively interplay between transparent and translucent areas, polished, matte, and frosted surfaces, or prismatic areas and smooth planes in a dialogue between long graceful movements and straight angular definitions. One of his important local achievements is the glass altar and overall sculptural architectural design of the Greenbelt Chapel in Makati. He has done a number of public glass sculptures in several Asian countries such as <b><i>Fertile Crescent</i></b> in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his other solo exhibitions are <b><i>Preview of a Touch of Glass</i></b> and <b><i>A Touch of Glass</i></b>, Hong Kong, 1993; <b><i>Orlina in Davao</i></b>, Genluna Gallery, 1995; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\"><strong>Ramon Orlina</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a>s</i></b>, Seattle, 1996; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>in ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></strong></a> of Freedom), George Sison Gallery, 1998; <b><i>Glass in Silver</i></b>, ArtSpace Glorietta, 2000; <b><i>Glasscapes</i></b>, Genluna Gallery, 2001; <b><i>Translucent Life</i></b>, Gallery Nine, 2002; <b><i>Quintessence: 30th Year in Sculpture</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 2006; <b><i>Abstract Emeralds</i></b>, Galerie Joaquin, 2007; <b><i>Luminosity: The Colors of Orlina</i></b>, SMU Art Gallery, Singapore, 2008; and <b><i>Highlights</i></b>, Art Verite Gallery, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982, he won the best entry in the 35th AAP Annual Art Competition and a gold medal in the 1983 AAP photography competition.

In the following year, he was conferred by the ASEAN Business Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with the third ASEAN Achievement Award for visual arts. He received the Dangal ng Batangas Award on the 415th Batangas Foundation Day and the &ldquo;Mr. F Prize&rdquo; of the Toyamura International Sculpture Biennale &rsquo;99 in Hokkaido, Japan.

His installations incorporate video and audio technology to reflect on issues related to globalization and human rights. <b><i>Ode to Empire</i></b>, 2012, is a sound collage made from archival video and film clips, showing the rise of the United States of America as a world military superpower. <b><i>Murmur</i></b>, 2012, engages the phenomenon of <i>desaparecidos</i>&mdash;activists who have disappeared against their will due to actions by the state&mdash;by inviting viewers to listen to a poem through earphones suspended from a low ceiling. Other installations explore the use of intermedia, such as television sets and video clips, to produce commentary on the state of mass media, land reform, and poverty. Ortiz is also regularly commissioned to produce illustrations, poster designs, comics, political cartoons, and drawings for advocacy campaigns of people&rsquo;s organizations. This practice is reflected in his exhibitions through works such as the mural <b><i>Palabas-Papasok</i></b> (Outgoing-Incoming), 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ortiz held his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Sandosenang Sarap or The Lies and Farce of I</i></b><b><i>&ntilde;igo Ramus and the Rivet Thieves</i></b>, 2007, at the West Gallery in Quezon City.

Manila 27 Jul 1913. d. United States 1979. Painter. He was the son of Mauricio Oteyza, a Filipino concert violinist in the United States and Dolores Sta Maria. He was a cousin of filmmaker Eric de Guia aka KidlatTahimik. He married Leonila Madrid and had a daughter. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the pioneers in the Neo-Realist style, Oteyza turned to art in the mid-1930s. He finished a bachelor of science degree in engineering at the University of the Philippines and a masteral degree in physics at the Far Eastern University. Oteyza began to paint as influenced by artist friends with whom he associated with while working as engineer and head of radio and TV production for J. Walter Thompson-Manila. By 1949 he was encouraged to take up painting when his works won in several art competitions. The critic MagtanggolAsa wrote that as early as 1947, Hernando R. Ocampo and VictorOteyza were already experimenting on non-objectivism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oteyza is acclaimed today for his Plastic Engineering series of paintings, which he might have begun as early as 1947. The title evidently refers to Oteyza&rsquo;s exploration of plastic space on canvas, filling it up with pencil-thin shapes placed in different directions and interacting with each other such that they began to suggest planes or spaces of color floating in the resulting three-dimensional space. <b><i>Plastic Engineering # 13 </i></b>and <b><i>Untitled</i></b>, both reproduced in <b><i>Art in the Philippines</i></b>, 1958, are outstanding examples of this particular exploration of Oteyza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1965, he held a one-person show at the Galerie Bleue, showing pure abstract forms suggestive of light feathery objects and cracking surfaces. This was followed by shows at Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a> and Luz Gallery. In 1969, he migrated to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oteyza was awarded fifth prize by the Art AssociationofthePhilippines for his <b><i>Perfect State </i></b>in 1949, and his work <b><i>Study</i></b> was cited in the First Exhibition of Non-objective Art staged at the PhilippineArtGallery. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Painter. He married a woman named Leocadia, with whom he had a daughter, Isabel Pablo, who later married the painter Isidro Arceo. Known as Capitan Viring, Pablo lived in San Fernando de Dilao (now Paco), Manila. Among all the known painters of mature skills by the 1850s, Pablo was the most likely to have belonged to the first batch of enrollees at the Academia de Dibujo under DamianDomingo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pablo&rsquo;s earliest signed and dated work, 1836, is the portrait <b><i>Don Paterno Molo y Agustin</i></b>, 1786-1835, which the painter might have started while the sitter was still alive or which he might have painted from a miniature, after the subject&rsquo;s demise. This work has been adjudged as &ldquo;stiff,&rdquo; a term associated with &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; or folk portraiture, probably because it was the early work of a formally schooled painter who was still young and self-conscious. Pablo&rsquo;s other known works are <b><i>Don Maximo Paterno y Yamson</i></b>, signed and dated, 1852, <b><i>Obispo Pedro Agurto, OSA</i></b>, signed and dated, 1859 (Augustinian Parish Convent Library, Cebu City); and <b><i>Obispo Juan Jose Aragones, OSA </i></b>(Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace, Vigan, Ilocos Sur), signed but not dated. All these portraits are remarkable for the vivid depiction of the features of the sitters and the meticulous rendition of the embroidery of their garments, which show Pablo&rsquo;s training as a miniaturist. <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251979776\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"><em><strong> </strong> </em><v:textbox><em><strong> </strong> </em></v:textbox></v:shape><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Tarlac 27 Apr 1967. Painter. He is the son of Oscar Pacquing and Marilou Agonoy. He studied editorial design at the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Fine Arts, 1984-89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pacquing is distinguished for his deft painterly handling of planar surfaces rendered abstractedly in their invoking of urban spaces under construction, or evincing the weathering of time and physical elements. His tightly composed pieces often consisting of scratched and/or unevenly applied pigment register as subtly raw human traces of intervention upon ground subjected to a seeming loss of control or desired spontaneity. Pacquing&rsquo;s inclination toward abstract expressionism of a decidedly minimalist strain sets him apart from earlier and later generations of abstract painters given to dramatic flair and chromatic flourish. In the course of his artistic career, Pacquing&rsquo;s works have ranged from the playfully enigmatic to a somewhat dark minimalism, both of which resist easy interpretation. Seemingly more random than graffiti, his works suggest a disjunction of the everyday. In his multilayered images of positive and negative spaces, backgrounds and foregrounds, half-revelations and palimpsests, meanings rife with contradiction and irony may be gathered. Yet for all their apparent opacity, his abstract works draw reference from objects as disparate as termite hills as in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a> Mounds</i></b>, 2010, and internal combustion engines of <b><i>Recent Works</i></b>, 2011, with the latter described as both &ldquo;a praise and a lamentation for the gifts of the Industrial Revolution.&rdquo; In both instances, the main theme explored is human intervention in the world, presented with disconcerting effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first exhibit, <b><i>Chasms-Saltando-Coalesce</i></b>, at the West Gallery in 1993. His solo exhibitions include <b><i>Premise Trumps Plot</i></b>, 2013, West Gallery; <b><i>Potato</i></b> <b><i>Motion</i></b>, 2011, Finale Art File; <b><i>Things We Miss While Waiting</i></b>, 2009, West Gallery; <b><i>Making Truth</i></b> <b><i>Forgettable</i></b>, 2008, Finale Art File; <b><i>Shape Memory</i></b>, 2007, Mag:net Gallery; and <b><i>Dripping Weight</i></b>, 2006, Finale Art File. In 2000, his exhibition <b><i>Drawings</i> </b>was held at Vermont Studio Center, USA.

Bayambang, Pangasinan 18 Apr 1916. d. 2002. Painter, architect. He was the son of Enrique Pardo and Remedios Sabado. He married Gertrudes Lim with whom he had five children. He finished his elementary and high school studies at San Alberto College in Dagupan, Pangasinan. He studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) where he also took up painting. He impressed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>, then director of the UST School of Architecture and Fine Arts, with the bold stylization of forms. Edades then enlisted him to the core of the modernist movements, making Pardo one of the Thirteen Moderns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pardo specialized in urban planning as an architect. He finished a master&rsquo;s degree in environmental planning at the University of the Philippines and also a one-term scholarship grant at the Massachussets Institute of Technology. Despite continuing to pursue his architectural practice, he did not put down his paintbrushes through his later years. He staged his last solo exhibition at the Manila Midtown Hotel in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pardo&rsquo;s paintings are characterized by bold wavy outlines that capture the essence of his subjects while at the same time rendering them in stylized movement. His early period, exemplified by <b><i>Muslim Woman Combing Her Hair</i></b>, 1943, demonstrates his energetic contours. In this piece, the undulating long hair of the woman acts as counterpoint to the curve of her body. The concise depiction of the shapes, on the other hand, suggests the elemental way of life of the subject. Fellow artist GaloOcampo in an essay in the <b><i>Philippine Review</i></b>, 1944, referred to this piece as &ldquo;Long Hair&rdquo; and praised its &ldquo;planar composition and intense color scheme that make it stand out in spite of its small size.&rdquo; In <b><i>Pulubi</i></b> (Beggar), 1952, Pardo set forth the image of a beggar with sharply drawn lines with color applied to mimic flat watercolor to approximate abstract form. In <b><i>Corazon de Maria </i></b>(plant called Heart of Mary), Pardo suggested a grouping of plants through his characteristically bold outline that evoked heart-shaped leaves. Pardo again picked up these plants as subject in 1989, using their leaves as a stepping-stone to a meaningful and organic abstract image. Even as he continued painting, he also later went on to do metal sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pardo won awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: third prize for <b><i>Water Bearer</i></b>, 1951; third prize for <b><i>Pulubi</i></b>, 1952; and second prize in photography for <b><i>Stairway Pattern</i></b>, 1953. In Apr 2003, a year after his passing, the Ateneo Art Gallery held an exhibit in memory of Pardo titled <b><i>Jose S.

His son Mikel is a painter and graphic artist. Parial graduated with a bachelor of fine arts from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1969.

Many of his rubbercuts portrayed mother-and-child, <i>calesa</i> (horse-drawn rig) drivers, and mythical subjects, but marked by a lively decorative appeal and an unusual approach to the figure, with an emphasis on two-dimensional design. In painting, he developed a strong folk quality. His 1979 Moriones series is characterized by vigorous design and vivid hues. His works also have a strong sense of organic life, in which plants have spiky rhythmic shapes and intense colors. He has developed his own figurative style that brings out the expressiveness of figures, at the same time that there is a unity of the human subjects, such as female nudes, with the whole of organic life. He has pursued folk and mythological interests in his art, in which the woman figure is central whether as mother, temptress, Eve in a native paradise, or even the Virgin Mary in all her splendor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first one-person show was in 1965. Since then until his death in 2013, he accomplished 28 solo and 160 group exhibitions in the Philippines and abroad. In his later works, he explored the fusion of photography and painting, or painted photography, in an exhibit titled <b><i>The Peripatetic Process of Parial&rsquo;s Painted Photographs</i></b> at the Kaida Art Gallery in Quezon City in 2009, and at the Francesca Gallery in SM Megamall in 2012.

Negros Occidental 17 Aug 1963. Visual and performance artist. His parents are Rudolfo Pasilan and Marita Olladas. His younger brother Neil is also a visual artist. Pasilan has a diploma in fine arts from the Western Australia School of Art, Design, and Media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\"><strong>Diokno Pasilan</strong></a> may be described as a pilgrim between ports, his art finely honed by his interest in locale and its relations to a wider world. Prior to settling in Perth, Australia, in 1998, he traveled the Philippine archipelago with the famed folk band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a>, designing stage backdrops for performances. Prior to migrating, he was also involved with another iconic band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4129\"><strong>Pinikpikan</strong></a>. Plying routes across the Asia Pacific, Pasilan mounted solo exhibitions in Perth, Manila, and Singapore. Diasporic travel and local lifeways were abiding themes in these exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pasilan navigates his way across various territories through the vehicle of art. This was most pronounced in <b><i>Ganta</i></b>, 2013, an exhibition at the University of the Philippines Jorge B. Vargas Museum. He utilized the <i>gantangan</i>, a wooden cube equivalent to <i>celemin</i>,<i> </i>a unit of measure widely used for grains, as metaphor and tool. Through photographs, prints, sculpture, installation, sound, and performance, his works traced the way of life of Palawan&rsquo;s senior residents. His primary materials were given to weathering and effacing: rust, sand, wax, and coffee stains. His methods of making art and manner of assembling and presenting them place the themes of fortitude, resilience, presence, and loss in relief. While vast in scope and varied in form, Pasilan&rsquo;s assembly of objects explore these themes eloquently. Most notable of his pieces were wall-bound back-lit portraits of senior residents framed inside wooden gantangan, connected to each other by a network of gnarled electric wires intimating the form of an aged tree rooted to earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For <b><i>SV Locomote</i></b>, a solo exhibit at The Drawing Room Gallery, Gillman Barracks, Singapore, Pasilan collects objects from his home in Ballarat, Victoria, and interweaves them with memories of growing up in Visayas Island. Central to his recollections is the boatbuilding tradition, an enterprise his family practiced during his growing-up years in Negros Occidental through their eventual move to Bacolod City. The artist plots landings on shores to voyages across seas, from his travels with the folk band Asin, to his interactions with communities in Palawan, his relocation to Australia, and his recurring visits to Manila. These acts of passage consolidate Pasilan&rsquo;s diverse body of work. Moving across mediums and making art of varied forms coupled with a nuanced understanding of passage, belonging, and wandering consistently inform Pasilan&rsquo;s art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pasilan has done solo exhibitions since 2003 in the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore. Among these were <b><i>Ballarat ID</i></b>, 2013, Slot Gallery, Sydney, Australia, and <b><i>ID</i></b>, 2011, Kurb Gallery, Perth, Western Australia. Pasilan&rsquo;s pieces have also been included in group exhibitions in Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Italy. He has participated widely in performance workshops in Australia. <b><i>Ganta</i></b>, his 2013 show at the UP Vargas Museum, included a performance piece and sound recording. Pasilan&rsquo;s performance pieces have also been staged at the Bagasbas International Eco-Arts Festival in 2003 and 2010.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byTessa Maria Guazon</strong> </em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources: </strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Asia Art Archive 2014a; Cultural Precinct 2014; Drawing Room Gallery 2014a; <i>Snippets</i> 2011a.</p>\r\n"

Installation artist-curator. He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree, major in painting, from the College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines Diliman, and won the Gawad Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda for Best Thesis, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pastrana has established a reputation for turning out consistently understated work that takes everyday objects to speak evocatively about a broad range of ideas. In <b><i>Collapsible Stream</i></b>, for instance, he took a discarded fisherman&rsquo;s boat, chopped it into pieces and then sent the pieces by mail from Kyoto, Japan, where he was doing an artist&rsquo;s residency, to Busan, South Korea, where he exhibited as one of the artists in the Busan Biennale, 2008. This indexical reference to the trafficking of objects and ideas is something that logically proceeds from his interest in the cognitive summoning of meaning in another work, <b><i>First Attempt at Social <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> or Breaking the Fourth Wall</i></b>, 2011, which consisted of a cake that guests were tauntingly invited to partake of, except that they first had to deal with the jagged glass shards that were foisted on its surface. Pastrana also undertook <b><i>99%</i></b>, 2014, in one of the last exhibitions at Silverlens, Gillman Barracks, Singapore. In this work, Pastrana counts on an elaborate narrative that can be taken as a contemporary tale of the life of things&mdash;in this case, a car destined for the trash heap but instead sold off with 99 percent of the proceeds used to purchase the corresponding amount of gold, which was tiny. This was then shown at the gallery as part of a video installation screening the narrative transformation. This obtuse but often poetic upending of the skew of fates, of the impoverished and disempowered 99 percent vis-&agrave;-vis the power elite 1 percent, is typical of how Pastrana&rsquo;s work delivers several substrata of stories which beholders are drawn to confront.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Pastrana&rsquo;s other solo exhibitions are<b><i> Sustaining Symmetry</i></b>, 2000, Big Sky Mind; <b><i>Echolalia</i></b>, 2002, Finale Art Gallery; <b><i>Detour/Set/Fraction</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a>, 2003; <b><i>Actuality/Virtuality</i></b>, 2003, IAF Shop, Fukuoka City; <b><i>Stray Bullets</i></b>, 2004, Finale Art Gallery; <b><i>New Collages</i></b>, 2008, 20 Square;<b><i> Indivisibilis</i></b>, 2009, SLab; and<b><i> Vivo Fragmenta</i></b>, 2011, Bangkok University Gallery. He has participated in various international group exhibitions in Thailand, Italy, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland, and various venues in the United States of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from starting up the now-defunct artist-run space Future Prospects at the former Marikina Shoe Exchange turned Cubao Ex, and programming the short-lived Theo Gallery in Makati, Pastrana continues to be active as both practicing artist and curator-organizer. He collaborates with other artists through partnerships such as Project Joint with Stanley Ruiz, and the design initiative Broke with Jeremy Guiab. Among the exhibitions he either curated or co-curated are <b><i>On the Radar: Six New Symptoms</i></b>, 2011, Silverlens; <b><i>Complete and Unabridged II</i></b>, Osage Art Foundation, 2011; <b><i>Ley Hunting</i></b> 1 and 2, 2012 and 2013, Silverlens; <b><i>The Midnight Marriage</i></b>, 2013, Silverlens; <b><i>Fundacion Broke</i></b>, 2013, Art Informal; <b><i>Relikt</i></b>, 2013, <b><i>The Shadow Factory</i></b> and <b><i>Space and Two Points</i></b>, 2014, all at Silverlens Gillman Barracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pastrana has been awarded residencies at Bangkok University Gallery, 2004 and 2010, and by Japan Foundation under the Jenesys Program, 2008.

Adelaida&rsquo;s siblings were also artists led by her older half-sister Paz, considered one of the most prolific women visual artists in the 19th century. Paz painted <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2147\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2147\"><strong>Bodegon</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Still Life)<b> </b>and<b> <i>Frutas y Canasta </i></b>(Fruits and Basket), the earliest known existing painting by a woman visual artist in the Philippines. Another sister, Dolores Paterno, composed <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/890\"><strong>La Flor de Manila</strong></a> </i></b>aka <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a></i></b>. Pedro Alejandro Paterno, her brother, wrote the novel <b><i>Ninay</i></b>, 1885, the first novel in Spanish written by a Filipino, as well as the libretto of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\"><strong>Sangdugong Panaguinip</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>). Another sister, Trinidad, made embroidery using human hair, as exemplified by <b><i>Escena Rural con Aguador </i></b>(Rural Scene with Water Carrier), ca 1890s. Concepcion (Concha) Paterno was one of the women who joined the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition) in Manila, in which she exhibited a landscape done in embroidery. Adelaida&rsquo;s older sisters must have taught her to embroider using hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The catalogue of the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas in Manila reveals that Adelaida submitted an embroidered landscape for the exposition. However, the whereabouts and status of this embroidered work are not known. In 1896, Adelaida painted <b><i>Escena del Rio Pasig </i></b>(Pasig River Scene). In 1897, when Adelaida was 17, she produced three embroideries using human hair on Chinese silk: [<b><i>Country Scene</i></b>],<i> </i>[<b><i>Rural Scene with Child</i></b>],<i> </i>and<i> <b>Vista de Mariquina </b></i>(View of Marikina). These three works portray women of the working class from the viewpoint of an <i>ilustrado </i>(educated native) woman. Adelaida&rsquo;s use of human hair to depict a scene and figures is admirable, considering that she had no training in anatomy. While the influence of her older sister Paz can be discerned in her landscape genre painting, particularly in regard to the combination of themes, her embroidery work using hair is unique to Adelaida. The three works are in the Central Bank collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Adelaida was inclined not only toward painting and embroidery but also toward music. According to Manuel (1970, 117), she studied music under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3931\"><strong>Victorino Carrion</strong></a> and even appeared in <i>ensayos musicales </i>(musical rehearsals).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like her older sister Paz, Adelaida never married. Adelaida died at the age of 82. She was then the last survivor among the Paterno siblings. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEloisa May P.

Santa Cruz, Manila 1 Nov 1867. d. 25 Aug 1914. Paz was the ninth of Don Maximo Molo Agustin Polo Paterno&rsquo;s children, the eighth with his second wife Carmina Devera Ignacio. Paz&rsquo;s siblings were also inclined toward the arts. Paz&rsquo;s youngest half-sister, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3708\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a>ida Paterno</strong></a>, was known for hair embroidery. Dolores Paterno is known as the composer of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/890\"><strong>La Flor de Manila</strong></a> </i></b>(Flower of Manila). Her brother Pedro Alejandro Paterno wrote the libretto of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\"><strong>Sangdugong Panaguinip</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), the first opera staged in the country, in 1902.<i> </i>Another sister, Trinidad, also made embroidery using human hair as seen in her work titled <b><i>Rural Scene with Water Carrier</i></b>, ca 1890s. Concepcion (Concha) Paterno joined the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition) in Manila,<i> </i>where she exhibited a <b>paisaje</b><i> </i>(landscape) done in embroidery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura was still not open to women at that time, Paz studied painting and drawing with private tutors who happened to be the three leading painters of the time: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\"><strong>Lorenzo Guerrero</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3653\"><strong>Felix Martinez</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3454\"><strong>Teodoro Buenaventura</strong></a>. Critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3803\"><strong>Emmanuel Torres</strong></a> credits Guerrero specifically for Paz&rsquo;s deftness in her <b>bodegones</b> or still lifes of fruits (Torres 1980, 60).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At age 17, Paz painted <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2147\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2147\"><strong>Bodegon</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Still Life) and <b><i>Frutas y Canasta </i></b>(Fruits and Basket). These two pieces are the earliest known existing painting by a woman visual artist in the Philippines. In 1885, she painted <b><i>Frutas y <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> </i></b>(Fruits and Flowers), <b><i>Escena del Rio con Banca </i></b>(River Scene with Banca), and <b><i>Escena del Rio con Barcos de Vapor </i></b>(River Scene with Steamboat). Another work,<i> </i>[<b><i>Still Life with Bird</i></b>], is undated, but scholars assert this may also have been painted around the same period. As in her first work, <b><i>Bodegon</i></b>, Paz also combined landscape and still life in this painting. Paz&rsquo;s works, however, were not limited to landscapes and still life.<i> </i>She also painted [<b><i>Portrait of a Woman</i></b>],<i> </i>which is now in a private collection. Paz appears to have been the most prolific of the women visual artists in the 19th<sup> </sup>century. In the span of two years, she produced seven works, all in oil and canvas. Paz exhibited works in the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas in Manila. Among these were a paisaje, four bodegones, and another paisaje titled <b><i>Orillas del Pasig </i></b>(Banks of the Pasig).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paz suffered from tuberculosis and lived in Santa Ana, Herran, to recuperate. According to other relatives, she probably painted her paisajes from this family home but must have been forced to stop painting because of her illness. She died unmarried at the age of 47. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eloisa May P.

His first acquisition was a collage by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a>, a purchase that he made in the 1970s. The trove has grown increasingly since then, reaching over a thousand in number in the form of paintings of landscapes, portraits, <b>letras y figuras</b> (letters and figures), and <b>tipos del pais</b> (country genre); sculptures of <b>santos</b> (icon saints) of all types; ivory; furniture; and salakot. The artworks illustrate turning points in the history of Philippine art from the 18th century to the present&mdash;the periodical and stylistic shifts from religious and secular painting in the late 18th and 19th centuries, to the academic and conservative tradition, the emergence of modernism, and on to the contemporary. Rare and iconic works by notable artists form a significant part of the collection. There are early pieces, works that define artistic achievements or mark important biographical moments in the artist&rsquo;s life. Likewise, there are works that signal the artist&rsquo;s transition from one medium and technique to another, or impart new explorations in subject matter and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The following are among the most significant in the collection: the self-portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a>, 19th century; <b><i>La Virgen Maria</i></b> (The Virgin Mary), a religious image in oil and wood by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3548\"><strong>Simon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a></strong></a>, late 19th century; the two versions of <b><i>En el Paco </i></b>(In Paco) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>, 1880 and 1884; and <b><i>Waves at Sunset </i></b>by Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, 1890. Fabian de la Rosa, one of the first faculty members of the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts, is represented in the collection through the genre painting <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Filipino Love Song),<b><i> </i></b>1932, as well as through a rare portrait of his nephew, the young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, 1903. Works by Amorsolo include <b><i>Portrait of Morgan Sweet at Age 10</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1929, and <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1924. Distinct works by modernists include <b><i>Chief Galo</i></b>, 1907, an early work by the architect painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\"><strong>Juan Arellano</strong></a>; <b><i>Self-Portrait</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1927, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>, a work the artist did when he was a new graduate; <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1948, a large-scale painting by Galo Ocampo; <b><i>Maria Makiling</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1947, a lyrical interpretation of folklore by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a>; <b><i>Veronica</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1957, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>; <b><i>Sacramental</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1956, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3686\"><strong>Hernando Ocampo</strong></a>; <b><i>Nativity</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1950, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>; and <b><i>Street Musicians</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1952, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a>. Later artists of modernist sensibilities are well represented in the collection&mdash;among them, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\"><strong>Fernando Zobel</strong></a>, Jose Joya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\"><strong>Lee Aguinaldo</strong></a>, Federico Alcuaz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\"><strong>Ang Kiukok</strong></a>, Jeremias Elizalde Navarro, and Benedicto Cabrera. There are also exemplary works by Filipino artists who lived abroad such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3586\"><strong>Venancio Igarta</strong></a>, the pioneer of printmaking Manuel Rodriguez Sr, Mexico-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\"><strong>Romeo Tabuena</strong></a>, Paris-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3752\"><strong>Nena Saguil</strong></a>, and long-term United Kingdom resident <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Medalla</strong></a>, whose painting <b><i>Progress in Cery Vision</i></b> figures prominently in the collection. These examples are by no means definitive of the breadth of the collection as it continues to expand to accommodate contemporary art. The exhibition <b><i>Revealing Signs of the Present: Philippine Paintings 2000-2012</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>held at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila in 2013, presented a selection of contemporary art from the Paulino and Hetty Que collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The provenance of the works in Que&rsquo;s collection gives insight to the transfer and circulation of objects from one collector to another. A number of works have been acquired from reputable artists, critics, and fellow collectors who previously owned them. Among them are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\"><strong>Luis Araneta</strong></a>, Arturo de Santos, Federico Alcuaz, E. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r Cruz, the Bautista-Nakpil family, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\"><strong>Roberto Villanueva</strong></a>, Mariano Corpuz, Arturo Luz, Jess Ayco, and Purita <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w-Ledesma. In 2013, the exhibition <b><i>The Real H.R. Ocampo </i></b>held at the Ayala Museum featured the collector&rsquo;s 51 Ocampo paintings which Que collected over a period of 30 years. Que&rsquo;s recurring presence in key museum exhibitions also reveals the power dynamics in the local art world whose institutions rarely have their own acquisition budgets. Other recent thematic exhibitions that presented selections from the Paulino and Hetty Que collection are <b><i>Figuring the Times: Philippine Paintings 1996-2009</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009; <b><i>Meaning to Be Modern: Philippine Paintings from 1907-1959</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2010;<b><i> Imagining Identity: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> Filipino Self Portraits</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012,<b><i> </i></b>all held at Finale Art File.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLouise Anne D.

Namacpacan (now Luna), La Union 31 Aug 1877. d. Manila 1 Oct 1940. Scenographic painter. Peralta pursued his secondary education at the Instituto Burgos, then finished his bachelor of arts at the Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado where he received medals in the yearly competitions. He taught at the Centro de Artistas before he joined the faculty of the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts in 1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon the death of ToribioAntillon, Peralta became the leading scenographic painter. In recognition of this achievement, UP placed him in charge of the annual celebration of UP Day, National Heroes Day, and the tableaux-vivants at the UP Padre Faura Campus. He was also the main decorator of the stage of the Grand Manila Carnival held yearly before World War II. To further enhance his talent in scenographic art, UP sent him to Europe for further studies. He traveled to Barcelona, Madrid, and Paris where he observed various theaters and stage houses. Upon his return, he did the mural <b><i>Alma Mater</i></b>, which adorned the President&rsquo;s Office at the Administration Building at UP Padre Faura.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of Peralta&rsquo;s three paintings on the same locale, <b><i>Tirad Pass</i></b>, now at the UP Diliman Library, shows a panoramic reed and grass landscape of which the narrow and steep passage courageously guarded by Gen Gregorio del Pilar to his death is depicted small in relation to the sky-dominated setting. General del Pilar mounted on horseback is understandably also depicted small. This approach to the subject is certainly reflective of Peralta&rsquo;s training as scenographic artist. In traditional stage backdrops, the characters were always small in relation to the painted panoramic settings. Other works by Peralta also give evidence of his scenographic approach to painting. His colors were pastel and his shadows sharply contrasted with highlighted forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His awards include a bronze medal for <b><i>Study of a Head</i></b> at the Saint Louis Universal Exposition of 1904 and another bronze medal for <b><i>Estudio de Cabeza </i></b>(Study of Head), perhaps the same as the former, at the Exhibition-Competition sponsored by the Sociedad Internacional de Artistas de Manila in 1908. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

He left the magazine in 1938 due to tuberculosis. He was replaced by Esmeraldo Z. Izon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As editorial artist of <b><i>Free Press</i></b>, Pereira produced a weekly cartoon dwelling on the issue or event discussed in the editorial. Since the main theme during this period was the campaign for Philippine independence, the artist focused on the weaknesses or follies of local politicians. His style was derived from painting, with lines achieving or evoking character and tonal contrasts reminiscent of bold washes, injecting a dramatic atmosphere into the scene. Pereira resumed his painting in 1938, creating his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>s (Stream) series, which portrayed rural lasses bathing or washing clothes, reminiscent of the works of FernandoAmorsolo. The maidens are depicted sensuously, their bodies tightly wrapped with blue-and white-striped sarongs. He adopted the bright highlights of Amorsolo, but his coloring was sweeter, with a penchant for orange tints mixed with pink. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Okinawa, Japan 4 Oct 1950/b. Manila 29 Jun 1948. Potters. Jon is the son of H. C. Pettyjohn and Isabel Lorenzo. A studio potter of Filipino-American descent, Jon studied ceramic arts and worked as pottery apprentice in Barcelona, Spain. He has had his own workshop since the mid-1970s. His work concentrates on functional, one-of-a-kind limited edition stoneware and porcelain in the Asian tradition. He occasionally does sculptural and experimental work, including murals. He has had many one-person shows and has joined group shows starting at the Design Center Philippines in the late 1970s. He exhibited at the Luz Gallery, Hiraya Gallery, CulturalCenterofthePhilippines, Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>, and Vargas Museum. He has also participated in exhibits in Southeast Asia and the United States. Jon is the co-founder of the Pettyjohn-Mendoza <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\"><strong>Pottery</strong></a> School and president of the Association of Philippine Potters Inc or Putik, and stands at the forefront of the movement for the recognition of ceramics in the Philippines as art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tessy is the daughter of Francisco and Remedios San Juan. She studied fine arts, major in painting and ceramic arts, at the University of the Philippines. She did further studies in ceramics under Manuel Ramirez at the New School for Social Research in New York City. She has worked with husband Jon in their workshop studio in Laguna since the late 1970s. She had numerous one-person shows and has joined group shows in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Together, Jon and Tessy have done extensive research on the use of indigenous raw materials, specifically doing exhibits with local materials for handmade porcelain. Their workshop was one of or probably the first to produce glazes like celadon, <i>tenmoku</i>, and Chun in the country. They continue to do research on the use of interesting materials like wood and sugarcane, ash and volcanic stones for high-temperature glazes. The Pettyjohns occasionally do collaborative work, but for the most part maintain their own styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition to their research and experimentation, the Pettyjohns also periodically teach and conduct seminars, and have mentored second- and third-generation potters, including their daughter Hannah who has also gone into painting and installation. Most recently, the Pettyjohns held an exhibit in Aug 2015 at the Silverlens Galleries titled <b><i>Touch Me, Touch Me Not</i></b>, where the couple showcased clay pieces that evoke their current ambivalence about their practice and functionality. <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251995136\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"><em><strong> </strong> </em><v:textbox><em><strong> </strong> </em></v:textbox></v:shape><em><strong>Written byAnnaliza B.

Patterning their plan after the National Art Education Association of the USA, they organized art teachers from 15 private schools in Manila to share, discuss, and assess the situation of art teaching in the metropolis. Finding out that most art teaching was still based on ideas published in American magazines, they decided to focus their efforts on developing Filipino consciousness. They enlisted resource persons to help develop content and new methods of propagating art practice and art appreciation to Filipino children and the general public. Then National Museum director Gemma Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) visual arts director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, and Design Center of the Philippines director Oscar Mapua Jr assisted them in their planning and strategy. It became PAEA&rsquo;s mission to professionalize the teaching of art, and to keep the teachers creative. In 1970-71, <b><i>Six to Sixteen</i></b> was organized as the annual children&rsquo;s art exhibition at the Main Gallery (now also known as Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>) of the CCP, becoming the model for exhibitions of a wide variety of imaginative, stimulating, and colorful visual expressions by children and youth. Annual thematic conferences with art-making workshops became a well-kept tradition that consistently deepened the members&rsquo; Filipino sensibility, and expanded their creative, innovative capabilities. Exposure and field trips to indigenous cultural communities were also organized. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3791\"><strong>Tam-awan Village</strong></a> in Baguio City became a regular venue for its Artsploration / art immersion projects in regard to Cordillera arts and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The vision, mission, and goals of the organization are as follows: to make art and culture accessible for the development and advancement of Filipinos as creative individuals and responsible members of the society; to nurture creativity, promote culture, and strengthen Filipino identity, to educate through the arts by training art educators based in institutions and communities, and to develop linkages with individuals, organizations, and communities for the promotion, appreciation, and respect for the diverse cultures in the Philippines. PAEA exerts much effort in strengthening knowledge and appreciation of the various forms of living traditions of the Philippines, and making these relevant and sustainable. A sample of the organization&rsquo;s rich trove of creative learning is the 2013 workshop module Buffet Drawing, wherein participants had workshops in comic book production, painting, printmaking, indigenous Philippine performing and literary arts, and &ldquo;Claymation.&rdquo; In 2015, the theme for its annual conference was Sining Pangkabuhayan (Art for Livelihood), and in line with this it held <b><i>Katutubo</i></b> (Indigenous), a portrait exhibit by teachers/members consisting of paintings, crafts, and sculptures focusing on indigenous peoples. Through its adopted pedagogical framework, Discipline-Based Art Education, images, sounds, and stories become a vehicle for social change. As PAEA adheres to making arts beneficial for total human fulfillment, it has served as effective proselytizer of its Arts Integration Program, wherein the arts&mdash;drama, dance, and music&mdash;are used in teaching math and literacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While PAEA&rsquo;s membership was first drawn from the academic private sector, it has since expanded to include public school teachers, administrators, teachers practicing informal education, cultural workers in the communities, club moderators, counselors, student leaders, and individual artists who desire to work for PAEA&rsquo;s goals. Its list of presidents includes Brenda Fajardo, Cota Yabut, Teresita Dichupa, Clarissa Perez, Pearl Kapunan Ortega, Alice Alafriz Panares, Zenaida Xavier, Blesilda Reynoso, Rosel Valenzuela, Edda Amonoy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3725\"><strong>Alma Quinto</strong></a>, Jane Ebarle, and Orlando Abon. Its officers are accomplished in their careers as teachers, authors, consultants, and evaluators of government art education curricula, trainers and resource speakers in educational institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">PAEA had 675 registered individual members from various schools nationwide. Institutional members include St. Mary&rsquo;s Academy of Pasay City; Claret School of Quezon City; De La Salle University (DLSU) in Dasmari&ntilde;as, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a>; DLSU&ndash;Saint Benilde College in Manila; Mapua Institute of Technology; Philippine Normal University in Northern Luzon; Marist School of Marikina; Letran College of Manila; and Ateneo de Manila. PAEA draws its financial sustainability from modest membership contributions and project participation fees, donations and institutional support, such as those from Metrobank Foundation, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</strong></a>, Government Service Insurance System Museum of Art, Faber-Castell, WriteTech, Rex Book Store, Phoenix Publishing House, and Coca-Cola Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the support of NCCA, PAEA has set up a scholarship program for 60 art educators nationwide who are now leaders in their educational community. It also supports the goals of the Department of Education&rsquo;s K-12 Art Education Program through its promotion of arts and culture among teachers through its holistic approaches to Transformative Culture-Based Education. It has partnered with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority to include and enrich the arts and culture aspects of its national certificate accreditation program. Some of its members are now holders of National Certificate (NC) such as NCII Illustration, NCIII Events Management, and NCII Tourism and Promotions. PAEA now has regional coordinators and training centers nationwide such as in Batanes through Yaru Gallery; Philippine Normal University in the North Luzon campus in Bulacan; Tam-awan Village in Baguio City; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>Banga</strong></a>an Elementary School in Sagada, Mountain Province; and Balay Mindanao in Cagayan de Oro City and Iligan City. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Its founders were Lydia Villanueva-Arguilla, writer and widow of fictionist ManuelArguilla, Flora Lansang, TrinidadTarrosaSubido, Consuelo Abaya, and EstrellaAlfon. They set up Promotions Inc along Azcarraga (now C. M. Recto) St in front of the Aranque market, then added a commercial art gallery after three months. At that time, public awareness of art was increasing through the efforts of the Art Association of the Philippines and the ongoing debates between the conservatives and the modernists. RomeoTabuena was the first artist to be presented on PAG&rsquo;s &ldquo;Feature Wall,&rdquo; followed by HernandoR.Ocampo, ArturoLuz, and Arguilla herself. Later on, artists were invited to participate in group exhibits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the outfit moved to the Malate area (near the corner of Taft Ave and Herran St) after six months, Promotions Inc gave way to the PAG. It became a busy art center with lecture forums and classes in art, music appreciation, flower arrangement, and languages such as Tagalog, Spanish, and French, and attracted not only artists but also professors, poets, fictionists, students, and other cultural personalities. The gallery printed Christmas cards designed by artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3752\"><strong>Nena Saguil</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Magsaysay-Ho, CenonRivera, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\"><strong>Romeo Tabuena</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a year PAG transferred to a building owned by CarmenGuerrero-Nakpil along Taft Ave, facing the Philippine General Hospital. There it celebrated its first anniversary with a big, monthlong exhibition of paintings, photographs, and architectural designs. The following year it organized a Philippine exhibit in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PAG was kept alive, through many financial difficulties, largely by Arguilla, even though she was out of the country for long periods. It set up several branches in Cubao, including the one on Saint <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s St, which featured a studio-theater-gallery, but none of them prospered. Only the branch in Arquiza was maintained till the late 1960s. When Arguilla died on 20 Dec 1969, the PAG died with her. Years later its belongings, which had been stored at the house on Saint Williams St, were bought by Mario Alcantara and went into the Heritage Art Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A book called <b><i>The Biggest Little Room</i></b>, 1987, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3604\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</strong></a></strong></a> has documented the development of the PAG. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

The first fine arts students were Patty Biroceni, Anterra Mar, Lilia Trinidad, Elenita Sayoc, Fe Severino, and Rosario Bitanga. SFAD was separated from the music program, and renamed the Institute of Fine Arts and Design (IFAD) in 1957. The first studio artist to become IFAD director was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3626\"><strong>Araceli Limcaco-Dans</strong></a>. Two major programs were emphasized in its formative years in the 1960s: painting and graphic arts. With the establishment of the Center for Visual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\"><strong>Printmaking</strong></a> under Manuel Rodriguez Sr in the 1960s, IFAD became a notable venue for printmakers in the Philippines. The Philippine Association of Printmakers (PAP) was born in the institutional space offered by IFAD. Among the notable faculty and administrators that were associated with IFAD were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3637\"><strong>Mariano Madarang</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3592\"><strong>Raul Isidro</strong></a>, Manuel Rodriguez Sr, Julian Cea Nepal, Alfonso Miaga, Ludivina Abes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J.

In 2006, IFAD was renamed the School of Fine Arts and Design. Since 2011, the SFAD has been led by Dean <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Turalba. In 2013, the SFAD Gallery was inaugurated under Curator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3492\"><strong>Noel Cuizon</strong></a>. SFAD offers a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts, major in industrial design, painting, and visual communication; a bachelor of science degree in interior design, and a master of arts degree in fine arts and design. The pedagogy emphasizes a globally competitive contemporary art and design curriculum that also gives importance to issues in Philippine art history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">SFAD has graduated a notable list of fine arts alumni since the 1960s.

Sculptor. She is the daughter of Serafin Pilapil and Francisca Manalaysay. Pilapil&rsquo;s artistic background is diverse. She spent a year training in painting and printmaking at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> in 1968. This was followed by a scholarship in cinematic studies at the Academia Italiana in Rome, then a workshop at the Pratt Graphic Institute in New York, 1977-78, where she specialized in lithography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A versatile artist, Pilapil has done prints, particularly serigraphy, as well as sculpture in glass and mixed media. Serigraphy, combined with etching or lithography, is her printmaking forte. Her earlier prints were geometric, marked by rigorous discipline and with a measured approach to color and tonality. The imagery of her prints later developed into a dialogue between free and intensely colored biomorphic shapes, as in the Dreamer&rsquo;s Zone series in the early 1980s. She has also done paper art, in which colored paper is folded or pleated to create geometric designs producing a relief effect, and has explored indigenous materials such as gauzelike coconut fiber. In 1983, Pilapil shifted to the medium of glass, as in her work installed at the Philippine Commercial and International Bank. Since then, she has done works using large irregularly shaped planes of glass, at times combined and contrasted in texture with rocks and metals. Often she etches the glass with linear patterns allusive of sun and moon, water and clouds that together compose an aerial landscape of floating colored form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pilapil&rsquo;s selected solo exhibitions in the Philippines and abroad include <b><i>Paper <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a>s</i></b>, 1975; <b><i>Collage and Prints</i></b>, 1976; <b><i>Prints</i></b>, 1985; <b><i>Paper, Glass and Metal</i></b>, 1986; <b><i>Mix-Media</i></b>, 1989; <b><i>Sculptures in Glass and Stone</i></b>, 1990; <b><i>Art and Ecology</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Reflections in Water</i></b>, 1993; <b><i>Reflections of the Spiritual</i></b>, 1994; <b><i>Art of</i> <i>Glass</i></b><i> <b>and Stone</b></i>, 1994; <b><i>Seed</i></b>, 1995; <b><i>Glass and Stone: Boracay Series</i></b>, 1997; <b><i>Find Your Truth</i></b>, 1998; <b><i>Glass and Stone</i></b>, 2000; <b><i>Benevolent Force</i></b>, 2002; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a> Empowered</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Spiral of</i></b><i> <b>Life</b></i>, 2006; <b><i>Interactive: The 12 Senses</i></b>, 2008; and <b><i>Aquabella</i></b>, 2011.

In 1974, she received citations from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> as outstanding artist, and as prizewinner at the annual competition of the Philippine Association of Printmakers.

Built on the ruins of the former Arellano family residence in San Juan, which burned down in 1981, the gallery complex was a memorial to the members of the family who died in the fire: Arellano&rsquo;s father architect Otilio Arellano, mother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> Almario, and sister Cita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, Arellano&rsquo;s mentor at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> (UP CFA), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3588\"><strong>Nilo Ilarde</strong></a>, also a former student of Chabet at UP CFA, set the direction of Pinaglabanan as a space for paintings, sculpture, installations, and other experimental works. They curated the first season of exhibitions, which formally opened on 9 Nov 1984 featuring works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\"><strong>Antonio Austria</strong></a>, Danny Dalena, Jaime de Guzman, and Tito Sanchez. Succeeding shows included solo presentations by Pardo de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3629\"><strong>Julie Lluch</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3666\"><strong>Fernando Modesto</strong></a>, and Popo San Pascual. Chabet and Ilarde also organized three survey shows that presented recent works in figuration, abstraction, and mixed media by a number of young and emerging artists including Ray Albano, Bert Antonio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3439\"><strong>Huge Bartolome</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3441\"><strong>Joe Bautista</strong></a>, Dick Daroy, R.M. de Leon, Yoli Laudico, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3616\"><strong>Ileana Lee</strong></a>, Judy Sibayan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3793\"><strong>Gerardo Tan</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3828\"><strong>Nestor Vinluan</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the first season of exhibitions, Pinaglabanan invited other guest curators such as Bobi Valenzuela. The galleries began showing more social realist works that reflected the political atmosphere of the times, such as the solo shows by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3370\"><strong>Pacita Abad</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a> in 1986, and the group exhibition <b><i>SR: Mga Bagong Likha</i></b> (Social <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\"><strong>Realism</strong></a>: New Works) in 1987. They hosted exhibitions of artists from other parts of the Philippines, such the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a>, Bicol Arts Guild, artists from Sagada, and the Philippine High School for the Arts in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, as well as the works of Filipino expatriate artists Duddley Diaz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Medalla</strong></a> who were both based in Europe. The gallery also showed works by writers and poets in the two-part <b><i>Chromatext</i></b> exhibitions in 1985 and 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pinaglabanan played an active role in introducing Philippine art to an international audience. The gallery organized several exchanges between Filipino and foreign artists and curators, such as the exhibition <b><i>Ex-change Manila-Berlin</i></b> in 1988, which brought together paintings, sculpture, installations, and films by Filipino artists Marcel Antonio, Agnes Arellano, Edson Armenta, R.M. de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\"><strong>Peque Gallaga</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3729\"><strong>Dan Raralio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\"><strong>Raymond Red</strong></a>, Raul Rodriguez, and German artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a>no Castelli, Knut Hoffmeister, and Birgit Hoffmeister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pinaglabanan closed after five seasons of exhibitions. Chabet curated two more group shows: <b><i>Five Girls: Chaos and Alarm</i></b> and <b><i>Sunsets and Other Vanishing Acts</i></b>, before mounting his own solo exhibition <b><i>Cargo and Decoy</i></b>, which essentially brought the gallery&rsquo;s fate full circle as it closed in 1989. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byR.

Santa Cruz, Manila 26 Jul 1879. d. Santa Cruz, Manila 12 Sep 1946. Illustrator, painter. He was the son of Ines Pineda. He studied at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura before the outbreak of the Philippine-American War and later enrolled at Buenaventura&rsquo;s School of Drawing. In 1904, he won awards at the Universal Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA: bronze for <b><i>Campesina</i></b> (Farm Girl), showing a solidly drawn head of a rural lass, and honorable mention for <b><i>Las Buyeras</i></b> (Betel-Nut Vendors). In 1895, he began working as a lithographer in the Carmelo and Bauermann printing firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pineda was also considered the leading illustrator of his time. He was an active contributor to political publications such as <b><i>The Independent </i></b>and <b><i>Lipang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>baw</i></b>, a satirical magazine, where he sometimes used the pen name Makahiya. He did the lithograph version of the composite portrait of 13 heroes, <b><i>Filipinos Ilustres</i></b> (Illustrious Filipinos), based on the 1911 drawing by GuillermoTolentino. He is credited as the creator of Juan de la Cruz, the symbol of the ordinary Filipino. He also drew cover illustrations for <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino</i></b> as well as ads, and designed sweepstakes tickets, postage stamps, and the prewar 20-peso bill showing the Mayon Volcano. He did illustrations for many books such as <b><i>Bajo los Cocoteros </i></b>(Under the Coconut Trees) by ClaroM.Recto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a painter, Pineda was peer to FernandoAmorsolo but less prolific, being an occasional painter. He explored subjects outside those of the Amorsolo school. He painted the neat and quiet streets of the city in the 1920s. Among his most charming genre scenes are those depicting Filipino games like <i>siklot</i> and <i>sungka </i>(bantumi). <b><i>Bantilon</i></b>, 1943, depicts a young couple playing the siklot on the floor, while <b><i>Chongka</i></b>, 1943, shows an old couple playing sungka by the window. Characteristic of these works is the interplay between the shadowy indoors and bright outdoors, as well as the psychological interest in people absorbed in their activity. Pineda used rugged brushstrokes that help suggest the simplicity of domestic settings. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Assembled by the founding president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3604\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</strong></a></strong></a>, the collection is critically illustrative of both the formal and thematic concerns of the work of early and post-World War II Filipino modernists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>, Carlos Francisco, Galo Ocampo, and the other Thirteen Moderns whom Edades posed as the emergent voices of a new Filipino aesthetic challenging classicist and romanticist sensibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists whose works also form part of the collection include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, Fabian de la Rosa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\"><strong>Irineo Miranda</strong></a> who were Kalaw-Ledesma&rsquo;s former teachers at the then School of Fine Arts at the University of the Philippines. Alongside these are pieces by her fellow artists and modernist advocates. The collection also includes works from those who did not necessarily match Kalaw-Ledesma&rsquo;s predilection for a new aesthetics that was more experimental and socially oriented. Finding herself amidst a circle of artists and intellectuals working in a landscape bereft of institutional and private support, Kalaw-Ledesma straddled multiple positions in the emergent art world. Alternately artist, collector, documentor, and impresario, her own personal art practice took a backseat to the rigors of organizing and chronicling of a broad stream of art practices including but not solely of the modernists&rsquo;. Key pieces in the collection dating prior to World War II onward affirm her place in a nascent art world where artists navigated the tensions between notions of identity and internationalism, while distilling tendencies from impressionism to cubism. As in most early collections, the acquisition logic is driven more by kinship and professional affinities than traditional regard for art historical junctures and a coherent register of aesthetic values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Birthed in the logic of gifts and tokens of gratitude from struggling artists hoping to trigger their momentum for an exhibition, or to plump up a kitty for further studies, the Kalaw-Ledesma trove, along with other small pockets of assembled art, would stand as the primary source for early modernist history through the 1970s and 1980s. Presumably, it would also be the core reference for Kalaw-Ledesma when she later set out to write art history in books such as <b><i>The Struggle for Philippine Art</i></b> and <b><i>The Big Little Room</i></b>, under the auspices of the ASEAN Institute of Art headed by Dr Rod Paras-Perez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection represents pivotal moments in modernist art production in many respects. While it boasts of some of the most iconic pieces from the oeuvre of early modernists, it also contains a significant number of pieces done by artists at possibly their least unguarded or most playful moments at work when they might have been resolving points of influence, exploring unfamiliar material, or merely trying on new ideas for size. The collection includes works that have gained circulation through Philippine art history books and didactic materials for the humanities. Among these are H.R. Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Man and</i></b> <b><i>Carabao</i></b>, 1949; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Diggers</i></b>, 1951; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Rice Planters</i></b>, ca 1952; Benedicto Cabrera&rsquo;s 1970s etchings of Filipino migrants; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Banaklaot</i></b>, 1948; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3414\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Lyd Arguilla</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Camia Flowers</i></b>, 1950; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3693\"><strong>Onib Olmedo</strong></a>&rsquo;s tempera Singkong-Suka series; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\"><strong>Abdulmari Imao</strong></a>&rsquo;s three-dimensional bronze rendering of the AAP logo. Nonetheless, the assembly of work also encompasses more idiosyncratic pieces such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3569\"><strong>Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi</strong></a>&rsquo;s untitled 1982 oil on cloth with Latin spiritual references; Chabet&rsquo;s minimalist watercolor <b><i>Ocho</i></b>, 1963; Luz&rsquo;s pieta-like <b><i>Brown Man</i></b>, ca 1950s; Abueva&rsquo;s undated <b><i>Totem Pole</i></b>; and Edades&rsquo;s study done in collaboration with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Magsaysay-Ho and Consuelo Lee for a mural commissioned for the Quezon Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once intended as a bequest to the Museum of Philippine Art, the collection has reverted to Kalaw-Ledesma&rsquo;s surviving family who have honored her desire to broaden Philippine art&rsquo;s public by loaning these works to institutions for exhibition and by opening up access to Kalaw-Ledesma&rsquo;s archive of materials from her travels and seminal years as presiding leader of the longest-running art organization in the country<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Kalaw-Ledesma Foundation and Ayala Foundation 2010</p>\r\n"

Dingras, Ilocos Norte 20 Nov 1912. d. 1998. Painter. The son of Honorio Puruganan and Victoria Madamba, he married Victorina Soles with whom he had nine children. He graduated from the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts in 1936. In 1940, he entered the University of Santo Tomas (UST) on a scholarship and earned his bachelor of arts degree after one year. While studying at UST, he joined the fine arts faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Puruganan&rsquo;s early works like <b><i>Coming Storm</i></b>, 1935, and <b><i>Bullfight</i></b>, 1942, show his penchant for dynamic composition and movement. This is complemented by his bold strokes and heavy application of paint. Identified by National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> as one of the Thirteen Moderns, Puruganan in the 1960s evolved a style that sought to synthesize indigenous Filipino designs with contemporary themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Puruganan won first prize for <b><i>Coming Storm</i></b> at the National Landscape Competition at Philippine Vistas, 1935; first prize for <b><i>Safety Breeze</i></b>, 1937, at the third annual exhibition of the UP President&rsquo;s Committee on Culture; second prize for <b><i>Inauguration of the Commonwealth</i></b> at the UP Los Ba&ntilde;os National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Painting Contest, 1937; first honorable mention for <b><i>El Ultimo Galeon</i></b> (The Last Galleon) in the historical category, and the same prize for <b><i>Doubting Peter</i></b> in the religious category at UST&rsquo;s national art competition, 1941. In 1943, during the Japanese period, he garnered first and second prizes for <b><i>Bullfight</i></b> at the first National Art Competition, and first prize for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> December Morning</i></b>, 1943, at the literary and art contest held during the celebration of the Foundation Day of Manila. In 1944, he participated in the 2nd National Art Contest, but his two works, <b><i>Mass Burial of Heroes at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> and <b><i>Railroad Scene</i></b>, were reportedly disqualified for their anti-Japanese sentiments (Kulay Diwa Gallery, n.d.c). He also won the following prizes at the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines&ndash;Manila Club Exhibition of 1949: first prize for <b><i>Neighbors</i></b>, third prize for <b><i>Suburban</i></b>, and honorable mention for <b><i>Father and Son</i></b>, all in the watercolor category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2012, the UST Museum held an exhibit on Puruganan and fellow modernist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a> Francisco titled <b><i>Botong and Puruganan: A Double Centennial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te</i></b>, while in 2014, the Ilocos Norte government, in cooperation with the collector-director of Pinto Art Museum Dr Joven Cuanang, presented an exhibition titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\"><strong>Ricarte Puruganan</strong></a>: The Filipino as Modernist</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/80\"><strong>Paseo</strong></a> de Paoay, Ilocos Norte.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Concepcion, Iloilo 24 Aug 1941. Potter, printmaker. She is the daughter of Melchiades Querubin and Natividad Amante. She lives in Colorado with her husband, Michael Tompkins. She studied at the Iloilo School of Arts and Trade and the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. She was an illustrator at age 14, and was largely self-taught in painting. In Manila, while working as architectural draftsman from 1965 to 1973 in a government agency, she was active in printmaking workshops of the Philippine Association of Printmakers (PAP), working closely with Manuel Rodriguez Sr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a>. She explored various techniques in the graphic arts including etching and aquatint, collagraphs, and linocut, doing a variety of themes in abstract expressionist style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although she garnered numerous awards in printmaking, it is in ceramic art that she has excelled most, after working closely with Leonardo Villaroman. In 1973, she decided to work full time as potter, moving back to her Iloilo hometown where she built her own house, workshop, and kiln. There she gathered local clay as material and waste wood as fuel, sharing her talent in the art with friends and kin. To Querubin, firing is the most important technical factor in pottery, such that she developed her own &ldquo;fire show&rdquo; technique in kilns she builds herself. She developed formulas of glazes based on arches she gathers from her fireboxes. Often, she applies this thickly on the bisque pieces by pouring, dipping, or brushing, sometimes leaving portions unglazed. Querubin started making black pottery in 1976. The mixture of clay she uses for this is a coarse mass with plenty of iron content. With techniques of slip- coating, rigid burnishing, the right time of drying, and smothering in pulverized cow dung, she produces handsome black pottery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She moved to Colorado in 1985 where she found influence and inspiration from her new environment. The natural landscape and the changing seasons are echoed in her works of varying texture and color, much like a cross-section of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She held major retrospective exhibitions and projects from the early 2000s, some of which are <b><i>Forms &amp; Textures</i></b> and <b><i>Patterned &amp; Inscribed</i></b>, both at the UP Vargas Museum, and <b><i>Terrain </i></b>in the Ayala Museum in 2013. In 2012, she launched her book titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a> and Joy in My Real World</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which documents her spiritual journey.

Urdaneta, Pangasinan 3 Aug 1961. Visual artist and art educator. She is the daughter of Jose Bernardino Quinto, a musician who used to play in a local orchestra, and Lolita Galliguez Bongolan. Quinto finished a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Philippine studies in 1983 and took graduate units in art studies and undergraduate units in the fine arts program at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1998. She also earned art education specialization and preschool education units in 1992 and a teaching certificate in 1988 at the Philippine Normal University. Quinto has served as president of Kababaihan sa Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan<i> </i>or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>KASIBULAN</strong></a> and the Philippine Art Educators Association, both nongovernment organizations advocating the empowerment of women and art education in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Quinto is best known for her contributions to the field of art and healing, having worked since 1980 with traumatized children and communities, including survivors of sexual abuse, domestic violence, and disasters, and those living under conflict situations, extreme poverty, mental illness, and other forms of disabilities. With soft sculpture, textile, and needlework as her primary media, she has facilitated arts for healing workshops with girl survivors of abuse for more than a decade, 1995-2008, under the CRIBS Foundation in Marikina City. During the same period, she facilitated visual arts workshops for children and adults at Art in the Park, Quezon Memorial Circle. The insights and experiences she gained from these projects form the foundation and wellspring of the collaborative nature of her art projects. Among these is the <b><i>House of Comfort Art Project</i></b>, a work in progress which she started in 2006, aiming to build a collapsible, modular, easy-to-install quilt house made out of grids of dreams from various communities including those from the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and the Middle East. Her appropriation of textile and needlework as primary medium and technique also link her work to art processes associated with women&rsquo;s art in the Philippines and Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art empowerment and healing similarly form the main threads of her major works like <b><i>Ayayam</i></b>, shown at the 2nd Yokohama Triennale, 2005;<b><i> Soft Dreams and Bed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a></i></b>, shown at the 8th Havana Biennial, 2003, at her solo show at the University of Santo Tomas Museum of Arts and Sciences, and at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Norway, 2004; the <b><i>House of Comfort Art Project</i></b>, shown in solo exhibitions at the University of the Philippines Galeria 1, 2007, and the Osaka Prefectural Women&rsquo;s Center, 2008; the <b><i>Nothing to Declare</i></b><i> </i>exhibition at Yuchengco Museum in Makati, 2011; the <b><i>Women-in-Between: Asian Women Artists 1984-2012 </i></b>traveling exhibition in Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Okinawa Prefectural and Art Museum, Tochigi Prefectural Museum, and Mie Prefectural Museum in Japan, 2012-13, and as a solo show titled <b><i>weDREAMforCHANGE</i></b> held at the Museum of Three Cultures, Cagayan de Oro City, 2012; and <b><i>Floating Wombs for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a> Manual Project</i></b> shown at the Design and Creative Center Kobe, 2013, and at the Sining Makiling Gallery, UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, 2014. Every time these and other works are shown, Quinto conducts workshops, either aiming to train trainers or to facilitate healing of traumatized survivors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Quinto&rsquo;s writings have been published in several national and international publications. She also served as speaker and lecturer in various events locally and internationally. Quinto&rsquo;s art practice is anchored on the notion of creative intervention to human and social traumas. Transcending the traditional role of artist as individual creator, Quinto contributes to the aspect of Philippine art practice in which the artist becomes the facilitator and interlocutor of collaborative works, with the goal of empowering communities in the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byFlaudette May V.Datuin</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Manila 28 Jul 1929. d. Quezon City 28 Apr 2001. Painter. He was the son of Teosilo Ragodon and Eliza Yboa. He married Theodorsia Inez Beltran with whom he has five children. He graduated from the University of the Philippines with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts in 1952. He held one-person shows at the Philippine ArtGallery in 1962 and the Luz Gallery in 1970. In 1967, UNESCO gave him a travel grant to Europe and Mexico. He taught Asian History at the Lyceum of the Philippines, and worked as artist in the <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine</i></b>. He became director of the Ayala Museum during its founding phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His distinctive paintings of old Spanish churches inthePhilippines in the 1960s became the hallmark of his artistic career, as he rendered these in elegant, realistic style. This came to be later emulated by younger artists interested in the subject of nostalgia and antiquities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Church of Daraga</i></b>, 1966, is an oil painting on wood done in fine linearity and delicate washes of blue, ocher, and black set against an immaculately plain white background. This depiction of a traditional subject through a single-image approach to space was an innovation in painting at the time Ragodon developed this. It was a device akin to literal representation associated with American pop and magic realism of the 1960s. <b><i>Church in Lana</i></b>, 1971, was another work done in convincing photo-realistic manner set against a blank background as this further exemplified this new tendency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An accomplished landscape painter, Ragodon also utilized ink, tempera, and watercolor. Sometimes, he combined Chinese calligraphic techniques with his unique personal skill in capturing photographic likeness, such as in his Spanish Landscapes series of 1967. His <b><i>Norte Espa&ntilde;a</i></b> (Northern Spain), 1967, consists of delineated and contrasting horizontals and vertical planes, with light and shade, textural richness of earthenware rooftops, and plastered walls amidst an architectural landscape finely crafted in brown ink wash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ragodon received the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines award for art in 1964. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, updated by Roberto Daniel Devela</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Heritage Art Center 2011c; <i>Inquirer.net</i> 2013a; Philippine Trivia, n.d.; Pinoyarte.com, n.d.b.</p>\r\n"

Iriga, Camarines Sur 27 Sep 1946. Painter. Antonio&rsquo;s parents are Elias Corporal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a>ida Ramboyong. He obtained his elementary education from La Consolacion Academy and St. Anthony Academy. He also finished high school in the latter. He took up preparatory engineering at the University of Santo Tomas in 1963, then studied fine arts at the University of the East from 1966 to 1970. He staged his first three one-person shows at the Solidaridad Gallery in 1971, 1972, and 1974. He opened his 10th solo exhibition at the Manila Garden Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ramboyong is identified with the pure abstract movement of the early 1970s. But his works gained particular recognition for his use of acrylic or oil on aluminum sheet, as influenced mainly by the same finish on the <i>anting-anting</i> (amulet). On the metal sheet, Ramboyong would raise geometric shapes like circles, triangles or fusions of forms from the surface by incising and hammering. He enriched these designs by adding color. The contemporariness of his works lie in the impersonal rigidness of the arrangement of the shapes, and the cold feel of the aluminum sheet. In <b><i>Sixteen Squares</i></b>, 1971, for example, the artist arranged 16 squares which in turn are set in a circle at the center of the painting&rsquo;s square surface. In the 1980s, Ramboyong rejected his own early rigid format, filling up his aluminum surface with wide sweeps of lines uniformly repeated to evoke palm leaves as in <b><i>Diptych: Twin Growth</i></b>, 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ramboyong won prizes at the Shell National Students Art Competition: fifth prize for painting for his work <b><i>Field Machines at Rest</i></b> in 1967; and first honorable mention for <b><i>Beat</i></b>, certificate of merit for <b><i>Diptych: Forms in Space</i></b>, and second prize for on-the-spot painting in 1968. Another work, <b><i>City</i></b>, won second prize in the annual exhibition sponsored by the ArtAssociationofthePhilippines in 1980. In 1976, he also won first prize for his painting <b><i>Labuyo sa Umaga</i></b> (Rooster in the Morning) at the art contest sponsored by the Philippine National Bank during its 60th Anniversary. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

This is demonstrated in his work titled <b><i>eachmineallmine </i></b>done for the 2000 CCP Thirteen Artists exhibition.

He appropriates motifs and forms from Graeco-Roman sculpture with a pop sensibility, projecting their sleek classical quality to embody the alienation of the contemporary world.

Manila 25 Nov 1964. Installation, performance, mixed media artist. He is the son of retired government employee Marietta Macalalag Viros and Decimo Zabala Reamillo, who was a piano maker previously with Javincello &amp; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> Inc. Reamillo was married to Australian artist Juliet Rea. Reamillo majored in painting at the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Fine Arts, 1981-85. He began his art practice as a visual arts teacher at the Philippine High School for the Arts (PHSA) in Mount Makiling, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, a school for gifted students in the arts. As state scholars, these students majored in the various fields of art. Reamillo himself majored in the visual arts at PHSA, 1977-81. He earned units under the master of arts in visual arts program of the Western Australia School of Visual Arts, Western Australia Academy of Performing Arts, Edith Cowan University, Perth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reamillo&rsquo;s performative process involves play, improvisation, and a collaborative pedagogical method he terms creative <i>bayanihan</i>,<i> </i>a Filipino term that refers to the traditional community networking and support system. This practice draws inspiration from the German artist Joseph Beuys&rsquo;s concept of social sculpture. Beuys was motivated by a utopian belief in the power of art to instigate change. Reamillo&rsquo;s collaborative projects take place in mobile and community workshops that mobilize a range of mediums that intersect in many interesting ways: mixed media painting, sculpture, installation, shadow puppetry, video, and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shuttling between the Philippines and Australia, where he migrated in 1995, his art pieces and collaborations explore ideas about memory, mobility, and cross-cultural dialogue/exchange, colonization, migration, and globalization. These themes and processes created a number of participatory &ldquo;social sculptures&rdquo; in the form of &ldquo;vehicles/vessels/crafts,&rdquo; exemplified by the <b><i>Thuringowa Helicopter</i></b><i> <b>Project</b></i>,<i> </i>2007-10, held and shown in several venues such as The Substation, Melbourne, and Stokes Hill Wharf / Festival of Darwin; <b><i>Making It New: Focus on Contemporary Australian Art</i></b>, 2009, Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; and plAAy / Contemporary Asian Artist Residency Programme, Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery, United Kingdom. Another major project involves the reconstruction of the grand piano from the now-defunct piano factory that his father co-founded, restaged as <b><i>Mang Emo + Mag-himo Grand Piano Project</i></b>,<b> </b>at the Galleria Duemila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), and the Fremantle Arts Centre, Western Australia, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of Reamillo&rsquo;s performances have also been driven by his inclination toward evoking participation with earlier work consisting of collaborations with artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3405\"><strong>Rene Aquitania</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a>.

Candon, Ilocos Sur 5 Apr 1928. d. Los Angeles, California 30 Sep 1995. Cartoonist, writer. He took up architecture at the Mapua Institute of Technology. He was exposed to the medium at an early age when his father used to bring him imported funnies. He deftly imbibed the techniques of his favorite American illustrators and in no time shifted from a mere <b>komiks</b> reader to komiks illustrator. This transition was relatively easy as his involvement in the art heightened. Soon he was illustrating a serial, <b><i>Palos </i></b>(Eel), penned by his brother Virgilio. This was so successful that it ran for 14 years. It was followed by other stories of Virgilio which Nestor illustrated, among them, <b><i>Diwani</i></b> and <b><i>Gagamba </i></b>(Spider). He also did the artwork for most of PabloS.Gomez&rsquo;s opuses: <b><i>Gilda</i></b>, <b><i>Bangkusay</i></b>, <b><i>Dayukdok</i></b> (Addicted).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Redondo&rsquo;s popularity peaked when he was commissioned to illustrate MarsRavelo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/135\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>. He had by then developed an illustrative style which so appealed to readers that a whole generation of komiks artists tried to emulate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1963, together with Tony Caravana, Alfredo Alcala, JimFernandez, Amado Castillo, and his brother Virgilio, he founded CRAF Publications. He also put up ARES Publications Inc, which became the training home for would-be komiks illustrators. Redondo&rsquo;s publishing ventures waned, however, during the turbulent late 1960s and 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1972, through US-based Filipino komiks illustrator Tony Zu&ntilde;iga, Redondo&rsquo;s works got international exposure. Redondo initially illustrated several episodes of Edgar Burrough&rsquo;s <b><i>Tarzan</i></b>. Later he took over the artwork for <b><i>The Swamp Thing</i></b>, a popular American series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Refusing to migrate to the United States, he put up his own studio in his Valenzuela home, and continued to accept commissions from US publishing firms like the <b><i>National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a>ical Publications</i></b>, the <b><i>Pendulum Press</i></b>, and the <b><i>Dykeman Studio</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1975, he became one of the founding members of Lakan Sining ng Bulacan, an organization of Bulacan painters headed by Tomas Bernardo. He started painting at about this time and was commissioned by the Mass Media Production Center to do the covers of pocketbooks. He also founded the Association of National Illustrators with AngelCacnio, Noly Panaligan, Romy Mananquil, and Domy Gutierrez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Redondo participated in art exhibits in the Philippines and the United States, and conducted lectures abroad. He received international recognition as an illustrator, and in 1979 was bestowed the prestigious Inkpot Award by the San Diego (California) Comics Convention. Before this, he also received the Valenzuela Kalikasan Award for his outstanding contribution to the advancement of arts and culture as a komiks illustrator. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byC.

During this period he exhibited <b><i>La Siesta</i></b> (Nap in the Afternoon), 1881, a piece favorably reviewed in <b><i>La Ilustracion Espa&ntilde;ola y Americana </i></b>in that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1879, he went to Rome, still as a pensionado, where he finished a portrait, <b><i>Senador Romano </i></b>(Roman Senator), and others. In 1883, he toured Spain rejoining his patron and close friend Francisco de Yriarte in Galicia. There, he pitched a tent to study nature more closely.

In 1891, it was accorded a <i>diploma de honor</i> (diploma of honor) at the Exposicion General de Bellas Artes (General Exposition of Fine Arts) of Barcelona. A year later, this painting also received a gold medal in the Exposicion Internacional de Bellas Artes (International Exposition of Fine Arts) in Madrid during the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. It was finally bought for 7,500 pesetas by the Spanish government and ordered hung in the principal saloon of the Museo-Biblioteca de Ultramar, passing afterward to the Museo Nacional de Pinturas de Madrid after the archipelago became a territory of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He also exhibited <b><i>Adios al Sol</i></b> (Farewell to the Sun), 1892, at the Exposicion Internacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid in that year.

His artworks adhere to an abstract modernist aesthetic, which began as hard-edged abstractions in the 1970s and developed into highly amorphous shapes done using airbrush techniques in 2011. Throughout his art career, he has focused on a bright palette composed of primary color combinations (red, yellow, and blue) contrasted with white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a writer and art critic, Reyes wrote a column titled &ldquo;Gallery Hopping,&rdquo;<i> </i>1995-2005, for the national daily <b><i>Today</i></b>.

As creative director, Reyes was also responsible for many recognizable slogans and concepts for Philippine advertising campaigns from the 1980s. These include the &ldquo;<i>laba dami, labango</i>&rdquo; (lots of laundry, smells good) tag, as well as the &ldquo;<i>huwag maging dayuhan sa sariling bayan</i>&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t be a stranger in your own country)<i> </i>tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reyes received the Art Criticism Award from the Art Association of the Philippines in 1979; Art Critic of the Year Award from <b><i>Art Quarterly Manila</i></b><i> </i>in 2001, 2002, and 2003; and the Lifetime Achievement Award in Creativity from the Creative Guild in 2007.

Reyes&rsquo;s mother came from a family of painters and church <i>cantores </i>(singers). He took up his early education in his town, secondary schooling at Manila East High School (now Mapa), and fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP). He entered UP in 1928, graduating in 1932. While studying, he obtained two medals in the Drawing from Life I and II classes taught by Pablo and FernandoAmorsolo, respectively, and another medal in illustration and commercial design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although mainly known for serialized comic stories, the artist also produced oil canvases. His portraits and landscapes in the 1930s showed influences of FabiandelaRosa and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>.

For <b><i>Kulafu</i></b>, Reyes collaborated with another Reyes, Pedrito, who wrote the stories. In 1935, after Pedrito took on another job, Francisco became both narrator and illustrator of the series. This serial lasted for eight years until the outbreak of the war.

In the same year he finished school, Ricio soon started working as a visualizer for advertising and eventually moved up and became art director. His stint in New York soon earned him enough expertise in the field of graphic design. After 10 years in the business, he established his own design company in 1977&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3736\"><strong>Nik Ricio</strong></a> Studio, which handles specialized services in graphic design, photography, and production design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nik is known for his work in the field of graphic design for print media, specifically book designing.

Cebu 17 Sep 1941. d. 13 May 2015. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a> and installation artist. He was the son of fictionist Estrella Alfon and retired army major Bernardino Rivera. Rivera took courses in advertising art while pursuing a degree in architecture at the University of Santo Tomas (UST). While in UST, he studied under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> who introduced him to installation and conceptual art. Dropping out of school in 1967, Rivera went into photography, book illustration, set and props design for film, film production, acting, graphic art, advertising, and writing. His first employment was at the Design Center of the Philippines, 1975-76, as writer and liaison officer. This was followed by jobs in advertising and graphic design until 1991 when he decided to be a full-time painter and a freelance graphic designer. He aligned himself with groups like the Starving Artists and joined group shows such as Artists in Revolt and Manning the Barricades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ever the experimenter, Rivera&rsquo;s earlier painting explored the medium of paint and collage. The first painting he sold was an abstract nude consisting of crumpled newsprint pressed together on a wet canvas. Alan was later attracted to Zen philosophy and its minimalism. His later works relied heavily on the use of indigenous materials, such as twine and rocks, often seen suspended from the ceiling. An artist&rsquo;s residency in Australia in 1992 enabled him to explore the nuances of form, using found objects which resonated with deep spiritual themes. At the later part of his life, he began a series of self-portraits chronicling the downward spiral of his health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rivera&rsquo;s roster of solo and group exhibits include <b><i>Sikat: Twenty Years of Philippine Art </i></b>(Shine/Famous: Twenty Years of Philippine Art), 1989, Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> (also known as Main Gallery) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP); <b><i>Solstice: My Life in the Resistance (Save the Planet)</i></b>, 1991, Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a> compound; <b><i>Art Lab</i></b>, 1991, Art Lab Gallery; <b><i>Art in Progress</i></b>, 1991, Kanlungan ng Sining Gallery; <b><i>Kilusang Katutubong Sining </i></b>(Indigenous Art Movement), 1992, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise Gallerie; <b><i>101 Monks Contemplating the Gospel According to Zen</i></b>, 1992, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise Gallerie; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong>Biyaheng Timog</strong></a> Patungong Kanluran</i></b> (Journey to the South Going West), 1992, a two-man exhibit with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a> at the Australian Center Gallery in Makati; <b><i>14 Nautical Miles</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Makabago, Alternatibo at Katutubong Sining </i></b>(Modern, Alternative and Indigenous Art), 1993, West Gallery; <b><i>Migrante </i></b>(Migrant), 1993, CCP Main Gallery; <b><i>Art Manila &rsquo;93 AIDS Group Show</i></b>, 1993, Philam Life Building; <b><i>Tugmaan: The Ties That Bind </i></b>(Matching: The Ties That Bind), 1994;<b><i> Storytellers</i></b> and <b><i>Small Works Show</i></b>, both held 1995 in the USA; <b><i>Virtual Landscapes in the Spirit of Zen</i></b>, 1997 and 2003, Ayala Museum; <b><i>Artopus &rsquo;98: Hilaga ug Sur</i></b>,<i> </i>1998, Ayala Tower 1 Lobby; <b><i>All in the Spirit of Zen: A Place of Worship</i></b>, 1998, Museo de Iloilo;<i> <b>Fast Forward to 2000</b></i> and <b><i>Labintatlo: 13 Artists Survey Exhibition</i></b>, CCP, 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP honored him with the Thirteen Artists Award in 1972.

Hagonoy, Bulacan 16 Apr 1922. d. 25 Nov 1998. Painter. He was the son of Pedro Rivera and Placida Mangahas. He married Ma. Teresa Tech. He graduated from Araullo High School and enrolled for a liberal arts course at the University of the Philippines (UP), while taking up some subjects at the School of Fine Arts. While at the UP, VicenteAlvarezDizon influenced him to go into art education. Thus after the war, Rivera entered the University of Santo Tomas (UST), where he finished his bachelor of science degree in art education in 1948. In 1956, he joined the faculty of the UST College of Architecture and Fine Arts, where he was conferred the title Professor Emeritus three years after his retirement in 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1962, Rivera received a scholarship from the Italian government to study at the Regge Accademia di Belle Arti. He stayed in Rome for three years, during which he studied stained glass techniques in European cities and trained in mosaic at the official studio of the Vatican. Upon his return, he succeeded VictorioEdades as director of the UST Department of Fine Arts upon the latter&rsquo;s retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rivera&rsquo;s earliest style was influenced by the academic realism of his UP professors, but in 1951 he abandoned realism for semiabstraction. His <b><i>Wooden Shacks</i></b>, 1951, shows his attempt at analytic cubism. An early affiliate of the PhilippineArtGallery, Rivera exhibited in many group shows and held his one-person show at this gallery in 1956. His works from 1951 to 1957 are considered his best, characterized by a tightness of composition and sober or muted colors.

Manila 11 Aug 1837. d. Manila 20 Oct 1898. Painter. Lorenzo&rsquo;s parents were Antonio Rocha y Tuason, a Spanish-Chinese mestizo businessman, and Guadalupe de Icaza, a Philippine-born Spaniard. In 1871, he married Maria Rosario Ruiz Delgado, with whom he had five children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was one of the first enrollees at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura when it reopened in 1850. For a time, Lorenzo left the school, enrolled at the Escuela Nautica and obtained a naval degree. Then in 1855, he returned to his art studies. He was hailed as &ldquo;most outstanding student&rdquo; and made assistant director. In that year, the Junta de Comercio, the school&rsquo;s sponsor, organized a contest for the best painting by a Spaniard and an <i>indio</i> (Christianized native). Rocha won the award together with his indio classmate and namesake LorenzoGuerrero; he, for his portrait of Isabel II, the reigning queen, and Guerrero, for his portrait of Ferdinand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\"><strong>Magellan</strong></a>. Each won 150 pesos and the honor to have their works displayed permanently at the Junta de Comercio&rsquo;s session hall. In 1857, Rocha won in the open competition for the directorship of the Academia, which was vacated by Nicolas Valdes. But in 1858, Agustin Saez arrived from Spain to fill in the job. Rocha in turn received a four-year scholarship grant to study at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. His work pleased his teachers such that they recommended him to the Royal Palace. The Infante Don Francisco had him appointed Painter to the Royal Chamber of Her Majesty. During this stint, the Marquesa de Montijo asked him to paint two portraits of her daughter, the duchess of Alba, one for herself, and another for her other daughter, Empress Marie Eugenie of France. In 1867, he entered <b><i>El Ensue&ntilde;o de Don Ramiro en la Batalla de Clavijo</i></b> (The Dream of Don Ramiro in the Battle of Clavijo) at the Madrid Salon, which won him an honorable mention. He came back to Manila in Sep 1867, eventually setting up home in Intramuros. While still in Madrid, he actively sought the directorship of the Academia held by Agustin Saez. In the end, Saez and Rocha were made professors of equal rank in the school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1880, Rocha introduced an art course at the Escuela Normal de Maestros. In 1889, the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura was transformed into the Escuela de Dibujo, Pintura y Grabado with the Escuela de Artes y Oficios incorporated with it, and Saez and Rocha jointly supervising. In 1891, Saez died, leaving Rocha as sole director of the school. In 1893, the school became the Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado and was directed by Rocha till his death in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Only one work by Rocha seems to have survived, a life-size <b><i>Yndia Filipina</i></b>, now hanging at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Cordoba, Spain.

Uson, Masbate 8 Mar 1937. d. 24 Aug 2001. Sculptor Renato was the son of Ramon Rocha, who made business out of his boats, and Consuelo Autor, who was a housewife. Rocha took up bachelor of fine arts majoring in sculpture at the University of the Philippines (UP) from 1959 to 1963. He also studied commercial design under the Scranton International Correspondence School. He apprenticed under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a> for several years and under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3461\"><strong>Anastacio Caedo</strong></a> for a year. He was a major sculptor exclusively working on wood and was the master of this medium along with his mentor Abueva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rocha created forms, mainly abstracted from the objective world and with elegant polished surfaces. Although most of his works may be considered semiabstract sculptural interpretations of genre scenes, he also created significant images that are purely his own, as in <b><i>Butterfly Fish</i></b>, 1979, on molave wood, shown in the exhibit<b><i> Museum Artists</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in that year. Here, Rocha captured the undulating movement of a fish with masses and voids carved out of a wood block. His major works include <b><i>The Cry of Pugad Lawin</i></b>,<i> </i>1971,<i> </i>at the Himlayang Pilipino Memorial Park;<i> <b>Struggle of Man for Higher Knowledge</b></i>,<i> </i>1974, and<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/164\"><strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></a></b></i>, 1989, both located at UP Los Ba&ntilde;os;<i> </i>and <b><i>Guitarist </i></b>and<i> <b>Reclining Figures</b></i>, 1977, both found at the Malaca&ntilde;an Guest House (De La Paz 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first solo exhibit was <b><i>Renato A. Rocha: Recent Wood <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a></i></b>, 1978, held at the Manila Peninsula Hotel. This was followed by<b><i> Rocha&rsquo;s Wood Sculpture</i></b>, 1981, at the Rear Room Gallery, Manila Garden Hotel (De La Paz 2013). He participated in two international group exhibitions: the Seattle World&rsquo;s Fair, 1962, and the New York World&rsquo;s Fair, 1964. He staged his first solo exhibition in 1978 at the Manila Peninsula Hotel lobby and his second at the Manila Garden Hotel three years later. He had a total of nine group exhibitions and a sculpture exhibition with Abueva, Castrillo, and Marcelo in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rocha won several awards from the UP Student Catholic Action art competitions, including second prize and honorable mention in 1960, first prize in sculpture in 1961, first and second prizes in 1962, and first prize in 1963. In 1961, Rocha won the second and third prizes at the Shell National Students Art Competition for <b><i>Shell Twist</i></b> and <b><i>Playmates</i></b>, respectively.

In 2004, he also started producing paintings, plywood cutouts, sintra board assemblages, and installation work. A collaborative piece with UGATLahi,<b><i> Symphony of Destruction</i></b>, 2009, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), represented the imposing figure of an orchestra conductor as symbol of imperial dominance.

His paintings, drawings, and installations employ both distortion and symbolism to portray complex social realities in the Philippines, which may not be easily represented through more naturalistic means. His subjects range from images of the downtrodden masses to representations of exploitative classes. His representations of poverty, injustice, and corruption are often interspersed with references to religious icons and related imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rodriguez held his first one-man exhibition <b><i>Kimi/Imik</i></b> (Silenced/Spoken), 2009, at the Blanc Compound, and later exhibited his works in <b><i>Dis/This Location</i></b>, 2012, at the Gwangju Art Fair, South Korea, and <b><i>Vista</i></b>, 2011, at the 1961 Gallery in Cambodia. His sixth solo show, <b><i>Hangganan </i></b>(Limit), 2013, was held at Manila Contemporary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rodriguez began showing in group exhibitions in the Philippines in 1996. He also participated in group exhibitions in China, England, Malaysia, and Singapore, including <b><i>Drawing a Distance: Drawings from Three Cities</i></b>, 2012, at the House of Matahati, and <b><i>Art Triangle</i></b>, 2010, at the National Art Gallery in Kuala Lumpur; <b><i>Rubix Rukus</i></b>, 2009, at the National University of Singapore Museum; and <b><i>Asian Art Showcase</i></b>, 2008, at the Novas Contemporary Urban Centre in Liverpool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Along with UGATLahi, Rodriguez completed artist residencies at Big Sky Mind, 2004-5, and the Sambalikhaan Artist Village, 2005-10. He also completed residencies in Malaysia and Singapore.

Manila 1942. d. 21 Jul 2014. Painter, printmaker. He was the son of pioneering printmaker Manuel Rodriguez Sr and Natividad Panis. He was married to Melanie Tiongson. His brother Marcelino is a painter and printmaker. He had an early exposure to art and art making. He had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts from the University of Santo Tomas, and, under a scholarship grant, studied graphic arts at the Pratt Institute in New York from 1969 to 1974. Rodriguez founded and managed Sepia Print Gallery in New York in 1969 along with his brother Marcelino and other Filipino printmakers such as Amberto Hechanova, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\"><strong>Nonoy Marcelo</strong></a>, and Lucio Martinez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art of Manuel Rodriguez Jr shows his intense engagement with a variety of materials, textures, and techniques while challenging customary art practice. In search of alternative concepts and inspirations other than those deriving from the West, he found these in Philippine indigenous art, as in the expressions of the cultural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He studied native weaving and ceramics in Manila, which heavily influenced his treatment of his art. In his tapestries inspired by indigenous weaves, Rodriguez conveys the value of developing an appreciative understanding of the material through direct tactile experience of the work. A principal concern of his has been the merging of art and craft, such as turning fiber into art. Despite the fact that he has had long sojourns in the United States, the artist explores themes of indigenous culture and the tropical environment. In his dye-resist paintings on cloth, he dwells on the expatriate theme in an original way. In <b><i>Not in New York</i></b>, he created a counter-image of the American asphalt jungle in the imagery of lush vegetation and tropical gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first one-person show was at the Contemporary Arts Gallery in 1961, and he had at least 14 others here and abroad. He participated in at least 41 group shows in painting in the Philippines and abroad and 18 exhibitions on printmaking in the United States from 1961 to 1985. He represented the Philippines in Brazil at the 9th Sao Paulo Biennale in 1967, in New Mexico at the New Mexico Triennale in 1971, and in Japan at the Tokyo Biennale in 1974.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rodriguez received awards from the Art Association of the Philippines art competitions: honorable mention, <b><i>Mayag</i></b>, 1960; third prize, <b><i>Cigarette Vendors</i></b>, 1961; honorable mention, <b><i>Carnaval</i></b>, 1962; bronze medal, <b><i>Picnic in Summer</i></b>, 1963; purchase award, <b><i>Ocean Effie</i></b>, 1964; purchase award, <b><i>Homeward</i></b>, 1964; second prize, <b><i>Devil&rsquo;s Playground</i></b>, 1966; honorable mention, painting category, 1967; and first prize, <b><i>Devil&rsquo;s Domain</i></b>, 1967.

Cebu City 1 Jan 1912. d. Florida, USA 6 May 2017. Printmaker, painter. He was the son of Severino Rodriguez and Antonina Timario. He married Natividad Panis. His sons Manuel Jr and Marcelino are painters and printmakers. Rodriguez&rsquo;s early environment was conducive to his artistic development since his father was an engraver and goldsmith who did gold and silver ornaments for churches, designed liturgical vestments, and fashioned jewelry. He finished his elementary education in Argao, Cebu, and his high school at Southern Institute (now University of Southern Philippines Foundation). In 1935, he left Cebu for Manila and enrolled at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts, where he studied until 1939. His classmates included fellow Cebuanos <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\"><strong>Martino Abellana</strong></a> and Julian Jumalon. As early as the 2nd <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> Watercolor Exhibition, 1952, when the debate between the conservatives and the modernists was at its height, Rodriguez had cast his lot with the modernists, with himself winning the first prize in the modern category and Abellana the first prize in the conservative category. In the historic 1955 AAP Annual Art Competition marked by the walkout of the conservatives, Rodriguez also won a major prize for his painting <b><i>Liberty Walls</i></b>, along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\"><strong>Galo B. Ocampo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>. Even before Rodriguez devoted himself to printmaking, he had already attained recognition as a painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rodriguez&rsquo;s skill in serigraphy served him in good stead in the lean years of the war that broke out on the eve of his graduation from arts school. After the war, in 1948, he introduced serigraphy or silkscreen to the local art scene when he opened a small gallery to serve as outlet for the works of his students who learned from his workshop. In 1958, he received a grant from the Pratt Institute in New York where he studied lithography and etching. In 1961, he worked as trainee in the print department of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, after which he trained under the pioneer British printmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Stanley Hayter of Atelier 17 in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon his return to the Philippines in 1962, Rodriguez reorganized his Contemporary Art Gallery at 1416 A. Mabini St into a graphic art workshop and gallery. He also taught at the University of Santo Tomas and Philippine Women&rsquo;s University where he established the graphic arts department and proved to be an exemplary teacher who took the popularization of printmaking as his personal vision. Not long after, Philippine printmaking began to flourish mainly through the zeal of Rodriguez and with the organizers of the Philippine Association of Printmakers (PAP) like Maring Llamado, Adiel Arevalo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3424\"><strong>Ivi Avellana-Cosio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\"><strong>Virgilio Aviado</strong></a>, Petite Calaguas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3724\"><strong>Nelfa Querubin</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a>, Jo Escudero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3468\"><strong>Orlando Castillo</strong></a>, and Rodriguez&rsquo;s own children: Manuel Rodriguez Jr aka Boy Rodriguez, Marcelino, Rey, and Marietta. For popularizing printmaking as contemporary art medium, a medium that was previously thought of as lowbrow and inferior to painting, Rodriguez is called the &ldquo;Father of Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\"><strong>Printmaking</strong></a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The production of his gallery-workshop was varied and prolific, marked by the enthusiasm of his students for new techniques and processes. From serigraphy, it branched out into lithography, woodcut, etching, aquatint, mezzotint, and drypoint prints. Spurred by the success of the Contemporary Graphic Arts Workshop in San Andres, Rodriguez put up a studio in New York where he now resides, the Pioneer Print Center at 1170 Broadway. His students and the PAP continued his crusade for printmaking and were joined by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From Dec 1982 to Jan 1983, Rodriguez held a big show of recent works at the Museum of Philippine Art. Reflecting his long and rich experience in printmaking, the exhibit gathered his &ldquo;sculptural prints&rdquo; in one gallery and his paintings in another. His sculptural prints are striking for their lively colors and textural contrasts and sculptural features: foldouts and projecting forms that involved the processes of cutting the paper, folding it out to form a protruding circular shape, and inserting within papers of different colors. These produced the effect of rosettes in relief, which, in the entire composition, can be bursting suns and flowering stars&mdash;bright focal points in landscapes of fantasy, marked by childlike whimsicality and grace. His texture art shows the artist&rsquo;s involvement in texture which, for him, is the physical experience of life itself. With the use of a microscopic lens, he takes photographs of wood grains or cracks in the floor and develops these into symbolic shapes of an experience or a memory. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> single print may combine a wide variety of techniques and processes which Rodriguez has at his fingertips. While he emphasizes the importance of developing technical skills in processes, he also believes that art can be created from ordinary materials through ingenuity and creative exploration. Rodriguez creates a rich artistic universe through an extensive vocabulary of processes that exceed the traditional graphic art methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His output as printmaker includes <b><i>Traveller</i></b>, 1961; <b><i>Calesa</i></b> (Horse-Drawn Carriage), 1965; <b><i>Garden of Allah</i></b>, 1969; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2176\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2176\"><strong>Entourage</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1970; <b><i>Penitent</i></b>, 1971; <b><i>Limbo</i></b> and <b><i>Sabong</i></b> (Cockfight), 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rodriguez&rsquo;s <b><i>Jai</i></b>-<b><i>alai</i></b> won an honorable mention in the 1949 Manila Club Art Exhibition. He received awards from the AAP: third prize, <b><i>Washing by the Creek</i></b>, 1949; honorable mention, <b><i>Fragment</i></b>, 1950; honorable mention, <b><i>Two Girls</i></b>, 1951; first prize, <b><i>Lalaki&rsquo;t Babae</i></b> (Boy and Girl), 1952; first prize,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/479\"><strong>Tatlong Hari</strong></a></i></b> (Three Kings), 1953; second prize, <b><i>A Girl, A Flower</i></b>, 1954; Rotary Golden Anniversary Award and second prize, <b><i>Liberty Walls</i></b>, 1955; honorable mention, <b><i>Quarry</i></b>, 1959; best entry, <b><i>Traveller</i></b>, 1962; and honorable mention, <b><i>Fertility</i></b> <b><i>Rite</i></b>, 1963. He received the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1967. When he first returned to Cebu in 1997, he also received two awards: the Provincial Capitol&rsquo;s Garbo sa Sugbu Award and the Rajah Humabon Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beatrice Harding wrote a book on Rodriguez and his art, titled <b><i>Survival through Art</i></b>, 1974. In 2009, the Lenore RS Lim Foundation for the Arts also published a book of the same nature, <b><i>Manuel Rodriguez, Sr: Into the Threshold</i></b>, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, Eva Florentino, Virgilio Aviado, and Clint White. When he was 98, he came back to Cebu to visit exhibits, converse with artists and students, and witness the launching of his book. As a celebration of his centennial year, Rodriguez launched his coffee-table book, which features his life and art, at the Philippine Center in San Francisco in Aug 2012. There he was awarded by the consul general a certificate of appreciation for his artistry and for generously sharing it to the San Francisco community. Four months later, the Cebu Artists Inc held <b><i>Homage: An Exhibit of Prints in Honor of Manuel Rodriguez Sr.</i></b> in SM City Cebu as a tribute to Rodriguez, who served as an inspiration for many Cebuano artists. The exhibit, which displayed various prints by native artists of Cebu, also aimed to present printing as a living art form and the Cebuano masters as artists who knew how to break away from traditional artistic forms and adapt to different media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the age of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>, Rodriguez still conducted workshops in the Philippines and abroad. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

Manila 1946. Printmaker, painter. He is the son of Manuel Rodriguez Sr and Natividad Panis, the brother of painter Manuel Rodriguez Jr aka Boy. He studied fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas. Like his father and brother, Marcelino also studied at the Pratt Institute in New York under a four-year scholarship program. Working closely with his father and older brother Manuel Jr, he became a devoted and innovative printmaker like them. He helped his father manage the Contemporary Graphic Arts Workshop in Manila, and later assisted his brother in organizing the Sepia Gallery and Workshop in Manhattan, New York, in 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcelino experimented on a variety of graphic techniques although he was most partial to etching and aquatint. <b><i>Endless</i></b> <b><i>Night</i></b>, 1974, is an aquatint work in deep black made up of a grid arrangement of random shapes and forms. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2226\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2226\"><strong>Man and Woman</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1974, another intaglio in varying shades of gray, makes use of the same strategy of textural pattern repetition. His <b><i>Untitled No. II</i></b>, 1974, a photoserigraph, is a simple, playful composition of flat, colorful linear doodles. Most of his works are decorative abstract patterns that adhere to an art for art&rsquo;s sake approach to presence as end in itself. Some of his works, such as <b><i>Fruit Basket</i></b> and <b><i>Pitcher and Fruits</i></b>, incorporate recognizable but flat figures in the foreground that hide a tapestry of abstract figures and shapes in the background. Technical virtuosity and self-confident boldness akin to American pop art characterize his artistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He had many solo exhibits in the Philippines and in New York, the first being at the Luz Gallery in Manila in 1969.

He also participated in the Pratt Graphic Arts Center Traveling Exhibit in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He won first prize in the Art Association of the Philippines annual Graphic Arts Competition, 1966; third prize in the 17th Shell National Students Art Competition, 1967; grand prize in the Philippine Association of Printmakers Annual Competition and Exhibition, 1969; and grand prize at the Pratt Graphic Annual Competition.

Roxas City 6 Jun 1953. Painter, multimedia artist. He took up philosophy at the St. Pius X Seminary and fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas, where he won first place in the annual advertising design competition in 1976. He also took graduate courses in art studies from the University of the Philippines. It was in Bacolod City, where he taught, that he became actively involved in artist&rsquo;s groups and activities, and held his first exhibitions. In 1987, he worked as art director in a Sydney advertising company and graphic designer at the Australian Center of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a>. He, together with other Bacolod-based artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3474\"><strong>Charlie Co</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\"><strong>Nunelucio Alvarado</strong></a>, Dennis Ascalon, and Lilibeth Lao, formed the Black Artists of Asia (BAA) in 1986. In 1990 and 1992, he initiated and coordinated the BAA-organized Visayas Island Visual Arts Exhibition and Conference. Along with fellow artist Donna Miranda, he founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a> in 2000, an alternative artist-run space located in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his early works, Roldan combines contemporary and traditional images and techniques in using indigenous materials and found objects to make social statements. He is a longtime avid collector, and his collections consisting of different everyday objects and paraphernalia often find their way into his installations. Newspaper clippings, bottle caps, crocheted doilies, <i>patadyong</i> fabric, scapulars, reeds, vintage toys, figurines, lipstick holders, amulets, beer crates, and grasses are assemblaged in flat, rhythmic, decorative manner. Roldan believes that ordinary items hold meaning such that they are witnesses to the histories of the people who own them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his later works, Roldan created diptychs that feature a photo-realistic image from the past on one side and a textual passage&mdash;also derived from history&mdash;on the other. This juxtaposition of texts that occurred within different historical events questions the truthfulness of history, and in the process also creates a new interpretation with a strong social statement. In his work <b><i>F-16</i></b>, 2012, a 6 x 12 ft oil-and-acrylic canvas diptych that represented him at the <b><i>No Country</i></b> exhibition in Guggenheim Museum, Roldan painted on the left half an American fighter jet flying over the lands of Afghanistan as a response to the 9/11 attacks. On the other half is an excerpt from a published interview with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> McKinley, the American president who led America&rsquo;s &ldquo;benevolent assimilation&rdquo; of the Philippines. The excerpt states America&rsquo;s justification of its imperialistic actions, such as that the Philippines is &ldquo;unfit for self-government.&rdquo; Bringing the image and text together&mdash;which represent historical events that happened a century apart&mdash;interrogates the truth that man only repeats his mistakes through the course of history. <b><i>F-16</i></b>, along with another diptych of his titled <b><i>First Lady</i></b>, 2012, is now part of the Guggenheim Museum permanent collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 1983, when he exhibited with Alvarado and Co at the University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos in Bacolod City, Roldan has had one-person shows and joined group exhibitions both in the Philippines and abroad. His early solo exhibitions, starting with <b><i>Mixed Media</i></b>, 1984, at the La Consolacion College in Bacolod City, have been held mostly in Bacolod galleries. His Manila shows include <b><i>Dagway sa Inaway</i></b> (Images of War), 1987, at the Hiraya Gallery and <b><i>Negative Collections Et Al.</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1985, at the Art Association of the Philippines Gallery. Later on, he held more solo shows in Manila art galleries, such as in Hiraya Gallery, 1994 and 1999; Green Papaya, 2001 and 2005; Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise, 2004; Mag:net Gallery, 2007; MO Space, 2008; Pablo Fort, 2009; and Now Gallery, 2011 and 2012. International solo exhibitions were also held abroad such as at the Charles Darwin University Gallery in Darwin, Australia, 2003; Taksu, Kuala Lumpur, 2009; Taksu, Singapore, 2009, 2011, and 2012; and the Vulcan Artbox in Waterford, Ireland, 2012. He also participated in a number of art exhibitions abroad such as the <b><i>Philippine Exhibition Series: Imaging of the Continuing Struggle</i></b>, 1989, Sydney, Australia; <b><i>New Art in Southeast Asia</i></b>, 1992, Japan; <b><i>ASEAN Travelling Exhibition</i></b>, 1991, and <b><i>Handmade Paperworks</i></b>, 1992, Philippine Center in New York, USA; <b><i>Identities versus Globalisation</i></b>, 2004 and 2005, Bangkok, Thailand; <b><i>Flippin&rsquo; Out: Manila to Williamsburg</i></b>, 2005, New York, USA; <b><i>No Soul for Sale</i></b>, 2010, London, United Kingdom; <b><i>Negotiating Home History and Nation: Two Decades of Contemporary Art in Southeast Asia</i></b> <b><i>1991-2011</i></b>, 2011, Singapore; and <b><i>No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia</i></b>, 2013 and 2014, Guggenheim Museum, New York, USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works can be found abroad at the Solomon R.

Paco, Manila 1840. d. Paris 13 Apr 1899. Painter. He is the son of Antonio Roxas and Lucina Arroyo. He married Raymunda Chuidian. He was the brother of architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\"><strong>Felix Roxas</strong></a>. An alumnus of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, he taught such subjects as linear drawing, drafting, and design at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. In 1884, up to the time he migrated to Paris, he taught at the University of Santo Tomas (UST). Among his students were Jose Ma. Asuncion, whom he advised to refine his studies in Europe. Only a few paintings by Roxas have survived&mdash;namely, <b><i>Casa Indigena en Baliuag </i></b>(Native House in Baliuag), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2279\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2279\"><strong>Puente de Paete</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Paete Bridge), <b><i>Iglesia de <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/262\"><strong>Antipolo Church</strong></a>), 1889, and <b><i>Despues de la Mercado</i></b> (After Market Hours), all in the Pagrel Collection. In 1889, he left for Paris with his wife and children. His descendants still live there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Roxas is regarded as a painter of buildings because of the three extant paintings and reproductions of numerous paintings now lost. This may have been the influence of his stepbrother, the architect Felix Roxas, who built the gothic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> destroyed during World War II. Felix might have asked Felipe to draft the plans, facades, and interiors of the buildings he constructed. Thus, Felipe&rsquo;s paintings of architecture are firmly drawn, solidly defined, and enriched with a lot of architectural ornamental details. <b><i>Casa Indigena en Baliuag</i></b> shows a lower middle-class house of the period with a steep roof of nipa, bamboo stairs outside the main structure, and window shutters also of bamboo. In the background is a rich upper-class house with stone walls, capiz windows, and tiled roof. These works were exhibited at the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition) in 1895. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Painter, multimedia artist, curator. He is the son of Felipe Ruiz and Victoria Tence. He is married to Rosario Ta&ntilde;edo and they have two children, the eldest Amihan is a theater actress. He graduated with a fine arts degree, cum laude, from the University of Santo Tomas in 1979 and subsequently taught anatomy there to art students. He was a member of Kaisahan, a group of socially committed artists, as well as of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ruiz began with a series of austere still lifes. From this, he proceeded to assemblages of shirts sewn from canvas and impregnated with synthetic resin to convey a sense of expressive form. In 1978, he began his Bus and Jeepney painting series marked by bright colors and unusual angles of vision. This developed into the three-dimensional work <b><i>Jeepney, Tagilira&rsquo;t Tapalodo </i></b>(Jeepney, Side and Hood), which shows the side of the vehicle with a row of passengers&rsquo; heads done in resin with a wire framework. A comment on colonial mentality, <b><i>Kikong Baterya</i></b> (Kiko the Battery), another three-dimensional work, shows a standing figure stiff and proud in his boxed facade outfitted in American coat and tie but revealing rugged bare feet where the facade ends. The assemblage <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2178\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2178\"><strong>Erding Erdrayb at ang Kanyang Palasyong Agaw-Tanaw</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Driver Erding and His Now-You-See-It-Now-You-Don&rsquo;t Palace) brings together all the talismans of the folk survivalist psyche. The figure itself is basically constituted from an upright pay telephone bolstered with a radio-cum-cassette player. His work <b><i>Tinolang Tinalo si Hari Manok at Iba Pang Martir ng La Loma </i></b>(Tinola Dish That Defeated King Rooster and Other Martyrs of La Loma) continues the theme of folk psychology as manifested in cockfighting. The Katay (Butcher) painting series consists of large expressionist works, the central image of which is the carcass, the decaying beast, symbol of the system that breeds prostitution and criminality. In <b><i>Mga Nagnininong kay Neneng </i></b>(Neneng&rsquo;s Sponsors), an a-go-go dancer emerges from the flanks of the beast to entertain her imperialist masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ruiz&rsquo;s solo exhibitions include <b><i>Bukod Tanging Pag-ibig</i></b> (Special Love), 2009, Silverlens Galleries, Makati; <b><i>Wag Ma-inlab sa Tao sa TV</i></b> (Don&rsquo;t Be In-Love with a Person on TV), 2009, Kaida Gallery, Quezon City; <b><i>Speculation: Only the Old Die Young</i></b>, 2010, and <b><i>Sagala de Ligalig</i></b>, 2012, both at Art Informal, Mandaluyong; and <b><i>Barangay Humigit Kumulang </i></b>(Village More or Less), 2013, Artist Space, Ayala Museum, Makati City.

In 2015, Ruiz was one of the artists that comprised the Philippine Pavillion exhibit at the 56th Venice Biennale, <b><i>Tie a String around the World</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an artist-curator, Ruiz&rsquo;s projects include <b><i>MMY</i></b>, the National Capital Region leg of Sungdu-an 2: National Visual Art Exhibition, 1999, Museo ng Maynila; <b><i>Analog/Playground</i></b>, 2006, Ateneo Art Gallery; and <b><i>Tutok:Nexus</i></b>, 2007, Ateneo de Manila University Loyola House of Studies.

Navotas 22 May 1971. Painter, performance artist. He studied fine arts at the University of the East (UE) and while there became a founding member of the student organization Buklod Sining in 1989. He is the artistic director of Tupada Action and Media Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ruiz is a performance artist and painter who has also done installation work. While still a student, he often had the indigenous Filipino native as subject. Ruiz was born of meager means and as he became an active member of the leftist student organization League of Filipino Students during his UE years, social problems and issues would also feature in his work. The color red was the dominant color in the rallies he contributed to as a street muralist at that time and it was a color often found dominant in his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ruiz worked for two years in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as a graphic artist, and this experience provided him with firsthand experience of life as an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) who had to deal with the idea of being a human commodity while struggling in a foreign land. The paintings he did that received recognition soon after this overseas stint were <b><i>Bagahe</i></b>, Juror&rsquo;s Choice, 1996 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> Annual Art Competition; <b><i>Sexportation</i></b>, Juror&rsquo;s Choice, 1997 AAP Annual Art Competition; <b><i>Human Smuggling</i></b>, Juror&rsquo;s Choice (Top 5), 1997 Philip Morris Group of Companies Philippine Art Awards; and <b><i>Reshuffled Identity</i></b>, Best Entry, 1998 AAP Centennial Regional Art Competition. Ruiz, however, would later go beyond the OFW plight to explore more widely themes of human oppression and pain, such as in <b><i>The Master</i></b>, which won Juror&rsquo;s Choice (Top 5) in the Philip Morris Group of Companies Philippine Art Awards in 2000. Eventually, his works would be influenced by his fascination with technology and advocacy for environmental awareness. Beginning with the solo exhibition <b><i>High Risk</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2002, technology became the principal inspiration for his paintings, many of which are expressed in abstract forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He discovered performance art by accident while he was a fine arts student. He performed the <i>atang</i> (offering) ritual from Northern Luzon during one UE Foundation Day and did not know this constituted performance art, until the college dean spoke to him about it the next day. Ruiz continued to do performance art alongside painting; and as it had been in his early work, these performances featured themes related to his roots, social issues, the life of OFWs, and human pain. An association with fellow Filipino performance artists led to the series of performance events held mainly in public spaces called Tupada Action and Media Art in 2002. The visual composition of his performances is influenced by his training as a painter. Avoiding being too theatrical, he consciously integrates elements of spontaneity and interactivity in his performance art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Locally, he has held solo exhibitions in Boston Gallery, Ayala Museum, The British Council, West Gallery, Red Dot Gallery, Renaissance Gallery, Big and Small Art Co., SM Megamall Art Center, Galerie Astra, Whitebox Studio, and The Drawing Room. He has also participated in international exchanges in Japan, ZSenne Art Lab in Belgium, Gonggan 415 in South Korea, and New Zero Art Space in Myanmar. He participated in group exhibitions and visual and performance art events in Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Dubai, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Macau, Myanmar, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia. He was artist in residence at Artspace, Sydney, Australia, in 1999 and Artesan Gallery + Studio, Singapore in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ruiz received the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Thirteen Artists Award in 2003.

Mankayan, Benguet 22 May 1969. Visual artist. He is the son of Juan Pabros Sabado and Mildred Barreras. Sabado is a Cordilleran artist whose large-scale and intricate pen-and-inks on canvas or handmade paper depict the indigenous people&rsquo;s struggle against environmental abuse. He is based in Baguio City as a Tam-awan village artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sabado grew up amidst both the abundance of nature and the expropriation of its resources. He was born and raised in the mining town of Mankayan, a once thickly forested muni&shy;cipality tucked in the northern corner of Benguet. His Ilocano parents worked for the logging concessions of Lepanto Consolidated Mining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, but the declaration of a total log ban in the mid-1980s resulted in their unemployment and the family&rsquo;s migration to Baguio City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He began exhibiting with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a> in the early 1990s. Together with Ged Alangui, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3381\"><strong>Leonardo Aguinaldo</strong></a>, and Jordan Mag-osan, he is part of the second generation of artists from Baguio who gained prominence in the late 1990s for works showing mastery of artistic techniques coupled with strong sociopolitical messages regarding ecology, clashes between indigenous Cordillera cultural values against the onset of modernity, and depictions of the spirit world, juxtaposed with urban and rural life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>bulol</b><i> </i>(a carved figure of ancestor-spirits) in a gas mask frequently populates Sabado&rsquo;s dreamscapes of mountain ranges, blocky urban stru&shy;ctures, forests, tree stumps, and a backdrop of intricate patterns remi&shy;niscent of Cordilleran&shy; traditional weaving. This can be seen in works such as <b><i>Soaring Spirits</i></b>, 2011, the series <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> Warrior, 2011, <b><i>Bontoc Warrior</i></b>, 2012, and <b><i>Kalinga Woman</i></b>, 2011, all exhibited in <b><i>Vanguards of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2012, in The Drawing Room, Makati.

Santa Cruz, Manila 1914. d. Paris, France 17 Feb 1994. Painter. She was the youngest girl among nine children of Dr Epifanio Saguil and Remedios Laconico, a relative of the 19th-century painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>. Saguil graduated from the School of Fine Arts in the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1933. She received a medal of excellence from UP in 1949. She was the first woman to win an award at the Art Association of the Philippines art competition in 1949. She is recognized as the only woman invited to exhibit at the First Exhibition of Non-objective Art in Tagala curated by Magtanggul Asa at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\"><strong>Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</strong></a> in 1953. Her first one-person show was held at the PAG in 1950. Four years later, she went to the United States on a Walter Damrash scholarship. She received a French government scholarship in 1954 and studied abstract art at the Ecole d&rsquo;Art Americain, Palais de Fountainbleau. In 1955-56, she was a scholar of the Institute of Spanish Culture in Madrid and at the Academie de la Grand Chaumier in Paris. Since then, she resided in Paris but did not give up her Filipino citizenship. She frequently visited Manila in the 1970s-1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saguil is best known for her quasi-abstract paintings in which the predominant figure is the circle in its infinite variations. However, her early paintings of the late 1940s were representational portraits and genre that emphasized the rotundity of the subject. In the early 1950s, she did a series of genre works on wood panels depicting peasants and stevedores rendered in a distinctly rhythmic style. In Paris in 1955, the artist had a brief cubist phase playing on the relationship of geometric shapes. In her most experimental period, Saguil rubbed coffee grains into her paintings for texture. In 1967, she did several shaped canvases with circular holes or relief elements. Some watercolors of the mid-1960s were turbulent microcosms, with sweeping movements and dramatic light-and-dark effects. Her art of the 1960s also possessed an organic vitality in the imagery of cells proliferating and forming tissues bound together by nets of fine nerves. The first half of the 1970s saw her work entering a new phase of harmony and serenity depicted in landscapes without gravity, where circles rise and float in a blue and rose ether, deploying circular forms that are also bubbles, spheres, orbs, globes, worlds, suns and moons, and the artist&rsquo;s magical mandalas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saguil&rsquo;s works have been exhibited in prestigious galleries in The Hague, Munich, Zurich, Madrid, London, Stockholm, Istanbul, and New York. A number of the artist&rsquo;s works are in the permanent collections of the Centre National d&rsquo;Art Contemporain, the Fondation Nationale des Arts Graphiques et Plastiques, and the Musee d&rsquo;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. In the Philippines, her works are in the collections of the Lopez Memorial Museum and the National Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saguil won several awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: eighth place for <b><i>Faith</i></b>, 1949; honorable mention for <b><i>Mother and Child</i></b>, 1951; and honorable mention for <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>mal</i></b>, 1954. Saguil received recognition from the Salon International de Juvisy, Paris-Sud, 1964; the Musee de la Lumiere, Tours, France, 1967; and the Second Annual Italian Graphic Art Show, Ancona, Italy, 1968. She received the Gawad Tanglaw ng Lahi from Ateneo de Manila University in 2004. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Lemery, Batangas25 Dec 1944. d. 14 Feb 2004. Fashion designer. He was the son of Isabel and Juanito Salazar. Salazar studied architecture at Mapua Institute of Technology in the 1970s before he dropped out to work as an apprentice for couturier Ben Farrales, and later pursue further studies under Salvacion Lim-Higgins. An early breakthrough came when he was introduced by movie columnist Ethel Ramos to actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salazar is known for creating silhouettes that drape the body of the wearer, appropriating the features and fabrics of the traditional Filipino dress. In 1974, Salazar gained fame for designing an iconic albeit controversial translucent hoop terno with a set of hot pants underneath, for Miss Israel at the Miss Universe Pageant held in Manila. Salazar subsequently won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3814\"><strong>Ramon Valera</strong></a> Award for Fashion in 1975 with a softly draped and beaded blue chiffon gown as his entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He is best known for his contributions to the wardrobe of former First Lady, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos, who became a loyal patron of Salazar in the early 1980s. With Marcos, Salazar was able to freely begin experimenting with unconventional materials such as horsehair or peacock feathers. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Salazar typically kept few records of his work and did not document his process, preferring to approach fashion design instinctively to ensure the uniqueness of each piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Throughout his career, Salazar was the first choice for formal and bridal wear among many of the Philippines&rsquo; most popular figures in entertainment and politics. He made the inaugural gown of former First Lady Maria Luisa Ejercito in 1998, and dressed numerous high-profile brides, including Charlene Gonzales-Muhlach, Irene Marcos-Araneta, Jackie Ejercito-Lopez, and Angela Montenegro-Arroyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A final retrospective of Salazar&rsquo;s iconic ternos was held in Nov 2003 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> ELJ Communication Center, while another tribute exhibition was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila in 2003. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice A.

Davao 11 Sep 1978. d. 12 Mar 2014. Painter, puppeteer, illustrator, animator. He was the son of Carlito Salubayba and Flocerpida Maralit. He was married to Jennifer &ldquo;OJ&rdquo; Togan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salubayba was a member of the Avellana-Brocka Batch of the Philippine High School for the Arts (PHSA) where he graduated in 1995. Later, he earned a bachelor of fine arts in studio arts from the College of Fine Arts in the University of the Philippines (UP) in 2000. Salubayba was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>no Shadowplay Collective and the Tutok Artist Collective. He was a teacher at Laguna&rsquo;s Beacon Academy, visiting faculty of the PHSA and the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University where he spearheaded the Center for Visual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\"><strong>Printmaking</strong></a> in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salubayba&rsquo;s works use personal narratives to launch into the broad scope of allegory. His multimedia practice tackles the hazy relationships between personal and collective memory, rereadings of history and institutional thought, as well as resonances and tensions of the folkloric past in a present flattened by modernity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His paintings and installations are heavily influenced by his multimedia work as a shadow puppeteer insofar as crafting narratives and characters, the layering of light and images, sensitivity to space, and the use of alternative materials all play a large part in his creative vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salubayba held his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Figured Realities</i></b>, 2002, in Boston Gallery in San Juan. In the same year, he mounted a second solo exhibition at Kulay Diwa Galleries titled <b><i>Portraits</i></b>. Salubayba&rsquo;s other one-man exhibitions include <b><i>Echoes of the Sea</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2003, in Casa San Miguel, Zambales, and <b><i>Imaje-Naci&oacute;n</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2006, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). These were followed by a prolific period in which Salubayba held at least two solo exhibitions in the Philippines and abroad every year from 2008 to 2011. Among these are <b><i>Images from My Floating Third World</i></b>, 2008, The Drawing Room Gallery; <b><i>The Peculiarity of a Familial Atmosphere</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009, Valentine Willie Fine Arts Gallery, Singapore; <b><i>The Muddled Matter of the Multi-tasking Monsters</i></b>, 2010, Orange Gallery, Bacolod; <b><i>Lamat </i></b>(Fracture/Crack), 2010, Tin-aw Gallery; and <b><i>Excess Baggage</i></b>, 2011, Taipei&rsquo;s Project Fulfilled Gallery. Salubayba mounted <b><i>The Union of the Forgotten and the Unknown</i></b>, 2012, at the Kuandu Biennale in Taipei. His last exhibition was <b><i>Sala sa Init, Sala sa Lamig</i></b> (Hot or Cold, You Lose), 2013, at the UP Vargas Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salubayba also took part in group exhibitions like <b><i>Retro-Active</i></b>, 2005, CCP; <b><i>Pali-Palaruan</i></b> (wordplay on &ldquo;airport&rdquo; and &ldquo;playground&rdquo;), 2008, Museo Pambata&rsquo;s Zero-In Project; <b><i>State of Education of the Nation (TUTOK SOeNa)</i></b>, 2010, with the TUTOK Collective at the Manila Contemporary; and <b><i>Looking for Juan</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, UP Vargas Museum.

Salubayba partook of several residencies in Fukuoka, San Francisco, New York, Taipei, Hanoi, Vermont, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>sburgh, and Zambales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from his career as a painter and illustrator, Salubayba also worked in stage and production design. He worked as visual director for<b><i> Uyayi ng Dalampasigan </i></b>(Lullaby of the Shore), 2003, at Casa San Miguel, and as stage designer for <b><i>Apples in the Dessert</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009, at the CCP, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\"><strong>Dulaang UP</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Umuulan Umaaraw</i></b> (It Rains, It Shines), 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salubayba was awarded the Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda Award for Best Thesis for his undergraduate work at the University of the Philippines in 2000.

Manila 22 Jan 1980. Visual artist. He is the son of Ramsel Salvatus and Annie Na&ntilde;ez. He is married to the Japanese curator Mayumi Hirano. Salvatus graduated with honors from the University of Santo Tomas with a degree in advertising arts. He is co-founder of the urban street collective Pilipinas Street Plan and co-director of 98B Collaboratory, two Manila-based artist collectives that focus on multidisciplinary collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salvatus&rsquo;s art comes from a committed interest in process, the resultant work often comprised of trails across places. A central feature of these sites is art, varied in modes of making and form. Paths across journeys, junctions, and intersections, stops whereby conversations unfold: all three make up Salvatus&rsquo;s imagination of the city&rsquo;s complex terrain. The artist walks, breathes, and lives the city with a trained eye, a sharp wit, a relentless curiosity, and an itinerary that proposes contemporary art as compass. The artist scrutinizes the highly aestheticized everyday expressions within urban settings and translates the short-lived gaieties that permeate daily urban life. Yet we are made to realize that this is only one face of the city: where there is great abundance, there is harrowing loss; where there is staggering wealth, there exists crippling poverty. Increasingly, cities all over the world share these inequalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salvatus however, delivers an emancipatory gesture, a degree of hope in the promise offered by the city. This is a theme expressed in conversations facilitated through his art, like the workshops conducted with inmates of a Quezon province jail for his project <b><i>Secret Garden</i></b>,<b> </b>2011,<b> </b>or the array of filmed lip-synching acts for his <b><i>Territories</i></b> exhibition, 2012. He documents dreams, dual expressions of desperation and hope in an installation piece of a revolving model of a gated community. In these projects, Salvatus forages, pilfers, and becomes both stranger to and dweller of the city. His projects are informed by a wide spectrum of contradictions that define urban life. While all-embracing, cities can also alienate. It is home to many as they transit through many other places like it. This itinerancy, this moving about is at once exhilarating and baffling. To a significant degree, his practice also charts itinerant travels, from his childhood in Lucban, Quezon province, through university training in the heart of old Manila, and of late, his many travels across the globe for artist residencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salvatus has shown in group exhibitions including biennales in Singapore, Yokohama, Guangzhou, Jakarta, Gwangju, and Melbourne. His artist residencies include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Curtain Studio residency grant, Taipei; OMI International Artist Project Grant, New York; and another residency at La Trobe University&rsquo;s Visual Art Centre in conjunction with his receiving the Ateneo Art Award in 2010.

Calabanga, Camarines Sur 29 Mar 1953. Painter. He is the son of Consortia Aguilar and Amaro Salvosa. He had an early exposure to art because his father, a public school teacher, studied at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>. He enrolled at the UP College of Fine Arts and enthusiastically experimented and explored new concepts and techniques. Before graduation, Salvosa did a mural about Mindanao culture measuring 1-1/2 x 12 m for the Mindanao Hotel in Cagayan de Oro. Around 1970-71, he did the Baricada (Barricade) series in acrylic, abstracts in aggressive colors. In 1972, Salvosa became drawn to oriental philosophy, particularly to Zen. He is currently the president of Agos Kulay Maynila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He traveled to Europe in 1976 after winning the Parks and Wildlife On-the-Spot Painting contest sponsored by the Quezon City Jayceerettes. During his tour, he had the opportunity to see the original works of the Italian masters whose masterpieces inspired him to go back to classicism. At the same time, he developed a stronger interest in Philippine festivals and rituals in their folk aesthetic aspect. Inspired by the Ati-Atihan, he tried to combine the local and the Western in paintings of folk subjects marked by classical influence. In 1978, he went to Japan where he stayed for four months. This stay deepened his earlier fascination with Zen aesthetics. His desire was to find a common ground for Asian and European culture. The following year, he revisited Europe as a prize for his winning the painting competition conducted by Circulo Romano and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> on the subject of Lorenzo Ruiz, the first Filipino saint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Back home in 1980, the Asian influence resulted in the series under the title My Name Is Mu. However, his other side brought up in Western influence also demanded expression. In 1981, he held the exhibit <b><i>Ode to Beauty</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which bore allusions to the work of Botticelli, Michelangelo, and da Vinci. This consisted mainly women images, ethereal and idealized. In 1985, still in the quest for meaning in the things around him, he came up with the exhibit titled <b><i>Piping Saksi</i></b> (Mute Witness). Here he focused on subjects that had no voice but were witness to an event or were a part of a social situation or context.  From 1986 to 1987, Salvosa went home to Camarines Norte in the Bicol region and became involved in ecological concerns. His advocacy in protecting the environment reflects in many of his works, as seen in his paintings of <i>diwata</i> (deities), whom he considers the life forces of nature, and babaylan (shamans) who take their herbs from the forests. His most recent project is a series of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> paintings of breastfeeding mothers, a vast collection of Madonna and child, which he considers his muse for his art. The Madonna paintings are rendered in many different ways: some mothers are idealized and universal, while others are more specific and humble Filipina portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salvosa held 25 one-man exhibits in the Philippines since his first show, <b><i>Orchidism</i></b>, in Metro Gallery, Makati in 1976. He had three solos in the USA, the most recent being an art exhibit dedicated to the survivors of the super typhoon Yolanda at the Hamilton Galleries in California, USA, in 2014. Since 1972, Salvosa has also participated in a total of 60 group shows in the Philippines and eight international shows in countries such as Egypt, France, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, USA, and Thailand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He received numerous recognition and awards from art competitions since 1961. His works in both the on-the-spot painting and watercolor contests were runners-up in the 1971 Shell National Students Art Competition. On the same year, he also won second prize at the YMCA Annual Art Competition. His <b><i>Saan Ka Pupunta Juan?</i></b> (Where Are You Going, Juan?) was the best entry in the 1982 Art Association of the Philippines Art Competition. Other awards he received from AAP include Emerging Artist Award, 1975; first prize, First Filipino Saint Art Competition, 1978; and best entry for his work <b><i>Pamana</i></b> (Legacy), Annual Art Competition, lithograph printmaking category, 1995. He was also the Top 5 watercolorist at the 19th Kulay sa Tubig Annual Watercolor Competition in 2002. In 2007, he received recognition as one of the outstanding alumni for the arts in UP. He was awarded the main prize at the Freedom to Create Prize in London, United Kingdom, 2009.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Alice G.

In a country that has an extensive mat-weaving tradition, Laminusa stands out for the excellence and intricacy of its handwoven mats, done with consummate skill by Sama women. Laminusa mats are made from the pandanus plant which grows abundantly in the place and the other islands of Tawi-Tawi. They are distinguished by exceptional pliability, luminosity, and fineness, and from a distance can even be mistaken for woven cloth. The mats feature complex geometric patterns in various color combinations, with plain colored mat serving as base. The tradition of mat weaving in the area has been on the decline due to the entry of more lucrative and easier sources of livelihood.

Manila 29 Feb 1941. Printmaker. He finished art studies at the University of Santo Tomas. He held his first one-person show in 1969. Aside from important local group shows, he participated in Expo &rsquo;70 at Osaka, Japan; the 1973 Sao Paulo Biennale in Brazil; and the fifth International Triennial of Colored Prints in Switzerland, 1970. He traveled to Japan, the United States, South America, and Europe, holding exhibits abroad while studying various printmaking techniques. Samonte developed into a printmaker from various influences: Manuel Rodriguez Sr&rsquo;s workshops, Rod Paras-Perez&rsquo;s woodcuts, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a>&rsquo;s abstractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has consistently done abstract works since 1970. A series called Colorscapes consisted of compositions of pure color and form, marked by precise linear modulation. While abstract, they were allusive of land and sky. From color woodcuts he proceeded to relief serigraphy, in which he molded his own paper through the technique of applying layer upon layer of transparent color on the surface. He showed an innovative handling of shapes and color in his prints, at the same time that he was one of the first to develop handmade paper for prints and paper sculpture. At one point, he did cast paper relief prints in which he rejected color, replacing it with tones and cast shadows. Following his international orientation, Samonte eventually opted to migrate to the United States in 1979. In the United States, he learned to do computer graphics when he worked for a number of advertising agencies. In 1998, he quit work and became a full-time artist. In 2003, he started experimenting with digital art. He presently resides in Burbank, California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His solo exhibitions include <b><i>Spheres of Time</i></b>, a series of large-scale digital paintings on canvas shown at the Arts &amp; Books Gallery, Los Angeles, 2003, and an exhibit in the Philippines titled <b><i>New Work: Large-Scale Digital Paintings</i></b>, 2011, Galerie <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Samonte was cited by the Art Association of the Philippines in 1966 for his woodcut <b><i>Love Garden</i></b> and the serigraph <b><i>Benguet</i></b>, which won first and second prizes, respectively. He was a Thirteen Artists awardee of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in 1974. &bull; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Painter. His parents are Reynaldo Samson and Juliana Sienes. His siblings Jerson, Julio, and Reynaldo are also painters. He graduated with a fine arts degree from the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in 2007. Samson is a member of Sangviaje Art Collective. Its other members are fellow Antipolo-based artists John Paul Antido, Edrick Daniel, Dennis Fortoza, Guerrero Habulan, and Joven Mansit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Samson&rsquo;s early foray into altering perspective is exemplified in his figurative painting titled <b><i>Mas Masaya Kung Nandito Ka</i></b><i> </i>(It&rsquo;s More Fun If You Are Here),<i> </i>a winning entry in the 2005 Government Service Insurance System painting competition. The said painting features a brood of 11 individuals posed outside their home. Akin to a family portrait addressed to a missed breadwinning member, it is a poignant reflection on the increasing wave of migrant Filipino workers in search of greener pastures. Employing the technique of foreshortening, Samson elongates the torso of his figures and distorts their limbs to challenge the viewer&rsquo;s sense of proportion in an otherwise realistic painting. His later works are further explorations on styles of figuration, often emulating the lens of a fish-eye camera, as can be seen in his suite of paintings for <b><i>Iskul Bukol </i></b>(Truants), 2008, and <b><i>Diretso </i></b>(Straight), 2013.<i> </i>Taking a cue from works done as his undergraduate thesis, he appropriates the law of frontality commonly observed in Egyptian paintings. Samson combines this technique with cubism, harnessing the multiple viewpoints it offers to present viewers with unlikely vantage points from which to deal with depth and space in two-dimensional art. Thematically, his works draw from everyday settings, with people mired in poverty and lacking in access to basic needs such as quality education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His solo exhibitions include <b><i>Diretso</i></b>, 2013, Boston Gallery, Cubao; <b><i>Isports Kalye</i></b><i> </i>(Street Sports), 2011,<i> </i>Boston Gallery; <b><i>Eleksyon Hang-ober</i></b><i> </i>(Election Hang-over),<i> </i>2010, Boston Gallery; <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b>,<i> </i>Utterly Art, Singapore; <b><i>Eskulelat</i></b><i> </i>(School Loser),<i> </i>2008, Boston Gallery; <b><i>Tanghaling Tapat</i></b><i> </i>(High Noon), 2007, Boston Gallery; and <b><i>Karaniwang Tao</i></b> (Ordinary Person), 2006, Boston Gallery. He participated in group exhibitions such as <b><i>Distrongka </i></b>(Disassemble),<i> </i>2013, Pinto Art Museum; <b><i>Maelstrom: The Monumental in Philippine Art</i></b>, 2012, Valentine Willie Fine Arts, Singapore;<i> <b>Basta</b></i>:<i> <b>Samson Brothers Group Exhibition</b> </i>(That&rsquo;s It: Samson Brothers Group Exhibition), 2011, Nineveh Art Space, Laguna; <b><i>Crossover Contemporary Art from the Philippines</i></b>,<i> </i>2010, Copenhagen, Denmark; <b><i>Putaje</i></b><i> </i>(Viand), 2008, Art Informal, San Juan; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>Bodabil</strong></a> </i></b>(Vaudeville),<i> </i>2008, Richard Koh Fine Art, Kuala Lumpur; <b><i>The Samsons</i></b>, 2007, Kaida Gallery, Kamuning; <b><i>May Time Art Festival</i></b>,<i> </i>2005, Pinto Art Museum; and <b><i>Winning Entries NCCA: Diwa ng Sining</i></b><i> </i>(Winning Entries NCCA:<b><i> </i></b>The Soul of<i> </i>Art),<i> </i>2000, Art Center, SM Megamall, Mandaluyong City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Samson was awarded best entry in the drawing category of the 56th Art Association of the Philippines Annual Competition in 2003. The following year, he received a Linggo ng Parangal<i> </i>award from the UP Diliman Office of the Chancellor; grand prizes in the 18th Visual Art National Competition of the PLDT-DPC Telephone Directory Cover and the Metrobank Art and Design Excellence in the oil-based medium on canvas category. Samson received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2009. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D. Marcelino</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

They were previously members of the group Salingpusa. They formed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3761\"><strong>Sanggawa</strong></a> in Dec 1994 to create works that departed from Salingpusa&rsquo;s interactive paintings of contemporary Filipino life. Sanggawa sought not just to combine their individual styles into one canvas but also to create a totally collaborative work, thus the name Sanggawa (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Work).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The group is known for their large-scale oil paintings that comment on various topical issues such as politics, religion, cultural displacement, and other Philippine social realities. They are recognized for &ldquo;breathing new life on the Philippine mural tradition&rdquo; (Toh 2009), which is traced back to the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a>, who, together with Victor Edades and Galo Ocampo, pursued mural painting in the mid-1930s and later on formed &ldquo;The Triumvirate&rdquo; of Philippine modern art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among their noted works are <b><i>Second Coming</i></b>, 1994; <b><i>House of Sin</i></b>, 1995; <b><i>Marlboro Man</i></b>, 1995; <b><i>Palo-Sebo</i></b> (Oily Pole Contest), 1995; <b><i>Into the Out</i></b>, 1995; <b><i>La Flor del Mundo </i></b>(Flower of the World), 1996; <b><i>Okamura sa &rsquo;Yo na &rsquo;To </i></b>(This Is for You, Okamura), 1997; <b><i>Engaging Echoes</i></b>, 1998; and <b><i>Epilogo</i></b> (Epilogue), 1998, a mural commissioned by the Metropolitan Museum of Manila for <b><i>Alab ng Puso</i></b> (Flaming Heart), an exhibition commemorating <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> years of Philippine independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sanggawa regularly exhibited at Pinto, Boston, and Hiraya galleries.

Reus, Catalonia, Spain 23 Nov 1929. Painter. He was born to Jose Sanso and Ramona Gerrit who set up a wrought-iron business, Arte Espa&ntilde;ol, after they moved to Manila in 1933. Sanso was not interested in the family business and instead took up informal painting lessons under Alejandro Celis. Encouraged by Celis, he attended classes at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts as a special student, 1948-51. His professors included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\"><strong>Irineo Miranda</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a>. When he was 21, he left for Rome and studied at the Academia di Belle Arti, the Academia della Madaglia, and the Circolo Artistico. He was in Paris in 1953-61, studying at the L&rsquo;Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the years, Sanso developed a unique style of his own, often labelled &ldquo;poetic surrealism.&rdquo; His best-known works are depictions of nature, which include rock forms, flora, seacoasts and riverbanks, bushes, lichen, and fish traps. Through his etchings and drawings of fish traps known locally as <i>baklad</i>, he did for the Para&ntilde;aque fishing village San Dionisio what <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> did for Angono, and what Benedicto Cabrera did for Bambang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first one-man show in Paris, and in 1957 he held his first local exhibition at the Philippine Art Gallery. In 1964, his work <b><i>Lueurs</i></b> was chosen as Print of the Year by the Cleveland Museum of Art. In 1964, he held a major solo show at the Cleveland Museum of Art as well as one-man shows at the Philadelphia Print Club and New York&rsquo;s Weyhe Gallery. His local solo exhibitions include <b><i>Sanso at the</i></b><i> <b>Podium</b></i> and <b><i>Bravo Sanso!</i></b>, both at Galerie Joaquin, 2006; <b><i>Summer</i></b>, Galerie Raphael, and <b><i>Black</i> <i>Bouquet</i></b>, Ayala Museum, 2007; <b><i>Parallel Inspirations</i></b> and <b><i>Dawnscapes</i></b>, Galerie Joaquin, 2008; <b><i>The Importance of Being Juvenal</i></b>, Galerie Stephanie, 2009; <b><i>Premier Sanso</i></b>, Mandarin Oriental Suites, and <b><i>Pioneer of Expressionism</i></b>, SM Art Center, 2009; <b><i>Sanso Moderno</i></b>, Galerie Joaquin,<i> </i>2011; <b><i>Breton Houses</i></b>, Powerplant Mall, and <b><i>Sanso Classic</i></b>, Galerie Stephanie, 2012; and <b><i>Fundamental Sanso</i></b>, The Gallery, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1966, Sanso had a 20-year retrospective show at the Makati Commercial Center. In 1974, a 25-year retrospective of his works was held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. In 1976, he held yet another retrospective of some 1,000 works and released a portfolio of 10 lithographs on Philippine subjects, in commemoration of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Manila. In 1989, he held six simultaneous exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum, Lopez Museum, Ayala Museum, Centro Cultural de Espa&ntilde;a, Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise, and Finale Art File. In 2009, celebrating his 80th birthday, he held a series of shows in Galerie Stephanie, Mandarin Oriental Suites, Gateway Mall, and SM Megamall Art Center. Still another of his birthday exhibitions was a 2012 showing of new works titled <b><i>Paintings of a New Day</i></b> at the SM Megamall Art Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sanso&rsquo;s pieces have been widely exhibited abroad.

Although he was a longtime resident of Paris, Sanso regularly visited and exhibited in the Philippines. Two books, <b><i>Sanso: Art Quest between Two Words</i></b>, 1976, and <b><i>Sanso</i></b>, 1976, were written on the artist by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3702\"><strong>Rodolfo Paras-Perez</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3740\"><strong>Alfredo Roces</strong></a>, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1950, Sanso&rsquo;s work <b><i>Incubus</i> </b>won first prize in the watercolor category of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>.

Manila 26 May 1943. Painter, photographer. He is the son of Amado Santos and Emilia Baens. He graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP). He first worked as an artist in an advertising company. Then, before the declaration of martial law in 1972, he worked as layout artist, illustrator, and photographer for the <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>. This experience exposed him to the harsh social realities of the time. Later during the Marcos regime, he worked as an artist-writer for anti-martial law underground publications such as <b><i>Taliba ng Bayan</i></b> and <b><i>Liberation</i></b>, and joined the protest art movement for which he created popular forms of art such as murals and posters with protest messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos debuted as a painter in a three-person show at the Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a> in 1975. By then, he had become one of the founding members of the Kaisahan group of artists&mdash;the first formal group of nationalist, protest artists in the Philippines&mdash;who developed as social realists and laid down the principles of committed art in the country. Social realism in the Philippines was partly influenced by the 1920 Mexican muralists movement of David Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, and Jose Orozco. The Kaisahan group sought to resist Western influence in Philippine art by veering away from painting only the romantic and beautiful and, instead, exposing the ugly and oppressive reality that the Marcos regime kept hiding. Santos believed that many artists of his time refused to be political in their art, so the group conducted lectures, workshops, and discussions about nationalist art, hoping to inspire in them a more realistic and nationalistic attitude toward art. Santos&rsquo;s social and political beliefs showed in his choice of subjects: street urchins, mother-and-child of the slums, and workers. Most of his early works made use of the current symbols of political struggle: clenched fists, red banners, and a hand muzzling the mouth. In 1979, Santos did some of his strongest works on the theme of social conflict, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2260\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2260\"><strong>Panginoong Maylupa</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Landlord), 1974, and <b><i>Komprador</i></b> (Comprador), 1979. From 1982, Santos concentrated on images of mass mobilization, in a painterly style of sweeping fervor and energy. Some works, such as <b><i>Sagot sa Eleksyon </i></b>(Answer to Election), 1981, and <b><i>Boykot</i></b> (Boycott), 1981, related to specific issues. Later works dealt with the theme of militarization and of homage to the martyrs. The feminist theme also appeared in <b><i>Bagong Pinay</i></b> (Modern Filipina), 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several years after the turbulent Marcos period, he still actively paints current pressing social issues. He pays tribute to the disappeared and the victims of political killings in <b><i>Oplan Tumba</i></b>, an 8 x 36 ft mural that he first unveiled in 2007 in a one-man show in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os. It features several dead bodies splayed on the floor in many parts of the painting, while those alive are left suffering. Feminist theme also emerges in his 2008 painting <b><i>Kalinga sa Kalikasan</i></b> (Attention to Nature), a work that pays homage to mothers. Surrounding the nude mother and child is text painted in different colors, which says: <i>Babae dakila ka! Dahil dibdib mo ang nagpasuso, bisig mo ang nag-aruga sa mga dinadakila</i>. (Woman you are great! Because it is your breasts which breast-fed, and your arms which cared for the heroes). <b><i>Labor and Monkey Business</i></b> or <b><i>Labor Monkey</i></b>, 2010, is a satirical work that mocks those who bathe in power and luxury (the &ldquo;monkeys&rdquo; in their office suits) while the faceless and unrelenting laborers work in dangerous situations. As a social realist, Santos sees his art not only as a mirror of reality but also as an agent of change. His works show the development of his art coinciding with the development of his perception of Philippine reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos has participated in six one-man shows and about 80 group exhibitions. Aside from Kaisahan, he was also a member of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines, Alternative Horizons Media Cooperative, Art Association of the Philippines, and Printmakers Association of the Philippines, and a charter member of Agos Kulay Manila and Balintawak. His won awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: honorable mention, photography, for <b><i>Binondo</i></b>, 1967; and first prize, photography, for <b><i>Mga Adorno ng Binondo</i></b> (Binondo Decor), 1974. He was a Thirteen Artists awardee of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in 1990. For three consecutive years from 2003 through 2005, he was one of the top five watercolorists at the Annual Invitational Watercolor Competition sponsored by &ldquo;Kulay sa Tubig&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></a> Gallery), until in 2007 he received the Hall of Fame Award as Top Watercolorist. Two years later, he became the Best of the Hall of Famers in the same watercolor competition. In 2006, he received an Award of Excellence in Creative Arts at the UP Beta Sigma Fraternity Diamond Jubilee. He has been a judge himself in several art competitions in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works can be found at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippine National Museum, Ateneo Art Gallery, De La Salle Art Museum, Singapore National Museum, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.<em><strong> <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span>Written byAlice G.

Manila 17 Mar 1960. Painter, photographer. He is the son of painter Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos aka Malang and Mary San Pedro, and a brother to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3766\"><strong>Steve Santos</strong></a> aka Stevesantos, also a painter. He married artist Monalisa Reyes with whom he has three children, also artists. He took courses in fine arts at the University of the Philippines in 1978-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos started as a magic realist, moved to semiabstraction, and now experiments with pure abstract imagery. His subject matter, however, has remained the same. He usually explores ecological themes, filling his canvas with nature forms like leaves, twigs, stems, and roots. His earlier works show close-up views of nature in decay, with earth browns, ochers, rust, and moss greens as the predominant hues. Since the late 1980s, his forms have achieved &ldquo;buoyant simplicity&rdquo; and his colors have become tropical and vibrant, such as in <b><i>Foliage</i></b>, 2014, where he achieved balance by contrasting the rigid and brightly colored geometric overlays with the pale and organic sheet of twigs underneath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, he has not only limited himself to using natural forms as his subject, but he also turned to abandoned houses and shabby physical structures as subject for his work. Santos combined his now two favorite subject matter in his Derelict series, which consists of photographs of houses, roofs, and walls over which he painted dried twigs and leaves. In these works, however, he refrained from using vibrant colors and returned to his early scheme of subdued browns, greens, and rust, so that his painted photographs appear to depict forgotten and haunting places of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has held over 40 one-person shows since 1981, in such venues as the Luz Gallery, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></a></strong></a> Gallery, Finale Art File, Museo de Iloilo, Lopez Museum, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). He has represented the Philippines in exhibitions abroad like the <b><i>Seoul</i></b> <b><i>Contemporary Show</i></b>, National Museum of Modern Art, Korea; <b><i>2nd </i></b>and <b><i>14th Asian Art Show</i></b>, Fukuoka Art Museum, Japan; the <b><i>1st ASEAN Youth Painting Exhibition and Workshop</i></b>, Thailand; <b><i>Young Art in Asia Now</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Hong Kong Art Centre; an art exhibit in China; the <b><i>7th International Asian Show</i></b>, Indonesia; and the <b><i>11th International Biennial Print and Drawing Exhibition</i></b>, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts. He has joined more than 50 group exhibitions. In 1989, he and his wife Mona founded West Gallery. The Santos family showcased their individual works in <b><i>Gathered Narratives</i></b>, 2014, an exhibit that portrayed them not only as a family sharing the same creative blood but also as individual artists with their own distinct styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos was one of the Thirteen Artists awardees of the CCP in 1992. He was a finalist at the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Competition in 1981, first prize winner at the ASEAN Youth On-the-Spot Painting in 1983, finalist at the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards in 1994, and finalist at the Philippine Art Awards multiple times from 1994 to 2005. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by Alice G.

Manila 22 Dec 1951. Painter. He is the son of painter Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos aka Malang and Mary San Pedro, and a brother to painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3765\"><strong>Soler Santos</strong></a>. He married Elizabeth Diaz with whom he has two children. At a very young age, Santos was exposed to art because of his father and his friends, who were also renowned artists, such as his godfather <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\"><strong>Larry Alcala</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Hugo Yonzon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\"><strong>Ang Kiukok</strong></a>. A graduate of the University of the Philippines, he worked at various times as artist for West Design Studio and as art director for <b><i>Wingtips</i></b>, the Philippine Airlines inflight magazine, and Editorial Associates. After working freelance for a number of years, he joined <b><i>Lifestyle Magazine</i></b> as art director and the Philippine Information Agency as consultant. Santos has held exhibitions, both solo and group, since 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A noted magic realist, Santos paints in vivid colors mostly still lifes and landscapes. Though he dabbled first in portraiture, he prefers landscapes, as this genre allows him to easily manipulate his colors, composition, and forms. His early paintings showed resemblances to his father&rsquo;s works, but the latter challenged his son to find his own niche. He tried his hand on a number of artistic styles such as cubism, expressionism, and surrealism, until he found his true voice in magic realism. It was the American artist Andrew Wyeth, known for his painting <b><i>Christina&rsquo;s World</i></b>, who would then cast a major influence on Santos. Santos&rsquo;s panoramic landscapes are monochromatic and done mostly in bands and sweeps of color. While most of his landscapes are rural, he also painted cityscapes, such as <b><i>Urban Houses</i></b>, which were showcased in his one-man exhibit <b><i>New Landscapes</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2008, at the West Gallery in SM Megamall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first one-person show was at the Luz Gallery in 1975, which was made possible by his teacher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>. A group show with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3571\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Agustin Goy</strong></a></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3432\"><strong>Manuel Baldemor</strong></a> reputedly pioneered the trend in magic realism. He participated in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Annual Visual Art shows from 1976 to 1980; <b><i>Philippine Contemporary Art</i></b>, Philtrade, 1979; <b><i>Five Directions</i></b>, Museum of Philippine Art (MOPA), 1980; <b><i>ASEAN</i></b> <b><i>Exhibition of Paintings</i></b>, Manila Metropolitan Museum, 1981; <b><i>Kulturasya </i></b>(Culture of Asia), Philtrade, 1983; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, MOPA, 1986; and group exhibitions in various art galleries such as the Luz Gallery, Alegria Gallery, Greenhills Art Center, Galerie Dominique, Galerie Bleue, and Finale Art File.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos won several awards for his watercolors: honorable mention at the 21st Shell Annual Watercolor Contest; first prize at the 28th <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> Annual Competition; honorable mention at the 30th AAP; and second prize at the 31st AAP.

Sculptor. He was the son of Felix Saprid and Felicidad Arevalo. He married Consuelo Rivera with whom he had six children. He held a master of arts degree in education from Ohio State University, USA. He tried his hand at sculpture upon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>&rsquo;s encouragement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saprid has done sculptures in wood and adobe but most of his works are in bronze. He has taken full advantage of the properties of metal through a technique he developed from welding together and shaping pieces of metal scrap. He has worked around a variety of themes which include the crucifixion, flagellants, mother-and-child, Daphne, puppeteers, the legendary hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1849\"><strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong></a>, <i>amihan</i> (northeast monsoon) and <i>habagat</i> (southwest monsoon), and genre figures of peasants and other working folk. He is most famous, however, for his series on the <i>tikbalang</i>, the half-human half-horse creature of Philippine mythology. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his major works is the <b><i>Taming of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2309\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2309\"><strong>Tikbalang</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> at the Makati Commercial Center. His figures are the opposite of the classical form: they convey untrammeled freedom in their quest for human expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saprid was already more than 50 years old when he had his first one-person show at the Solidaridad Gallery in 1969. Other shows were <b><i>Seven by Seven</i></b>, 1968, at the Solidaridad Galleries, and <b><i>Triangulo </i></b>(Triangle), 1977, at the Hyatt Regency. He was the representative of the Philippines at the Indian Triennale in 1971 and the Australian Biennial in 1973.

Malag, Imus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a> 28 Oct 1916. d. 1995. Painter. His father was Juan Saulog, a farmer. He studied in Malag Primary School and Imus Elementary School. He was admitted to the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts in 1931 where he garnered eight medals of excellence in the annual school competitions. Some of his mentors were Filipino masters such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> and Fabian de la Rosa. Despite having trained in a university, Saulog believed that one could become a brilliant artist without formal education. He then formed an informal school in his hometown consisting of art enthusiasts and hobbyists whom he adopted and mentored. This group was later called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>ng Sining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saulog&rsquo;s works were exhibited in the Traveling Art Exhibit sponsored by the De La Rama Steamship <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in 1955. His murals used to hang at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\"><strong>Army and Navy Club</strong></a>, Far Eastern University, Manila Polo Club, and the headquarters of the United States Army and Navy. Some of his sketches can be found at the Makati Medical Center, his mural <b><i>Our Malayan Heritage</i></b> at Far Eastern University, and many in private collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saulog was famous for anecdote painting, a type of genre painting revolving around a theme or narrative which he romanticized through the dramatic pose of his human subjects. <b><i>Offspring</i></b>, 1952, is a romanticized Filipino Madonna showing a mother embracing a baby. <b><i>Love and Labor</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1970, shows a peasant couple, their vigorous bodies highlighted by bold contrast of light and shadow. His <b><i>Madonna of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1955, exemplifies a trend of Filipinizing images of the Blessed Virgin. In fact, most of his Madonnas are seen wearing traditional Filipina costumes. His models were often his female neighbors or relatives who had babies. Because of this fascination with the Filipino Madonna and child, which many critics consider as the theme he was most adept in, Saulog has been known as the &ldquo;master of the Filipino Madonna.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To stay away from the controversies surrounding the battle between the modernists and the conservatives, Saulog moved away from the Manila art circle and established his own art shop in Imus. Inevitably, his works, done in the style of the Conservative School, had suffered the effects of the somewhat derogatory term &ldquo;Calendar Artists&rdquo; coined by the modernists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saulog won an honorable mention for <b><i>Unselfish Love</i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> &ndash; Boy&rsquo;s Town Carnival Exhibition in 1949.

Parang, Sulu 1957. d. 12 Mar 2005.<b> </b>Textile weaver. Sawabi was a Tausug textile weaver of the traditional cloth tapestry called <b>pis syabit</b>. These are handwoven square-shaped cloths which are usually worn as head covering by the Tausug of Jolo but may also be used as ornament to traditional dress, bag decorations, and accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sawabi&rsquo;s life in Sulu was marked by economic difficulties, particularly by the effects of the armed conflict in Mindanao. Her family&rsquo;s earnings from subsistence farming were not enough to feed her family. With no other training apart from doing household work, her talent for weaving became a means to help her family as she would earn 2,000 pesos for each pis syabit, measuring 39 x 40 in, she could produce. In the 1970s, her family had to seek refuge in the forest to flee their village because of the armed conflict. Time and again, she had to abandon her loom even with works in progress because she could not bring these into the forest as they fled. Each time, Sawabi had to start anew when they had to relocate their residence. She even sold pis syabit to warring groups when they would pass through her village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process in weaving a pis syabit is considered to be difficult and expensive. It takes three days just to prepare the warp, consisting of stringing black and red threads across a banana and bamboo frame to form the base of the tapestry. Each cloth, featuring intricate designs with bold contrasting colors, takes three months to weave. Her pis syabit is valued because of the evenness of her weave. More importantly, her work was recognized as staying true to Tausug traditional designs, thus enabling these designs to be preserved for future generations to do proper study on them. Before she died in 2005, Sawabi was able to share her weaving process and knowledge to other women in her community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sawabi was awarded the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA in 2004. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byCecilia S.

Tondo, Manila 30 Mar 1948. Painter. He is the son of Arturo Sena and Faustina Belen. He is married to Nancy Canauay and they have two children. In 1968, he earned a fine arts degree from the University of the East (UE) School of Music and Arts where he majored in painting as a scholar of the Children&rsquo;s Museum and Library Inc (CMLI). He established the Kabataang Tondo Art Group in 1975 and the Art Discovery Learning Foundation Inc (ADLFI) in 2001, the latter of which he is president. He is associated with the Saturday Group, a loose collective of artists who meet every Saturday to hold art-making sessions and discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sena is noted for his adeptness in the traditional media of pastel, watercolor, and oil in rendering portraits, still lifes, and other figurative paintings, and is particularly known for his technique of using a palette knife to make cubist-pointillist oils. He draws inspiration from the years that he spent growing up in Tondo, Manila, where he resided until 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sena has been dubbed the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Art Workshops,&rdquo; as he has been conducting art workshops since graduating from college in 1972. He began doing so for free to help underprivileged youths in Nueva Ecija and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a>. Done under the auspices of the CMLI, the workshops are Sena&rsquo;s way of giving back to the institution that sponsored his education. As the popularity of his workshops grew, CMLI encouraged him to strike out on his own, and he started accepting paid students and giving lessons at different venues, including Miriam College and the Vargas Museum of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman. Sena continues to hold free workshops for disadvantaged young people, public school teachers, prisoners, and the chronically ill through ADLFI, which is composed of artists and art enthusiasts. The organization holds contests, exhibitions, and other activities for members and nonmembers, and also helps send young talents to art school, usually the UP Diliman College of Fine Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sena, who has been a faculty member of both his alma mater UE and UP, held his first solo show in 1973 at the Little Gallery in Tesoro Building, Makati, and has since mounted several other individual exhibitions, as well as participated in group exhibitions, in various venues in Metro Manila. He has received numerous awards, including Ten Outstanding Manilans from the city of Manila, 1979; Young Achievers Awards, arts and culture sector, from the Alyansang Kabataan, National Youth and Young Professionals Council, 1987; distinguished alumni from UE, 1989; outstanding alumni from the UE College of Fine Arts, 1994; and Gawad Parangal from the local government of Quezon City in 2011. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Angono, Rizal 1864. d. 1924. Painter. Nothing is known of Senson&rsquo;s artistic education. Folks of Angono surmise he might have learned his art from an artistically inclined Jesuit, this order having been in charge of the town in the Spanish period. Life in Angono was mainly dominated by two religious celebrations&mdash;namely, the Lenten season and the feast of the Pope San Clemente, its patron saint. Accordingly, Senson painted many scenes of the Passion of Christ. He was also a sculptor and he created the props&mdash;that is, the soldiers&rsquo; helmets&mdash;for the village&rsquo;s Lenten play or <i>sinakulo</i>. Some of his paintings are not inside museums or in private collections, but are secured in metal poles and carried around as part of the Lenten processions, blurring the distinction between &ldquo;fine art&rdquo; and &ldquo;folk art.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest dated work of Senson is one now known as [<b><i>At the Foot of the Cross</i></b>], 1894, and his last dated work is [<b><i>Christ before Pilate</i></b>], 1917, both pieces being still in Angono. His activities, however, were not confined solely to his town, having submitted <b><i>Vista Parcial del Pueblo de Angono y la Laguna de Bay</i></b> (Partial View of Angono and Laguna Bay) to the Regional Exposicion de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition), which opened in Manila on 23 Jan 1895. The painting is now part of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas art collection. [<b><i>The Stations of the Cross</i></b>] and [<b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2168\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2168\"><strong>Crucifix</strong></a></strong></a>ion</i></b>] by Senson were evidently inspired by engravings from a <i>pasyon</i> from which the folks read about Christ&rsquo;s sufferings. His drafting skill in these pieces were accurate, having been aided by the prints. Since his sources were in black-and-white, it fell on him to provide the colors, and because he fashioned his pigments from local pigments and dyes, they were mainly pastel shaded. To protect his works, Senson used a local varnish that gives his paintings a yellow-brownish appearance to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> acknowledged Senson as his earliest influence. As a child, Francisco watched him grind his own paints from raw minerals and plants. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a> also kept track of this master&rsquo;s works. Senson&rsquo;s presence gave him a strong sense of artistic tradition&mdash;meaning, the presence of local artistic roots; hence, he did not need to look for stylistic sources, particularly those from outside the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5484\"><strong>Ino Manalo</strong></a>, updated by Jhoanne Kristine A.

Raxabago, Tondo 14 Nov 1919. d. 9 Mar 1979. Painter. The youngest of four siblings, he was the son of Pablo Serna and Gracia Olandes. He married Bellaflor Laureano, a businesswoman. His father removed &ldquo;de la&rdquo; from the family name. He attended Rizal Elementary School and Torres High School. He took up drawing and painting under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3454\"><strong>Teodoro Buenaventura</strong></a> before entering the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts where he was a senior when World War II broke out. He worked for the <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b> as a layout artist and contributing photographer, during which he took photographs and painted portraits of a young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos (Imelda Romualdez at that time). His friendship with her carried on until he became a regular portrait painter of the Marcos family. Because he lived in New York for a time at the house of Jorge Araneta&rsquo;s father, he painted portraits of important people such as government officials and ambassadors, most of whom were friends of Araneta. He also gave lectures on art to mostly American students and people from the embassy. There, he also had his own art studio where he received guests, such as art critics, and sold his paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Serna belonged to the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; or traditional school of representational art. His figurative work is exemplified by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> Woman</i></b>, 1941, and <b><i>Marketing in Baguio</i></b>, 1941. Both show his solidly formed shapes and the bold brushwork that complement his subject matter, the rugged life of the mountain peoples in Baguio. In 1947, Serna painted a portrait of Teodoro Buenaventura, <b><i>Mi Maestro</i></b> (My Teacher), using dramatic contrast of light and shadow that highlighted the old man&rsquo;s infirmity. Serna&rsquo;s landscapes were also characterized by rough impasto. His colors were yellow and yellow-green mixed with large amounts of white. This tonality could be observed in his landscapes of the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Serna won honorable mention for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2134\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2134\"><strong>Baguio Market</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> Boy&rsquo;s Town Carnival Exhibition in 1949 and honorable mention in conservative painting for <b><i>Madaling Araw </i></b>(Dawn), 1951. He had a successful one-man show in New York in 1957. In 1964, the Philippine government commissioned him to decorate the Philippine Pavilion at the New York World Fair with murals and brass sculptures, for which he won international acclaim. He also won an award from Shell for a portrait he did of Rizal as an ophthalmologist. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Featuring works made out of found objects and other everyday common materials such as Chabet&rsquo;s suspended bamboo pole, Laudico&rsquo;s twigs and motor oil&ndash;stained papers, and Bautista&rsquo;s refrigerator with moldy Gerber bottles containing various objects including photographs of Ferdinand Marcos, the exhibition was seen as offensive by the gallery owners and was taken down by the artists a day after the opening. Word quickly spread about the censored one-day exhibition and the artists were soon offered a temporary rent-free space in Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>, a shopping arcade in Pasay. The artists adopted the name <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\"><strong>Shop 6</strong></a> after the six artists in the K-Lahi exhibition as well as the stall number of the single-room store space given to them in Kamalig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shop 6 opened the space for &ldquo;mixed media works, constructions, situations, environments, and other exploratory projects&rdquo; that countered the traditional paintings shown in commercial galleries. They launched their initial 14-week exhibition program with a two-part inaugural that showed works by the original six artists along with Danny Dalena, Joy Dayrit, Nap Jamir, Red Mansueto, Berna Perez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3737\"><strong>Alan Rivera</strong></a>, Eva Toledo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3828\"><strong>Nestor Vinluan</strong></a>, followed by their solo exhibitions that opened every Friday and only lasted through the weekend. While some critics dismissed their works as &ldquo;gimmicks,&rdquo; others acknowledged them as &ldquo;results of hard work perhaps, harder thinking&rdquo; (<i>Marks</i> 1974).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shop 6 exponentially grew as other artists and many of Chabet&rsquo;s students from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> (UP CFA) also joined their exhibitions such as <b><i>101 Objects</i></b>, a sprawling exhibition that included a cut-up and reassembled tree, a blind man from Quiapo, and a yellow Volkswagen with leftover cake, half-empty milk bottles, and a ticking metronome. After Kamalig, Shop 6 held guerrilla exhibitions in homes, parks, and secretly installed their works in other artists&rsquo; shows. They also had an exhibition at the CCP Main Gallery (now also known as Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>) in 1975 and participated in the Contemporary Art Museum of the Philippines inaugural in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1980s, the artists behind Shop 6 started to concentrate on their own practices or moved on to other careers. However the issues they raised then&mdash;what constitutes art and its values&mdash;remain as critical and contentious today. Primarily known through oral accounts shared among artists, Shop 6 was a precursor to succeeding artist-run spaces in Manila, many of which were founded by Chabet&rsquo;s students from the UP CFA. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRingo S.

Molina, Jose was a photoengraver, and Alejandro, a piano tuner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Siauinco learned wood carving from such master craftsmen as Manuel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3799\"><strong>Domingo Teotico</strong></a> who both had shops in Quiapo. When Teotico died, Siauinco worked with Maximo Vicente before establishing his own shop in 1910.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He excelled in carving religious figures, such as the <b><i>San Jose</i></b>, several <b><i>Mater</i></b> <b><i>Dolorosa </i></b>(Sorrowful Mother), <b><i>Virgen de la Paz</i></b> (Virgin of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a>), and <b><i>Corazon de Jesus </i></b>(Heart of Jesus). A notable work was his life-size bust of Francisco Balagtas, carved out of batikuling wood probably in 1904 or earlier. This piece was executed under the supervision of Romualdo de Jesus who had known Balagtas in Tondo. For some reason, de Jesus did not carve it himself. When finished, the sculpture was readily approved by the poet&rsquo;s children and other relatives as a faithful portrait of Balagtas. Since no likeness exists of Balagtas from his lifetime, Siauinco&rsquo;s work has since been used as one source for portraying him. Another bust of Balagtas was made in 1915 by an unknown artist, the model being Victor Baltazar, a son who was said to have looked more like the poet than anyone else. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E.

Baguio City 5 Jun 1953. Conceptual and performance artist, art educator, and curator. Her parents are Bonifacio Sibayan and Isabel Quines. She received her bachelor of fine arts from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> in 1976; her master of fine arts from the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, Los Angeles, in 1984; and her doctorate degree in fine arts from the De La Salle University (DLSU) in 2010. Sibayan was assistant professor at DLSU from 1989 to 2010 and associate professor from 2010 to 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The core of Sibayan&rsquo;s work is the institutional and materialist critique of art. Her initiation and exposure to art institutions began early. While still a college student in 1974, she was invited by Professor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> to participate in the group exhibition <b><i>Untitled Painting No. 1 and Other Paintings </i></b>held at the Small Gallery of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). Sibayan held her first solo exhibition <b><i>Investigating a Museum</i></b><i> </i>at the CCP Main Gallery upon the invitation of its director, the artist-curator Ray Albano. It was premised on the idea that the exhibition space is a value-imbuing device that names the objects inside it as art. In the same year, her performance <b><i>Lemon Cake</i></b>,<i> </i>which took place at a parking lot near the alternative space <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\"><strong>Shop 6</strong></a>, was discussed by Albano in the contemporary art publication <b><i>MARKS</i></b>. Crucial to her artistic formation, these works marked her long involvement with the CCP: as a curatorial assistant from 1976 to 1977, as an exhibiting and performance artist supported by the CCP until 1985, as an artist performing in <b><i>Ules, Bungon ti Agdawat</i></b><i> </i>(Ules, Shroud for Those Who Plead) in protest of the transition government in 1986, as director of the Contemporary Art Museum of the Philippines, and as head of the Coordinating Center for the Visual Arts from 1987 to 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist&rsquo;s first major work after a seven-year hiatus from the art world was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2293\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2293\"><strong>Scapular Gallery Nomad</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>SGN</i></b>), conceived in line with her reflection about being circumscribed in the Center for more than a decade. Through this work, Sibayan called attention to the difficulty of acting upon her conflicted roles as an artist expected to be responsive to the larger art community, on the one hand, and as an administrator of the foremost state-sponsored Contemporary Art Museum titled to privilege a limited few, on the other. Testing the limits of her autonomy and disengagement from the Center, <b><i>SGN</i></b> is a performance-based work that veers away from the institution by making her body the site of the exhibition. As owner and curator, Sibayan wore an enlarged scapular (1997-2002) with pouches that contained the works of artists whom she invites to exhibit. By literally diminishing the scale of the work and attaching <b><i>SGN</i></b> to her body, Sibayan brought <b><i>SGN</i></b> into the spaces of institutions just by her walking into them. She adds that <b><i>SGN </i></b>afforded her &ldquo;a rhizomatic process of producing art (its circulation and reception).&rdquo; The process and the use of minimal resources are echoed in succeeding projects&mdash;among them, <b><i>The Museum of Mental Objects</i></b>,<i> </i>begun in 2002. This performance rejects physical manifestations altogether as a commentary against the commodification of art. Here, Sibayan becomes the museum itself, the very site of memory, as she recites the artworks whispered to her by artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sibayan has exhibited and performed in numerous local and international institutions. She is the co-founder and co-publisher of the independent online journal <b><i>Ctrl+P Journal of Contemporary Art</i></b>. Her curatorial projects include <b><i>xsXL Expanding Art</i></b>, 2002, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> Square, Singapore, and <b><i>600 Images/60 Artists/6 Curators/6 Cities</i></b>,<i> </i>2005. Sibayan received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 1976. She was also conferred the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan sa Bagong Pamamaraan award<b><i> </i></b>by the city of Manila<b><i> </i></b>in 2006. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLouise Anne D.

Silang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a> 21 Feb 1972. Painter, intermedia artist, educator. She is the daughter of Modesto Sison and Eileen Belamide. She is married to artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3472\"><strong>Mariano Ching</strong></a> with whom she has a son, Haraya, who has already exhibited work alongside his parents. Sison graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in humanities cum laude<i> </i>at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, 1992. She received a certification for professional education the following year from the same university, where she later took up MA units in art education. In 1997, she received a bachelor of fine arts in painting from UP Diliman. Sison taught art in the following institutions: Cavite Institute, Silang, 2002-6, Ayala Museum, 1999-2006, and St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, 1998-2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sison is known for her hyperrealist imaging, particularly in her works depicting children. In 2007, her suite of paintings titled <b><i>Gingerbread Girls</i></b> reinterpreted stories told to her as a child. The theme recurs in later works, like the paintings in the exhibition <b><i>Into the Woods</i></b>,<i> </i>2009,<i> </i>whose narrative elements oscillate between genre and fantasy. Here, children garbed in their best dresses are set against the deep forest, wearing animal masks as if assuming a new identity while embarking on the process of discovery or survival. Her adroit handling of portraits is again exemplified in <b><i>Underneath the Sky</i></b>, 2011, as it harked back to her earlier series on children. In these, Sison introduced images of microbes to describe the breadth of children&rsquo;s imagination and disposition, their sporadic yet contagious and challenging quality configured in diptychs paired with crocheted forms encased in glass. Sison&rsquo;s solo exhibitions include <b><i>Playing House</i></b>, 2013, Finale Art File, Makati City; <b><i>The Domestic Life of Pictures</i></b>, 2012, Silverlens Galleries, Makati City; and <b><i>Storybook Collages</i></b>, 2012, West Gallery, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sison is a deft observer of media and popular culture. Through her paintings, she is also recognized for the way she appropriates images from fashion magazines, capturing details of the background yet obscuring elements of the face and body to emphasize projected personas and fictive memories. Sison and former bandmate and fellow artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3475\"><strong>Lena Cobangbang</strong></a> formed the duo Alice and Lucinda, a &ldquo;fluid mask persona&rdquo; which they took on beginning 1999. Apart from their respective practices, their critical collaboration enabled them to produce a &ldquo;lo-fi,&rdquo; process-based body of works including zines, photographs, videos, performances, and installations. The paired performances of these two artists culminated in contemporary archive exhibitions on Alice and Lucinda in Vargas Museum and Mo Space, Taguig, in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Always keen on exploring collaboration and other alternative practices, Sison is identified with the collective-cum-artist-run space Surrounded by Water, working as one of several artist-volunteers from 1999 to 2002. In the exhibition <b><i>Scribble Stage</i></b>, 2011, she involved her son Haraya in creating collages and photographs, reverting to the idea of play and dissipating the boundaries of her simultaneous performance as mother, artist, teacher, and woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sison has participated in numerous group exhibitions in the Philippines and abroad.

Manila 6 Feb 1943. Painter, sculptor. He is the son of Lazaro Soriano and Salud Salamat. His interest in the arts probably started when he was a child actor. He developed as an artist during his 11-year sojourn in Europe, mainly Paris, 1970-81, during which he took on odd jobs and gained a wide variety of experiences. There he did constructivist paintings, then proceeded to figurative works portraying forms such as animals. Since settling in the Philippines for good, he has drawn artistic inspiration from folk traditions and has committed himself to community development projects with the goal of rediscovering, reviving, and propagating traditional folk arts. He has worked in figurative pottery in a pot-making community and participated in the painting of public murals with community themes, as in Obando, Bulacan, as part of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo; (CCP) outreach program. He also painted clay sculptures depicting the Angono<i> </i><b>higantes</b> (giants).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1985 to 1986 Soriano did a series of paintings in which he interpreted folk songs in oil on canvas. In rendering their imagery, he did not only go by the narrative but brought out their entire social and cultural dimension. True to the spirit of his subject, he developed a colorful style reflecting the folk sensibility free from academic canons. In a subsequent series, he rediscovered riddles and proverbs and interpreted them visually. These paintings on folk songs, riddles, and adages are some of the liveliest genre works in Philippine art, filled with humorous characterizations and situations, and insights into the psychology of the Filipino. His most famous work is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2206\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2206\"><strong>Jak en Poy</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Sticks and Stones), 1987. In this colorful modern masterpiece, figures who appear like caricatures&mdash;a combination of prominent people in politics and ordinary citizens&mdash;crowd at the foreground from the middle up to the lower half of the painting, forming a tension that builds and points to the central figure, who is Corazon Aquino. Here she is depicted like Venus, but stoic and apathetic to the chaos surrounding her, gazing at an area outside the picture. The man in white barong on her right is said to be Juan Ponce Enrile, and behind her are Cardinal Sin and Fidel Ramos. The title of the painting borrows from the timeless children&rsquo;s game and alludes to the hand gestures used by opposing parties in the EDSA Revolt.

He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the University of Santo Tomas. He headed the creative arts visual communications group of the Design Center until 1981, and was for a time art director of the Philippine Advertising Counselors Inc, and member of the Art Directors Club of the Philippines. Although he also does etching, collagraphs, and serigraphy, Soriano is best known for his woodcut prints. He assembles several blocks of wood-carved images to create genre images of Philippine folk ways and country life in large-scale visual narrative. <b><i>The Trial of Longinus</i></b>, 1972, a vertical composition of a Morion mask repeated as leitmotif for a design in rhythmic repetition is an example. <b><i>Barrio Fiesta</i></b>, 1973, on the other hand, shows a nocturnal procession in a town plaza interpreted as an interplay of positive and negative images. Arches, saints in <i>carroza</i> (processional float), a hero&rsquo;s statue, an orderly crowd and festival buntings, are composed in a serial pattern. <b><i>Patched Home by the Railroad Track</i></b>, 1975, is a grid composition of the life of rural people who are beginning to be exposed to urban life in dwellings beside the railroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soriano worked closely with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\"><strong>Romulo Olazo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3758\"><strong>Rodolfo Samonte</strong></a> in printmaking workshops and exhibition of the Philippine Association of Printmakers (PAP).

Painter. He is the son of Plaridel Sotto and Aida Lopez Laguda and is the brother of the late film critic and historian Agustin Sotto. He studied fine arts, major in painting, at the University of the Philippines Diliman. Sotto was creative director at McCann Erickson from 1981 to 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sotto&rsquo;s abstract paintings play with sight, not through optical illusions but through color and pattern. In paintings such as the Trance<b><i> </i></b>series, 2005 and 2007, and <b><i>Painting Noir 2</i></b>,<b> </b>2006, Sotto employed a tricolor scheme arranged in circular strokes that, at a cursory glance, appear as a solid plane. Yet, upon closer inspection, these strokes bear minute differences, each one being a unique expression of the artist&rsquo;s thoughts and intuitions, but all together forming the whole picture that constitutes the artwork. Using the same color palette but with differing patterns, <b><i>Kzspygv</i></b>, 2008,<i> </i>is built up through linear strokes while <b><i>Rhythm of Days</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2004,<i> </i>maintains the circular motif. Set apart from his conventional style, <b><i>Water or Dream</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009,<i> </i>employs different tones of blue while <b><i>Fugitive Pieces</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2009, is composed of irregularly organized strokes framing those contained within the grid. These works and many more bear an inner light, through their deep and vibrant colors that invigorate the viewer. Sotto believes that &ldquo;the art object (painting, sculpture, print, video, performance, etc) is like a prism. The light is the artist&rsquo;s ideas and emotions that go into the object. What comes out is usually a multi-faceted view from the point of the audience. The engagement with the artwork is a dialogue&rdquo; (Sotto 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His first solo exhibition,<b> <i>Paintings</i></b>, 1977, was held in Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>.

Engraver. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of several eminent Filipino engravers on copper in the 18th century, he practiced his profession ahead of Nicolas de la Cruz <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a> by 15 years. This implies that he was much older than the latter. Suarez&rsquo;s earliest work is the <b><i>San Rafael Arcangel</i></b> (Saint Rafael the Archangel), which appeared in <b><i>Beneficios y Favores Singulares</i></b> (Special Benefits and Favors), 1716, a sermon in praise of the saint preached by Fr Pablo Clain. In 1729, he engraved the image of <b><i>Santo Domingo de la Penitencia</i></b> (Penitence of Saint Dominic) that illustrated <b><i>Breve Resumen </i></b>(Short Summary), a biography of Pope Benedict XIII by Jose Manuel Medrano. In 1734, Suarez collaborated with de la Cruz Bagay in the project of Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes Tamon to print the map of the Philippines charted by the Jesuit cartographer Fr Pedro Murillo Velarde. In 1737, Suarez did his most elaborate work, the title page of <b><i>La Razon en las Medidas</i></b> (The System of Measurements), the book written by Jose Nuno de Villavicencio in defense of the measuring standards used by the Manila merchants in the galleon trade. The book also contained three other engravings bearing the signature of a Luis Suarez, most likely Francisco&rsquo;s relative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The elegant illustration drawn by Suarez for the title page of <b><i>La Razon el las Medidas </i></b>auspiciously suited the theme of the book that defended the probity of the business dealings of Manila merchants. Suarez designed a three-storied triumphal arch in the center or archway on which was printed the bibliographical details of the work. The first story of the pediment features a pair of niches, with the muse of Arithmetic on the left, and that of Geometry on the right. Above each of the muses are a conch, on top of which, on the second story, is a cherub in relief. The arch is topped by a pediment decorated with trumpeting angels. Suarez&rsquo;s ornamental sources were eclectic, mostly renaissance and baroque. The artist&rsquo;s fine stippling and hatching points to his metier as engraver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1738, Francisco engraved a portrait of Philip V, enclosed in an oval frame and adorned with a crown at the center. The portrait was drawn over the view of an ocean in which could be seen a two-masted war vessel. The view is flanked by two Corinthian columns topped by a crown. The left column is wrapped by a ribbonlike band on which the word &ldquo;plus&rdquo; (further) could be read; the right one is similarly decorated with the word &ldquo;ultra&rdquo; (beyond), visible on the ribbon. This engraving came out in the book <b><i>Cursus Juris Canonici </i></b>(A Course in Canon Law) that came out in 1743. In 1749, Francisco engraved the image of <b><i>San Nicolas de Tolentino</i></b> (Saint Nicholas of Tolentino) that adorned <b><i>Sermones Varios</i></b> (Various Sermons), a book of sermons preached by Fr Joseph de la Concepcion. In 1760, Suarez again collaborated with de la Cruz Bagay in illustrating Gaspar Aquino de Belen&rsquo;s <b><i>Manga Panalanging Pagtatagobilin sa Caloluoa nang Tauong Naghihingalo</i></b> (Prayers for Commending the Soul of the Dying). This is Suarez&rsquo;s last known project, perhaps his last, after 44 years of distinguished productivity. It may be surmised from the presence in the <i>pasyon</i> of a print by Luis de la Cruz that the latter had to come in for the former in the middle of the project. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Cebu City 7 Jul 1939. Painter. His parents are Jovencio Subang and Manuela Ignacio. Subang married Felixberta Paragsa from Bantayan Island, Cebu. His love for art is inherited by two of his sons, Albryant and Rammilito, who are also artists in their own right. He belongs to the closely knit group of Cebuano artists, which includes the Mendoza brothers. He is a self-taught artist, not having gone through a fine arts course. After a boyhood of selling newspapers, he worked in a sign shop where he was assigned to do portraits. He avers that he was never under the tutelage of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\"><strong>Martino Abellana</strong></a>, the Cebuano maestro, but the elder artist&rsquo;s influence is seen in Subang&rsquo;s impressionist freshness of color and painterly approach. Though Subang has taken off from the impressionists, he has developed his own original interpretation of impressionism in what he calls &ldquo;radiation and refraction,&rdquo; components of his theory of &ldquo;scientific realism,&rdquo; in which forces of nature such as air and light combine with its objects (trees, rocks, mountains) to produce a realistic portrait of environment. In many of his works, the tropical heat emits a strong orange light that sets its mark on the people and objects of the environment. His theory is that light as it strikes objects or passes through them creates effects of refraction that very subtly changes depending on the angles and shift of the point of view, thus introducing movement and avoiding the static. Light as heat and warmth assumes a radiating energy that he uses dramatically or modulates softly. In his personal vision, landscapes are made of living forces of nature that interact and harmonize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of his works are landscapes and paintings of ordinary people at work, such as <b><i>Copra Workers</i></b>, 1989, which features a bare-chested man caught in the act of splitting open a coconut, bathed in golden light. His paintings feature radiant colors and painterly brushstrokes. Despite facing various ailments, he maintains an optimistic view of life, living in his rented apartment that also functions as a gallery. Having pursued poetry, singing, stage acting, and painting, Subang has made the most of his talents. To him, painting is a &ldquo;source of joy,&rdquo; and art is an &ldquo;honest and personal&rdquo; endeavor, a reflection of the artist&rsquo;s emotions and outlook in life. According to a personal anecdote, during a funeral for his best friend&rsquo;s sibling, he dozed off and woke up early the next day witnessing a beautiful landscape before him, which became his source of inspiration. For the next 21 days, he woke up at the same hour to paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Subang held his first one-person show at the ABC Galleries in 1976 and has joined several group shows, including one where he exhibited with his sons, <b><i>Subang Sun and Sons</i></b>, 1994, at the Manila Pavillion and Liongoren Gallery. His succeeding solo exhibitions include one held at the Liongoren Art Gallery in 1984; <b><i>The Suns of Subang</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1995, Gallery &ldquo;Y&rdquo;; and <b><i>Master of Line and Color</i></b>,<i> </i>2001, ABC Galleries. He also gave a lecture on art at the USIS Lincoln Memorial as part of a monthly series of lectures on art by Cebuano artists and conducted art workshops in Monami Art Gallery. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

Painter, sculptor. Born to Eusebio Sucgang and Matea Alayon, he married Manuela Mateo of Madrid with whom he had 12 children. Sucgang showed interest in painting, carving, and music as a young boy. He studied at the Colegio de San Jose in Manila, later transferring to Colegio de San Juan de Letran, where he earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree. He continued his art studies at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura while working as an apprentice in the atelier of sculptor Juan Flame&ntilde;o. In 1884, Sucgang went to Madrid to study art. Upon his return from Europe in 1893, he taught modeling and engraving at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios in Iloilo. He contributed articles to the Manila paper <b><i>El Comercio</i></b>, to the periodicals <b><i>El Porvenir de Visayas</i></b>, <b><i>El Panay</i></b>, and <b><i>El Ilonguillo</i></b> published in Iloilo, and to <b><i>La Revolucion</i></b> published in Jaro. During the second stage of the Philippine Revolution, he served as commandant under Gen Martin Delgado. Sucgang helped to establish several academic institutions: the Instituto de Visayas in Jaro, Iloilo, in 1900; Instituto de Aklan in Kalibo; Instituto de Capiz, ca 1905; another in Capiz in 1907; and the Colegio de Minerva in Manila in 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He also composed musical pieces, but none were published. He played the ucarina, guitar, violin, bandurria, and piano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of his paintings done in Madrid is <b><i>Un Indio Modelo</i></b> (A Native Model), 1886, which depicts a seminude brown-skinned male, presumably a Filipino, posed inside a studio and gazing at the viewer. While the painting may be seen as an anatomical study, it may also be considered the continuity of the <b>tipos del pais</b> (country scenes) style of painting, employing academic principles of painting. Other paintings done in Madrid were <b><i>El Desembarco de Magallanes </i></b>(The Landing of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\"><strong>Magellan</strong></a>), sometimes called <b><i>The First Mass in the Philippines</i></b>, 1888, and <b><i>La Ilegada de Legaspi y Urdaneta</i></b> (The Arrival of Legaspi and Urdaneta). Aside from genre and still-life paintings, he also did portraits, including one of his friend <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> in 1891 and several other portraits of famous people, such as King Alfonso XIII and Victor Balaguer. He was also often commissioned by wealthy people to paint their ceilings and walls. Most of his sculptures are religious in character like <b><i>Sagrada Familia</i></b> (Holy Family), <b><i>La Purisima Concepcion</i></b> (The Immaculate Conception), and <b><i>El Despojamiento de la Sagrada Tunica</i></b> (The Disrobing of the Sacred Tunic). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E.

Funded and organized by artists, its exhibition program was lenient and organic. Initially unable to access the institutional support of museums or galleries, the space functioned as an incubator of ideas and practices, enabling beginning artists to experiment with various media and pursue activities not normally embraced by mainstream channels of validation. In its early stages, artists were also initiated into organizing, programming, and curating by and for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The inaugural location of SBW was on Manila East Road Hi-Way, Angono, Rizal. The lack of funding prompted the space to close down in Jun 2000. In the same year, SBW moved to The Pied Piper Place, Mandaluyong City, when a former bakeshop was offered to the collective free of rent for a limited time. Its every room was appropriated as an exhibition venue, including the kitchen and stock room. From Oct 1999 to Jun 2001, SBW&rsquo;s exhibition program supported the works of the collective as well as similar group initiatives like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>no Shadowplay and UGATLahi. Senior practitioners and curators were invited to organize exhibitions there as well, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> who curated the shows <b><i>Handheld </i></b>at SBW Angono; <b><i>Panic Attack </i></b>at SBW EDSA; and <b><i>Surrounded</i></b>,<i> </i>an off-site exhibition<b><i> </i></b>of SBW artists&rsquo; works<b><i> </i></b>at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> (also known as the Main Gallery) in 2001. The regional exchange exhibitions curated by Bobi Valenzuela signaled an attempt to dialogue with artists practicing beyond Manila. SBW hosted the exhibition of artists from Mindanao in 2003; while in 2001, Iligan City and Cebu hosted SBW for their exhibitions <b><i>Portalet </i></b>and <b><i>Portable Landscapes</i></b>. The same period reflected a track record of support for the development of intermedia, as in the SBW Annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/797\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\"><strong>Sound Art</strong></a></strong></a> Festivals<b><i> </i></b>and through performances by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a>-based experimental band Elemento, headed by Lirio Salvador. <b><i>Dog Show</i></b>, 2007, an annual invitational group exhibition of SBW has been held in independent spaces like Green Papaya even after the SBW space closed down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2001, SBW held its second Fanzine Convention,<b><i> </i></b>an indication of support for lo-fi culture through zine production. SBW also organized talks in its EDSA space by contemporary artists active in the field such as Alfredo Juan and Isabel Aquilizan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3452\"><strong>Elmer Borlongan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3492\"><strong>Noel Cuizon</strong></a>, Alfredo Esquillo Jr, Jojo Legaspi, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>. Other SBW activities include film screenings, fora, poetry readings, and festival-pegged community-based projects. Although selling art was not SBW&rsquo;s priority, it maintained a stockroom for consignment of selected works. In 2002, SBW moved to 18th Ave, Cubao, in a space adjacent to the artist-run Big Sky Mind. The inaugural exhibition in Cubao, paradoxically titled <b><i>Mainstream </i></b>was also curated by Roberto Chabet. Moreover, SBW had an exchange project with the Singapore-based space Plastique Kinetic Worms in the same year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Due to persistent logistical challenges, the collective decided to close down the space in 2004. Artists who had been actively involved in SBW recognize its influence in their respective careers, harking to days of &ldquo;shared idealism&rdquo; and recalling its role in supporting their creative endeavors during their budding years amid minimal resources. Retrospective exhibitions of the SBW collective include <b><i>In the Ocean without a Boat or a Paddle</i></b>,<i> </i>2009, Blanc Compound, Mandaluyong, and <b><i>Surrounded by Water, Over the Water</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013, Equator Art Projects, Singapore. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLouise Anne D.

Syjuco.<b> </b>b. Manila 20 Aug 1953. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a> artist, poet, critic. The son of Augusto Syjuco and Aurora Limcaco, Cesare grew up in Australia and the United States where he obtained his formative education. He married artist Jean Marie Ricafort with whom he has five children. Returning to Manila, he enrolled at De La Salle University for courses in literature. Inclined to the arts since childhood, he was earlier recognized for poetry and fiction. In 1973, he turned to the visual arts, becoming both an art critic and an artist. Syjuco&rsquo;s first solo exhibition was held at the Gallery of the Hyatt Regency Manila in Dec 1976, followed by another in the same venue in Mar 1977 and the Art Associates Showroom, Makati, in Aug 1977. His 1982 work that won in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> Annual Art Competition appears to be an old Buddhist silk painting from a distance at first glance but is actually a multimedia collage in the pop art vein, with the faces of Andy Warhol and Marilyn Monroe among the images in the design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nourished in the Western artistic concepts and attitudes of the 1970s, Syjuco is a versatile artist along the conceptual and pop styles. His Tanka series is pegged on representationalism and other traditional traits of painting as a two-dimensional representation. His found objects and multimedia assemblages bring forth the bizarre to lay down metaphysical questions or simply to give tongue-in-cheek commentary on the erratic nature of human culture and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1992, Syjuco disappeared from the art scene. He came back in 2004 with <b><i>Flashes of Genius</i></b>, a major exhibit mounted at the Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> (also known as the Main Gallery) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). The works featured his <b><i>Literary Hybrids</i></b>&mdash;installations that combined poetry and visual art. Since then until 2011, he has had 12 solo exhibitions showcasing these hybrids and his spoken word performances. Syjuco formed the Electric Underground Collective in 2006, an organization of artists coming from different artistic fields. He also organized numerous events that showcased multimedia art performances, sound art, experimental film, and spoken word poetry. In 2008, he organized a mobile art project called <b><i>New Art Lab Road Tour</i></b>, where he brought spoken poetry events and multimedia exhibits to different places such as schools, galleries, and museums. A year later, he launched his YouTube videos that featured his spoken word performances from 2005 to 2008. In addition, he released <b><i>A Sudden Rush of Genius</i></b>, a package consisting of a CD album, a book, and a video set of his spoken poetry performances from 1981 to 2008. In 2010, <b><i>A Sudden Rush of Genius </i></b>was one in five finalists for best book design in the National Book Awards. He officially launched the album in 2011, accompanying it with a spoken word performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Syjuco&rsquo;s awards include the Purita <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w-Ledesma Award for Art Criticism, 1980; grand prize, <b><i>Tanka: Be Wary of Green, Be Most Wary of Memory</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1982 AAP competition; third prize for the collection <b><i>The Chameleon</i></b> in the poetry category, English division, of the Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards in 1983; Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines for art and culture advancement, 1991; the CCP Thirteen Artists award, 1992; the Gerry Roxas Foundation Presidential Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Arts; the UNESCO Gold Medal for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a> and Design; the Catholic Mass Media Award for Outstanding Communicator; the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan Award for new media in 2007; and the Lasallian Lifetime Achievement Award, 2007. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Manila 26 Jun 1952. Mixed media artist, performance artist. Daughter of Amado Ricafort and Pilar Borja, Jean Marie married multimedia artist and poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3787\"><strong>Cesare Syjuco</strong></a> with whom she has five children, three of whom&mdash;Michelline, Maxine, and Trix&mdash;are also artists in their own right. She graduated in 1975 from the University of the Philippines (UP) with a bachelor of science degree in industrial engineering, and is self-taught in the visual arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Manila&rsquo;s contemporary art scene, she is the most visible practitioner and orchestrator of performance art. Syjuco&rsquo;s earliest attempts at performance, in her own words, were &ldquo;very Western-style, sleight-of-hand technical feats of pre-conceived abrakadabra,&rdquo; referring to the mostly brief conceptual &ldquo;happenings&rdquo; that she used to synchronize as supplement to her exhibition, such as in her <b><i>Sleeper: New Works in Transmedia</i></b>, 1985. In 1988, she launched the Mano+Mano series of works based on an ancient ritual of healing, which marked her conversion to socially committed and nationalistic performance. In its first episode called <b><i>Isang Daan at Isang Dangkal</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Hundred and One Handspan), she explored the overseas Filipino domestic helper&rsquo;s plight. This was followed by <b><i>Oksidyin</i></b> (Oxygen), 1988, on the theme of ecology, an elaborate collaboration of multimedia art for video. <b><i>Porkilo</i></b> (Per Kilo), 1989, was on the issue of mail-order bride, first performed at the Performance Space Gallery in Sydney, Australia, and reworked several times. <b><i>Patawad, Diyos-Bundok </i></b>(Forgive Us, God of the Mountain), 1991, focused on the Mount Pinatubo themes. <b><i>Puting Uwak</i></b> (White Crow), performed in 1992 at the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino (also known as the Little Theater) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), was on the theme of violence and redemption from despair. The <b><i>Bangkok Project</i></b>, 1993, was a performance collage of past Mano+Mano<b><i> </i></b>episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 1988, Syjuco&rsquo;s performances have been lengthy quasi-surreal multimedia extravaganzas built around a social narrative: woman-victim degenerates into a hysterical madwoman who does violence to herself by shearing her own hair or bathing herself with a pail full of flour, dirt, mud, ash, eggs, or &ldquo;blood.&rdquo; She then concludes by magically transforming herself into a babaylan or shaman in a trance of healing. A cast of supporting performers, and a complex crew of installation and musical artists, light and sound technicians, and video-documentary staff support her semi-improvised gestures and monologues. She has also done sculptures that are conceptual, witty, and structural, drawing upon her engineering background. Her Toys for Grownups series are brightly painted plywood collections of creatures such as giraffes, complete with sound devices and illusory mirrors inviting viewer participation. In 2008, she and her husband Cesare held their first ever collaborative exhibit in Mag:net Gallery in Makati titled <b><i>2 Minds, Many Madnesses</i></b>, a commemoration of their 30 years in marriage and in art. Whereas Cesare&rsquo;s art was witty and challenged the viewer to question whether what he read or saw was true or not, Jean Marie&rsquo;s pieces in the exhibit were more sentimental. Her installations portrayed the reality of death and impermanence, as seen in her installation where an egg lay abandoned in its nest, and in another piece which consisted of an empty wall with only a piece of rusty nail to suggest that a painting hung there before. In her Kites series, 2011, she cut up plain canvases, painted, and arranged them so that they looked like huge origami kites mounted on walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Together with her husband Cesare, she founded <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Art Lab</span>, an atelier that serves as the family&rsquo;s studio and exhibition space for works of their own and other artists. During the 1990s, <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Art Lab</span> became a nesting ground for many conceptual and multimedia artworks. This art facility, initially located in Makati, was relocated to Ayala Alabang Village in Muntinlupa City in 2013. Like most independent, artist-run spaces, <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Art Lab</span>&rsquo;s mission is &ldquo;to develop new directions and alternative new audiences for Philippine art.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She participated in the second SEA Art Festival, Korea, 1990; the First ASEAN Artists Creative Interaction Project, Thailand, 1992; the <b><i>Kayumanggi Presence &rsquo;93 </i></b>(The Brown Presence &rsquo;93), a selection of Filipino artists from Hawaii, the US Mainland, Latin America, and the Philippines, Honolulu Academy of Art, Hawaii, USA, 1993; and the Fifth Havana Art Biennial, Centro Wilfredo Lam, Cuba, 1993. She also participated at the Lopez Museum&rsquo;s 50th anniversary exhibit called <b><i>Threads</i></b>, 2010, held at Rockwell Power Plant Mall in Makati City, where contemporary artists were asked to produce their own interpretation of the museum through creating another artwork or through &ldquo;cosplaying,&rdquo; or costume-playing, characters from the museum&rsquo;s iconic pieces. For her reference, Syjuco used <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>&rsquo;s [<b><i>Espa&ntilde;a y Filipinas</i></b>] (Spain and the Philippines) and made them into Barbie dolls. In 2015, she joined the National Art Fair at SM Megamall with her Enigma series&mdash;abstract compositions of white geometric shapes suggesting spaces and corners of walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She won the gold medal for sculpture in the 1980 Art Association of the Philippines art competition for <b><i>Traps: Approach to Mass and Insinuation</i></b>, an installation of nylon cords and hookeyes; and gold medal for <b><i>Slides OP #52</i></b>, liquitex and gesso on canvas, in the 1983 East-West Center Small Works Competition. In 1990, she received the CCP Thirteen Artists award. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, updated by Jhoanne Kristine A.

Iloilo City 22 Aug 1921. Painter. d. San Miguel de Allende, Mexico 15 Oct 2015. Tabuena studied fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP). He also studied at the Art Students League in New York, USA, in 1952 and at the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere in France in 1954. He lived in Mexico for several decades, but he has kept his Philippine citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the Neo-realists, he began his career with several exhibits of drawings and watercolors at the Philippine Art Gallery in 1949. He is best known for his watercolors, at times in a vertical format influenced by Chinese painting. These near-monochromatic watercolor landscapes of nipa huts, farmers, and carabaos are done in an exquisite style, with attenuated figures spread out in large tonal areas suggesting early morning fog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tabuena had another side to his art, and this was expressed in dark oil paintings, some of which seemed to reflect the &ldquo;proletarian&rdquo; concerns of the period, as in <b><i>Coal Gatherers</i></b>. Here the figures are short and squat, with expressionist distortion and with no bright colors to relieve the heavy atmosphere. He approaches expressionism, especially in such a work as <b><i>Childbirth</i></b>, in which the pangs of childbirth are expressed in elongated figures and dramatic lighting, which hints of fears of mythological beings. A later series consists of heads done in a monochromatic style with cubist influence, their jagged, angular features suggesting years of toil and arduous struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Tabuena settled in Mexico, he developed a colorful, prismatic style with folk subjects, including street sweepers, candle vendors, guards, and laundry women. Tabuena had several one-man shows both in the Philippines and in Mexico City, including a retrospective exhibit spanning 10 years of work at the Philippine Art Gallery in Manila in 1959. In 1965, he represented the Philippines as its official artist and art commissioner in the Eighth Biennial of Sao Paulo, Brazil. In 1995, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes sponsored his major exhibit for his long residency in Mexico and his passion for its artistic culture, particularly his town of residence, San Miguel de Allende, State of Guanajuato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tabuena won awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: second prize, <b><i>Agnus</i></b> <b><i>Dei</i></b> (Lamb of God), 1949, and honorable mention, <b><i>Black Christ</i></b>, 1952. Aside from these, he also received numerous awards and citations in Europe, including the Golden Centaur Award from the Academia Italia; the Medaglia al Merito from the International Parliament; and the Master of Painting, honoris causa, given by the International Seminar of Modern Art in Bannierre Europeanne des Artes. He was also cited for his artistry and active participation in cultural events on the Golden Anniversary of Instituto Allende. In 1996, he received a presidential citation from then-president of the Philippines Fidel Ramos for &ldquo;exemplifying the best of Filipino talent and excellence through his outstanding mastery in painting&rdquo; and &ldquo;elevating the quality of Philippine painting.&rdquo; In 2000, he was granted a Millennium Show by the Philippine Embassy as a sign of cultural agreement between the Philippine and the Mexican governments. An exhibit called <b><i>Rediscovering <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\"><strong>Romeo Tabuena</strong></a>: The Later Work</i></b> was held in Ayala Museum in 2009. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

They are known for their soil paintings depicting their epic tales and the worldview and spiritual beliefs of their people. The artists started the practice of soil painting in 1995 and have since participated individually and collectively in various exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Talaandig are one of the non-Islamized indigenous tribes living in the area around the Kitanglad Mountain Range. Communities are also to be found in North Cotabato, Agusan del Sur, and the Pantaron-Sumapay-Kubatungan and Minala mountain ranges. They are one of the <i>lumad</i> (indigenous people) who have been successful in preserving their traditional chants, weaving, and dance, keeping a strong belief in the spirit world and respect for the environment. To pass on the indigenous culture to their youth, the School of Living Traditions was put up by the Council of Elders of the tribe. The Talaandig community in Miarayon consider the elders as the original artists from whom they learn how to make crafts for livelihood and entertainment, embroidery of different patterns in cloth, healing dances and dances for special occasions, different songs with various themes to suit an event, and rituals using specific objects and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rodelio Linsahay Saway, aka Waway, is the cultural chieftain who first experimented with soil in the early 1990s as painting material and then taught other Talaandig the technique of using different shades of available soil as pigment with white glue as binder. Waway is a younger brother of tribal leaders Datu Migketay Victorino L. Saway and Datu Makapukaw Adolino Saway. Waway is a musician who makes and plays native instruments. He has recorded albums of tribal music and with his fellow lumad musicians has joined concerts and music festivals in as far away as South Korea, Taiwan, and New York. He is an educator and an advocate of lumad culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other members of the collective who have made their mark in the artistic landscape are Marcelino Balugto Poonon Necosia Jr, a Mindanao regional winner of the Philip Morris Philippine Art Awards (PAA), 2007 and 2009; Solimon Poonon, also a PAA winner in the regional level, 2009; Raul Sungkit Bendit, Adelfa &ldquo;Nanay Ipa&rdquo; Saway Kinuyog, Salima Saway, and Renjielou Salem who exhibit at the yearly Kalinawa Art Foundation shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two major exhibitions participated in by the Talaandig Artists as a collective are NCCA&rsquo;s co-curated exhibition <b><i>Sungdu-an 5 Current: Daloy ng Dunong</i></b>, 2009, at the National Museum in Metro Manila and the Singapore Biennale (SB) in 2013. For the Biennale, 10 artists from the Talaandig Indigenous community made a collaborative mural titled <b><i>Memories of the Peoples of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a>: The Talaandig R/evolution</i></b>. It is a four-panel soil-on-canvas, 244 x 488 cm mural. This was shown at the Singapore Art Museum together with other selected works from the Southeast Asian region. This particular work veered away from the usual epic tales which are a favorite theme of the artists. The SB 2013 soil painting is a folk art rendition of a panoramic map of the Talaandig lands, showing conflicts between old traditions, new technology, and their material and spiritual worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another noteworthy project was to make 1,001 paintings in one year. It was called the Talaandig <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>1 Millennium Soil Painting Project, 2009. Those already trained through past soil painting workshops made artworks on themes and issues identified as relevant to the tribe. This activity was spearheaded by the Indigenous Community of Artists of the Talaandig People. Talaandig soil painting methods have also been taught to the Manobo Pulangiyen tribe of Bendum Central Mindanao under the Bridging Leadership in Mindanao<i> </i>Project, 2011, of the Environmental Science for Social Change. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byKelly P.

The heritage project is fueled by the observation that the terrain of Baguio, the City of Pines, had been changing along with the shifting lifeways of ethnolinguistic groups based in the Cordillera mountain range. While their locations were still a destination for local and foreign tourists, Baguio-based tribes were seen as slowly replacing traditional methods of building homes, along with other practices and customs. Modern hardware and building implements as well as the need to strategically relocate nearer busy roads were increasingly favored by locals. Hence, the project was largely anchored on preserving, promoting, and making traditional Cordillera engineering and architecture more accessible to a general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tam-awan was the brainchild of National Artist Benedicto &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>&rdquo; Cabrera and other former members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a>. They envisioned a living museum that would serve as a hub for Baguio&rsquo;s artistic community. With the help of Chit Asignacion and artist Jordan Mang-osan, among others, the idea was realized. Chanum Foundation has managed the village from its inception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Century-old houses in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>Banga</strong></a>-an, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, made up the first three huts that served as prototypes. Each one was meticulously dismantled, transported, and rebuilt. To ensure that traditional methods of building were carried out, local artisans were employed. Original materials such as timber for the main structure, and support posts made of hardwood were used in the reconstruction. Nails were notably absent while the roofing material, cogon grass and reed, required the most upkeep. For stability, stone walls were created to support the soil upon which the huts were built. In keeping with tradition, offertory rituals were done for the spirits therein. At present, there are seven huts from Ifugao and two from Kalinga assembled and laid out like a village though with much less spacing between houses as would be found in an actual terraced site. To ensure Tam-awan&rsquo;s sustainability and self-sufficiency, eight huts are being rented out to itinerants and tourists who wish to experience living in the traditional dwellings. Also built into the village is a caf&eacute; and gift shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists from Baguio and the Cordilleras have since flocked to the village and considered it their haven, holding solo and group exhibitions in the village gallery, alongside other projects undertaken in art spaces outside of Baguio. A group of artists known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3791\"><strong>Tam-awan Village</strong></a> Artists, together with other locals, hold portrait sessions, livelihood demonstrations, lectures, workshops on printmaking, wood carving, weaving, papermaking, solar drawing, and rice-wine making. Art of different forms are showcased in one of the huts retrofitted into a gallery, while art installations are often strewn along the village&rsquo;s nature trail. Some of the members of the Tam-awan artists are Jordan Mang-osan, Marc &ldquo;Dungaw&rdquo; Tandoyog, Leonard Aguinaldo, Arthur Lozano, Herwin Buccat, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3751\"><strong>John Frank Sabado</strong></a>, Edwin Macadaeg, Jed Alangui, Patric Palasi, Tara Natividad, and Luisa Galang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Invoking Tam-awan&rsquo;s character as &ldquo;vantage point,&rdquo; Tam-awan artists launched an international art festival with the village as site for engaging discussions and dialogues on ideas of representation, authenticity, art, traditions, and culture. The annual Tam-awan International Arts Festival began in 2010 and has since been supported by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byThea C.

Although his family was not wealthy, he was able to study under Agustin Saez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\"><strong>Lorenzo Rocha</strong></a> at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios, where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo were his classmates at one time. In 1890, his atelier on what is now R. Hidalgo St was a thriving business. He was teaching at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios when the Philippine Revolution broke out and he became a volunteer in the Spanish military services. He resumed teaching at the Philippine School of Arts and Trades, 1908-10. He helped establish the Centro de Escultores in 1908 and served as its treasurer. In 1914, together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3681\"><strong>Graciano Nepomuceno</strong></a>, he set up a shop on Evangelista St, Quiapo, with a branch on Arlegui.

The church was hailed as a masterpiece, &ldquo;a monument worthy of any land&rdquo; (Norton in Manuel 1955b, 444) with a splendidly carved interior unrivalled in &ldquo;its exquisite conception, ornate execution and even in its artistic unity&rdquo; (Manuel 1955b, 445).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other examples of Tampinco&rsquo;s art are the high-relief carving on the molave door of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> in Intramuros and the altars of the church of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, and Mangaldan, Pangasinan. The decorative wood carvings in Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a>, and the Ateneo de Manila were done by him and his sons. He also executed sculptures with religious themes for private individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tampinco is important for his advocacy of a native Filipino style in decorative art. As early as 1895, he exhibited architectural plans and models that became known later as the &ldquo;Estilo Tampinco.&rdquo; He used <i>bunga</i> (palm tree) trunks for columns, anahaw and banana leaves as details, and <i>sala</i> (woven mats) for arches and facades. These were used for picture frames (called &ldquo;Tampinco frames&rdquo;), window posts, curtain valances, arches, and furniture. &ldquo;Estilo Tampinco&rdquo; antedated the coming of Western Art Nouveau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He received numerous awards for his work as sculptor and wood-carver: a silver medal and diplomas for the carved wooden cover of Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b> (Plants of the Philippines) for the king of Spain, 1882; a civil merit medal from Gen Domingo Moriones y Morillo, 1880; a silver medal during the tercentenary celebration of Santa Teresa de Jesus, 1882; a silver medal in the Exposicion General de las Filipinas (Philippine General Exposition), 1887; gold medals in the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition), 1895; gold medal in the Exposicion Universal de Barcelona (Barcelona Universal Exposition), 1888; and gold and silver medals in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in the United States, 1904.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite his achievements during his time and being named as &ldquo;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> of sculpture&rdquo; (Valdez 2014), Tampinco is rarely known today for his art, due mainly to the damage the war imposed on his works and to insufficient research and scholarship on him and his oeuvre. In Aug 2014, an art book dedicated to his life and works was launched at the National Museum in partnership with Vibal Foundation. Santiago Albano Pilar, art historian, teacher, and author who wrote the book <b><i>The Life and Art of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\"><strong>Isabelo Tampinco</strong></a></i></b>, spent 10 years of rigorous research on the sculptor, interviewing families and sifting through old newspapers and magazines. He was helped by art collectors Ernie and Araceli Salas, who discovered Tampinco&rsquo;s art during the 1980s. Aside from the book, a documentary titled<b><i> Estilo Tampinco </i></b>was also produced to tell the story of how they rediscovered Tampinco. It features talking heads, including Pilar, book editor and National Museum director Jeremy Barns, and Tampinco collectors. <em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by E.Arsenio Manuel, updated by Jhoanne Kristine A.

Manila 22 Jun 1960. Visual artist, curator, and art educator. He is the son of Arturo Parilla Tan and Teresita Lumibao del Mundo. Hefinished bachelor of fine arts, major in painting, at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman College of Fine Arts (CFA) in 1982 and masters of fine arts, major in painting,at theState University of New York at Buffalo in 1992. He was a professorial lecturer at UP CFA from 1993 to 2000 and the former dean of the University of the East College of Fine Arts from 2002 to 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a conceptual artist, Tan explores the nature of art and how formsand materiality can be articulated in ideas andconcepts, be it through two-dimensional painting, sculpture, or installation art. His<b><i>Painting with Content</i></b>, 2014,<i></i>is rendered in gray monochromatic smudgesthat create a crustily marbled surface. While entranced with the energy of the painting&rsquo;sapparently atmospherically pure form, itswholeness is disrupted by a small compartment on its lower left which conceals a photographof the same painting. The painting, which is a reconstruction of his earlier work done in 1986, deals with aesthetic questions related to the reproducibility of images and the spatial and temporal authenticity of a work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tan has participated in severalinternational exhibitions such as the 2nd Asian Art Show in Fukuoka Museum, 1982, and the1st Melbourne Biennale, 1999. He continues to work with contemporary artists making up the Bastards of Misrepresentation,<b><i> </i></b>which has aggressively and independently been exhibiting since 2010 in Berlin, Germany, Queens New York, and Paris, France. In <b><i>This Is Not Sugimoto&rsquo;s Drive-In Theatre</i></b>, undated, Tan appropriated the black-and-white photographs of old American cinema houses taken by Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto. The painting touches on serial likeness among other recurring issues in Tan&rsquo;s body of work which explores the capacity of art to rearticulate reality often in the most understated and ordinary of means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Code</i></b>, 2014, is a collection of found household objects, personal belongings, and quotidian materials he gathered from people. Similar to an earlier work done for the Melbourne Biennale, Tan created an inventory and catalogue of thecollected materials beforehanging these in the shape of a grid on the gallery&rsquo;s white walls. The work comes across as anethnographic display of the everyday, with mundane materialshaving their own narrativeboth as art and as part of the social sphere of daily activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tan was awarded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>Thirteen Artists Award in 1988. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byClod Marlan Krister Yambao</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Manila 8 Jan 1952. Her parents are Francisco Sotelo Sollesta and Julita Andrada Luces. She is married to Kaoru Taniguchi.Her daughter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3795\"><strong>Maria Taniguchi</strong></a> is also a visual artist, as well as her brother Danilo Sollesta. She attained her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in mass communication in 1978 and master&rsquo;s degree in English literature in 1985 from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a>, Dumaguete City. She also owns and operates Mariyah Gallery, which offers an exhibit space and meeting place for local artists. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the major projects that emerged from this space is the international Terracotta Art Festival and Competition, 2005 and 2007, aiming to maximize the locally available terra-cotta as medium for art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dumaguete-based Taniguchi is a self-taught visual artist. She started out as a painter with her Paper City series, 1989, followed by a series of large-scale black and red paintings called <b><i>Heroes and Dancers</i></b>, 1994, in oil; and <b><i>Tattoo and Tarot</i></b>, 1998, a series in watercolor and handmade paper. In 1999, a major shift occurred in Taniguchi&rsquo;s artistic vocabulary when she installed 50 life-size female torsos, her first attempt at terra-cotta sculpture. Titled <b><i>Mannequins</i></b>, 1998, the installation was shown at the <b><i>Women Imaging Women Exhibit </i></b>at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>, 1999, featuring women artists from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These early works are peopled with human figures that interact with animal and spirit worlds drawn from memories of childhood, mostly in the mystical island of Siquijor, of travel in the cityscapes of Singapore and Japan, from personal and universal myths, and from the artist&rsquo;s self-reflection on the role and status of women. These themes and the personal artistic iconography that would emerge in her body of work would resonate in later pieces, among them the Wrong Horizon series, 2004, and the three-panel <b><i>Anthology of Myths and Muses</i></b>, 2010. Variations on these themes and iconographic motifs would be inflected with observations from other cultures, resulting in artworks from various residencies such as <b><i>White Carpet</i></b>, 2013, in India; <b><i>Ehipto</i></b>, 2012, in Egypt; and a 400 x 200 m bronze piece sculpture <b><i>Dreamer</i></b>, 2011, which now sits in an ecological park in Jilin, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All in all, Taniguchi&rsquo;s body of works are testimonies to the dislocations of the self as it travels through the contemporary landscape, thus expressing the permanence of change and the processual and transitional nature of cultures and identities. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byFlaudette May V.

Dumaguete City 21 Sep 1981. Intermedia artist. She is the daughter of painter and sculptor Cristina or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3794\"><strong>Kitty Taniguchi</strong></a>. She received her bachelor of fine arts in sculpture at the University of the Philippines Diliman in 2007 and her master of fine arts in art practice at Goldsmiths, London, 2009. Taniguchi was selected to be part of the post academic LUX Associate Artists Program in London from 2009 to 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taniguchi&rsquo;s works explore processes and translate concepts, frameworks, or systems into abstracted forms. Many of her works draw attention to the materiality of the media she employs. She is recognized for large-scale paintings assiduously rendered with patterns akin to brickwork in a series she began doing in 2008. These flat black canvases reveal subtle shapes with slight shifts in gradients appearing on the painting surface. Rather deliberately crafting narrative, her videos privilege elements such as lighting, color saturation and tonal gradations, motion, rhythm, composition, and sometimes sound. In the video <b><i>Untitled</i></b> [<b><i>Celestial Motors</i></b>], 2012, the jeepney&rsquo;s body is captured in vivid detail, deprived of its usual baroque ornamentation and removed from the familiar context of the streets, the bare setting creating an aura of sophistication and glamor often elicited by product advertisements. The artist&rsquo;s solo exhibition at the UP Vargas Museum titled <b><i>Echo Studies</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011, conflates process and the making of meaning through form by evoking interconnections. Her grid paintings and graphite drawings foregrounding negative spaces converse with the high-definition video <b><i>Untitled </i></b>[<b><i>Dawn&rsquo;s Arms</i></b>].<i> </i>The video features the foliage of Romblon and centers on a marble slab being transformed by a local craftsman into a sculpture alluding to a work by Georg Kolbe, evoking the intersections of stone, sculpture, maker, making, and place to an exhibition site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist&rsquo;s solo exhibitions include <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3795\"><strong>Maria Taniguchi</strong></a></i></b>, 2014,<b><i> </i></b>Silverlens Galleries, Singapore and Manila; <b><i>Art Statements</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013,<b><i> </i></b>Art Basel 44, Switzerland; and <b><i>Rambler&rsquo;s Association</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, Art Space Auckland. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of Taniguchi&rsquo;s earliest exhibitions was <b><i>Grave Findings: A Reclamation Project</i></b> held at the Lopez Museum in 2005. She also participated in group exhibitions such as <b><i>Don&rsquo;t You Know Who I Am?: Art After Identity Politics</i></b>,<i> </i>2014,<i> </i>Museum of Contemporary Art Antwerp, Belgium; <b><i>The Philippine Contemporary</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013, Metropolitan Museum of Manila; <b><i>A Reader of Materials and a Writer of Forms</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012,<b><i> </i></b>MOT International, Brussels; and <b><i>Roving Eye: Video from Southeast Asia</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011, Sorlandets Kunstmuseum, Norway.

Montalban, Rizal 10 Jul 1980. Painter and intermedia artist. He is the son of Rodolfo Garcia and Eutemia Tapaya. He is married to visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3490\"><strong>Marina Cruz</strong></a>. They live and work in Bulacan. He finished his certificate in fine arts, major in painting, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a>. In 2002, as part of his prize for the Nokia Art Awards, he went to the Parsons School of Design in New York where he took up intensive courses in drawing and painting. He then went to the University of Helsinki where he took further studies in art. Tapaya returned to the United States for an artist residency program in Vermont Studio Arts Center in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tapaya&rsquo;s early works are characterized by his use of grids that appear as a mesh that sometimes overlaps with the pictorial space and intervenes in the neat contouring of the subject as in <b><i>Baka-Baka</i></b> (Cows/Maybe), 2004. This mesh layer may also recede in the background as in <b><i>Bulong Luntian</i></b> (Green Whisper), 2006. In his later works, these grids would evolve into embellished patterns integrated into the subjects&rsquo; anatomy and as texture-filled garments with geometric designs, colors, and symbolisms as in the Parable series, 2006. Aside from employing this distinctive style element, he also integrated burlap as material for his paintings. Beginning in 2006, Tapaya explored folk motifs as subject for his art. His subjects, which used to be solitary creatures in a pictorial space, now become part of a community of characters that symbolize different archetypes in Filipino society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The year 2008 marked a milestone in Tapaya&rsquo;s practice as he started appropriating Filipino folk narratives. In Tapaya&rsquo;s re-articulation of Philippine folk legends, myths, epics, and tales, the characters in these narratives become representations of contemporary realities and knowledge. This would lead to further shifts in his image-making in terms of scale as he started making large murals, and dioramas that house tableaus of Philippine folklore. He pursued this direction further in his 2010 exhibition <b><i>Bulaklak ng Dila</i></b> (Flower of the Tongue) at the UP Vargas Museum. In this exhibition, the pictorial space became larger and was filled with more characters situated in a vast array of flora and fauna. Tapaya also broadened his menu of materials with the introduction of resin sculptures, installations, paintings on glass, and decorative frames reminiscent of the <b>platero</b>&rsquo;s (silversmith&rsquo;s) traditional art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tapaya&rsquo;s works have been exhibited in Singapore, China, Japan, the USA, and Germany in both group and solo shows. He represented the Philippines in the Nokia Art Awards Asia-Pacific Student Art Competition in Seoul, South Korea, in 2001 and won the grand prize. His works were shortlisted for the Ateneo Art Awards in 2004, 2006, and 2010. In 2011, he received the grand prize at the Asia Pacific Brewery Singapore Art Prize for <b><i>Baston ni Kabunian, Bilang pero Di Mabilang </i></b>(Cane of Kabunian Numbered but Cannot Be Counted).

Angeles City 7 Aug 1956. Painter, sculptor, furniture designer. He is the son of journalist Renato Tayag aka &ldquo;Katoks&rdquo; and Adoracion Suarez. He is married to Mary Ann Quioc. Tayag grew up in the ferment of lively discussions of art and culture among prominent painters like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3488\"><strong>Emilio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r Cruz</strong></a> (whom he considers his greatest influence), all friends of his father. Tayag is a self-declared autodidact; he derived his basic techniques from observing E. Aguilar Cruz, Sofronio Y. Mendoza aka SYM, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3554\"><strong>Romulo Galicano</strong></a>, and other members of the Dimasalang Painters Group, who used to visit the Angeles countryside to render landscapes in plein air. He finished a bachelor of arts degree in economics at the University of the Philippines. Tayag is also a renowned chef, restaurateur, and food writer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in 1978 that he appeared in the Philippine art scene. Tayag&rsquo;s significant contributions to Philippine art lies in his elegant documentation of folk traditions like the Marinduque Lenten pageant in <b><i>Moriones</i></b>, 1982, at the Galerie Dominique, and vanishing colonial cultural objects like the carved and painted Christian images as in <b><i>Santo</i></b>, 1987, San Agustin Museum. In both themes, his works were characterized by a forceful spontaneity and a raw vigor almost verging on the crude that effectively capture the rich color, simple vision, and enduring appeal of these practices. In his large-scale <b>sumi</b>, <b><i>Black Mountain</i></b>, 1989, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> (also known as the Little Theater Lobby), on the other hand, he sought to trace the subliminal Oriental roots of his characteristic calligraphic handling of paints. Other than traditional Philippine folk practices, he has also exhibited European travelogue watercolor and Japanese ink paintings. In 1990, he had his first one-man show in wood at the Ayala Museum, <b><i>Art <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>Furniture</strong></a></i></b>, featuring art furniture from solid hardwood tempered by fine artisanship. Even before this exhibit, however, he had already been crafting traditional Filipino furniture such as tables, chairs, and plate containers, among others, with very simple, functional forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His sculptural works went through several phases, but the main perspective underlying each phase is the treatment of wood as a malleable plastic material to produce several possible forms that challenge what is traditionally expected of a rigid medium. His latest phase, consisting of the Totem Pole series, explores the different patterns created when a convex or a concave is placed adjacent a square log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1997, he won the Guhit Award given by the <b><i>Design and Architecture Magazine</i></b>, recognizing his dexterity in the decorative arts. In 2005, he opened his own lifestyle store/gallery in Greenbelt, Makati City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the beginning of his career as an artist in the late 1970s, Tayag has actively participated in several one-man and group exhibitions in the Philippines, China, the United States, and Spain, where he exhibited with both Filipino and Spanish artists. In 2003, he held a three-man show with Ben Cabrera and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3800\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3722\"><strong>Patis Tesoro</strong></a></strong></a> in a museum in his hometown, Angeles City. Other Filipino artists who exhibited in group shows with him include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3569\"><strong>Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3836\"><strong>Phyllis Zaballero</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3765\"><strong>Soler Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\"><strong>Abdulmari Imao</strong></a>, and Sajid Imao. Tayag also participated in the 20th Asian International Art Exhibition at the Ayala Museum in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2013, his show <b><i>Full Circle</i></b>, held at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, showcased his latest huge black-and-white canvas paintings. It also served to commemorate his 35th year in the art industry since his first solo show in 1978. His artworks can be found in the public collections of establishments such as the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, PLDT, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and Bank of the Philippine Islands. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Painter. Formerly based in Baguio, his works were exhibited in Baguio caf&eacute;s. He did several painting series of indigenous warriors of the Cordilleras. Many of these were vivid portraits rich in detail, possibly influenced by Masferre&rsquo;s photographs. Other paintings dealt with the struggle of the indigenous communities for their ancestral lands, as when the projected Chico Dam threatened to engulf their lands. His vision of their struggle also went beyond limited sectoral issues to radical social change which would transform the entire Philippine society. He did several paintings couched in striking visual imagery which were made into posters because of their political content. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> dealt with the subject of low intensity conflict, mainly psychological warfare that targets an entire population, including innocent children.

Beatriz Fabella Pamintuan Tesoro</b>) b. Manila 29 Dec 1950. Fashion designer. She is the daughter of Ramon Pamintuan and Esperanza &ldquo;Nena&rdquo; Poblador Fabella. She is married to Atty Jose Claro Tesoro. Architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2706\"><strong>Augusto F. Villalon</strong></a> is a first cousin. As both designer and environmentalist, Tesoro gained media recognition as the &ldquo;Grand Dame of Philippine Fashion&rdquo; despite having no formal education in clothing design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her first exposure to clothing and fashion came from her mother, who ran a dress shop from home. Tesoro then learned to sew in grade school as part of the home education curriculum at Assumption, Iloilo. After attending Maryknoll (now Miriam College) from 1959 to 1968, she began studying art education at Marygrove College in Detroit, Michigan. She returned to the Philippines after only a year, upon her mother&rsquo;s death in 1969. She returned to Maryknoll to continue her studies. As her husband&rsquo;s family owned Tesoro&rsquo;s, then the largest chain of stores specializing in Philippine handicrafts, she first ventured into the clothing business in 1972 initially with a line of embroidered blouses. By 1982, she launched her own label&mdash;Patis&mdash;followed by her first fashion show in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tesoro&rsquo;s first couture line came with the founding of thePatrones de Casa Manila, a group dedicated to preserving artifacts and creative expression relevant to Philippine history and culture. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of her advocacies with the Patrones was the establishment of a sustainable industry for the production and distribution of pi&ntilde;a<i> </i>(pineapple) fabric. Handwoven and hand-spun from dried pineapple leaves, pi&ntilde;a is traditionally associated with formal and elite Filipino clothing&mdash;specifically, the barong (traditional Filipino clothing for males) and the <i>terno</i> (traditional Filipino dress for females)&mdash;as it is notoriously difficult to produce and to weave. To revive pi&ntilde;a cloth production, Tesoro lobbied Visayan local officials to set up courses that would train the next generation of pi&ntilde;a weavers. She succeeded in doing this in 1985 (Milgram 2003). She also pioneered the development of <i>pi&ntilde;aseda</i>,<i> </i>a blend of synthetic fiber, silk, and pi&ntilde;a fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1992, Tesoro became the organizer of the Katutubong Filipino Foundation (KFF), which was devoted to providing tribal and rural-based Filipinos with livelihood opportunities while preserving their traditional arts and crafts. Under the supervision of Tesoro and then First Lady Amelita Ramos, the KFFparticipated in the Philippine Festival of Arts and Culture, held in France in 1994, and the <b><i>Bonjour Manila </i></b>exhibit in Printemps Department Store, Paris. Through such ventures, she showcased her talents all over the world, from New York, to Beijing, to Toronto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2000, together with San Juan civic leader Guia Gomez, she introduced the &ldquo;Ninay&rdquo; doll, a collector&rsquo;s item dressed in Philippine-made fabric and which was meant to depict Filipino customs and traditions. In 2013, she spearheaded the campaign to convert the Pamintuan ancestral home in Angeles City, Pampanga, into a museum that would showcase the best of Philippine textiles and social heritage. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice Sarmiento</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Milgram 2003.</p>\r\n"

Chunkong, Fukien, China 12 Apr 1927. Sculptor. Ting obtained his formative education at Fukien. He received his first schooling in art at Sinyu Normal College in 1945. Arriving in the Philippines in 1948, he studied at the School of Fine Arts, University of Santo Tomas (UST), where he obtained various prizes in the school&rsquo;s art competitions, particularly the first prize at the UST Art Exhibition of 1954. Studying sculpture under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\"><strong>Francesco Monti</strong></a>, Ting was to establish his reputation as a semiabstract sculptor through several winning pieces at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a> annual art exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ting&rsquo;s pre-1960 sculptures were described as &ldquo;expressionistic.&rdquo; These pieces were genre in subject matter, showing human figures apparently Oriental in proportion, in ordinary actions and poses, but animated with inner emotion. His forms and surfaces, however, are generally too polished and refined to be called expressionist. His work <b><i>New</i></b> <b><i>Moon</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1960, presaged the style that he is best known for. The work in bronze depicts a nubile maiden, her form rendered semiabstract by simplification of the masses of her body, her contour and surface articulated with a minimum of texture to evoke shadows when the moon is yet small and young. Because of his sweeping, graceful but quiet contours, his shapes that are pared down to two or three groups of small curved masses, and his polished surfaces, Ting&rsquo;s sensibility evokes the conciseness of Chinese nature poems. TingPingLay also produced elegant rubbings and woodcuts that recall traditional Chinese sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>New Moon</i></b> won for him the first prize in the 1960 AAP Annual Art Competition; <b><i>Two Sisters</i></b>, a sculptural piece, garnered second prize at the 14th AAP art competition in 1961; and <b><i>Blue Night</i></b> won the third prize at the 15th AAP art competition in 1962.

Malolos, Bulacan 24 Jul 1890. d. Quezon City 12 Jul 1976. National Artist for visual arts. He was the son of Isidro Tolentino and Balbina Estrella. In 1932, he married Paz Raymundo. They had seven children. He was a pupil of Mrs H. A. Bordner who first instructed him in drawing at the Malolos Intermediate School. He finished his secondary education at the Manila High School. As a self-supporting student, he obtained his degree in fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1915. He left for the United States in 1919 and there, through his own merits, was granted a scholarship at Beaux Arts School, New York City, through the beneficence of Bernard Baruch, an American millionaire. In 1921, he finished his course at the Beaux Arts with awards. In the same year, he left the United States for Europe, visiting the famous museums and galleries in London and Paris. In 1922, he entered the Reggie Istituto di Belle Arti di Roma and graduated in 1923 with the highest honor partly through the support of the Italian colony in Manila. In Rome, he held his first solo exhibition, which included <b><i>Saluto Romano</i></b> (Roman Salute). In a sculptural competition held in the Eternal City, his <b><i>Four</i></b> <b><i>Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i></b> won second prize. Tolentino sailed back for Manila in 1924 and worked in his own studio for a year. In 1926, he was appointed instructor at the UP School of Fine Arts. In this school, he rose to professor, secretary, and finally director. He headed the school from 1953 until his retirement as Professor Emeritus in 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tolentino first attained nationwide recognition with the multifigural bronze cast<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, which was designed in 1930 and unveiled in 1933. Other famous life-size statues by him are the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, unveiled in 1935 at the UP campus on Padre Faura, the statue of President Ramon Magsaysay in the Government Service Insurance System Building lobby, and <b><i>Alma Mater</i></b> at the University of the East campus. He did numerous busts, like those of Lapu-Lapu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\"><strong>Antonio Luna</strong></a>, Gregorio del Pilar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>, Manuel Quezon, Epifanio de los Santos, A.V.H. Hartendorp, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\"><strong>Carlos P. Romulo</strong></a>, Jose Cojuangco, Manuel Roxas, Jaime and Sofia de Veyra. He gifted President Woodrow Wilson with a statue titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, as a tribute to Wilson&rsquo;s efforts to preserve peace in the world. He completed a suite of six oriental dancers, including that of the biblical dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1277\"><strong>Salome</strong></a>, Maria Clara, and Persian, Javanese, and Chinese dancers, ca 1953. He did allegorical figures like <b><i>Filipinas</i></b>, also called <b><i>Slave</i></b>, a figure of a nude woman bound by ropes. He did religious images like the Immaculate Conception, 1936, and the Madonna and child, ca 1950. He designed the Maria Clara Award for film, and many other trophies and medals such as the official seal of the Republic of the Philippines and the medal of the Ramon Magsaysay Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A product of the classical academic tradition, Tolentino was a champion of classicism. From Jul to Oct 1948 in the <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine</i></b> and later in <b><i>This Week</i></b>, he engaged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> in a written debate on classical and modern aesthetics, attacking &ldquo;distortion&rdquo; and reaffirming the value of classical art. Although Tolentino&rsquo;s training was classical, his works were also permeated by the romantic sensibility that prevailed in the Western world from the early 19th century to the 1920s. Hence, his works were infused with drama and sentiment, particularly with nationalism since he was a fervent Rizalist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tolentino was also a guitarist, a spiritist, and translator. He could write in the ancient Tagalog alphabet, translated Rizal&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\"><strong>Mi Ultimo Adios</strong></a>&rdquo; (My Last Farewell) into Tagalog and Italian, and did the libretto for Felipe Padilla de Leon&rsquo;s opera, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Touch Me Not), 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tolentino received numerous awards and citations in his lifetime. He was one of the two outstanding alumni of UP in 1933. He received the Sculptor of the Year award from the Philippine Institute of Architects, 1955; an award of merit from the United Nations Commission of the Philippines, 1959; the Rizal Pro-Patria award, 1961; the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award for sculpture, from the city of Manila, 1963; the Republic Cultural Heritage Award, 1967; the Presidential Medal of Merit, 1970; the Diwa ng Lahi Award, 1972; and the National Artist Award for visual arts, 1973. In 1976, the National Art Foundation of Malolos, chaired by Tolentino&rsquo;s childhood friend Alfonso Calalang, published <b><i>Tolentino</i></b>, the first study of the artist written and designed by Rod Paras-Perez. On the artist&rsquo;s 123rd birth anniversary in 2013, a retrospective exhibit titled <b><i>Eskultor ng Lahing Filipino: Honoring the Life and Work</i></b> <b><i>of Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a></i></b> was held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

She graduated with a degree in fine arts, major in visual communication, from the University of the Philippines in 1982 and was a fellowship grantee at the Vermont Studio School and Colony in the United States in 1988.

Done in the expressionist style, her works are an attempt to capture the human soul. Emaciated forms, in a state of physical imprisonment and enveloped by garments, appear in both her paintings and sculpture. She has also used her paintings as a vehicle for questioning the traditional values regarding women. In her sculptures, she shows mummy-like figures in sheets and shrouds to express a person&rsquo;s imprisonment by society&rsquo;s rules or by personal fears. In recent works, she has introduced the theme of liberation: her figures are shown dancing, with their clothes swirling or hanging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She has held at least 10 solo exhibitions since 1987. In 1988, she mounted <b><i>Feminist</i></b> <b><i>Expressions</i></b> at the Holiday Inn Gallery in Manila and <b><i>Luna: Paintings, Drawings and Installations</i></b> at the Kulay Diwa Art Galleries in Para&ntilde;aque. Her succeeding works were shown in <b><i>Sa Pagbangon ng mga Ina</i></b> (With the Awakening of the Mothers), 1991, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP), and <b><i>Figures and Paradoxes </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> and Drawings) at the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise in Manila. She has also taken part in 21 group exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Torrijos was a CCP Thirteen Artists awardee in 1992. She won second prize at the Balagtas at Selya National Poster Competition, 1979, and was a finalist (painting) at the International Triennale Competition in Osaka, Japan, 1990. She also received an award from the V-Day Stop Rape Contest in New York. She co-founded WeDpro Inc, a nonprofit feminist organization that aims to support oppressed women and children, the poor, and other marginalized members of the society, designing its logos and other images. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byAlice G.

Angono, Rizal 28 Feb 1973. Painter, installation and performance artist. He is the son of Renato Tuazon and Narcisa Gagaring. He is married to the painter Katrina &ldquo;Keiye&rdquo; Miranda. Tuazon graduated in 1999 with a fine arts degree from the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Fine Arts (UP CFA) where he majored in painting. He is the founder of the now-defunct Surrounded by Water Alternative Art Space, the establishment of which marks a decisive moment in contemporary artist-run spaces. He is a core member and former president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3680\"><strong>Neo-Angono Artists Collective</strong></a>, a nonprofit organization composed of visual artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, and cultural workers who seek to engage the community of Angono in creative dialogue through research, education, production, and collaboration in art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Believing that the legacy of National Artist for visual arts Carlos &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a>&rdquo; Francisco, also a son of Angono, had been reduced by artists of his hometown to an industry of genre and landscape paintings, Tuazon deliberately pursued a more conceptual approach to painting. While retaining a strong sense of place, he also explored other non-illustrative forms such as installation and performance. In regard to his painting practice, Tuazon&rsquo;s work is characteristic of his generation of painters from the UP CFA trained to brashly appropriate media-generated and found images, taking liberties in their pictorial rendering and potential juxtapositions with incongruent elements such as text and spatial context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tuazon held his first solo exhibition, called <b><i>Angels of the Picture Tube and the Damned Collages</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>at The Mezzanine of Hiraya Gallery in 1996. His work has since been shown in solo and group shows, and performance art festivals, some of which he organized or directed himself under the auspices of Neo-Angono. Tuazon has held solo exhibitions annually since 1999, and is represented by Finale Art File in Makati City. He has also mounted shows abroad, including <b><i>Chance Imagery </i></b>in Malaysia, 2009; <b><i>The Shape of Water</i></b> in Singapore, 2010; and <b><i>Alleged Legends </i></b>in Beijing, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an artist-curator, Tuazon&rsquo;s projects include selection of Luzon-based artists for <b><i>Sungduan 4: Ex-Tensions</i></b> in 2007, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) Thirteen Artists Awards exhibition in 2009, and the exhibition <b><i>The Death of Death</i></b> at SM Megamall Art Center in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tuazon received the CCP Thirteen Artists Award in 2003. He received a residency grant at the Ashiya City Museum of Art and History from Japan Foundation Asia Center in 2001, and was one of the representatives of the Philippines to the 4th Prague Biennale in 2006, where works by Southeast Asian artists were presented in Central Europe for the first time. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byJaime Oscar Salazar</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Achacoso, n.d.; Bianpoen 2009; Finale Art File 2014d.</p>\r\n"

Inspired by illegal cockfighting bouts that could apparently be traced back to the Spanish colonial period and which persist to our day, the first Tupada events were held every Sunday in Rizal Park, Manila. These were done without the permission of the National Parks Development Committee, the government agency that administers the site, and would go on to include guerrilla performances in other public places. These were intended to help emerging artists gain valuable experience and test their ideas before live, incidental publics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2004, Tupada evolved into Tupada Action and Media Art or TAMA, an annual international performance art festival that serves as a platform for the convergence and exchange of diverse concepts and practices. It features exhibitions, fora, and workshops and has, since 2005, deliberately sought to broaden its public reach by taking the festival beyond Manila, in places such as Baguio, Batangas, Aurora, and Pangasinan. Its development into an international event has enabled exchanges with many performance artists, particularly those from or based in Southeast Asia. In contrast to how the practice of performance artists in other countries often come off as defiant of the art world mainstream, TAMA has opted for a more congenial relationship to state and commercial art world institutions. In Feb 2010, the seventh edition of TAMA was held in partnership with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as part of the National Arts Month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the festival has grown, its organizers have expressed a desire to shift into a more self-reflexive and critical mode regarding their practices, and have, for example, established certain protocols to ensure the soundness of submitted proposals prior to execution at the actual event. Resorting to this mode of self-curation is presumably done in response to how provocative actions have been publicly received over the years. Such actions include fellow artists critiquing performers about the wasting of food during a performance at <b><i>Densities: Making Sense of Dense</i></b><i> <b>Cities</b></i>, 2003, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> and an offensively construed reference to the marginalized urban poor in a work done for TAMA at the Blueroom Gallery environs, Pasay City, 2006. The controversy that erupted around children being made to wrestle each other for the 2007 edition of TAMA at the CCP is also partially credited to the fact that proposals at that time were not screened. Such issues of voluntary curtailment of artistic license, the shift from guerrilla to festival mode, the farming out of traveling opportunities, among other potentially contentious issues, have also led to the changing of the membership core over the years. While participating artists have presented pieces in various locations, such as streets, parks, bus stations, and markets, TAMA has also brought performance into museums, galleries, independent art spaces, galleries, and schools, with the goal of heightening and broadening public perception about the art form and how it is produced, disseminated, engaged with, and understood. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byJaime Oscar M.

Ermita, Manila 5 Jul 1923. d. 28 Jan 1996. Painter, sculptor. She was the daughter of Ty Engan and Tiu Sie-Engabu. She married Jerry Elizalde Navarro. Ty-Navarro graduated with a degree in fine arts, 1949, with highest honors, from the University of Santo Tomas where she taught immediately after graduation until 1960. She also taught at the College of the Holy Spirit, 1964-69. Her first one-person show was held at the Philippine Art Gallery in 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Active in the art circles, she organized the Society of Philippine Sculptors of which she was president, 1969-82. In 1970, she became the director of the Hilton Art Center. Known for her &ldquo;incision technique&rdquo; in sculpture, she demonstrated this method in Cambodia at the University of Phnom Penh, where she received an award from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and in India at the second Indian Triennale in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ty-Navarro&rsquo;s approach to art is multidirectional, favoring expression in different media and styles. In her work, no academic distinction exists between the fine arts and the applied arts, between sculpture and painting, or between jewelry and landscapes. In sculpture, she worked in bronze, wood, jade and mixed media. In the early 1970s, she did the Bird series in bronze. She likewise carved in jade, creating rounded, supple forms, human and animal. A series in bronze was created using an original technique in which the figure is made of tiny pellets of metal welded together. Her best-known sculpture is the bronze statue of Our Lady of Queen of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a> aka Our Lady of EDSA, 1989, located in Quezon City, to commemorate the religious aspect of the EDSA Revolt in 1986.

Manila 15 Apr 1953. Photographer. He is the son of<b> </b>Louis Joses Tysmans and Victoria Funtanilla. A longtime resident of Baguio City, he studied at Saint Louis University, Baguio. Tysmans may be considered a self-taught photographer. However, his career of more than four decades reveals how prolific and sought-after he has become among other formally schooled photographers in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tysmans is at ease with both black-and-white and color photographs, is familiar with a wide variety of equipment and materials, and has explored various photographic techniques. His portraits are generally straightforward, and are usually in black-and-white. While posed, they do not appear stiff and unnatural, and effort is made to capture significant aspects of the characters of the sitters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Being an artist himself, he was among the founding members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a>, a photographer among members who were predominantly painters. Among his body of work may be seen portrait images of his fellow Baguio artists such as National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\"><strong>Kidlat Tahimik</strong></a>. He has also photographed other artists and their works. Among them are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3370\"><strong>Pacita Abad</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\"><strong>Lee Aguinaldo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3387\"><strong>Gus Albor</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3836\"><strong>Phyllis Zaballero</strong></a>. At other times, he chose to collaborate with artists as they produced their own work. Tysmans has had artistic engagements with painters Bose and Aguinaldo, installation artist Ann Wizer, and performing artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3151\"><strong>Mae Paner</strong></a> (more popularly known as &ldquo;Juana Change&rdquo;). He has, of course, also appeared with fellow photographers in group photography exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Though famous as a portrait and fashion photographer, Tysmans photographs structures, ethnographic objects, and artworks in pieces that have received critical attention. A portion of his production also consists of nudes and his experiments with infrared or IR film. More recently, he also ventured into travel photography. Tysmans&rsquo;s fashion photographs are primarily accessed in the lifestyle sections of local newspapers and in fashion magazines. The publication <b><i>Jamming on an Old Saya</i></b>, 1995, however, functions like an art catalog to accompany an exhibition and fashion event with the same title. The fashion collection, done in collaboration with designers and installation artists, featured reworked old (but usable) cloth materials from writer and theater impresario <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5183\"><strong>Gilda Cordero-Fernando</strong></a>&rsquo;s horde of clothes dating to her grandmother&rsquo;s time. Of a slightly different character are the subjects featured in <b><i>Tahor</i></b>, 1992, a volume of portraits devoted to the country&rsquo;s fighting cock breeders. Also, in <b><i>Town and Country Magazine</i></b>, an open publication on the web, published by Carewell Foundation and also in print, Tysmans tackled images of cancer survivors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Works of a more documentary character are evident in Tysmans&rsquo;s publication work such as the photographs of Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, 2005 and lime containers from the Cordilleras, 2006. The book project <b><i>Sinaunang Habi</i></b>, 1991, on the other hand, put together many never before seen traditional<b> </b>textiles from northern and southern Philippines that are now in private collections. In sections where the textiles are represented as dress, Tysmans did not work with professional models but with locals from the different ethnolinguistic groups who chose to wear their textiles in the manner they deemed appropriate. In the books <b><i>Ginto</i></b>, 2004, and <b><i>Tanaw</i></b>, 2005, Tysmans documented the gold and painting collections, respectively, of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. He also did the exhibition catalogue for <b><i>Lumina Pandit</i></b>, 2011, which was made up of the rare book collection of the University of Santo Tomas. Other documentation projects include anniversary volumes for commercial institutions in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His photographs have been exhibited both locally and internationally, and have appeared in various publications such as broadsheets, glossy magazines, coffee-table books, and business reports. The photographs of Tysmans have been exhibited in institutional art venues such as the Ayala Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, the Yuchengco Museum, the Luz Gallery, and Pinto Art Gallery. Others have also been viewed through expositions in more popular venues, such as the Power Plant Mall, Alabang Town Center, and the SM Malls, including a permanent collection of the Shell series at the St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Fort Bonifacio Global City. Because of his track record in various domains of both commercial and art photography, Tysmans has often been called upon to give workshops and serve as judge in numerous photography competitions. He was also designated a Canon ambassador. In Apr 2014, to celebrate his 40th year as a photographer, the BenCab Museum in Baguio City hosted <b><i>Photographic Memories</i></b>, a Tysmans retrospective. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byMarilyn R.

In 1995, UGATLahi joined Sining Bugkos, a Manila-based alliance of cultural workers and formations and adopted its current advocacy for supporting nationalist culture and human rights. The group initiates art workshops, artists&rsquo; immersion programs in urban poor communities and workers&rsquo; organizations, organizing work among artists, exhibitions, mural projects, puppet theater performances, fora, and effigy projects. Among its members over the years were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\"><strong>Mideo Cruz</strong></a>, Boyet de Mesa, and Raoul Ignacio aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3743\"><strong>Iggy Rodriguez</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">UGATLahi has explored the use of popular and protest art forms to communicate the advocacies that the group supports. Its members started producing papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; effigies for street demonstrations in the late 1990s, parading and burning the figures as part of these protests. Several of their larger and more elaborate effigies in the succeeding years, such as the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2177\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2177\"><strong>Erapzilla</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2000, made for the <i>welgang bayan</i> (people&rsquo;s strike) of 2000, attracted the attention of mass media and a broad public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">UGATLahi&rsquo;s largest projects to date are the annual effigies for the protests during the annual State of the Nation Address delivered by the Philippine president before a joint session of Congress. These are all produced in collaboration with the political umbrella organization Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (New Patriotic Alliance). The group has produced various effigies of different presidents: Joseph Ejercito Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III. Symbolizing different government administrations through their heads of state, the effigies are usually burned to convey the protestor&rsquo;s demands for social change. They are treated by the group as collaborative and collective works, produced in cooperation with volunteers and grassroots organizations. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>WrittenbyLisa Ito-Tapang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The school was established to train craftsmen in the proper techniques of painting religious imagery. It subsequently closed down due to lack of enrollees, and was replaced by the Estudio de Adorno that provided art classes for the various Dominican schools in Manila, such as UST and the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. The Estudio became the UST College of Fine Arts and Design in 1934-35 when it became evident that the modernization of Philippine industries required a corpus of trained designers and architects (Edades in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5758\"><strong>The Varsitarian</strong></a></i> </b>1935, 5). UST Rector Fr Serapio Tamayo called for the establishment of a School of Fine Arts on 24 Feb 1934 that would help &ldquo;build a more refined civilization&rdquo; founded on morals and spiritual satisfaction derived from artistic works (Tamayo in <b><i>The Varsitarian</i></b><i> </i>1934, 1). It initially offered a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in fine arts with two majors, interior design (later design) and public school art, patterned after the modern American pedagogical system, with a strong grounding in Catholic theology, humanities, and modern art. Sixteen students constituted its first batch of enrollees in 1935. Its first faculty consisted of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a>, Jose L. de Ocampo, and Severino Fabie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1938, the two schools were separated from the College of Engineering and combined into the School of Architecture and Fine Arts. In 1946, it became the College of Architecture and Fine Arts (CAFA) under its first dean, Arch Jose Victor Rocha. Its first college regent was Fr Gregorio Garcia, OP. In 1950-51, the fine arts was reorganized into two departments: painting and sculpture, under chairpersons Victorio Edades and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\"><strong>Francesco Monti</strong></a>, respectively. Two-year vocational courses in modeling, ceramics, painting, drawing and design, interior design and decoration, and commercial art were also offered from 1951 to 1957. The bachelor of fine arts in design was reorganized into the baccalaureate degrees for interior design, 1957, and advertising 1958, under their respective departments; while the Department of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> was abolished in 1962. It was at this time that the UST CAFA was known as the home of modern art in the Philippines, with a faculty that included Edades, Galo Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Jeremias Elizalde Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\"><strong>Diosdado Lorenzo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3487\"><strong>Bonifacio Cristobal</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\"><strong>Ricarte Puruganan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3738\"><strong>Cenon Rivera</strong></a>, and Manuel Rodriguez Sr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1960 to 1977, vocational programs in advertising, interior design, furnicraft, and commercial art continued to be offered, and were aimed at adult night school students and those who were not qualified to take the baccalaureate degree. The position of director of fine arts was abolished in 1972 under CAFA Regent Fr. Frederick Fermin, OP, and replaced with individual department chairpersons. In 1997, it was decided to separate fine arts from architecture via a two-year transition period from 1999 to 2001, with Prof Jaime de los Santos serving as associate dean for fine arts. Fine Arts officially became the College of Fine Arts and Design through a memorandum dated 13 Oct 2000 from UST secretary-general Fr Rodel Aligan, OP. The same memo also announced the appointment of Fr Isidro Aba&ntilde;o, OP, as the acting first dean of CFAD, as well as regent of CFAD and the College of Architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST CFAD roster of alumni and alumni-faculty include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3704\"><strong>Mario Parial</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\"><strong>Angelito Antonio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\"><strong>Antonio Austria</strong></a>, National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\"><strong>Ang Kiukok</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3807\"><strong>Virginia Ty-Navarro</strong></a>, Rosario Bitanga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3699\"><strong>Leon Pacunayen</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3442\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>Norma Belleza</strong></a></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\"><strong>Romulo Olazo</strong></a>, Jaime de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\"><strong>Danilo Dalena</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, Lito Mayo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3437\"><strong>Gabriel Barredo</strong></a>, Ronald Ventura, Alfredo Esquillo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\"><strong>Mideo Cruz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3438\"><strong>Andres Barrioquinto</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3463\"><strong>Buen Calubayan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3743\"><strong>Iggy Rodriguez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3755\"><strong>Mark Salvatus</strong></a>, and Jaime Pacena. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byReuben Ramas Ca&ntilde;ete</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtextALT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carado 2013; Edades 1935; Tamayo 1934.</p>\r\n"

Together with the College of Medicine and the College of Agriculture, it is one of the earliest units in UP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the first nine instructors of the SFA, including Director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3532\"><strong>Rafael Enriquez</strong></a> and his successor Fabian de la Rosa, had been students, faculty, or scholars of the Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado whose teaching system was based on the Academia de San Fernando in Madrid. Active from 1845 to 1898, the Escuela was reestablished as the Academia de Dibujo, one of the first official art academies in the Philippines, in 1823-34.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The SFA initially offered five-year nondegree certificate programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving. Students, including elementary students &ldquo;who show marked proficiency in drawing,&rdquo; were admitted through competitive examination (UP 1912a). Effective school year 1918-19, no new student was admitted who had not finished studies equal to those taught in the intermediate grades of the public schools. No tuition was charged until 1923-24. In 1926-27, the curriculum in painting, sculpture, and engraving was reduced to four years while illustration, cartooning, and commercial design programs were shortened to three years. Four-year degree courses leading to a bachelor of fine arts (BFA) in painting and a BFA in sculpture were offered by 1947-48.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the first batch of six graduates in 1914 was Fernando C. Amorsolo who later assumed directorship of the school in 1938. He was succeeded as director by Guillermo E. Tolentino in 1952 and Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda in 1955. The UP Fine Arts faculty during its first half-century was associated with the classical tradition in art. This led to an impassioned debate over the nature of art between Tolentino and the modernist Victorio C. Edades, then director of the University of Santo Tomas School of Architecture and Fine Arts, in a series of periodical articles in 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s and 1960s, younger faculty members such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3445\"><strong>Constancio Bernardo</strong></a>, Napoleon V. Abueva, Jose T. Joya, and Rod Paras-Perez received scholarships to the United States. Several revisions in the curriculum coincided with their return, reflecting the shift to modernist ideas. In 1955, the BFA in art education and BFA in commercial design were instituted. Since its inception, the commercial design program, since renamed visual communication, has consistently attracted the most number of enrollees within the college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The SFA became the School of Fine Arts and Architecture in 1959 when the architecture program, which was initially offered by the UP College of Engineering in 1956, was transferred to it. The school was elevated to a college in 1961. The College of Fine Arts and the College of Architecture became separate academic units in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The college offers bachelor&rsquo;s degree programs in art education, art history, industrial design, painting, sculpture, and visual communication. It also offers certificate programs as well as a master of fine arts. As of 2014, it has produced 10 of the 16 National Artists for visual arts&mdash;namely, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, Benedicto Cabrera, Carlos &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a>&rdquo; Francisco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\"><strong>Abdulmari Imao</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Hernando Ruiz Ocampo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byRoberto Eliseo G.

It offers bachelor of arts programs following three tracks (art history, interdisciplinary studies, and Philippine art) and three master of arts programs (art history, art theory and criticism, and curatorial studies). It is, to date, the only academic department of its kind in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DAS, originally called the Department of Humanities and Philippine Institutions, was formed in 1959 when the English Department of UP Diliman split into three smaller units: the Department of English and Comparative Literature, the Department of Speech Communication and Theater Arts, and the Department of Humanities and Philippine Institutions. At that time, the department&rsquo;s initial task was to teach art appreciation in the style of the University of Chicago as part of the general education curriculum of UP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the decades after 1959, the department shifted its approach from one which was heavily formalist and geared toward the appreciation of fine art, to one which acknowledged the value of popular and marginalized art forms and which was more suited to the study of Philippine art as implicated in its diverse social and historical contexts. In 1989, the Department of Humanities became the Department of Art Studies to reflect the newer paradigms and approaches advocated by its faculty, which included contextual as opposed to object-centric and formalist analysis, as well as a deliberately critical approach to elite, Euroamerican art discourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DAS has been committed to the foregrounding of the study of Philippine art from an inter-/multidisciplinary approach. Its faculty and students have produced significant scholarly works that have contributed to the better understanding and valuation of various art practices and traditions in the country, as well as to the formation and development of new theories and critical methods in the study of art. Its publications include <b><i>Paths of Practice: New Directions in Art Studies and the Humanities</i></b>,<i> </i>2010, and <b><i>Suri Sining: The Art Studies Anthology</i></b>, 2011. These represent the range and diversity of knowledge and theoretical paradigms embodied by its faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DAS has also been active in the development of pedagogical tools, methods, and instructional materials through its publications, fora, conferences, and workshops for teachers, art scholars, museum workers, curators, cultural workers, writers, and artists. Its projects include the Visual Literacy Workshops held in the summers of 2012 and 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from the department&rsquo;s contributions to art scholarship and criticism, its faculty, several of whom are occasionally seconded to hold key positions in government institutions, are curators, artists and/or cultural workers. They have been at the forefront of many projects in collaboration with various institutions, local communities, individual artists, and artist groups. These endeavors highlight the department&rsquo;s assertion that the study and practice of art are not divorced from social, political, and ecological issues concerning the nation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byPatricia Marion Lopez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Lava 2011; Mirano and Lopez 2011; UP Department of Art Studies 2013.</p>\r\n"

Abra 31 Aug 1912. d. Manila 25 May 1972. Fashion designer. National Artist for fashion design. He was the son of Melecio Valera and Pilar Oswald. He finished his primary and secondary education in De La Salle, but dropped out of his first year of college at Far Eastern University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He began his design career in 1935. Valera was best known for the innovations made to the baro&rsquo;t saya (traditional blouse and skirt), which he combined into a single gown, now referred to as the <i>terno</i>. He also did away with the<i>tapis</i> (overskirt),and<i>pa&ntilde;uelo</i> (a stiff scarf that covered the shoulders and nape). Instead of hooks, he introduced the used of the zipper at the back, creating an A-line in the silhouette popularized in Western fashion design. Valera initially scandalized his conservative clientele with these innovations. But the controversy died down quickly enough because the elite continued to wear his terno featuring embroidery, bead work, and butterfly sleeves. Soon, the Valera terno became the iconic style on the national level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His clientele included First LadiesAurora Quezonand<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Romualdez-Marcos. Marcos was largely responsible for making Valera&rsquo;s work internationally known. It was Valera who created Romualdez-Marcos&rsquo;s wedding gown and many of the ternos worn by her for diplomatic functions. He also costumed actress<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a>, who played Marcos&rsquo;s First Lady in the film <b><i>Pinagbuklod ng Langit </i></b>(Joined by Heaven), 1969. In 1960, Valera showed alongside Japanese couturier George Oka at a benefit show for the Fourth Cancer Educational Fund Drive. While Oka brought professional models from Japan to wear his work down the runway, Valera dressed a bevy of society ladies and actresses, including Marcos and Romero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4593\"><strong>Barbara Perez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\"><strong>Susan Roces</strong></a>, and Imelda Cojuangco, because there were no professional models at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1994, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> mounted the exhibit <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3814\"><strong>Ramon Valera</strong></a> and the Terno</i></b> curated by Salvador Bernal at the Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works are chronicled in the book <b><i>Valera: Cada Traje es una <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1479\"><strong>Obra Maestra</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Every <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><strong>Dress</strong></a> Is a Masterpiece),<i> </i>2005, published by the Tantoco-Rustia Foundation and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>.

Paco, Manila 29 Oct 1910. d. 22 Apr 1997. Cartoonist. He was the son of Eusebio Velazquez and Andrea Santos. He was married to Pilar Tongco with whom he had two children. In 1926, while a boy of 16 in high school, he worked as photoengraver at the Banaag Press in Santa Cruz, Manila, which was later bought by Ramon Roces of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b>. Velasquez took courses in cartooning and advertising at the Federal School of Arts of America. In 1935, Velasquez was promoted to chief advertising artist for the six sister magazines: <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, <b><i>Graphic</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5087\"><strong>Bannawag</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Bikolnon</i></b>. In 1962, he also took up modern management at the Management Development Center in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 11 Jan 1929, the first issue of his comic creation <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></i></b> appeared in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, followed later by <b><i>Ponyang Halobaybay</i></b>. Except for the <b><i>Graphic</i></b>, <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b> appeared in all the magazines, either in Tagalog or translated into the regional languages. A major hit, <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b> inspired a song from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a> and a poem from Jose Corazon de Jesus. <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b> soon grew into an extended family which included his parents Mang Teroy and Aling Matsay, his sweetheart Rosing, his rival Tirso, and the dimwit Talakitok. The comic strip survived the Japanese occupation and continued after the war, appearing twice weekly in <b><i>Pilipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><strong>Komiks</strong></a></i></b>, at one point heralded as <b><i>Di Retarn op Kenkoy</i></b>,<b> </b>1991-93.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, Velasquez became a freelance contributor to <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, having put up his own advertising agency with his brother Damian, also a cartoonist. In 1946, he along with a number of pioneering cartoonists contributed to <b><i>Halakhak</i></b>. In 1947, he organized Ace Publications, which came out with its first comic magazine, <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>, for Ramon Roces, and later with <b><i>Tagalog Klasiks</i></b>, <b><i>Hiwaga Komiks</i></b>, and <b><i>Espesyal Komiks</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Velasquez received the Best Komiks of the Year award from Graphic Arts Service Inc, 1963; a special award from the Citizens Council for Mass Media, 1971; the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan sa Larangan ng Makasining na Komiks from the city of Manila, 1974; a special award from the Department of Public Information, 1975; and a Life Achievement Award from Komiks <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tion Brotherhood, 1998.

Manila 31 Jul 1947. Painter. He is the son of Geronimo Veneracion, Doctor of Laws, and Aida Santos. His son Ian is a film and television actor and a painter. Intent on pursuing an artistic career, he enrolled at the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts in 1970. Although he was in advertising from 1970 to 1973, he concentrated on painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has worked in a number of series in different styles, media, and content. Around 1976, he worked in the abstract expressionist style, because of the influence of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a> and other abstractionists. In 1981, he experimented with pastel works using sandpaper to create original textural effects. He also developed a &ldquo;soaked&rdquo; technique in which the paper is steeped in a sink of water with various elements, producing random strains and textures. From the outset, Veneracion placed importance on the role of the subconscious in art. He created compositions based on the free play of chance and accident, as in the throw of dice or joss sticks in Chinese fortune-telling which would finally fall into the pattern of I Ching hexagrams. He never relinquished figuration which sparked a connection between his art and events of the real world. Around 1983, he did a series of large-scale paintings in which the transition from Marcos to Aquino was interpreted in a dreamlike manner. Its surreal allegory featured dramatis personae such as military figures, as monsterlike robots in full armor, the Filipino people as the archetypal Malakas (Strong) and Maganda (Beautiful), and a beautiful nude gazing into a mirror below the crossed flags of the Philippines and the United States, suggesting the perpetual questioning of identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around 1984-85, Veneracion summoned his drawing skills to draw nudes that combined spontaneity with a classical air. From these, he indulged his fascination with movement in sketches and watercolors of dancers, exploring the infinite agility of the human figure. At the same time, his passion for experimentation led him to use sinamay cloth pressed on randomly stained paper to obtain traces of the organic fiber in fine striations and patterns. Using the treated paper as background, he collaged simple decorative cutouts of folk designs, usually derived from Maranao <b>okir</b>. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo inspired a series of paintings that went from textural interest to metaphysical reflection. Veneracion&rsquo;s fascination with the concept of time, which he distinguished into &ldquo;linear time and cyclical time,&rdquo; resulted in semiabstract works combining texture and gestural painting, with figures of humans and beasts emerging like allegorical symbols in a metaphysical cosmic space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He has had one-person shows and joined group exhibitions such as the <b><i>Mini-Mini</i></b>, Gallery Bleau; <b><i>Fil-Art Exhibit</i></b>, Ontario, Canada; <b><i>Insights into Philippine Art</i></b>, New York; <b><i>Contemporary Philippine Art</i></b>, Washington, DC; <b><i>Seven Filipino Artists</i></b>, San Francisco; and the <b><i>ASEAN Travelling Exhibition</i></b> in Southeast Asian countries and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.

Manila 12 Jun 1973. Intermedia artist. His parents are Ruben Ventura and Rosalina Cruz. He received his bachelor of fine arts in painting at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1993. Ventura was instructor of fine arts in UST from 1993 to 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Employing various themes and techniques, Ventura&rsquo;s works offer complex visual dialogues. His works meld imageries culled from Philippine folk traditions; iconic works from the West; religion; popular culture genres such as comics, advertisements, cartoons, and toys; as well as elements from subcultures like graffiti and tattooing. In the early part of his artistic career, the art historian Patrick <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> noted that Ventura&rsquo;s paintings were done with &ldquo;breathtaking naturalism&rdquo; (Flores 2008). Many of Ventura&rsquo;s large-scale compositions are filled up with hyperreal figures achieved through methodical techniques of drawing and painting. The compositions would sometimes incorporate found objects, digitally manipulated printouts, as well as stenciled figures. On the other hand, his initial forays into sculpture involved the use of fiberglass and resin glossed up with acrylic polyurethane paint, producing a sleek, industrial effect. In his later works, as in the exhibition <b><i>Watching the Watchmen</i></b>, 2012,<b><i> </i></b>held at the University of the Philippines Vargas Museum, Ventura&rsquo;s industrial sculptures became more elaborate and unsettling. Translating the <b>bulol</b> (images of granary gods or anito, ancestor, and nature deities) to create contemporary imagery, the artist pronounces the musculature, making these figures look like anatomical models. Ventura also applied intricate drawings on the whitewashed bodies of the morphed bulol, and rendered some of the figures in appropriated poses from pop culture and religious icons&mdash;for example, Saint Michael trampling on a demon. His oil on canvas work <b><i>Appetite</i></b>, 2008, for his solo exhibit <b><i>Mapping the Corporeal</i></b>, 2008, at the National University of Singapore Museum features the coalesced image of two lavishly dressed men, their face obscured by an enlarged mouth, exposing its anatomy. Ventura&rsquo;s works for this exhibition also features his Zoomanities series, fiberglass resin sculptures of part-human, part-animal forms. His images are reflections on postmodern conditions. Embracing the fluid exchange among belief systems, his works imagine fusions and transformations when barriers are broken down. His juxtapositions are ruminations on human desires and anxieties about the predominance of machines and high technology, urban blight, commodification, and mediatization of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist has exhibited extensively in museums and galleries in the Philippines and abroad. His solo exhibitions include <b><i>All Souls Day</i></b>, 2000, Drawing Room Gallery; <b><i>Cross Encounters</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2006, Ateneo Art Gallery;<b><i> Major Highways, Expressways, and Principal Arterials</i></b>,<i> </i>2009, Akili Museum of Art, Jakarta, Indonesia;<b><i> Humanime (I)</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011, Fine Arts Centre, Taipei, Taiwan;<b><i> Recyclables</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, Singapore Tyler Print Institute; and <b><i>Bulul: Ronald Ventura and the Traditional Art of the Philippines</i></b>, 2014, Museo delle Culture, Lugano, Switzerland. Ventura&rsquo;s work also appeared in international group exhibitions such as the Prague Biennale, 2010, Prague, Czech Republic; Nanjing Biennale, 2011, Nanjing, China; and <b><i>Surreal versus Surrealism in Contemporary Art</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011, Institut Valencia d&rsquo;Art Modern, Valencia, Spain. In 2011, the book <b><i>Realities</i></b> was published by Grafiche Damiani, featuring selected works by Ventura and with essays by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a>, Ramon E.S.

Negros Occidental 7 Aug 1938. Sculptor, painter. His parents are Edgar Victorio Verano and Alicia Maravilla. He married Elvira Santos. A graduate of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a>, he was a student of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>. Like his mentor, Verano&rsquo;s experience in materials is wide ranging, having worked in wood, stone, and metal (particularly bronze), with a definite penchant for experimentation. He was one of the first to use old wood from crumbling century-old houses to make statements on the human condition. His bamboo sculptures bring out the full expressive potential of the material. His <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Fugue series,<b><i> </i></b>1972, was inspired by the use of bamboo as musical instrument, the variedly shaped apertures individualizing each piece within the ensemble. While visual and tactile in appeal, they also make auditory allusions to bamboo pipes, such as the native flutes and panpipes. In 1972, he began experiments in acriweld, consisting of sawdust combined with strong glue. From this medium he created sculptures of stylized human figures eminently supple in form, doing light and airy gestures and dance movements as well as of genre themes, such as rice planting and various rural occupations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Verano is also a painter of landscapes and still life. In his landscapes he enhances his painting surfaces with sand and modeling paste, thus creating a direct textural appeal. He has also consistently worked in watercolor in the wet technique, bringing out the freshness spontaneously and the atmospheric effects of the medium in misty landscapes and floral bouquets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Verano won awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: first prize, <b><i>Stone</i></b> <b><i>Idol</i></b>, 1951; third prize, <b><i>Composition No. 15</i></b>, 1961; second honorable mention, <b><i>Composition No. 16</i></b>, 1962; honorable mention, <b><i>Human Bondage</i></b>, 1963; and best landscape, <b><i>Tondo Tide Lands</i></b>, 1977.

He was the only son of Antonina Vicente, a fish vendor, and of a certain Spaniard named Guardamonte who died a month before Maximo&rsquo;s birth. His mother later married Pablo Santiago, a fisher from Navotas. They had five sons, Rafael (master carpenter), Felix (sculptor, painter, and altar designer), Dionisio (sculptor), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a>no (painter), and Roberto (sculptor), who all contributed to the success of the Talleres de Maximo Vicente from its founding in 1908. His formal education consisted of a month&rsquo;s stint at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts on Calle R. Hidalgo when it opened in 1909.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vicente Sr learned the art of the <b>santero</b> or religious image maker from his maternal uncles Osmundo and Narciso Vicente who had ateliers in Quiapo and Santa Ana. In his childhood days, Vicente Sr was surrounded with lush trees in their huge backyard, and it inspired him to try to create something out of wood. He made a crucifix that impressed a parish priest who eventually bought the item and promised to order more. This inspired him to found the Talleres, a pioneering shop and the largest during its heyday in the late 1920s when it occupied the streets of R. Hidalgo and del Paso, Quiapo. Its services included <i>carroza</i> (float) making, plating, embroidery of costumes, <b>encarnacion</b> (rendering of flesh tones), gold leafing, wood carving, wig making, eyelash and glass-eye making, and designing and constructing altars, confessional boxes, holy water fonts, and even boats. Majority of its workers hailed from Malabon, Navotas, and Pampanga and were relatives of his wife Crispina Laxamana. His artists included Juan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, Rufino Rivera, Alfredo Contreras, Conrado Rubio, Rufino de Jesus, Jorge Santiago, and Ner Maglaqui. Vicente Sr believed in using only the finest materials in his shop. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a>s were usually made of batikuling wood, ideal for its fine-grained structure and durability. The unparalleled craftsmanship of the religious images produced in the Talleres made Vicente Sr and his artisans popular, their works reputedly rivaled those produced by the best artisans in Europe. Vicente Sr was dubbed the &ldquo;Master Sculptor of Religious Imagery.&rdquo; The clients of his Talleres ranged from church establishments to government officials. Before World War II, they did the silverwork for the carozza of the image of La Naval. When he died, the Talleres came under the supervision of Mrs <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Hernandez-Vicente, wife of his architect-son Maximo. Later on, the shop was moved to M. Adriatico St in Ermita, where they now restore old statues made of plaster, marble, ivory, or porcelain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of his works include <b><i>Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Praga</i></b> (Holy Infant of Prague), ca 1915, San Beda Chapel; <b><i>Birheng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a>a </i></b>(Miraculous Virgin), ca 1920, San Marcelino Church, Manila; and <b><i>Saint Gerard</i></b>, ca 1920, Redemptorist Church, Baclaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jul-Aug 2015, a few of Vicente Sr&rsquo;s original works were shown at <b><i>Lilok </i></b>(Sculpture), an exhibit dedicated to religious art held in San Beda College Alabang Museum in Muntinlupa. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>WrittenRita S.

Hagonoy, Bulacan 1 May 1944. d. 19 Jul 2006. Painter. He was the son of Jose Victor and Dominga Cadid. As a grader in the Sagrada Familia Elementary School in Hagonoy, Bulacan, he was known as a child crazy about drawing. In high school, he continued to draw from his own imagination. After graduation, when he expressed the wish to pursue an art career, his father objected, thinking that it was neither a practical nor a profitable course. In order to realize his ambition, Phillip became a working student at the University of Santo Tomas, where he took both advertising and painting. It was only later, upon recognizing the seriousness of his purpose, that his father supported his studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even as a young artist, Victor had a highly experimental kind of creativity. To develop his originality, he preferred to work from his own imagination, shunning models and references, even books, and not going out much. He followed a strict and solitary program, most of the time just working with pencil and paper. His creativity never failed him; in one sitting, he could produce a series of 5-10 drawings on oslo paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Constrained by family needs, he worked for a while as production manager at Philprom. But in 1972, he cut his links with advertising to become a full-time artist. It was then that he developed his highly original medium in mixed media of what he called &ldquo;permanent embossed paintings&rdquo; with a three-dimensional effect. This became his well-known Parik-Parik, Palikpik, Pikpik (Parik-Parik, Fins, Pikpik) series. These consisted of white minimalist works with sculptural features and color accents like rainbows or prismatic reflections. The artist pointed out that their whiteness was not that of snow but of the fishponds of his hometown. In these highly original works of a total concept, he first worked with a solid wood base which he sculpted with wood-carving tools to bring out hollows and mounds, and other convex and concave features, according to his conceived design of a particular painting. This done, he took the solid piece of canvas and glued it onto the wood base in a flawless technique, leaving no folds or wrinkles but creating a fluid undulating surface that becomes the landscape. He first exhibited this series at the Luz Gallery in 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his subsequent shows at the Luz Gallery where he had held five one-person shows (the last in 1991)&mdash;as well as his other shows at the Rear Room, 1981; Galerie Bleue, 1985; and Lopez Museum, 1988&mdash;Victor became increasingly experimental, turning to installations. In one work he attached a branch of driftwood like a lively calligraphic line on the frame of his canvas. He also incorporated mobiles, as well as streamers of white transparent plastic to suggest raindrops on his white landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Victor won several times in various art competitions, with seven of them coming from the Art Association of the Philippines, including best entry for <b><i>Alon Panik Panik at Palikpik</i></b> (Wave, To Go Up and Fins), 1982, and a prize for abstract painting in 1983. He participated in about 200 group exhibitions, 12 of them held abroad, and a total of 14 solo shows, one of which was held in New York in Oct 2003. He was also an important member of two local art groups: the Hagonoy Art Group and the Lakan Sining ng Bulacan, where he served as president. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

Painter, sculptor, and installation, fiber, and performance artist. He was the son of Pedro Corpuz Villa and Prisca Gorospe. Villa earned his undergraduate degree in education at the San Francisco Art Institute, 1961, and his master of fine arts at Mills College, Oakland, California, 1963. His earliest influence and tutor in art was a cousin, Leo Gorospe Valledor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villa began his professional practice primarily driven by a minimalist abstract aesthetic before developing a deep interest in exploring how traditional cultures manifest resistance to the influences of colonialism. Villa initially painted in an abstract expressionist vein, eventually shifting to a more multidimensional and transmedia practice. His visual language would expand by way of infusions of materials like blood, bones, feathers, saliva, semen, teeth, hair, glass shards, bronze plates, and the artist&rsquo;s own scratched inscriptions tracking the human in the everyday. Villa would frequently apply these trace materials and physical marking on unstretched support which would sometimes get turned into cloaks or coats, along with other ritual garment accoutrements to construct a language of becoming rather than one that aspired to a static authenticity. Villa&rsquo;s use of various membranes that alluded to skin and a put-on or built-up sense of self had constructivist equivalents. His installations would often be made up of cabinets, coffins, and doors&mdash;boxes and containers which were read as having identitarian and navigational innuendos. These enclosures were also intended to be read as spaces pregnant with possibility and the unexpected because they were objects that could be opened up to reveal what was inside. Not being inclined to the overtly political, Villa also painted straitlaced grids which were destabilized organically by such phenomenon as warping brought on by heat or cold. It was through such process-based aspects of his work that Villa played up imprecisions, as surfaces produced in standardized dimensions would give way to corrosive elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villa&rsquo;s early minimalist phase was spent in New York where he began exhibiting professionally in 1958. He had his first solo exhibition at the Poindexter Gallery, New York, in 1967. His return to California engendered a noticeable shift in his work as he encountered Chicano and specifically El Movimiento members Rene Ya&ntilde;ez, Rupert Garcia, and Amalia Mesa-Baines, artists and thinkers who took their creative practice into the barrios. On top of these engagements, Villa was also doing an art residency at Telegraph Hill Center amidst students from African-American and Asian families. Taken together, these circumstances exposed him to ideas such as &ldquo;the recuperation of heritage&rdquo; and <i>rasquache</i> or the making of new culture from the &ldquo;shards of old culture.&rdquo; These would inform his practice progressively particularly in shifting to a mode of community action he would locate within the stream of performance art via Joseph Beuys&rsquo;s notion of social sculpture. In Villa&rsquo;s case, action translated to organizing within the circles he moved in, and this included putting together overtly art historical projects such as the canon-challenging &ldquo;Rehistoricizing the Time around Abstract Expressionism: Late 1950s to Late 1960s,&rdquo; done in 2005-7 with another iteration in 2010, as well as the four-part seminal 1988-92 symposium series and publication <b><i>Worlds in Collision: Dialogues on Multicultural Art Issues</i></b>, 1995. These ventures, which Villa called art actions, were preceded by undertakings such as &ldquo;Multicultural Symposium: Agenda for the 1990s&rdquo; at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI), 1989. Pursued alongside his pedagogical practice at SFAI among other institutions he taught in, Villa became keen on excavating community social histories and overlooked or unarticulated art histories of artists of color, of women, and groups not legible in mainstream narratives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even while cultivating a multifaceted practice that went beyond object-making, Villa did still keep visible within the parameters of the art world. His exhibitions would often consist of conceptual allusions to the backdoor or impeded entry of migrants, specifically the Filipino <i>manong</i> generation and their desire to be regarded as gentlemen all spruced up in suits and bowler hats as they came off the fields doing menial labor. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> illustrative example of his process-based constructions possibly alluding to such aspirational mobilities is the 1999-2004 <b><i>Campo Santos</i></b> consisting of makeshift ladders hanging from tree branches in a non-gallery/museum location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villa&rsquo;s other solo exhibitions include those at the Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 1973; the American Academy, Rome, 1988; and a major retrospective at the Hearst Art Gallery, 2007. Villa showed with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a> in <b><i>Colonialism, Immigration and Manongs</i></b>, 2000, Pacific Bridge Gallery, and in <b><i>Memories of Overdevelopment: Philippine Diaspora in Contemporary Visual Art</i></b>, 1996, University of California at Irvine Fine Arts Gallery. Other group shows were at Spatsa Gallery, 1958; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1960, 1976-77, and 1982; the Houston Museum of Contemporary Art, 1963; Noah Goldowsky Gallery, 1964 and 1967; Park Place Gallery, 1965, 1966, and 1968; the Oakland Museum, 1971 and 1996; Whitney Museum of American Art and the De Young Museum, 1972; Krannert Art Gallery, 1974; Hayward Art Gallery, 1987; the Havana Biennial, 1989; INTAR Gallery, 1990; the Museo de Bellas Artes, Chile, 1991; Bomani Gallery and Galeria Likovnih Umetnosti Slovenj Gradec, 1997; and the Triton Museum, 1999 and 2006. Villa&rsquo;s pieces are in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Crocker Art Gallery, among others. His performances include <b><i>Manila</i></b> <b><i>Gorilla from Manila</i></b>, 1989, Jennifer Pauls Gallery, and <b><i>Doin&rsquo; the Do</i></b>, 1990, California Wig Shop, again in reference to the off-duty dressing up of the manong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from his toggling between teaching and making art and engaging in what historian Mark Dean Johnson calls &ldquo;archive activism,&rdquo; Villa was also one of an early generation of artist-curators. He co-curated <b><i>International Hotel</i></b>, 1994, at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and <b><i>Other Sources: An American <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\"><strong>Essay</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1975,<b><i> </i></b>at the San Francisco Art Institute. <b><i>Other Sources</i></b> particularly enabled Villa&rsquo;s long-term goal of pitting academe vis-&agrave;-vis street scholars on Third World art, this time on the occasion of the American bicentennial of independence. Villa also co-curated <b><i>Sister City Sisters: San Francisco Babaylan</i></b>, 1998, one of the few but seminal stagings of diasporic Filipino-American work, first mounted at the San Francisco State University Gallery then at the Museo ng Maynila. Villa also collaborated with the art collective Mail Order Brides / M.O.B. in <b><i>Chatsilog</i></b>, 2010, a video installation project that physically brought together the four &ldquo;talking heads&rdquo; who at the time were living out of four distinct locations but virtually caught on TV monitors at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a>. Through his senior years and over a period of four decades, Villa taught at the painting and interdisciplinary departments of the San Francisco Art Institute, which was later renamed the California School of Fine Arts. It was in this teaching context that he influenced artists such as Jenifer Wofford, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5367\"><strong>Jessica Hagedorn</strong></a>, and Manuel Ocampo. Villa received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts, 2012, and was also awarded grants by the National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1158\"><strong>Endo</strong></a>wment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. <em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written byEileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Archives of American Art 2015; Gonzalves 2011; Villa 2015.</p>\r\n"

Vigan, Ilocos Sur 1 Sep 1797. d. 23 Jan 1878. Painter. He was the son of Placido Villanueva and Tulia Pichay. He was a successful entrepreneur who was known for the set of 14 paintings depicting the Ambaristo rebellion known today as the Basi Revolt. The <b><i>Basi Revolt</i></b> paintings are presently kept at the Burgos Museum of the Filipinas Foundation Inc, Vigan, Ilocos Sur. They were painted in 1821, commissioned by the Spanish government to remind the locals about the bloody consequences of the revolt and discourage future rebellion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To raise revenues, the Spanish colonial government established in 1785 a monopoly of <i>basi</i> or sugarcane wine. The imposition was resented, for the Filipinos were accustomed to a hearty enjoyment of their homemade wines. On 16 Sep 1807, the people of Piddig, Ilocos Norte, took up arms. This revolt quickly ignited the neighboring towns. The basi warriors were later crushed, their forces scattered and their leaders hanged. What began in true fervor ended in crushing defeat that no small quaff of the basi could quench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Basi Revolt</i></b> paintings chronicled the event from the Spanish point of view. In sequence, the paintings show the following scenes: <i>alcalde mayor</i> (mayor) Juan Yba&ntilde;ez and local troops at vigil; Yba&ntilde;ez calling the chiefs of Bantay, San Vicente, and Santa Catalina; the chiefs of Candon and Santiago being reprimanded for tardiness; rebels of Ilocos Norte marching to Ilocos Sur; troops being sent to confront the rebels; an arrested rebel dying of lashing; Vigan troops being sent to repel enemies; natives fleeing to Bantay Church; bloody battle being waged at Bantaoay; dead rebels being buried; Spanish victory coming on 7 Sep 1807; convicts being brought to the gallows; rebel leaders being hanged; and the condemned being decapitated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villanueva did not take formal lessons in an established artistic tradition, which can perhaps explain the naive style and the use of flat perspective. He derived artistic devices from those in his environment. He stylized clouds in the manner of the carved <b>santo</b><i> </i>(religious image). He used the hierarchical perspective where principal figures, the Spaniards, loom largely over dwarflike commoners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the paintings were commissioned initially as a means for propaganda, an alternative interpretation involving local resistance is possible. The inclusion of Halley&rsquo;s comet in the painting has been considered by others as Villanueva&rsquo;s subtle message of urging the people to keep fighting and to hope for victory, for in local belief, a comet signifies the coming of a revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Restoration efforts have been recently concentrated on the <b><i>Basi Revolt</i></b> paintings, which have been damaged severely due to neglect and previous restoration efforts, to retain its authentic appearance and determine the original materials used by Villanueva. The procedure also aims to uncover possible hidden meanings that have been overlooked or were unclear before. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Olongapo, Zambales 25 Jun 1947. d. 26 Feb 1994. Installation and performance artist, painter, filmmaker. He was the son of Napoleon Villanueva and Trinidad Villanueva. He finished a bachelor of fine arts degree at the University of Santo Tomas in 1973, after which he taught at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University in 1974-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villanueva began as a surrealist painter in the 1970s. When he moved to Baguio City in 1980, he became a founding member and later vice president of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\"><strong>Baguio Arts Guild</strong></a>, which consists of other local artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, and filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\"><strong>Kidlat Tahimik</strong></a>. He has done documentary films like <b><i>Linang</i></b> (Cultivated Field), <b><i>The Ilocano Tradition</i></b>, and <b><i>Runsai</i></b>, all in 1980, for the Council for Living Tradition. In 1983, as a member of the Board of Directors of the United Filmmakers Organization, he did ethnographic films of Cordillera festivals and documentaries on ecology. His documentary <b><i>Bagong Sibol ang Gubat</i></b> (Newly Sprung Is the Forest) won as Best Documentary Film in the Catholic Mass Media Awards, 1980, and the Berlin Film Festival, 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He is known for creating art inspired by and built from the basic materials of the environment. He won critical recognition for <b><i>Archetypes: A Cordillera Labyrinth</i></b> or <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong>Uma ti Biag</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Garden of Life) set up on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) grounds in 1989. The installation, 45 m in diameter and 600 m in length, consisted of a spiral labyrinth made of bamboo and reeds. Its center was covered with rocks from a river bed, creating a space peopled with <b>bulol</b> or spirit figures. Another installation was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> ti Kararua</i></b> (Soul Offerings), consisting of three bamboo floats carrying offerings on a lake for the souls of those who perished in the big Baguio earthquake. His painting <b><i>Pitong Sining</i></b> (Seven Arts), 1990, used naked figures inspired by the<b><i> </i></b>Manunggul jar<b><i> </i></b>rowers, creating a circular group at the center enclosed by three lizards biting each other&rsquo;s tails. Originally used for the Baguio Arts Festival in 1990, it became part of the CCP art collection as a mural installed on the wall of the staircase from the Main Theater lobby to the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino lobby. The image was later used as cover for the <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i></b> (Discovering Art) book and DVD edition, also produced by the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist also incorporated the participation of the locals of Pampanga and conducted a ceremony with a shaman to pacify the spirit of Mount Pinatubo, after its destructive eruption in 1991. In his works, Villanueva sought to restore the communal function of art and its primitive life force and to recover and understand the animism in the heart of Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held at least four solo shows, the first being at the Ateneo Art Gallery in 1972, and participated in more than 50 group shows. In 1990, he was invited to New York as artist in residence of the New York State Council of the Arts. A year later at the Lincoln Square, he performed an indoor installation called <b><i>Surrender to Nature</i></b>, wherein he lit candles while in the middle of a sea of stalks. In an exhibition in Naguri, Japan, he combined Cordillera animism with Shintoism as he placed a bulol on a rushing stream and formed an arch using two reed stalks. He participated in the first Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art in Brisbane, Australia, in 1993, where he created and performed Ego&rsquo;s Grave at a mall&rsquo;s courtyard. As one of his last major installations before his death in 1994, he carved a human figure within a deep pit made of terra-cotta, which he fired and glazed afterward. During his four-month stay in Brisbane, he would perform various ceremonies at the installation site, one of which was an indigenous Australian smoking ritual. He was a Thirteen Artists awardee of the CCP in 1992. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G. Guillermo, updated by Jhoanne Kristine A.

Painter. He married Policarpia Manrique. The artistic education of Vicente Villase&ntilde;or is unknown, but it is a fact that there had been icon painters in Lucban as early as the 1820s. By the 1870s, portraiture was also a firmly established craft in Lucban. The writer Juan Alvarez Guerra in <b><i>De Manila a Tayabas</i></b>, 1878, wrote: &ldquo;If you want a portrait while passing by Lucban, have no fear for you shall have one. There are <i>indios </i>(native Christians) in this vicinity who will capture you in oil, just having seen you once.&rdquo; This statement might have been primarily alluding to Vicente Villase&ntilde;or.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villase&ntilde;or did several religious paintings but he was best known for his portraits. In the latter, his work does not exhibit the detailed style of Manila&rsquo;s miniaturists nor the solid modeling of the products of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura. Nevertheless, he depicted resemblances as closely as his skills allowed and enhanced the personality of his sitters with objects that reflected their status, a convention he certainly observed in city portraits. His self-portrait, 1860, shows him garbed in a pale violet-brown coat and dark necktie. His features show him to be of Chinese descent, their delicateness suggesting his sensitivity as a youth immersed in art. In 1870, he painted the portrait of his wife Policarpia. Striking for its vibrancy brought about by the realistic rendition of her engaging gaze and her palpably soft, full chin, this piece followed portraiture conventions. Her right arm is propped on a table while her left holds a handkerchief to suggest that she comes from an influential family. The presence of the puppy at her right makes this piece unique among all 19th-century portraits. Villase&ntilde;or also painted the portraits of Antonio Limcuico and Feliciana Dollosa Limcuico, both in 1882, and Bartola Estrella. All his known paintings are on panel, except <b><i>Bartola Estrella</i></b>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Painter. She is the daughter of Zacarias Josep Villaver and Ester Suico. Her father and grandfather are musicians. She studied fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) Cebu from 1977 to 1982, and was mentored by Professor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\"><strong>Martino Abellana</strong></a>. Her engagements revolve around art education, being an art teacher at various schools such as St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College in 1988, St. Benedict Learning Center in Cebu City in 1983-84, and the Learning Tree at Quezon City in 2002-8. She was also an art professor and coordinator at the fine arts program of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan College in 2004-8. From 1982 to 2012, Villaver conducted art workshops in Cebu, Leyte, Metro Manila, Cotabato, Baguio, and Osijek, Croatia. She is also a choreographer, Bible study facilitator, and curator.

The works embody a worldview born from steadfast faith accounts in calm yet bright colors on themes mainly surrounding childhood. Villaver, however, does not wholly stay within what would be construed as the perspective of an innocent and pure child as demonstrated by works like <b><i>Rugby Boy&mdash; A Death Sentence</i></b>, 2009, which includes the image of a drugged boy whose presence reaffirms that despite a childlike sensibility, the artist possesses an awareness of corruption that cannot be ignored even as it remains on the sidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villaver believes that her exhibitions were &ldquo;born of interactions with individuals and communities&rdquo; (Villaver 2014).

Laoag, Ilocos Sur 8 Mar 1898. d. Iligan City 8 Jun 1989. Painter. He studied at the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion in Vigan. At 17, he decided to devote his life to painting, taking private lessons with Jose G. de Ocampo, a classical and figurative painter. In 1917, he left the Philippines for San Francisco where he studied at the California School of Fine Arts and took further studies in Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1924. After a brief stay in the United States, he went to France to pursue his art at the Academie des Beaux-Arts de Montmartre in 1926. Through all the years, he kept his Filipino citizenship. He died on his last visit to the Philippines in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His earliest paintings date back to the 1930s and were of the French working class in the Depression years. He engaged in painting portraits during World War II when he was interned in a concentration camp in France. After the war, he painted still lifes and abstracts, showing the influence of Jacques Villon and his circle, who had earlier established themselves in Puteaux where Vitalis put up his studio. It was in Puteaux that he also met a few modernist artists, one of whom was Pablo Picasso. He met Picasso at a restaurant owned by his friend Camille Renault, who let him stay there. <b><i>Dining Chez Camille Renault </i></b>(Dining at Camille Renault&rsquo;s) marks the peak of his Paris years, when he worked in Renault&rsquo;s restaurant which exhibited his paintings on its walls. The painting shows the influence of impressionism, although subsequently his works became more prismatic with interpenetrating planes of blues and yellows. From the 1960s, landscapes dominated his works as he settled in Plestin-les-Greves, a village in Brittany, Northern France. In 1963, he resumed contact with the country of his birth through the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> which visited France and facilitated his first visit to the Philippines. He exhibited at the National Library in Manila&mdash;where his featured works were mostly spiritual and religious&mdash;sponsored by the French ambassador Francois Brier. Back in France, he pursued his prismatism in a number of landscapes of the period, at the same time that he took up religious themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon his return there in Plestin-les-Greves, he was commissioned by the Municipal Council to paint a mural for the Plestin Town Hall and the Maison de Retraite. In 1975, he was cited by then Plestin mayor Marcel Harmon as &ldquo;the only honorary citizen&rdquo; of the town at an event where his works were exhibited. In 1981, his works were featured, along with the paintings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3752\"><strong>Nena Saguil</strong></a> and Ofelio Gelvezon-Tequi, at an exhibition called <b><i>Six Artistes Contemporains Philippins en Europe</i></b> in Paris. A year later, during his 84th birthday celebration, the Community of Plestin presented Vitalis with an oak bust carved by Breton sculptor Lucien Prigent. In 1984, he opened a retrospective exhibition in Plestin, featuring his works which spanned 50 years. It was also in that same year that he received an award of excellence from the Institut Academique de Paris for his painting La Cr&ecirc;perie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, he visited Manila for his first retrospective exhibition at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Main Gallery. He went to Iligan City after the show, where he was able to paint a few more works. These paintings were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila in 1987 and at the Finale Art File in 1988. His works can be viewed at the Lopez Museum, Pasig City. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G. Guillermo, updated by Jhoanne Kristine A.

Vitug is the founder of the artist initiative Re: Source Art and Development, which is dedicated to collaborating with local communities and nonprofit organizations to help realize advocacy goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vitug&rsquo;s art practice encompasses painting, performance art, video art, installation art, and socially engaged art. He also curates and writes about art, and has worked as an art teacher. The forms in which Vitug&rsquo;s works come significantly vary since this is a result of his deliberating upon the best medium to use for expressing a certain idea. Even as a painting major in college, he joined Sining Tanghalan, a St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College theater group, which prepared him for the performance art he would take up later in his practice. His earlier paintings, which were heavily influenced by his lahar experience, were made with a limited palette of mostly earth colors. These days, however, his paintings at times include brighter colors reminiscent of the neon lights found in Las Vegas. Some paintings he has done are a combination of abstraction and realism, including works in <b><i>Suspending This Belief</i></b>, 2005. The paintings in the 2014 exhibition <b><i>Terra Infirma </i></b>are realistic renditions of satellite imagery showing the effects of oil spills, nuclear tests, and other environmental catastrophes, which appear as abstract elements in his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His solo shows in the Philippines include <b><i>Suspending This Belief</i></b>, 2005, Big &amp; Small Art Gallery; <b><i>I Painted the Presidents</i></b>, 2005, Dateline Gallery, Cubao Shoe Expo; <b><i>Lessons from the Masters</i></b>, 2005, CCP; <b><i>Source of Living</i></b>, 2010, Pablo Gallery; and <b><i>The Truns</i></b>, 2011, Manila Contemporary. In Las Vegas, his solo exhibitions include <b><i>How To&rsquo;s</i></b>, 2012, CCP; <b><i>Before/After: Nuclear Weapons Testing Legacy</i></b>, 2012, Fifth Wall Gallery; <b><i>Casino Capital</i></b>, 2013, Momas and Dadas Project House; <b><i>Wasteland/Oasis</i></b>, 2013, Fifth Wall Gallery; and <b><i>Terra Infirma</i></b>, 2014, Left of the Center Gallery. Vitug has also shown in group exhibitions in Japan and Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vitug&rsquo;s first significant art citation came in 1991 when he represented the Philippines in Geneva, Switzerland, as the Philippine Red Cross Painting Competition first place winner. As a college student from 1994 to 1998, he was a consistent finalist in various painting competitions. He won awards at the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Art Competition: honorable mention in 1998, third prize for representational painting in 1999, and the Leo Benesa Award for Art Criticism in 2003. The Philippine Art Awards recognized him thrice as a finalist&mdash;from 2000 to 2003. Vitug became a CCP Thirteen Artists awardee in 2006. He received grants from the Nevada Art Council Jackpot Award in 2010 and 2012 and he was also part of the Metro Arts Council of Southern Nevada&rsquo;s Zap! Public Art Project, 2010. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byIris S. De Ocampo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Guimba, Nueva Ecija 18 Jul 1952. Painter. He is the son of Nicodemus P. Wilwayco and Josefina Cinense. He is the nephew of fashion designer Tente Wilwayco, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3814\"><strong>Ramon Valera</strong></a>. He took up continental design studies in Los Angeles, California, 1968, and earned a bachelor of fine arts at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, 1972. Wilwayco received the British Council Scholarship for Painting at the West Surrey College of Art and Design in Farnham, England, 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wilwayco looks to music and his strong sense of faith as his inspirations. He has a penchant for the orchestral and his works are described as &ldquo;nothing short of symphonic&rdquo; (Magsaysay 2014). This affinity to the spiritual and musical is best exemplified in his works <b><i>River Circles</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2010; shaped screens called <b><i>Birds of Paradise</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1995; and <b><i>Second Nature</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011. There are also direct references to music such as <b><i>Homage to Bach</i></b>, 2010;<i> <b>Homage to Vivaldi</b></i>,<b><i> </i></b>2010; and <b><i>Silent Music</i></b>, 2006. These works are marked by their particular use of color and brushstrokes evoking either grand or subdued sounds. In <b><i>Well Tempered Clavier </i></b>(from<i> <b>Homage to Bach</b></i>), muted colors are given hints of brightness and minute movements. Within the stately stillness is a spirit that wishes to be unleashed from its frame. This evokes the mathematical precision and organization, as well as spirituality and a certain joie de vivre of Bach&rsquo;s compositions. While the works possess their earthly overtones, it would be difficult not to be lifted and to see the metaphysical in Wilwayco&rsquo;s works. His appropriation of Filipino motifs, as with the bold colors and dynamic geometrical configurations of <b><i>Birds of Paradise</i></b> and <b><i>Second Nature</i></b>, and<b><i> </i></b>combining these with his eclectic experience and education has enabled Wilwayco&rsquo;s paintings to contribute to the lineage of vibrant abstract expressionist works in the Philippines. Wilwayco himself cites <b><i>Hanger Wires</i></b>,<i> <b>Cathedrals</b></i>, <b><i>Jeepney Fantasia</i></b>, <b><i>Heliconias</i></b><i> <b>and Birds of Paradise</b></i>,<i> <b>In Nature&rsquo;s Realm</b></i>, 2012, and <b><i>Recalibrations</i></b>,<i> </i>2014, as some of his landmark series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1976 to 2012, he exhibited widely in the Philippines as well as internationally in sites like Providence, Rhode Island, Paris, France, and Essen, Germany. Among these solo exhibitions are<b> <i>Images of Exuberance</i></b>, 1976, at Hidalgo Gallery, Philippines; <b><i>Gaudeamus</i></b>, 2006, at St. Kamillus Centre, Essen, Germany; <b><i>Silent Music</i></b>, 2006, at Galerie Etienne de Causans, Paris; and<b> <i>Homage to Gluck</i></b>, 2009, at BankRI Gallery, Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Wilwayco received an Award of Excellence for his UP Fine Arts thesis in 1972, the Italian government scholarship for painting in 1982, the Achievements Award from the Mees Music Foundation of Guimba Inc, and the UP Alpha Omega Fraternity <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong></a> Run Award for visual arts in 2003.

Quezon City 4 Aug 1974. Visual artist. Her parents are Relly Yan and Susana Valera. Yan-Santos graduated with a degree in painting from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> in 1995. She taught studio courses at the same college from 1997 to 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yan-Santos explores art and womanhood through a wide range of creative methods and forms. A highly skilled printmaker and painter, she combines mediums such as stencils, collage, serigraphy, image transfer, and painting to mount installation pieces that often incorporate wall-bound works, video, and sound. Her works are highly tactile, meticulously rendered, and thoughtfully assembled. She explores the links between materials and attendant techniques, the potency of image, the codes of language, and the immersive potential of three-dimensional forms in space. She explores her life as a woman artist across themes of femininity, domesticity, and child-rearing. Her recollections are far from sentimental; they are serene and incisive explorations of her inner and outer worlds and the self that is realized in between these spheres. Drawing from her personal life, the artist also succeeds in involving us in the act of recollection by expanding how we grasp memory through mundane acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yan-Santos has exhibited solo since 2002 at various local galleries and museums, delving into themes close to hearth, bringing depth and uncommon insight into what has come to be accepted as commonplace. In her exhibition <b><i>Imperfections</i></b>, 2013,<b> </b>at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a> Museum in Baguio, period furniture was encased in pages taken from old school textbooks. The furniture set with their low seats and turned legs hark back to the past as did paintings of kitchenware, a wooden toy, the skeletal frame of a lamp that all show wear from the passage of time. The artist rendered these pieces and domestic scenes devoid of nostalgia for the past, highlighting instead current predicaments about education and womanhood. Her work therefore attempts to elevate the ordinary into the realm of deep thought and the everyday to the sphere of larger beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Group exhibitions she participated in include the 5th Mondial Triennale of small-sized prints in France in 2000, Art Beijing in 2008, Art Stage Singapore in 2013, and Art Basel Hong Kong in 2013. Philippine exhibitions include <b><i>Sungduan 4: Extensions at the Museum of Three Cultures</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Cagayan de Oro, and <b><i>Postcards from the Philippines</i></b>, Utterly Art Gallery, Singapore, 2007.

Manila 24 May 1924. d. Oct 1994. Illustrator, cartoonist, painter. He was married to Vitaliana &ldquo;Betty&rdquo; Dagani, and father of their 13 children. He graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in fine arts from the University of the Philippines (UP) on a Ramon Roces scholarship. When he was a small boy in grade school, he did pencil drawings of the dominant images of the media and cinema, cowboys and film stars, such as Janet Gaynor and Shirley Temple. He also enjoyed copying characters from the comics such as Captain Marvel. His schooling was interrupted by the World War II. After the war in 1947, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\"><strong>Ramon Roces Publications</strong></a> was in need of artists to illustrate the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> magazine. It held a national art contest and created scholarships for the top 10 artists to study for a year at the UP School of Fine Arts. Yonzon belonged to the first batch of scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yonzon worked at the <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and the <b><i>Evening News</i></b> for one year and then became the first artist of the advertising agency Philprom. At Philprom from 1947 to 1950, he worked with artist colleagues <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a> and Slim Torres. When his boss, A.G. Palileo, put up Adcraft, he brought Yonzon with him as artist. There he worked for more than 10 years and in 1960 transferred to the Philippine Advertising Counsellors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yonzon&rsquo;s break as an artist came when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3414\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Lyd Arguilla</strong></a></strong></a>, founder of the Philippine Art Gallery, commissioned him to do a six-meter long mural for the New York World Fair in 1964. The mural in oil was a panoramic view of Philippine life and culture, focusing on festivals. It was the same international fair which featured carved panels representing episodes of Philippine history designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> and executed by Paete artists. In the Philippine Pavilion, which was shaped like a rounded nipa hut, Francisco&rsquo;s panels were on the ground floor and Yonzon&rsquo;s mural was displayed in circular form around the central beam of the second floor. Other artists who exhibited their works were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J.

His second was held the following year. His sixth and last one-man exhibit was held at the Lopez Museum in 1989, which featured figurative oil paintings, a diversion from his cubist-neorealist style. Aside from painting in oil, he did significant work in cartoons and caricature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His works often show a tension between the conservative and the modern. Being versatile, he also had the tendency to work in different styles, so that an exhibit of his can give the impression of a five-person show. Later, however, he settled for one style, cubist of influence, as in Manansala and the Neo-Realists, and maintained a preference for acrylic as medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He received awards from the Art Association of the Philippines: sixth prize, painting, <b><i>Squatters</i></b>, 1949; first prize, caricature, <b><i>Cuenco</i></b>, 1951; honorable mention, modern category, <b><i>Tindahang Sari-sari</i></b> (Variety Store), 1952; first prize, photography, <b><i>Still Water</i></b>, 1953; first prize, photography, <b><i>Scat</i></b>, 1953; first prize, painting, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/898\"><strong>Harana</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(Serenade), 1954; and third prize, painting, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong>Procession</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 1955.

Manila 3 Jan 1978. Painter, photographer, installation artist. She is the daughter of Rogelio Yu and Hannah So. She graduated with a fine arts degree from the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yu&rsquo;s practice spans a variety of media including painting, photography, video, installation, and elements of performance. The visual impact of her works is heightened by its conceptual power. She is known for her drip paintings, which she began doing in 2000. Grappling with chance and control, Yu allows paint to fall onto canvas to create linear patterns and multiple color combinations. Her drip paintings transcend the usual support of the canvas, dripping on to plinths or splattering upon a building&rsquo;s columns. <b><i>If You Could Hear a Pin Drop</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>White Elephant</i></b><i> </i>consist of drip paintings and video that challenge the viewer&rsquo;s perception and reveal the immaterial aspects of the works.<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a photographer, Yu counts on her discerning eye&rsquo;s inclination toward the commonplace. Her works reconcile binaries and contradictions in everyday surroundings as in the photographs that made up the exhibitions <b><i>Common/Oddities</i></b><i> </i>at Silverlens Galleries and <b><i>Subject/Object</i></b><i> </i>at Mag:Net, 2009. She draws upon photography&rsquo;s documentary capability while underscoring her subjective inclinations as an image-maker. She defamiliarizes found objects, recognizes various configurations amid &ldquo;visual garbage,&rdquo; and captures recurring texts and images on the streets. Yu continues to explore various ways of presenting photographs, turning to the light box, to wall paper, or to do-it-yourself photo books as in <b><i>Thoughts Collected, Recollected</i></b>, 2007. An early work titled <b><i>Cool Pieties</i></b>, 2001,<i> </i>is made up of a thousand multi-exposed photographs occupying the entire wall of a gallery. <b><i>18th Ave Kodakan</i></b><i> </i>(18th Ave Picture Taking),<i> </i>2004,<i> </i>consists of 200 photographs of<i> </i>the artist posing with residents and bystanders along a street in Cubao. The work literally gives viewers a glimpse of the artist and her process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Her solo exhibitions include <b><i>Landpaintings</i></b>,<i> </i>Silverlens Galleries, Makati City, 2014; <b><i>Left of Here</i></b>, West Gallery, Quezon City, 2013; <b><i>Miscellaneous</i></b>,<i> </i>Galeri Canna, Jakarta, Indonesia, 2012; <b><i>Inventory</i></b>,<i> </i>Galerie Zimmermann-Kratochwill, Graz, Austria, 2011; <b><i>If You Could Hear a Pin Drop</i></b>,<i> </i>West Gallery, Quezon City, and <b><i>Waste Not, Want Not</i></b>, Finale Art File, Makati City, 2010.

Sculptor and painter. He is the son of Jose Palma Yuson and Carmen Sison. He took up fine arts, major in sculpture, at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts in 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As part of a postwar generation of sculptors influenced by abstraction and modernism and deviating from the representational tradition of large monumental commissions, Yuson&rsquo;s works emphasize the abstraction of form and the qualities of the material itself. Yuson&rsquo;s earlier sculptural pieces exhibit a strong sense of minimalism, stressing the physicality of industrial and natural media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since 2005, Yuson has increasingly moved away from creating discrete abstract objects and explored how sculpture redefines the viewer&rsquo;s experience of the surrounding space, such as gallery or outdoor areas. <b><i>Site+Works</i></b>, 2005, marked this engagement with physical site through an installation that explored the use of reflective surfaces and materials, such as black auto paint and sheet metal, as means to make objects engage with their surroundings. Another solo exhibition, <b><i>R. Muck</i></b>, 2010, featured parabolic black bobs fabricated from fiberglass scattered across the gallery floors and walls in random clusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the early 2000s, Yuson has created large-scale public art projects and sculptural commissions. His corporate commissions include works for Greenbelt Makati, 2003; Fort Bonifacio High Street <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> Park, Taguig, 2006-7; the Renaissance Harbor View Hotel, Hong Kong, 2007; Marquee Mall Civic Plaza, Pampanga, 2009; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, 2011; and The Mind Museum, Taguig, 2011-12. Among these commissions are <b><i>Specific Gravity</i></b>, a boulder fountain comprised of an immense and apparently heavy mass suspended in air, precariously propped up by gently sloping steel rods, and <b><i>Hearsay</i></b>, composed of twisted industrial pipes through which sounds travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yuson held his first solo exhibition at UP and has since then held exhibitions of his sculptures, paintings, drawings, and furniture sculptures at the West Gallery, Pinto Art Galllery, Mag:net Gallery, ART Forum Gallery, Singapore, and Manila Contemporary. His works have been included in group exhibitions in the Philippines, Hong Kong, and France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yuson was a member of the Art Association of the Philippines, 1993; the Society of Philippine Sculptors, 1993-2000; and the Philippine Native Plants Conservation Society Inc, from 2011 to present.

Quezon City 19 Nov 1978. He is the son of Benjamin Zafra and Evelinda Palomer. He studied fine arts, major in painting, at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a> (UP CFA) from 1996 to 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zafra was among the students mentored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> at the UP CFA in the late 1990s. Exposed to conceptual and experimental ways of art-making through his participation in group shows such as <b><i>Racing Thoughts</i></b>, 1999, at the West Gallery, Zafra started his long-running <b><i>Objects/Medium</i></b> project, where he uses real objects, such as bullets or bottles, as both media and subject for drawing. This formal exploration of materials and process later merged with sociopolitical commentary in the series Headshot, 2008, and Killing Box, 2010, where Zafra uses M-16 bullets as drawing tools on sandpaper to create portraits in response to the extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances of Philippine activists and journalists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More broadly associated with Zafra are his &ldquo;skull paintings,&rdquo; which he produces using animal and human bones and sandpaper. For his undergraduate thesis work <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2129\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2129\"><strong>Argument from Nowhere</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2000, Zafra repeatedly scraped a human skull on three sandpaper panels, producing an abstract painting by grinding the form into powder residue, and documenting the process through video. The work was later exhibited at the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, in 2009 and at the <b><i>3rd</i> <i>Mediations Biennale</i></b>, 2012, at the National Museum of Poznan, Poland. This process is echoed in the works <b><i>No. 80 Versus Complex</i></b>, 2001, and <b><i>Aso&rsquo;t Pusa </i></b>(Dog and Cat), 2013, where the skulls of a dog and a cat are ground upon two acrylic cubes covered with sandpaper. This process-centric mode of work extended to employing the artist&rsquo;s own body in 2006, when Zafra started producing nail portraits using his own fingernails abraded against sandpaper to produce a series of portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first solo exhibition, <b><i>Destroy, Erase, Improve</i></b>, 2001, at Big Sky Mind and his second solo exhibition, <b><i>Paper Trails</i></b>, 2006, at Future Prospects. Since then, he has held solo exhibitions at West Gallery, Nova Gallery, Mo Space, West Gallery, and Finale Art File. He has been part of numerous group exhibitions since 1997, including <b><i>Bisa: Potent Presences</i></b>, 2011, at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila and <b><i>The Topology of Signs</i></b>, 1999, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>.

These include <b><i>Thrice upon a Time</i></b>, 2009, at the Singapore Art Museum and <b><i>Crossing Space</i></b>, 2013, in Albert Schweizer Schule, Hanover, Germany. Zafra was a finalist in the 2011 Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Tanaw Art Competition.

Lucban, Quezon 24 Sep 1930. d. Lucena City 10 Jul 2010. Painter. He was the son of Eladio S. Zalameda and Julia Deveza. Finishing his bachelor of fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas in 1950, he went abroad to further his studies at the Art Students League of California, the Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-Arts, and Paris-Sorbonne University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zalameda&rsquo;s early works are exemplified in two watercolors: <b><i>After the Rain</i></b> and <b><i>Still Life</i></b>. <b><i>After the Rain</i></b> is essentially a representational work showing two women at the center, their backs to the viewer as if about to cross what appears to be a rain-soaked street. The pavement that occupies the foreground glistens with rain. The other side of the street is rendered impressionistically, with the buildings foreshortened to give the painting a pleasant sense of depth. The watercolor technique is used for both representational and stylistic effect. The rendition of the street, on the other hand, with an explicit reference to its Chinese name locates the scene. <b><i>Still Life</i></b> shows Zalameda experimenting with cubism. A few lines are made to suggest the shape of a bottle, a fish, an old dish, and a fruit. The lines of the fish crisscross with those of the bottle, thus negating the work&rsquo;s realism. The conciseness of the forms also give the painting an Oriental minimalist feel. In the 1960s, Zalameda&rsquo;s shapes became bolder. In <b><i>Sailboats</i></b>, 1964, the artist&rsquo;s juxtaposition of bold colors transforms his sails of boats and the blue sea into an abstract pattern. From the 1970s onward, bold shapes of loud colors were used by the artist to execute genre scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the artist&rsquo;s most prestigious shows was his exhibition at the National Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City, 1965. He also held exhibitions at the Malaca&ntilde;an Palace, 1966, and the Palace Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zalameda received numerous awards and citations, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the French government.

His father was himself an engraver and maintained a shop where his children had their first lessons in the art of engraving. Zamora went to a school directed by the schoolmaster Jose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>. His father, seeing the boy&rsquo;s unusual interest in his art and business, sent him to the Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado in Intramuros. He studied painting under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\"><strong>Lorenzo Rocha</strong></a>, then director of the school, and engraving under MelecioFigueroa, an accomplished artist who had just arrived from the Peninsula. For three years, 1890-93, Zamora studied assiduously in the school while gaining much practical knowledge in his father&rsquo;s shop. He also studied at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios where he learned casting under RamonMartinez while simultaneously serving as an assistant to Professor Campa. After graduation from the Escuela, he joined his father&rsquo;s establishment on Crespo (now Hidalgo) St. He was 24 years old when his galvano-plated bust of Father Anaya, <i>cantor</i> (singer) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, was awarded a prize in the Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (Philippine Regional Exposition) in 1895.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon his father&rsquo;s death, he took over the engraving business, manufacturing with bare hands and inadequate handmade tools. He made insignias, buttons, and other military decorations for the revolutionary army. During the American period, his business grew steadily, enabling him to acquire and import modern machinery from abroad. During this time he had no strong competitor in the field, thus allowing his enterprise to prosper.

His image-making shifted to a definitively more tactile phase when he embarked on graduate studies in Missouri, and as he reckoned with the American state&rsquo;s seminal role in the 1904 Saint Louis World Exposition. This phase in his practice is marked by a more acute sense of the meaning-making potentials of memorial residue that could be activated by manipulating such historically charged materials as anecdotes of racial slurs, dog treats, ash, food, a marching ditty, soap, and subtle references to American consumerism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among his solo exhibitions are <b><i>Laman</i></b> (Flesh), West Gallery, Quezon City, 2001; <b><i>Consisting Upholding</i></b>, Vermont Studio Center, Johnson, Vermont,<b> </b>2002;<b> <i>Consisting Upholding</i></b>, The Corredor, UP, and Ayala Museum, 2003; <b><i>Fine Line</i></b>, West Gallery, 2004; <b><i>Karga </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>d), 2007, West Gallery; <b><i>Banal: Sculptural Meditations on the Unfamiliar </i></b>(Holy: Sculptural Meditations on the Unfamiliar), 2009, George Caleb Bingham Gallery, Columbia, Missouri; <b><i>Out of Ordinary Spectacles</i></b>, 2011, Silverlens, Manila; <b><i>Inconspicuously Consumed</i></b>, 2012, Bliss on Bliss Art Projects, Queens, New York; <b><i>Another Please</i></b>, 2012, Phoenix Gallery, New York; <b><i>Site of Marks</i></b>, 2013, Silverlens; <b><i>Balat</i></b> (Skin), 2013, West Gallery; <b><i>Private Pool</i></b>, 2014, Mo Space, The Fort; and <b><i>Another Other</i></b>, 2014, Ateneo Art Gallery, Quezon City.

He worked closely with the Rodriguez family of printmakers, Lucio Martinez, and VirgilioAviado in graphic arts workshops.

Gapan, Nueva Ecija 29 Sep 1842. d. 5 Mar 1923. Painter. He was the son of Rafael Zaragoza and Gregoria Aranquizna. Attending the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, he obtained a scholarship from the Spanish government, leaving with FelixResurreccionHidalgo for Madrid in 1879. He was one of the illustrators of the deluxe edition of Fr Manuel Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b> (Plants of the Philippines). In 1877, his drawing <b><i>La Lechera</i></b> (The Milkmaid) appeared in <b><i>La Ilustracion del Oriente</i></b>. He refined his painting at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid, 1879-82, and at the satellite academy in Rome, 1882-85. Returning to Manila in 1891, he taught at the Escuela Superior de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado, Ateneo de Manila, and Liceo de Manila. From 1891 to 1895, he wrote more than <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> articles on art, culture, and history, mainly for <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>, published by his brother Jose. In 1908, he became one of the founding members of the faculty of the UP School of Fine Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A typical academic painter of the 19th century, Zaragoza was fond of dark colors and impasto brushwork along the style of the 17th-century Spanish master Velazquez. In 1921 and 1922, however, he experimented with pointillism, applying his paints in tiny specks with a worn-out brush, as in his views of Guimaras at the University of the Philippines Vargas Museum Collection and at the University of Santo Tomas Museum. Most of Zaragoza&rsquo;s work did not survive the World War II. His most famous painting, <b><i>ElVioloncellista</i></b> (The Cellist), 1891, is now at the Malaca&ntilde;an Palace. The Central Bank owns the portrait <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\"><strong>Pedro Paterno</strong></a></i></b>, 1882, and <b><i>El Gobernadorcillo</i></b> (The Mayor), 1891. The Pagrel collection has <b><i>Old Mestiza from Quiapo</i></b>, <b><i>El Lego </i></b>(The Layman), and the portraits <b><i>Manuel Zaragoza</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a>no Santiago</i></b>.

At the Saint Louis Universal Exposition of 1904, he received a gold medal for his overall participation, while individual awards were accorded to specific works&mdash;namely, gold medal for <b><i>Portrait of Fr.

Al Jahara, Kuwait City 15 Sep 1984. Painter and installation artist. He is the son of Angelo Zicarelli and Zenaida Marquez. He spent part of his childhood living in Kuwait and Italy before moving to the Philippines and living in Ilagan, Isabela, and later Manila. He graduated from the University of Santo Tomas with a degree of bachelor of fine arts in advertising. He attributes his body of work to substantial self-training. In 2009, he completed a residency at Point B Work Lodge in Brooklyn, New York. In 2012, he did residencies in Small Projects in Troms&oslash;, Norway, and KINOKINO Air in Sandnes, Norway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zicarelli&rsquo;s drawings, paintings, and sculptural installations feature dark subject matter. He frequently works with graphite on paper. Even while the material is unexceptional, the monochromatic drawings are detailed and laboriously made. The artist&rsquo;s installations, though not as painstakingly crafted, echo the monochrome quality of his graphite drawings in their being chromatically limited to black, white, gray, and glossy silver. Despite the patently distressful tone emanating from Zicarelli&rsquo;s pieces, there is a cleanliness that can similarly be found in the works of other artists who, like Zicarelli, majored in advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2005, Zicarelli participated in shows held in Big Sky Mind, Cubicle Art Gallery, and Goliath Visual Space in Brooklyn, New York. In 2006, he had his first solo show in Cubicle Art Gallery called <b><i>The Ghost and the Holy Abortion: A Leaving Process</i></b>. Over the years, he has also participated in group exhibitions held in Future Prospects Gallery, Art Informal, Blanc Gallery, Gallery Orange, West Gallery, Boston Gallery, Finale Art File, Manila Contemporary, Light and Space Contemporary, Silverlens Galleries, Museo Vicente, and Pinto Art Museum. Outside the Philippines, he has participated in group shows held in Singapore, Beijing, and Kuala Lumpur. He has held two solo shows in his residence: <b><i>I&rsquo;m with Stupid / I&rsquo;m Not with Stupid</i></b>, 2007, and <b><i>I Put Fun Back in Hell</i></b>, 2009. His solo exhibitions in galleries include the following at Art Informal: <b><i>The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste</i></b>, 2009; <b><i>We Are the Kids That Your Parents Warned You About</i></b>, 2010; <b><i>Into the Abyss (Black Album)</i></b>, 2011; and <b><i>Swallowed by Shadows</i></b>, 2012. In Silverlens Galleries, which represents him, he held solo exhibitions such as <b><i>Into the Abyss: (White Album)</i></b>, 2011; <b><i>Empire</i></b>, 2012; and <b><i>As White as Moonlight, as White as Bone, as Dark as the Snake, as Dark as the Throne</i></b>, 2013.

Manila 27 Aug 1924. d. Rome 2 Jun 1984. Painter. He was the son of Enrique Zobel de Ayala and Fermina Montojo. He is the uncle of photographer JaimeZobeldeAyala. When he was nine years old, his family moved back to Europe and stayed in Madrid, Spain. Upon their return to the Philippines in 1936, Zobel studied in De La Salle College and later pursued a pre-med course at the University of Santo Tomas. In 1946, he went on to finish a course in philosophy and letters at Harvard University, USA, graduating magna cum laude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zobel came from a family of artists. Both his father and grandfather were amateur painters. As a young boy, Zobel was fond of drawing. To encourage him, his father brought him to museums in their travels around the world. Zobel learned to paint from painters he knew in Boston and Cambridge, like Reed Champion, Jim Pfeuffeur, and Hyman Bloom. Later, he began to take up painting seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He held his first solo exhibition at the PhilippineArtGallery in 1952. His entrance to the art scene during the postwar period helped invigorate the scene. His paintings were described as &ldquo;subtle,&rdquo; &ldquo;subdued,&rdquo; and &ldquo;understated.&rdquo; Over the years of his career as a painter, he became known for his Saeta paintings, described as &ldquo;brief, acidic and highly emotional&rdquo; (Reyes 1989), like the Flamenco repertory. He went back to Spain in 1958 and befriended abstractionists such as Saura, Sempere, Chirino, Magaz, and Rueda. Zobel quit the family business in the Philippines in 1960 to devote his time to painting. Although he settled permanently in Madrid, his works continued to be exhibited at the Luz Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His collection of Philippine paintings were donated to Ateneo de Manila and became the core of the Ateneo Art Gallery. He also lectured on art at Ateneo. In 1963, Ateneo published his landmark book, <b><i>PhilippineReligiousImagery</i></b>. He also published many articles on Philippine colonial art in journals like <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>. He was a regular member of the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica in Madrid. He collected Spanish abstract art, which later formed the nucleus of the Museum of Spanish Art in Cuenca, Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was named honorary cultural attache of the Spanish Embassy in the Philippines.
