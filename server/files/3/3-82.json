The Lamb itself carries the Philippine flag, its shape bearing similarities to the New Society banner, thus inviting the viewer to draw parallelisms with Philippine realities. The bright saints in the two side niches are partially or almost entirely covered by the dark silhouettes of soldiers&rsquo; long arms, while below, in the smaller niches, angels sound the trumpets of war. All in all, the imagery signifies the enthronement of military power in the Philippines, at the same time alluding to the armed struggle that reflects conflicting interests in the country during the Marcos period.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

As central image in many of his works, she is not only the spirit of the river but the symbol of all nature as well&mdash;pristine nature unstinting with her treasures and always renewing herself in her numerous metamorphoses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this work, as in the entire series, Lamarroza goes beyond mimetic realism to an original style that fuses surrealism and pop, with elements derived from indigenous ethnic designs. Pop in feeling is the figure of the Amburayan Queen against the background of the river, now a dry bed of sand and dry stones, an ecological comment. In her iconic quality, frontal in presentation, she is a two-dimensional and symmetrical figure, gazing forward from small piercing eyes, her carriage regal. Marking her breasts are two circular-design areas, like pineapple fruits, in counterpoint with the horizontal bands of her torso. Equally astonishing is her headdress, an abstract design that is a play of color and tone, rhythmic and of a mathematical precision, from the artist&rsquo;s Laoag or Light<b><i> </i></b>series. This lends her a queenly splendor as it recalls a large spreading crown, a magnificent superstructure, sparkling in its tonal play, its extremely refined execution giving it an airy lightness in a totality of subtle balance and harmony.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Illuminations (water-based pigments on paper). Approximately 4-8 sq cm. Unknown artist (active ca 1770-1830). Archives of the Archdiocese of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Anales </i></b>is a handwritten work that deals with the history of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines. It consists of two volumes, only the first of which contains profuse illuminations on almost every page. The first volume, containing 523 pages, is 40 x 26.7 cm. The text of the pages measure 35.6 x 17.8 cm. The amanuensis, who was in all probability also the illuminator, is unknown. However, the authority and book lover who commissioned him is believed to be Francisco Diaz de Durana, canon of the Metropolitan Church of Manila in the late 18th century. The initials &ldquo;FD,&rdquo; which might refer to him, are stamped on the cover of the first volume. The text was written in ink, using a quill. The miniatures were executed with quills and brushes, ink and water-based colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Anales</i></b> is not just a personal recapitulation of events; it also contains transcriptions of pontifical bulls and briefs, royal cedulas, orders from the Audiencia, and decrees of governors and archbishops. The narration ends in 1682, during the deanship of Miguel Ortiz de Cobarrubias, which suggests that the 18th-century amanuensis was actually asked to transcribe and illuminate Cobarrubias&rsquo;s 17th-century manuscript. The largest miniatures, measuring an average of eight sq cm, embellish the capital of the lead sentence of a chapter as well as that of the section announcing the term of a new bishop. Smaller miniatures and colored, artistically designed words add visual variety to the pages. A few pictures, apparently unfinished, are drawn only in black and red, with inscriptions stating what colors should be applied on certain areas, like <i>azul</i> or blue, <i>verde</i> or green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The miniatures in the <b><i>Anales </i></b>presage the <b>letras y figuras</b><i> </i>(letters and figures), a genre popular in the 1840s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3633\"><strong>Jose Honorato Lozano</strong></a> (b. ca 1820 d. ca 1880), the most outstanding painter of letras y figuras, might have seen clerical documents similar to the <b><i>Anales</i></b>, which inspired him to adapt the style to names of individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although not as strictly made to coincide with the contours of human beings, animals, or objects, a few illuminated capitals in the<b><i> Anales</i></b> suggest that the illuminators often had such coincidences in mind; thus the legs of the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; in the sentence beginning with &ldquo;A este&rdquo; were made to coincide with the two extremes of the configuration depicting a walled city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Evidently, the illuminator intended his images to depict the theme of the text. A drawing showing a diocesan council illustrates the text referring to the Synod of Manila in 1582. Another, depicting the crucifixion of Franciscan missionaries in Japan in 1597, serves to illustrate the discussion of said event. Full-figure renderings of bishops, wearing surplices and mitres and holding croziers, introduce the start of every episcopal term. A section on the devotion to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia at her sanctuary in Ermita is illustrated with a drawing showing the chapel in that place at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drawings in <b><i>Anales</i></b> are in the proselyte style, a sensibility so called because the artist&rsquo;s skills and pictorial devices reflected the mind-set of the Filipino while still perplexed and regaled by the colonial setup and the riveting aspects of the Christian religion. In this stage his style was neither naive nor folk nor primitive. It was medieval, reminiscent of Romanesque illuminations and frescos. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The canvas is diagonally divided into three, focusing on the food vendor at left, toys and fiesta ware at center, and a breastfeeding madonna at right. Stylistic distortion is most pronounced in the illogical positioning of the mother&rsquo;s legs and the rendering of her hands beyond normal realistic proportion. The human figures are merged with the objects and the setting. Note that the rod of hanging <i>suman </i>(rice cake) is superimposed on the vendor&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the women frown, the total atmosphere conveyed by the picture is one of festive delight.

More committed viewers, however, are subtly but quickly clued into the presence of a video playing next to the panels. The video consists of footage of the artist grinding down a human skull and in the process marking off the sandpaper surface with the skull&rsquo;s granular remains in a long-drawn and what the artist regards as &ldquo;meditative&rdquo; process. Initially produced as Zafra&rsquo;s undergraduate thesis at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2129\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2129\"><strong>Argument from Nowhere</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> eventually went on to be shown at the Mori Art Museum exhibition <b><i>Medicine and Art: Imagining the Future for Art and Love</i></b> in Tokyo, 2010. The work was also previously shown at <b><i>Futuramanila</i></b> in Osage, Hong Kong, 2008, and has since been succeeded by other more representational iterations of the artist&rsquo;s painstaking pulverizing of objects (such as bullets, overgrown finger nails, a bolo, among others) against abrasive surfaces (like sandpaper) as his practice continues to challenge what constitutes painting but broadens what makes up pigment and ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The performative aspect of Zafra&rsquo;s work mode has also brought to light just how critical awareness or familiarity with the artist&rsquo;s process becomes in extending meanings that become appended to works of this unconventional nature. Additionally, it also questions such vaunted modernist premises as medium specificity and the still persistent claim that the object can and should be regarded as existing in isolation, apart from physical and social conditions enabling its production, circulation, and reception. The work predictably raises questions surrounding the artist&rsquo;s simultaneously clinical, artifactual, and aestheticized handling of a death specimen. It forces visitors to reckon with the posed anonymity of mortality and the possible violation of cultural taboos.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources:</span> </strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Batten 2008; Birmingham 2009; Kazumichi 2009.</p>\r\n"

The setting is the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\"><strong>Palacio</strong></a> del Gobernador in Intramuros. The scene shows the governor-general near the top center of a landing of the grand marble stairway being simultaneously attacked with spears and bolo by a group of Dominicans in black and white robes and Franciscans in their brown habiliments, while another group of the same friars pulls him down with a rope tied around his body. While the murder is being committed, other friars and sacristans hold aloft colorful religious banners and crucifixes from their procession after mass. Below left, members of the king&rsquo;s guards threaten the monks with spears to no avail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The strong diagonal lines of the dynamic movement is suggested by the flurry of spears and lances. There are accents of bright color in the governor-general&rsquo;s rich costume and in the embroidered banners. There is likewise a lively play of light and dark tones in the reflections on the stairway and on the robes of the friars from the light coming from the large open window. A sequel to this event is the story of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a> (The Black She-Wolf), about the governor&rsquo;s Mexican widow who carried out a bloody revenge for her husband&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painting was commissioned by Don Antonio Ma. Regidor (1845-1910), a nationalist known for his anticlerical sentiments. However, Regidor was unable to take hold of the painting, which remained with Hidalgo in Barcelona. In 1914, a year after the painter&rsquo;s death, Hidalgo&rsquo;s relatives were able to take the painting back to the Philippines. In 1965, the painting came to be in the possession of Manuel Lazatin Garcia, and subsequently became part of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2670\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\"><strong>Leandro V. Locsin</strong></a></strong></a> collection. The painting was declared a National Cultural Treasure and was unveiled during the public exhibition in 1974 at the National Museum of the Philippines. On 29 Oct 2013, the painting was formally turned over to the National Museum. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by: <strong><em>Alice G. Guillermo,updated by Cecilia S.

Done in 1947, it depicts a Filipino family whose members have been massacred by Japanese soldiers. Paco was one of the major strongholds of the Japanese in the Battle of Manila in 1945. In this bloody encounter with American troops, desperate Japanese soldiers went on a rampage, brutally burning houses along with the people inside and mercilessly executing Filipino civilians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lorenzo depicts this carnage, showing a mother in the foreground huddled and cradling her baby, protecting it from the sharp bayonet of the Japanese soldier who stands behind, ready to stab his next victim. On the mother&rsquo;s side is a dead boy and behind her, a man about to fall from the impact of a gunshot. The mother looks askance at the Japanese soldier with a brave and unflinching expression. The Japanese soldier is depicted as cold and merciless, all human expression erased from his countenance. In the background are raging hot flames from the burning of Manila. Lorenzo&rsquo;s powerful and frenzied brushstrokes and his use of untamed reds and yellows heighten the feeling of doom. In its stark realism and emotional force, the work stands as a testament to the brutality of war and the fate of its victims. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources:</span> </strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin-top:4.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Guillermo 2009.</p>\r\n"

Illuminations. Oil on tempera. 9 sq cm. Attributed to Fray Marcelo de San Agustin. San Agustin Church Museum Complex collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A choir book with pages of vellum, measuring approximately 0.91 m high, written in ink and water-based tempera or gouache, it contains three illuminations: the Christ Child, the Holy Family, and the Agony in the Garden, each approximately 0.09 sq m each. Found in the hall which was formerly the anteroom of the large vestry of the San Agustin Church Museum complex, this artifact is generally accepted to be the work of Fray Marcelo de San Agustin. Fray Marcelo was an <i>indio</i> (Christianized native) from Malate, originally named Marcelo Banal. The Augustinian historian Gaspar de San Agustin recorded that Fray Marcelo was a devout brother who composed motets and inscribed choir books, including those used by the monks in the convent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The three paintings are actually illuminations of the capital letters of certain verses: &ldquo;O,&rdquo; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and &ldquo;E.&rdquo; The &ldquo;O&rdquo; is striking for its exotic inspiration. At first glance it seems to be a profusely carved and painted Solomonic column twisted to form the letter, but a closer examination at the top curve reveals this twisted form to be a dragon trying to reach its tail. The three-dimensional effect of the letter was achieved with cross-hatchings in ink. Inside the &ldquo;O&rdquo; the Christ Child is depicted in the convention of a newborn babe in a nativity scene, wrapped in swaddling clothes. Typical of 17th-century Filipino painting and reflective of the novice state of the art in the country, the &ldquo;O&rdquo; shows the painter&rsquo;s obsession with animating elements, such as the hand in blessing and the sharply rendered features of the infant, like his widely alert eyes and parted mouth; all these are done as if to compensate for the tentative skills of the painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Emphatic gestures are similarly observed in the Holy Family, which adorns the letter &ldquo;I.&rdquo; San Jose&rsquo;s right hand is dramatically placed on his chest. While the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is actually a round column on whose center is depicted the boy Jesus amidst red colors, the &ldquo;E&rdquo; was achieved through an intricate crisscrossing of curved lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The scene beside the letter &ldquo;E&rdquo; shows Christ&rsquo;s meditation in the Garden of Gethsemane. Instead of Christ&rsquo;s conventional leaning position, his figure, although kneeling, is drawn backward as if startled by the angel who appears above him. Praying with upraised hands was a practice in the early church, and these scenes might have been influenced by an artwork showing an early Christian orant or praying figure. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

This painting is one of utter simplicity that belies careful, precise planning. Each object is there for a symbolic purpose: a tiny moon reveals it is evening, a small cone represents the trumpet used during the New Year&rsquo;s Eve revelry, and a yellow-green background indicates that the action takes place outdoors. The cyclists are thin and straight. Their heads, faceless and pin shaped, are reduced to their basic geometric components.

Straight vertical and diagonal lines are present in the bicycle and cyclists&rsquo; bodies. Luz subdues the color element to highlight the straight lines and circles of his composition. The position of the cyclists&rsquo; bodies shows that they share a single well-orchestrated movement on canvas. There is rhythm in their straight limbs; one wraps his arms around the waist of another, as if holding on to dear life, while the cyclist up front gracefully covers his knees with his hands in a show of perfect balance. <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251666432\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Noel Valdellon and N.

Lopez (1903-85) was an accomplished portrait painter whose detailed studies of faces were highly realistic. His portrait paintings vividly captured every crease and line on the face of his figures. During the Japanese occupation, Lopez did a number of figure paintings representing different ethnic groups, which conformed with the Japanese program of returning to traditional and indigenous forms. In contrast, his landscape paintings were sedate and genteel and lacked the forcefulness and conviction of his portrait paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2134\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2134\"><strong>Baguio Market</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> was painted in 1943 and depicted Japanese soldiers in their iconic baggy pants, heavy boots, and field caps with neck flaps. Japanese soldiers were rarely portrayed in paintings of this period although <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> was said to have done a number of sketches of this subject. During the occupation, the Japanese set up a garrison at Camp John Hay in Baguio. Toward the end of the war in 1945, Gen Tomoyuki Yamashita transferred his headquarters to Baguio to escape the advancing American forces. It was also in Baguio where Yamashita signed the unconditional surrender of the Japanese army in 1945. As a result of the city&rsquo;s strategic role, it suffered significant damage toward the end of the war in the battle for the liberation of Baguio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Baguio Market</i></b>, Lopez chose to depict an everyday scene where, seemingly under a condition of normalcy, Japanese soldiers are seen milling around casually with the locals. The composition draws the eye to the foreground where two Japanese soldiers are standing in front of a vendor. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the soldiers stoops over to examine some vegetables while the other one looks on. Are the soldiers buying condiments for their daily meal or are they inspecting the goods? Their motive is not clear since the faces of the figures are hazily portrayed, devoid of emotional content. The predominantly somber tones of brown and ochre are not foreboding and do not express the tension of the period. This work represents paintings done during the Japanese occupation, which may be classified as anecdotal. <v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251667456\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

NMP X-77-U-127.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:4.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the east bank of the Masao River in the Ambangan hamlet of Libertad, Butuan City, Agusan del Norte Province in northeastern Mindanao lies a waterlogged archaeological site that the National Museum began excavating in 1976 after a steady emergence of fine Asian tradeware in Manila&rsquo;s antique market. During a decade of work, archaeologists located 11 boats and subjected three to C14 dating. Recovered in 1978, the first boat generated a date of CE 320; soon after, a second yielded the date CE 1250; and in 1986, a third yielded the date CE 990. Because of the high costs involved in analysis, the team left five prehistoric boats in anaerobic (in mud) condition. The <b>balanghai</b><i> </i>(boat) hull under discussion, the oldest, is now on display in the Museum of the Filipino People in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wooden planks of this boat&rsquo;s hull measure 15 m in length and 2.8 m across the beam; the dimensions are similar to other boats in Southeast Asia that bear the edge-pegged method of construction. The locals call the hardwood used for the planks <b>dongon</b> (<i>Heretiera</i> sp.), each carved into one continuous piece. The hardwood pegs or dowels were made from a mangrove wood species (<i>Rhizophora</i> sp.). From plank to plank and from plank to keel, the pegs were embedded in 12 cm intervals. Measuring 19 cm long, the pegs were driven into holes in the middle of the edge of each board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Butuan was a major trading port from the 10th to the 12th century. Butuanons collected sea products, like pearls, mother-of-pearls, tortoiseshells, and sea cucumbers (<i>tripang </i>or <i>Holothuria</i> sp.), and forest products, like medicinal and aromatic products, beeswax, resin, and camphor, which they exchanged for foreign goods. They were also major manufacturers of goods like pottery, textiles, mats, gold ornaments, metal tools (lead, iron, bronze), and reworked glass beads that they marketed to the hinterlands. They traded staples (banana, root crops, sago), dried fish, fish paste, salt, and rice, as well as slaves. Butuan began to decline in the 12th century as Muslim traders increasingly dominated the region and settled in the Sulu archipelago in the 14th century.While the earliest Asian tradeware from Butuan comes from the Five Dynasties period (CE 907-960), the 320 BCE date given the earliest balanghai gives credence to long-distance trade prior to contact with the great traditions of India and China. Moreover, that prehistoric Southeast Asians today share boatbuilding methods with peoples like the Sama of the Sulu Archipelago, points to a long-standing and shared heritage of seamanship, commerce, and social interaction in population centers that began in the Metal Age (500 BCE to CE <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>0) and persists today.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Cembrano, Margarita R. 1989. &ldquo;Guangdong Song Dynasty Sherds Discovered at the Balangay Area, Butuan, Northeastern Mindanao.&rdquo; In <em>Guangdong Ceramics from Butuan and Other Philippine Sites</em>, edited by Roxana Brown, 71-79.

It was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3655\"><strong>Ramon Martinez</strong></a> (ca 1860-1950) and inaugurated on 3 Sep 1911 in Balintawak, which from 1908 to 1963 was officially the site of the country&rsquo;s Cry of Rebellion against Spanish colonizers. According to Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda (1964), the statue is the first full-figure monument in reinforced concrete done in the Philippines. Martinez had been a faculty member of the Escuela de Dibujo, Pintura y Grabado (School of Drawing, Painting and Engraving) in 1892 and this work&rsquo;s idealized historical subject was consistent with his academic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even though the monument is formally dedicated to the heroes of 1896, the lone figure is traditionally associated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>; hence, the work is popularly referred to as a Bonifacio monument. Together with the detail of Bonifacio&rsquo;s image in the 1964 mural <b><i>Filipino Struggles through History</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V. Francisco</strong></a> at the Manila City Hall, Martinez&rsquo;s <b><i>Monumento sa mga Bayani ng 1896 </i></b>is an archetype of the romantic representation of a bolo-wielding, bare-chested, bare-footed Bonifacio in an open <i>camisa de chino</i> (Chinese shirt) and rolled up <i>kundiman</i> pants. While there are no physical markings on the flag, it is generally assumed that it represents the Katipunan flag because of the subject matter&rsquo;s reference to the heroes of 1896 and Bonifacio himself. The <b><i>Balintawak Monument</i></b> was subsequently reproduced in the reverse of the 20-peso banknote issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines from 1951 to 1969. Its design has since been appropriated by numerous Bonifacio monuments in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The monument was originally erected in Balintawak at what is now the intersection of EDSA and Andres Bonifacio Ave / North Diversion Road in Quezon City. At that time, Balintawak was under the jurisdiction of the municipality of Caloocan. The Cry of Balintawak then was celebrated every 26 Aug to commemorate the start of the Philippine Revolution when Katipuneros (Filipino revolutionaries against Spain) symbolically tore their cedulas (tax certificates). In 1963, President <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5472\"><strong>Diosdado P. Macapagal</strong></a> shifted the official commemorations to Pugad Lawin in Quezon City every 23 Aug and renamed the event as the Cry of Pugadlawin. Presently, National Heroes Day, which marks the 1896 Cry, is celebrated every last Monday of August. During the construction of the North Diversion Road, the monument was transferred to Vinzons Hall at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City. It was installed on 19 Nov 1968.

Pastrana slathered gelatin on the glass and blew silver dust upon it, creating granular indications on the reflective surface. The artwork was readily visible to viewers peering at the museum from the outside, but was easily missed by visitors viewing it from the museum&rsquo;s interior. Despite its unobtrusiveness, <b><i>Balloon</i></b> was read by the museum and Western art press as art coming out of a bold generation of artists born at the tail end of liberation and independence movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Institutionally categorized as &ldquo;provisional, site-specific, and performative, reflecting an attitude of possibility and resourcefulness,&rdquo; the works in the exhibition <b><i>The Ungovernables</i></b>, the second of the New Museum&rsquo;s generational biennales, also demonstrated how some artists remain disinclined toward dishing up the didactic. Tellingly enough, <b><i>The Ungovernables</i></b>&rsquo; tag was lifted from a moniker disparagingly used for the African National Congress at the height of resistance against apartheid. Thus, the exhibition as a whole was persistently read as political, even as artists and theorists continued to tangle with the meanings of the terms political, radical, and social.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Possibly inspired by the painter&rsquo;s mentor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>&rsquo;s interest in the intractability of process and reference in art creation,<b><i> Balloon</i></b> showcases Pastrana&rsquo;s predilection for understated transformations of everyday objects. In the work, the gesture of clouding over the apparent clarity of the glass window prompts a reconsideration of how marking materials like silver and gelatin used in photography fail to register. The work could also be seen in light of how photography has become so ubiquitous, given the accessibility of point-and-shoot technology to anyone who aspires to be an artist. Perhaps too in the context of a museum show, the materials employed by Pastrana may be seen as alluding to the illusory notion of the precious in the art world. It also exemplifies the quality of being averse to &ldquo;incorporation and monetization,&rdquo; which the curator Eunjie Joo assembled for this exhibition. In Pastrana&rsquo;s case, the fleeting and intractable mode also informs Pastrana&rsquo;s various temporal engagements, like the defunct art spaces Future Prospects and Theo Gallery, and his teaming up with the design collective Broke. Pastrana comes from a generation of artist-organizers who rode the crest of the 1990s wave of artist-run spaces, which short-circuited the art circulation and validation channels. Taken in this specific context,<b><i> Balloon</i></b> may open up to readings that take the balloon as a stand-in for a bubble, as in the art market bubble, or merely as the unwieldy, fraught membrane that desperately shields the artist&rsquo;s interiority from forces that may challenge individuality and independence.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Art Radar.2014. &ldquo;Artist Gary Ross Pastrana Redefining the Notions of What Is Filipino.&rdquo; 23 May. http://artradarjournal.com/2014/05/23/artist-gary-ross-pastrana-redefining-thenotions-of-what-is-filipino-interview/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duray, Dan. 2011. &ldquo;Check Out the New Museums Ungovernables.&rdquo; http://observer.com/2011/12/check-out-the-new-museumsungovernables/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Museum. 2012. &ldquo;&lsquo;The Ungovernables&rsquo; Artists Roundtable.&rdquo; http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/1453.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shultz, Charles. 2012. https://nakedartcriticism.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gary-ross-pastrana1.jpg.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

It was developed primarily out of a performance that Reamillo mounted earlier in the same year when he was artist-in-residence for Hong Kong ArtWalk, an annual one-night charity event involving Hong Kong galleries. For that earlier eight-hour piece, Reamillo roamed the streets of the Chinese territory, particularly the known haunts of Filipino migrant workers, in the manner of an ambulant balut vendor, though he distributed his wares for free. While his basket did contain a few edible samples of the fertilized duck egg that had been purchased from Wan Chai market, most of the &ldquo;egg objects&rdquo; were balut<b><i> </i></b>that had been emptied, refilled, and strengthened with plaster and emulsion, and embellished with historical and contemporary scenes of Hong Kong and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2138\"><strong>Ang Balutviand</strong></a></strong> </i></b> draws energy from Reamillo&rsquo;s previous creative efforts. In fact, many of the works that he executed over the course of his career grew out of and converse with another, as might be seen in the prominent place of food in his art. Reamillo first performed as a seller of balut in Manila in 1999 for the initial edition of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a>: Philippine International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a> Festival, and in a 2004 exhibition in Tambayang Makiling Artspace, also in Manila. This latter work was titled <b><i>Ang Viand (MacKilling Me MicroSoftly with E-saw</i>)</b>, in which he used roasted pig heads, emu eggs, and assorted condiments rather than balut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon completing his residency, and informed by his experiences in Hong Kong, Reamillo returned to Manila to mount <b><i>Ang Balutviand</i></b>, which on opening night saw Reamillo replicating his ArtWalk performance, this time on Makati Ave. As for the exhibition itself, scattered throughout the space of Tin-Aw&mdash;hanging from the ceiling, lined up along walls, placed on dishes, or nestled in baskets&mdash;were several duck eggs, each bearing a figure, scene, or image, or fitted out with other objects. Interspersed with the balut were other elements that have become recurring motifs in Reamillo&rsquo;s vocabulary, such as painted crab shells and repurposed piano parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reamillo is an advocate of what he calls &ldquo;creative <i>bayanihan</i>,&rdquo; which is informed by the local tradition of communal support for relocating families, and the concept of &ldquo;social sculpture&rdquo; as propounded by Joseph Beuys. In light of these notions, Reamillo embraces the spirit of play and the use of humor in his art-making, even as he seeks to grapple with and comment on social issues. In <b><i>Ang Balutviand</i></b>, for instance, Reamillo poses pointed questions about and around migrant labor, especially the traffic of bodies between the Philippines and Hong Kong, which is one of the most popular destinations for overseas Filipino workers, whose contributions to both the Philippine and Hong Kong economy come at enormous social costs. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Jaime Oscar M.

His fascination with bamboo goes back to 1971 when he exhibited a large open construction of bamboo poles assembled in loose grid patterns, bringing out the qualities of lightness and linearity. His use of bamboo brings to the fore the organic quality of the material that resides in its particularly smooth texture and in the swelling nodes that mark the stages of its straight and rapid growth. Because of its hollowness, the bamboo easily allows itself to be fashioned into vessels or pipes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verano was inspired by the use of bamboo as indigenous musical instruments&mdash;for example, the <i>diw-diw-as</i> or panpipes, <i>balingling</i> or nose flute, and <i>gabbang</i> or xylophone; thus he massed bamboo poles together to form a compact structure in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2140\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2140\"><strong>Bamboo Fugue I</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>. In this work, the variedly shaped cutouts and apertures at different heights suggest different tones and pitches, and at the same time serve to individualize each piece within the ensemble. While visual and tactile in appeal, the sculpture makes strong auditory allusions to bamboo pipes in counterpoint, producing the distinctly reedy sound as of breezes passing through a green and sunlit grove. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Anonymous.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Banton burial cloth is the oldest surviving specimen of textile in the Philippines. The description given to this abaca piece derives from its discovery in a cave in Banton Island, Romblon. Found accidentally in 1939 by Restituto Fonte, a farm boy who saw the cloth relatively intact inside one of several wooden coffins found together with human skulls and bones, and blue and white ceramics. The bones are believed to be from secondary burials. It is in its association with human remains that the cloth is thus described as a burial cloth. The artifact was eventually brought to the National Museum through the efforts of Gabriel F. Fabella, who was then a professor at the Department of History, University of the Philippines, who was also from Romblon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Banton cloth is also the earliest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia. Ikat is a resist technique that involves the dyeing of the textile fibers prior to weaving. In warp ikat, only the warp fibers are dyed. In the artifact, the dyes used are evident in the red and black fibers, while the whitish color comes from the undyed natural color of the fibers. The design on the Banton cloth is simple, composed of stripes of varying widths, interrupted at certain points by a core of patterns, such as regular and inverted &ldquo;S&rdquo; shapes, stylized &ldquo;Xs&rdquo; or tendril-like patterns with hooklike extensions, and positive and negative triangular shapes poised opposite each other to suggest either diamond- or hourglass-like patterns. Interestingly enough, both the palette and the patterns resonate in warp ikat textiles in southern Philippines, such as those of the Tboli, Subanon, and Mandaya. However, the patterns on the Banton cloth may be recognized as much simpler, possibly indicating the incipient stages of a design that would later blossom, as it were, in more recent versions of ikat textiles from areas other than Romblon. Also, in the Banton burial cloth, the stripes retain their integrity, while in the specimens from other ethnolinguistic groups, the stripes seem to be covered by a veil of intricate motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Currently, Romblon does not have a surviving tradition of cloth production using the ikat technique. It is quite possible that the Banton burial cloth<b><i> </i></b>is evidence of an ancient tradition of weaving now lost. Moreover, the circumstances in which the Banton cloth was found strongly suggest the importance of cloth in ritual contexts. Its association with blue and white pottery might also intimate the cloth&rsquo;s function as prestige object. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

The subject of this series is the 1807 revolt of the Ilocano against the government monopoly over basi, the local sugarcane wine. The monopoly, instituted in 1786, regulated the drinking of basi and forced makers to sell at a low official price. Aside from its documentary value in terms of the costumes and manners of the inhabitants of a hierarchical colonial society, this series also records a revolt against Spanish control.

Market scenes, jeepneys, <i>sari-sari</i> or variety stores, and carnival shows are among the themes portrayed in his canvases. He makes it a point to simplify a scene or object to its barest structure. He further reduces the structure to flattest planes of hues or tones that strongly contrast with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han</i></b> is one of Austria&rsquo;s finest works that illustrates the aforementioned artistic device. What is most remarkable about this work is the sophisticated, well-thought-out composition that underlies the naive picture of a community building a house. Beams, posts, and scaffolds of the house become the picture&rsquo;s design base. The monotony of the resulting irregular gridwork is broken by the figures perched on the lines. While figures of midget proportion are childlike, their stances are all so convincingly summarized in contrapuntal manner, which only a keen, mature artist can do. Note that the figures are never frontal but are viewed from varying angles: rear view, side view, top view, and bottom view. Likewise, gestures of work vary: one climbs a post, two others carry poles over their shoulders, and another is cutting wood with a saw. His contrasting colors are harmonized by accentuating large areas of a color with a patch of its complementary color. This is illustrated by the vermilion shirt at left, contrasting with the wide area of powder blue of the skyline and the thalo green of the horizon line. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

A genre work portraying occupational activity, it contains numerous human figures divided into two groups. In the foreground, a small fishing boat with a seated young woman and two male rowers leave for the open waters for their morning catch; in the middle ground and background, a crowd of fisherfolk help one another in sorting out the fish. The artist creates a casual, informal atmosphere, avoiding the posed look, by painting the fisherfolk with their backs turned to the viewer and by shadowing their faces. Only the young woman&rsquo;s face is clearly visible as she smiles at an implied presence, while she raises her white bandana against the sun. Her figure is rendered with a luminosity that is echoed by the sparkling waters and balanced by the white shirts of the fishermen at her back. As the only female figure, she becomes the focus of the painting, although she is situated slightly off-center to maintain the informal charm of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reared in Cebuano realism, Galicano shows his mastery of the human figure in the wide range of positions and gestures and their fluid interactions, enhanced by the skillful use of tones that bring out highlights and contrasts in this fine example of genre. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Early 1600s. Original in darkwood; replicas in molave (body) and batikuling wood (head). Life-size. Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene, Parish of Saint John the Baptist, Quiapo, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:4.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Crafted in Mexico, the image of the Black Nazarene was brought to the Philippines by the Augustinian Recollects on 31 May 1606 and initially enshrined in the church of San Juan Bautista in Bagumbayan. Upon the request of then archbishop of Manila Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa, the image was transferred to the church of Quiapo in 1787. This historic transfer and the feast of the Black Nazarene are commemorated every 9th of January in a grand procession called the <i>traslacion</i> or transfer (Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene 2014a).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Black Nazarene is the representation in a maroon robe of a dark-skinned Christ carrying the cross on his right shoulder, positioned with one knee on the ground and looking heavenward with agony. Expressionist in style, it is a solitary image depicting Christ falling to the ground on the way to His crucifixion on Calvary. The image wears a crown of thorns, representing Jesus&rsquo;s mockery. Three gold rays, called <b>potencias</b>,<i> </i>emanate from the image&rsquo;s head, symbolizing Christ&rsquo;s power and divinity. The image has a detachable head and movable arms and shoulders, with molave and<i> </i>batikuling<i> </i>wood used to replace the presumed original mahogany wood. In the 1990s, the original head of the image was transferred to a new body and permanently enshrined on the basilica&rsquo;s main altar for preservation purposes. The original body in return was refurbished with a replica of the head and is the one brought out in processions (Bonilla 2006, 106-7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The dark complexion of the image has spurred many theories, one of which is that it was made to reflect the color of native Mexicans (Catapang 1937). Another theory says it was a casualty of a fire that broke out on the galleon during its voyage to the Philippines (dela Vega 2013). Carved out of dark wood, the image darkened further due to aging and constant anointing with balsamic oil and perfume. The dark complexion and the attitude of suffering, together with the reputation of the image as miraculous, have made the image popular and endearing to many Filipinos. Devotees articulate that being dark-skinned and striving to bear the difficulties of life are Filipino traits. Devotion to the Black Nazarene is observed every Friday, especially the first Fridays of the month, during which hundreds of thousands of people flock to Quiapo Church (Bonilla 2006, 107-8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The number of devotees of the Black Nazarene continues to grow. An estimated 10 million devotees joined the 2014 procession (Severino and Legaspi 2014). Unfolding over several hours, the procession used to originate from and end at the basilica. But on the celebration of the 400th year of the arrival of the Black Nazarene in 2007 and thereafter, the procession started from Rizal Park and wound its way, over Quezon Bridge, to Quiapo church, reenacting the original transfer of the image from Intramuros to Quiapo in 1787 (Santos 2009). The procession proceeds at an extremely slow pace, lasting for 22 hours in 2012 (Andrade and Santos 2012). The Black Nazarene&rsquo;s traslacion is characterized by an overwhelmingly passionate display of popular devotion. Most participants aim to hold the ropes that pull the float of the image along. Some devotees attempt to board the float to get an opportunity to touch the image to sacralise their handkerchiefs. As one of the most popular religious icons in the Philippines, the image of the Black Nazarene has been associated with healing, has been used as an image for amulets, and has inspired narratives of salvation among its devotees. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Dino Carlo S.

Private collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\" class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:.05in; text-align:left; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paz Paterno (1867-1914) painted this piece at the age of 17. It is a combination of two subjects&mdash;a <b>bodegon</b><i> </i>(still life) and a <b>paisaje</b> (landscape)&mdash;and is perhaps her best-known work. The right side of the image is dominated by Philippine fruits and nuts in full splendor&mdash;lanzones, atis, makopa, bananas, mabolo, cashew, pili, and coconuts. They are all piled against the lower trunk of a large tree, whose flowers and leaves accentuate the fruits. It is a feast for the eyes. Instead of placing the fruits atop a table, as in conventional still life paintings, Paterno chose to situate her still life in the outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paz used vibrant and aggressive hues in this work. The reds and yellows are made intense in an effort to depict the fruits as fully ripe but fresh. None of these are rotting or blemished. The size of the fruits is exaggerated, magnified, and shown in almost extreme close-up, threatening to jut out of the pictorial space. The fruits, however, look artificial, because of their idealized depiction. Even if the entire scene is in the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; setting of a garden, the scene still looks staged. The space is crowded with visual elements that are made to fit in a confined and narrow pictorial plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The right side of the composition is heavier, because most of the fruits are grouped here. On the left half is the landscape. The entire garden is in the dark, but some light seems to come from a corner of the garden. There is just enough light for the details of the fruits to be seen. There is contrast in the clarity of the details of the fruits, butterfly, and plants on the painting&rsquo;s right half, and the hazy figures found in the background landscape. The composition is not static, but suggestive of movement, particularly in the flight of the butterfly and the division of the canvas into diagonal halves. Some fruits are even shown straying away from the main branch, but their movement appears contrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is supposed to be a combination of paisaje and bodegon but the paisaje is hardly discernible in the background; the mountains and a boating figure are not sharp. The landscape is hardly expansive and is overshadowed and contained by the artist&rsquo;s private garden space, from where she presumably painted the scene. The impression is one of narrowness and confinement; the site comes across as dark, protected, and concealed. Despite the fact that the space depicted in the painting is an exterior space, the painting leaves a stronger impression of an interior, private space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In combining two genres that were available to her and other women artists of the 19th century, Paterno showed a predisposition toward experimentation. In the process, she challenged the hierarchy of themes in the visual arts&mdash;a hierarchy in which bodegones and paisajes<i> </i>were devalued while historical and religious paintings were privileged. This is the oldest extant painting by a woman visual artist in the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eloisa May P.

Jorge B. Vargas Museum collection, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) remained as one of the most prolific painters during the Japanese occupation producing portraits, landscapes of genre scenes as well as numerous sketches. Amorsolo also painted a series of scenes depicting the carnage of Manila. <b><i>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2149\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2149\"><strong>Bombing of the Intendencia</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>done in 1942, depicts the Intendencia in Intramuros (located at the south bank of the Pasig River) as it is consumed by flames. The Intendencia housed the mint, customs offices, and finance bureaus. It was one of the first buildings to be destroyed when Japanese bombs were dropped on Manila in Dec 1941. The building again suffered major damage from American artillery in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image in Amorsolo&rsquo;s painting is derived from an actual photograph of the incident. The black-and-white photo depicts the burning Intendencia in the background while people on the bridge watched. On the right-hand side of the picture is a boat in the Pasig River depicted in its exact position in Amorsolo&rsquo;s painting. In both images, the people in the foreground are hazy, their faces indiscernible. While the people captured by the camera seem to be merely watching the flames engulf the building, Amorsolo depicts people fleeing from the scene, their belongings in tow. The boat on the right is shown in the painting at a more precarious angle, teetering as if about to sink. Amorsolo also added more dramatic elements to his composition by rendering the scene in color, using black, greys, and strong yellows and orange. In his work, one can almost smell the flames as it consumes the building and threatens to envelope the whole scene. In his signature style, Amorsolo situates this historic scene amidst the orange sun at dusk. Like the actual photograph, this work is significant in that it records for posterity a very important historical event. Although Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>Bombing of the Intendencia</i></b> may have revealed the darker side of war, one can also say that it was the dramatic content and composition rather than the urgency of the moment that was captured in this rendering.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The principal figure is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>, leader of the 1896 Philippine Revolution. Behind him and beneath the flag stands <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\"><strong>Emilio Jacinto</strong></a>. On both sides the Katipunero brandish their bolo in a call to arms. Behind the figure of Bonifacio, at the opposite side of the obelisk, are the hooded figures of the three martyred priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, whose execution gave birth to nationalism. These are followed in sequence by the initiation rites into the revolutionary secret society of the Katipunan, a dying woman with an infant reaching for her breast, and the man with clenched fist upraised beside the Katipunero figure, which completes the movement back to Bonifacio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bonifacio himself stands with pistol and bolo in each hand, his figure expressive of nobility and resoluteness of purpose as he surveys the scene. Classical ideals come into play, particularly in the restrained approach to the Bonifacio figure, but so does romanticism in the emotional dynamism of the Katipunero. Not to be overlooked is the realist&rsquo;s concern for detail, especially since Tolentino was also an excellent portraitist. Through these various strands, what comes to the fore is the sculptor&rsquo;s genuine feeling for the subject. The figure of Bonifacio, the tragic revolutionary hero, was an inspiration to the artist as nationalist. This monument, which marked the apex of Tolentino&rsquo;s career, was completed on the eve of the founding of the Commonwealth, once more stirring hopes for independence from colonial rule, symbolized by the winged victory atop the obelisk. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

A Baldovino portrait is characterized by the photojournalist&rsquo;s keen ability to picture realism and habitual concern to depict candidness or spontaneity, even if the image is taken under controlled conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subject is painter Carlos (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a>) Francisco (later National Artist for visual arts), whom Baldovino first met on the set of Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s movie <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Touch Me Not).

Botong was a man of the people, an artist who never left his rural, lakeshore hometown of Angono.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baldovino sought to portray Botong&rsquo;s unique, disarming lack of affectation. This black-and-white photograph shows a full, unposed figure sitting tailor-fashion on the grass roof of a native boat and sketching Angono&rsquo;s Bae Lake. It is the painter, devoid of self-consciousness, comfortable and totally absorbed in his aesthetic pursuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The singular character and style of the subject is captured not through a close-up of facial features but by a study of the painter&rsquo;s true-to-life working situation. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> remembers Botong as close to the commonplace and the common folk through Baldovino&rsquo;s masterful combination of pose, clothing, and setting. This is a fine example of environmental portraiture&mdash;capturing the subject in its milieu. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Felice P. Sta.

It was believed to have been commissioned by Luis Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as (who succeeded his father Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as to the governorship) as a record to be sent to the king of Spain. The 305-page manuscript contains descriptions and 75 colored illustrations of inhabitants of several Asian countries like the Moluccas, New Guinea, Annam, Formosa, Cambodia, Brunei, Achin or Sumatra, Siam, China, and Japan, as well as the Philippines where Luis Dasmari&ntilde;as traveled during his father&rsquo;s incumbency. Philippine illustrations include those of the Tagalog, Visayas, Zambales, Cagayan, and Aeta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When put up for auction by its previous owner, the English Lord Ilchester, in 1947, the <b><i>Codex </i></b>was acquired by Charles R. Boxer, a scholar on Asian culture; hence its name. According to Boxer, the 15 illustrations on the inhabitants of the Philippines are done with remarkable fidelity unlike the others that were based on narratives. Details of costume and jewelry and accessories must have been rendered by a keen observer. Boxer also believed that the drawings were done by a Chinese artist, although ornamental borders of birds, flowers, bees, and foxes indicate Western influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2013, the Lilly Library loaned the original set as part of the landmark exhibit <b><i>Philippines: Archipel des &Eacute;changes</i></b> (Philippines: Archipelago of Exchange) held at the Mus&eacute;e du quai Branly in Paris, France.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The discovery of a wealth of 19th-century photographs from colonial Filipiniana sparked a search for a national identity. BenCab appropriated these images into recomposed sepia enlargements or croppings that usually questioned the Filipino&rsquo;s passivity at acculturation. The result was a body of acrylic paintings, called Larawan (Portrait), which animated the art audiences&rsquo; mixed response of nostalgic pride and self-criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Brown Brothers&rsquo; Burden</i></b> is one of the Larawan series. The title alludes to the Imperialist League&rsquo;s assertion that it is the &ldquo;white man&rsquo;s burden&rdquo; to civilize the savages of the Philippines. Unmasking &ldquo;imperialist&rdquo; intentions, BenCab reveals the &ldquo;burden&rdquo; to be the white man whose interests weigh heavily on the shoulders of the &ldquo;little brown brothers,&rdquo; a term borrowed from historian Leon Wolff. The painting depicts four natives carrying a white man in a suit and hat on a palanquin. Here the artist remains virtually faithful to his archival visual source, yet focuses on its contemporariness as a fossil photograph. This he achieves by enclosing the drawing within a hard-edge border design, and glazing the fine image with a filament of uneven washes and stains. Adept at fine portraiture, the artist has heightened the quiet pain in the brown men&rsquo;s faces while he deletes the facial features of the white colonizer. Such fresh approach to looking at the past opened a vast vista of visual explorations on the national identity theme. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

In terms of subject, Ocampo&rsquo;s representation of the madonna-and-child departs from traditional colonial iconography, which gave a Caucasian cast to the holy figures. Here the brown complexion and features identify the figures as Filipino. Mary&rsquo;s baro&rsquo;t saya and <i>tapis</i> are unmistakably rural Filipino. The background is tropical, with its bamboos and mountains allusive of rice terraces, and the thatched hut in the lower section. The artwork may be viewed as one of the first efforts in painting to create new Filipino icons with which the people could identify, thus comprising an attempt at decolonization of religious imagery. Aside from nationalism, the motive for indigenization could also have come from the French post-impressionist Paul Gauguin&rsquo;s Tahitian work <b><i>La Orana Maria</i></b>, 1891. Ocampo&rsquo;s style is likewise modernist in the use of bright colors, the flat decorative effect, the absence of linear perspective, and the use of spatial recession as depth. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">1964. Mixed media. <u><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Medalla</strong></a></strong> </u>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">David Medalla (b. 1938) arrived in England in 1960. He edited <b><i>Signals Newsbulletin</i></b>, and with Paul Keeler co-directed Signals Gallery in London from 1964 to 1966. Both journal and gallery were important vehicles for the international avant-garde, especially South American artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark. Page one of <b><i>Signals Newsbulletin 1</i></b> (Aug 1964) served as a preview for their concerns. Medalla quoted articles by Benjamin Farrington on the evolution of technology and the Machine Age, Lazlo Maholy-Nagy on the inner life of objects and that man and not the market should be the reason for artistic production, Victor Vasarely and Piet Mondrian on the need for artists to work with other disciplines to create a better world, and Marcello Salvadori, Mies van der Rohe, and Yves Klein on the transformation of unconventional material to reveal new analogies between art and perception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The September 1964 issue of <b><i>Signals Newsbulletin </i></b>included a two-page spread on Medalla&rsquo;s bubble machines. His efforts to perfect <b><i>Cloud Canyons</i></b>,<b> </b>as he later called these and other forms of bubble machines, was a scientific challenge that involved more than a year&rsquo;s worth of work. Comprised of boxes with chemical liquid that produced foam in response to a low electric current, the bubbles expanded into columns and slowly spread outside the structures. For Medalla, these bubbles presented a novel concept: that sculpture could at once be monumental and fleeting, something and nothing. <b><i>Cloud Canyons </i></b>illustrated the principle of aleatory growth. The expanding and continuously changing bubbles showed that sculpture need not be stable to create mass and form, and that forms produced by motorized kinetic art need not be rooted in rote movement. He invented a new kind of sculpture that continuously grew and expanded by spontaneously renewing itself. German auto-destructive artist Gustav Metzger lauded these pioneering ideas behind <b><i>Cloud Canyons</i></b> as pathbreaking. Writing on Medalla&rsquo;s seminal position in the art world in an essay for <b><i>Signals 1</i></b>, Metzger (1964, 8) pointed to how random activity demonstrated through the transformation of the artist&rsquo;s material produced exemplary aesthetic content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his <b><i>Mmmmmmm Manifesto</i></b> of the following year, Medalla promised to create sculptures that would &ldquo;breathe, perspire, cough, laugh, yawn, smile, wink, pant, dance, walk, crawl &hellip; and move among people &hellip;&rdquo; This imaginative statement turned out to be prophetic. After his playful bubble, sand, and mud kinetic projects, he began using people&rsquo;s bodies and movement and increasingly involved spectators. In what would later be called Participation Art, Medalla contributed to bridging the intellectual gap between viewer and artwork. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Benitez-Johannot, Purissima, ed. 2012a. <em>The Life and Art of David Cortez Medalla</em>.

Here the subject was far removed from Amorsolo&rsquo;s images of the countryside. Shown is a group of builders working to construct an edifice. The setting is not specific; neither do the builders have individualizing features. Edades emphasized linear and structural composition above other pictorial elements in his work. His mural, basically a horizontal composition, is composed of a semicircle mesh of bodies at the center, closed in by isolated figures on both the left and right edges. Almost no negative space is left on the canvas; neither are there any bright hues, the painting being entirely in shades of gray and brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist fit in the human figures by means of distortion and changes in scale and proportion to the general design. There is a horizontal line and instead of a gradual recession, the scale abruptly changes from the big foreground figures to the row of men in the background pulling on a rope. Also new are the bold contours and the painterly brushwork, which does not conceal its passage and produces a rough texture instead of the usual smoothness of surface. In a style that is representational but not realist, Edades was concerned with conveying the essence of men engaged in labor through the contortions of the bodies. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The subject of the work is a comely Filipina from an elite provincial family. She is depicted full figure in the formal dress of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>La Bulaque&ntilde;a</i></b> has a naturalness rarely found in portraits of the same period. Its subject is shown casually holding her floor-length train over her black <i>tapis</i> or overskirt. Although she still carries an ivory fan and lace handkerchief, the obligatory props of 19th-century female portraiture, she does so with unique informality. Luna painted her at an oblique angle to keep the stiffness out of her pose. Unlike his contemporaries who were fond of filling portrait backgrounds with family heirlooms and religious images, Luna used a simple blue-green background for his subject&rsquo;s face and form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The portrait&rsquo;s gracefully curved lines provide the illusion of movement from the subject&rsquo;s lace-edged sleeves down her crossed arms toward the stripes of her skirt. The visual movement then reverts toward her face. Although not strikingly beautiful, the subject&rsquo;s face is an interesting one; her heavy brows, deep-set eyes and pert nose are set in a pensive, almost sad expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Luna&rsquo;s rendition of textural illusion is noteworthy in the portrait. The transparent jusi of the blouse and the thick weave of skirt material appear so true to life they can almost be felt by the viewer. The delicate lace edges of the billowing sleeves and pa&ntilde;uelo<i> </i>or kerchief even shimmer in the light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lady in the picture was Emiliana Yriarte Trinidad (b. 4 Jan 1878 d. 22 Mar 1971). She was less than 17 years old when she posed for the painting, which Luna started in Nov 1895 and finished in the first months of 1896. The painting was sold to the National Museum during World War II for 200 in Japanese military notes. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Noel Valdellon, N.

NMP 1961-A-21 purchased 1961.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Calatagan Pot, as it is popularly known, is an ellipsoid earthenware container with everted syllabic inscriptions incised along its shoulder. It was discovered in Calatagan, Batangas, and brought to the attention of then National Museum junior archaeologist and site supervisor Alfredo Evangelista when he returned to the site on the weekend. Because of these inscriptions, the museum declared it a National Cultural Treasure sometime after it entered its collections in 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fifteenth-century Sawankhalok (Thai) and Chinese (Ming Dynasty) trade ceramics were reportedly found in association with the Calatagan Pot. But determining an absolute date for the artifact has proven to be a problem. Hair pomade applied on the pot&rsquo;s surface when earlier attempts were made to replicate this important piece has resulted in contamination. Archaeologists did not accept the very old carbon 14 dates. The museum also conducted experiments on fired and unfired clay and found that the inscriptions on the Calatagan Pot were incised on the surface before firing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scholars have studied these syllabic inscriptions but none have presented their findings with certainty. Juan Francisco, a specialist in Indian scripts and language, has not accepted the authenticity of the pot. On the other hand, Dutch paleographer Johannes de Casparis compared the pot&rsquo;s inscriptions to those on other artifacts in the National Museum and declared the Calatagan Pot authentic. Moreover, physician and independent scholar of Philippine paleography Quentin Oropilla proposed that the inscriptions were part of a ceremonial prayer of offering that was not Sanskrit-based but Austronesian, a family of languages from which all Central Philippine languages derived, including current Tagalog, Ilocano, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a>. Philippine literature scholar <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5358\"><strong>Ramon Guillermo</strong></a> and anthropologist Myfel Paluga proposed a methodology combining paleography and cryptography to decode the inscription. Their findings resulted in a decoded text combining Visayan and Javanese languages and which they posit to signify as a charm or spell. Further scientific analyses are required to determine when and why the Calatagan Pot inscriptions were written and whether it may be conclusively considered an artifact from the Philippine and Southeast Asian prehistoric past. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot, with notes from Cecilia S.

He worked as illustrator of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>ne</i></b> and <b><i>Taliba </i></b>in the 1920s and was chief artist of the <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine </i></b>from the 1950s to the 1970s. He also did the editorial cartoons of the <b><i>Daily  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></strong> </i></b> in the 1950s. As an illustrator, his lines were refined but dynamic. His editorial cartoons were witty, often utilizing plays on words. In painting, Santiago Pilar describes his lines as vigorous and his brushworks as bold, qualities that made <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> regard him &ldquo;as a potential modernist and enlisted him as one of the thirteen moderns&rdquo; (Pilar 1994, 338).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Diego&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a></strong> </i></b> was done in 1948, three years after World War II ended and is considered as one of the most poignant renditions of wartime suffering. It won second place in the first postwar competition of the Art Association of the Philippines in 1948. The work is an intimate look at the sufferings Filipino soldiers had to go through when, together with American prisoners of war, they were made to march from Bataan to Camp O&rsquo;Donell in Capas, Tarlac. Known as the Bataan Death March, this event in history is remembered for the atrocities committed against Filipino and American prisoners of war by Japanese soldiers. Diego&rsquo;s work shows dying soldiers lying on bamboo cots in an internment camp in Capas. The work provides an intimate view of the scene, giving the feeling of being in the same room with these soldiers. The tight grouping of the figures as well as the angle of the composition highlights the cramped and uncomfortable situation. The soldiers&rsquo; faces are sunken, their eyes dark and hollow. Succumbing to fatigue, hunger, illness, and injuries, these soldiers will probably not make it. Depicted in somber colors of light and dark brown, the scene evoked is one of darkness and melancholy. This work remains significant today because it satisfies our need for temporal anchoring by capturing an important moment in history with unflinching pathos. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Source</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n\r\n<p>Pilar, Santiago A. 1994a. <em>CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art, Vol IV, Philippine Visual Arts</em>.

The photographic collection offers interesting views on American observations of the country and attendant senses of self in a new and colonized territory</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The picture of an American captain&rsquo;s child with her Filipina nursemaid presents a charged representation of colonial relations that obtained during the period. A <i>yaya </i>(nursemaid) carries the daughter of her master. As denoted by the title, it is the child that is the subject of the photograph and the Filipina maiden is only an appendage of this subject. They wear formal dresses for the camera, the native baro&rsquo;t saya<i> </i>for the nursemaid and a dress for the captain&rsquo;s daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still regarded as relatively new technology in the country then, the camera traveled across wide areas, crossed boundaries, and, with this photograph, entered the private space of a public official. Aspects of his domesticity are captured by the camera. The child and her nurse are rather formal, but there is a hint of gentleness as the child&rsquo;s head slightly touches that of the woman. Perhaps there is an intimacy that lurks beneath the surface and beyond the camera&rsquo;s gaze. The woman is not smiling, but not scowling either; there is a degree of dignity that is fixed or recorded. In the history of art, their pose resembles the &ldquo;mother-and-child&rdquo; motif with a perplexing twist when taken in light of the nation&rsquo;s new context: racial and imperial difference complicating the apparent tenderness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The blunt contrast in skin color&mdash;the almost black native woman and the sheer whiteness of the child&mdash;also sharpens the differences of these subjects amidst colonial relations. It is as though the child emerges from the backdrop as a distinct form and yet as one that is dependent on what surrounds her to make her present. Attending to their respective duties, the officer and his wife rely on this poor maiden to take care of their household. The presumably backward woman-native-other, who belongs to the country recently subjugated by the US invader, rears the precious child of an American military man, testifying to subaltern labor that sustains the empire&rsquo;s future and supporting the master-slave relations under America&rsquo;s &ldquo;Benevolent Assimilation.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by JPaul S.

In 1953 his large polymer on panel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2161\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2161\"><strong>Carroza</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> won first prize in the Art Association of the Philippines semiannual competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Here the subject is the Virgin Mary surrounded by bright yellow lamps on a carriage float. Its composition is flat. Symmetrical scallops adorn the wheels of the float, its scaffolding, the leaves of the palm plants, and the lamps on the upper half of the canvas. Short zigzags on the palm leaves and the Virgin&rsquo;s robes contrast with the scallops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Zobel depicted the karosa from a completely frontal perspective. He presented the Virgin as a stern, straight image without facial features. What prevents the entire painting from appearing too stiff is the profusion of brightly colored lamps, whose shapes dominate the painting. Even Zobel&rsquo;s signature at the bottom left corner of the panel wittily echoes the lamp shape. By playing down the religious aspect of the karosa, Zobel brought into focus its decorative qualities of shape, color, and form.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Noel Valdellon and N.

A simple beige, almost chromeless painting on a torn canvas, stitched, impastoed, and assemblaged with derelicts such as a lost shoe and a discarded tin can, was unparalleled during its time. Galang&rsquo;s use of space, sparseness of presences, and an apparent attitude toward art as objecthood make this a minimalist work. There is no better way to appreciate this work than through Galang&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;It is not a question of making art good for a time, for some time, or for all times. Nor is it a matter of artmaking at all but of thinking and seeing art where none exists&rdquo; (1964). &ldquo;True art has no value other than being a reflection of man&rsquo;s relationship with the unknown. It has no meaning other than a consciousness of being in the dark where one&rsquo;s perception of art is proof of the vastness which we are clearly a part of&rdquo; (1967).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Magsaysay-Ho emphasized movement and bustling interaction by means of bold and vigorous brushstrokes, and strong tonal contrasts of light and darkness. There is a marked tendency to simplify forms into basic geometric shapes: triangles for bandannas, rectangles for skirts. While the composition is circular and closed, there is a variety of interaction among the figures as well as an impression of fluttering movements in the chickens flying about, women chasing them with eager hands, and chickens cackling, their feathers rustling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The spatial intervals are filled with white bird shapes flying while the women&rsquo;s hands with outspread fingers flap and wave, their bodies bending and turning in counterpoint. Adding to the sense of excitement is the textural surface treatment as the hard bristles of the brush make sharp hatching and cross-hatching on the hardboard. The women subjects themselves are generalized with no particularizing features, their figures stylized as they are in most of Magsaysay-Ho&rsquo;s other works. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Oil on vertical wood planks. 500 x 350 cm. Attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3501\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3501\"><strong>Jose Dans</strong></a></strong></a>. Roman Catholic Parish Church of Santiago, Paete, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Multizonal in composition, this mural helps introduce the Roman Catholic cosmogony to its viewers. The painting&rsquo;s vertical space is expediently divided into four sections. Shown in the topmost section is Heaven; below it is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a>, represented by vignettes of the Seven Sacraments. Under Earth, occupying the center of the painting, are Adam and Eve standing beside the Tree of Knowledge. Flanking this central image and directly below it are three scenes representing Purgatory. Below Purgatory is Hell in all its terrors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a catechetical painting, the mural portrays the most important personages of Heaven and Hell. At the center of the heavenly plane is Christ crucified; above him, the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove; and above the dove, God the Father represented as an ancient-looking man. Christ is flanked on both sides by the Blessed Virgin on his right and San Juan Bautista and San Jose on the left. The vignettes illustrating the Seven Sacraments that feature folk in native costumes stress that only through compliance or fulfillment of these vital practices of the church can the faithful find eternal salvation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lower half of the painting contains the scenes with the most popular appeal; here depicted are the first love story, that of Adam and Eve, and also nerve-gripping spectacles like the suffering of the souls in Purgatory and the punishments of Hell. The boats of the forgiven and that of the damned flank the Paradise scene. The images of Hell&rsquo;s mouth, sinners trapped in cages, as well as condemned souls in various forms of torture, give evidence to the artist&rsquo;s engraving inspiration. The artist copied his subject from Greek mythology. Dans, however, seems to have also included images from Philippine netherworld folklore, like the <i>kapre</i> or ogre; <i>tikbalang</i> or half-human, half-horse; <i>aswang</i> or malevolent being; and <i>maligno</i> or evil spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dans was essentially a folk artist. He was mainly driven to narrate the compelling details of his subject as a storyteller and was less preoccupied with pictorial skills to obtain a naturalistic presentation. As in a cartoon, crisply etched lines rendered the contour of his figures while hues in their full intensity helped enliven this charming visual narrative. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The demand arose after the liberalization of trade policies with non-Spanish Europeans, including the British, who were previously banned from trading in Manila. So far six albums are known to exist, including one formerly in the National Library, amply documented but destroyed during World War II. Of the five extant, four have title pages&mdash;namely, those in the Newberry Library (Chicago), the Ayala Museum, the collections of Paulino and Hetty Que and Dr Eleuterio M. Pascual. The Que folio is contained in two albums with a dedication each to Grace and Eliza Douglas, signed &ldquo;from her affectionate Papa, January 1833.&rdquo; The Pascual album was discovered in the estate of the 13th Earl of Derby and bears the crest of the peer. The number of plates differs per album. The Newberry has 29 plates of Filipino costumes; the Ayala Museum has 28 of Filipino costumes; the Que album has 29 plates of Filipino costumes; the Pascual album originally contained 17 Filipino costumes (two are now in a different collection) and eight Chinese costumes. All the albums were commissioned and collected by Rafael Daniel Baboom (d. 1832), a Madras entrepreneur who in turn sold them to British textile traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Que album is outstanding not just for having 29 plates all inscribed with a caption in Spanish. The titles suggest the social class, region, and racial breed of the subjects. The English translations of the inscriptions in the plates in the Que album are as follows: (1) An Indio Municipal Captain, (2) An Indian Woman of Manila in Gala Array, (3) A Clerk of the Governor of Manila, (4) An Indian Lady Going to Mass with a Young Girl, (5) An Indian Field Worker, (6) An Indian Native from Pampanga with His Pipe, (7) An Indian Native from the Province of Pangasinan, (8) An Indian Boatman from Manila, (9) An Indian Woman from the Visayas, (10) An Indian from Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><strong>Dress</strong></a>ed in Gala Attire, (11) A Half-Breed Girl from Manila in Gala Attire, (12) An Indian Woman from Ilocos, (13) A Mestizo Student from Manila, (14) An Indian Fish Vendor from Manila, (15) A Spanish Mestiza Dressed in Gala Attire, (16) An Indio Bailiff from the Town of Tondo, (17) A Mestiza Shopkeeper from Manila, (18) A Commissioned Soldier, (19) An Indian Laundrywoman from Pangasinan, (20) An Indian Stevedore, (21) An Indian Fisherman, (22) A Mestizo Cleric from the Town of Santa Cruz, (23) An Indian Woman Dressed in Mourning, (24) An Indian Cart Driver in Manila, (25) An Indian Pot Vendor of Pasig, (26) An Indian Boatman from the Town of Pasig, (27) A Mestiza from Pampanga, (28) An Indian Inhabitant from the Province of llocos, and (29) An Indian Native of Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each plate shows a highly detailed drawing of a costume. The bright hues employed to capture the actual colors of the dress appear flat. Domingo, however, used tonal modulations to suggest the volume of faces and hands. The embroideries stand out in the color areas, being rendered in white. The exquisite skill bears out Domingo&rsquo;s metier as miniature portraitist. Since the plates contain many circumstantial details, they serve as an important documentation of the social, cultural, and economic life in the first three decades of the 19th century. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The woman is actively working and not merely passively posing. She is shown walking away from the picture plane, but remains the main focus of the scene. Behind her are three nipa huts with their windows and doors open. The huts are typical&mdash;with steep roofs and elevated from ground level. In front of the huts are two chickens and their brood. Several coconut and guava trees surround the nipa huts. The roof and fences, and even the leaves, are done in detail. On the background is a mountain. Our line of vision is equally drawn to the structures, landscape, and the woman walking. This is a clear attempt by Adelaida Paterno (1880-1962) to show the spaces of working women in the 19th century, from the perspective of an <i>ilustrada </i>(educated) artist. It is clear that Adelaida sees the working women&rsquo;s space as expansive, especially when compared to her own narrow space as ilustrada. The working woman is more active and more mobile, and has more freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Country Scene</i></b> exemplifies the level of skill in embroidery using human hair on Chinese silk achieved during the 19th century. It is possible that Adelaida used her own hair for this work. The artist&rsquo;s dedication to detail, in this example of <b>paisaje</b><i> </i>(landscape) and genre, is obvious. Adelaida&rsquo;s decision to use human hair to depict a laboriously detailed landscape and figures is admirable, considering that she had no formal art training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Adelaida has four extant works: one landscape and genre painting and three landscape and genre embroidered with human hair on Chinese silk. The influence of her older sister, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3709\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3710\"><strong>Paz Paterno</strong></a></strong></a>, on her paisaje and genre<i> </i>painting is seen in the combination of genres. However, the use of embroidery with hair is unique to Adelaida. Adelaida&rsquo;s style is different from that of Paz, particularly because Adelaida does not idealize her subjects. Her works are more realistic in their rendering of dilapidated fences and nipa huts. The shores, the boats, and the working women are not romanticized, and therefore hew closer to the &ldquo;roughness&rdquo; of the reality of life among the laboring classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In conventional art-historical accounts, embroidery is not considered a &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; art form but a leisurely activity. Most mainstream writers would compare Adelaida&rsquo;s embroidery to a drawing to render it more legitimate. However, when viewed from broader perspective of art and cultural history, <b><i>Country Scene</i></b> is a legitimate artwork that may be studied as a construct of societal conditions, gender differentiations, and power relations at the time of its creation.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eloisa May P.

Christ&rsquo;s hair, upturned from the nape, droops to totally hide the face, emoting a feeling of defeat and loneliness. Pain and forbearance are interpreted through the delineation of recesses and complexities of muscle and sinew in the outstretched arms, the chiseled ribmarks on a full chest vis-&agrave;-vis a depressed abdomen, a lean groin accentuated by a simple cloth, and contracted thighs and legs. Christ&rsquo;s oversized palms echo the downward movement of the drooping head, showing a subtle feeling of tension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Full humanity is expressed in the naked figure, while the glorious divinity of the Risen Christ is successfully depicted through the serene, symmetrical verticality of the figure in a full tunic, which underscores Christ&rsquo;s purity and priesthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Suspended from the dome of the circular edifice that is the Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, the double crucifix by Abueva was a first in church art executed in neorealist style and illuminated by sunlight filtered through a hole in the circular dome that suggests the firmament.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The human condition at its most pathetic or angriest predicament has always inspired this artist. Suffering and torture are images familiar to him as he witnessed these in his boyhood during World War II. Images of such cruelties continue to haunt him in the political and criminal violence reported daily by the mass media. While Western cubism is all about objective analysis of physicality, Ang Kiukok borrows its approach and techniques to pursue the opposite&mdash;that is, to synthesize what has been broken down into a unified interpretation of human agony. To him, agony is a universal fate rather than a specific circumstance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A pupil of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Ang Kiukok emerged as an accomplished painter in the 1960s, pursuing the theme of the mechanization of the human beings and the crucifixion of Christ in several of his works. In this <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2168\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2168\"><strong>Crucifix</strong></a></strong></a>ion</i></b>, Christ is a duality of tortured victim and alienated android. The figure&rsquo;s drooping head and the muscular tension emoted by the rendition of arms and hands signify the human angst in Christ&rsquo;s violent death. The suggested wheels, cranks, and levers that compose Christ&rsquo;s lower torso alludes to the dehumanization of modern men and women in the age of machines. The formal balance, as brought by the centrality of the cross and the composition of squares in cream and black, imbues a spiritual restraint to an otherwise raging theme. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Those reared and schooled in the Philippines would know that the classroom is not merely a place for knowledge generation but a circulator of &ldquo;politicized&rdquo; memories (Olazo 2011). Through the installation, Philippine public classrooms may be construed not merely as learning sites but as halfway places for the evicted and displaced, as well as possibly nesting places for the aberrant. These spaces additionally double up as ceremonial sites for the practice of civil agency and the imposition of moneyed and militarized power, poignantly represented by images of public school teachers drafted for election duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The work demonstrates Chabet&rsquo;s agile mining of both the formal and meaning-making capacities of everyday objects played off against each other. His use of ubiquitous GI sheets, other discards, and found objects like a bell from an old boat, wooden school desks, and neon text encased within the narrow space of a mall-based gallery, calls up dual performances of voyeurism and surveillance in a controlled space of commerce and mass socialization such as a mall. Not a few have faulted Chabet&rsquo;s work for being too opaque. In response, prot&eacute;g&eacute; artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3690\"><strong>Jonathan Olazo</strong></a>&rsquo;s exhibition text expressly points out the Chabet&rsquo;s use of objects, such as a  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> magic slate where written codes are easily effaced, is semiotically charged.

The titular reference to an immersive break-in into an otherwise private or fortified zone counts on the dynamic synergies between the artwork and the visitors. They are asked to project their bodily selves into a place as they allow the spatial encounter to permeate their cognitive sensors&mdash;their eyes, ears, and skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Set within a white cube exhibition space where visitors are barely able to see what might confront them past their first step through the gallery doorway, the installation is intended to be mildly reminiscent of a solitary confinement cell. It consists of strategically placed sensors on the floors, a rigged projector, video camera, and insect-repelling bulbs apparently randomly strewn across the footpath of viewers. Using a circuit-bending technique, the buzzing sound emitted by the bulbs is amplified when prompted by the entry of visitors, and whenever they move across and around the gallery. Sounds, lights, and video taken of people&rsquo;s gestures within the setting are projected upon the walls as the camera and projector are activated so that viewers are able to look at images of themselves in the recent past, the images coming at a few seconds time lag. Most visitors easily discover the ruse and begin to play catch-up or attempt to outwit the ominous surveillance instruments. It is in this sense that the resulting work relies upon inciting visitors to engage and manipulate the possibilities of authoring their encounter of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The suggestive injunction of <b><i>Deepenetration</i></b> goads the viewer to immerse in the constructed environment by being part of the process of producing spatial, visual, and auditory effects that go into making up a highly sensual experience. Their level of engagement is intrinsically volitional. As the lights are activated, poetic assertions of agentive action, such as &ldquo;<i>maglibot</i>&rdquo; (loiter or move around), &ldquo;<i>himayin</i>&rdquo; (break this down into parts or decipher the logic), &ldquo;assimilate&rdquo; (become one or give into the taunt to belong), and &ldquo;<i>baybayin</i>&rdquo; (set upon a path), are lit and made visible on the white wall. These written charges therefore are meant to invite visitors to explore and activate the space of the installation, possibly in the midst of recognizing a discomfiting position, of being asked or made to do things. The blacked-out ambience may also be read as a challenge posed to visitors to traverse the unknown and the indeterminate experiences of art with either a healthy or circumspect curiosity about how meaning and subjectivity are effected. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Clod Marlan Krister V.

It consists of exceedingly fine transparent screens in layers that overlap and create interesting patterns of relative density and transparency. Color is restrained to cool monochrome blues and greens, with hints of yellow and rose. With this particular effect, the artist is able to achieve light ethereal effects or luminous passages in the thin films of color that filter the light from the surface to increasing depths. The artist approaches color as an objective phenomenon, although he does not exclude nor negate the subjective dimension, for such a subtle art may be expressive of highly nuanced states of feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The work invites the viewer to mentally review the painting process as he strips layer after layer like thin veils of illusion until nothing but the ground remains, and then reverses the process as the painting is once more recomposed and one appreciates the total image in depth. Olazo has often modified the basic layering process by crumpling and folding the fine diaphanous tissues, by heightening tonal play in thin sharp facets, and by superimposing quick gestural strokes to stimulate the surface. The total effect is one of quiet sumptuousness and delicate elegance. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Davao International Airport, Sasa, Davao City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2173\"><strong>The Durian</strong></a></strong> </i></b> by Rey Mudjahid Ponce Millan aka Kublai (b. 1974) is a 1,219.2 cm (40 ft) sculpture in concrete installed at the entrance of the Davao International Airport in Sasa, Davao City. It was unveiled on 15 Mar 2003. The work was commissioned by AJMR Holding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> Inc under Alberto M. Soriano and dedicated to the matriarch Do&ntilde;a Carmen Marfori Soriano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Consistent with the body of work of the artist, this piece of public art towers over the surrounding landscape. The concrete sculpture shows a halved durian fruit with six people nestled inside it, in lieu of seeds. The durian grows abundantly in Davao, which is well-known for its durian-related products. The six people birthed inside this sculptural piece are paired representations of the three major groups inhabiting Mindanao: the indigenous peoples, the Muslims, and the Christian settlers. This is consistent with Kublai&rsquo;s recurrent representations of the Mindanao tri-people population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More of Kublai&rsquo;s monumental concrete pieces can be seen in the People&rsquo;s Park in Davao; in the Overview Park in Bukidnon; in the Saranggani farm of Philippine boxer Manny Pacquiao; in a retreat house in Mount Apo National Park in Kapatagan, Davao del Sur; in a cathedral in Tagum, Davao del Norte, in Panabo, Davao del Norte; in Sultan Kudarat in Maguindanao; in Surallah, South Cotabato; at the Enigmata Treehouse in Camiguin island; and around the family-owned Ponce Suites Hotel in Davao City. In 2010, the artist was also commissioned by the Vatican to do a nativity scene for Saint Peter&rsquo;s Square. Versions of the durian piece constitute other works of Kublai, such as the one in Ponce Suites where there are six ladies instead of the tri-people. The tri-people images are also seen in his Nativity piece for the Vatican, in a work titled <b><i>You</i></b> in Kapatagan, and in the monument at Surallah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sculptor sees himself as an advocate of Mindanao art and culture. In a Philippine artistic and cultural landscape where the regional is pushed to the background, the artist has succeeded in getting noticed. He does this through these massive sculptural pieces, usually done in partnership with local government units and other institutions. He continues to undertake several commissions from tourism boards and churches to create public art around Mindanao. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Kelly P.

It was published in the Philippines on 26 Nov 1828 by the Sociedad Economica (Economic Society), an elite collective that initiated projects devoted to the arts. Imprenta de Sampaloc printed this handbook of 22 pages, divided into 12 chapters with 16 illustrations. The publication was preceded by a landmark event also involving the Sociedad. In April of the same year, the first examination of students of the Academia de Dibujo (Academy of Drawing) was administered by a panel from the Sociedad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recognized as the first official art school, the Academia&rsquo;s first director was the esteemed painter and teacher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a>. He was believed to have contributed to the writing of <b><i>Elementos</i></b>. Under Domingo&rsquo;s tutelage, the students &ldquo;learned how to draw still life, render anatomy and perspective, paint in oil and aquarelle, and then prepare colors and surfaces. Sessions were also devoted to &ldquo;outline drawing, decoration, plasterwork both natural and colored&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> 1998, 220-21).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Elementos</i></b><i> </i>details techniques of rendering perspective of buildings and architectural features rather than focusing on painting and drawing (Flores 1998, 220-21). It consists of the following chapters: (1) &ldquo;Introduccion: Definiciones Preliminares&rdquo; (Introduction: Preliminary Definitions); (2) &ldquo;Construccion de las Lineas y Punto de que se ha Hablado en el Capitulo (Construction of Lines and Point as Discussed in the Previous Chapter); (3) &ldquo;El Mismo Cuadrado Visto por el Angulo&rdquo; (Viewing the Same Square from an Angle); (4) &ldquo;De las Pilastras&rdquo; (The Pilasters); (5) &ldquo;Sobre Pilastra&rdquo; (On the Pilaster); (6) &ldquo;Pilastras Vistas de Angulo (Viewing the Pilasters from an Angle); (7) &ldquo;Sobre Pilastras Vista de Angulo&rdquo; (On Viewing the Pilasters from an Angle); (8) Puertas y Ventanas (Doors and Windows); (9) Colocacion de las Puertas y Ventanas en la Pared (Placement of Doors and Windows on a Wall); (10) &ldquo;De los Arcos en la Perspectiva&rdquo; (Arches in Perspective); (11) [Untitled]; and (12) &ldquo;Practica de la Perspectiva&rdquo; (Practice of Perspective).

In <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2176\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2176\"><strong>Entourage</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, much of the whimsicality of his colored works can still be traced in the stylized figuration and the decorative motifs. But this time, the theme of celebration is expressed in a black-and-white alternation of positive and negative spaces and a splurge of textures. The test of a true printmaker&rsquo;s skill, particularly in intaglio, is in the great variety of tones and textures rendered in a one-color plate. The widest range of nuances from deep black to middle tone gray, light gray, and white is explored in this restrained composition. This excellent etching bridges the disjunction between the artist&rsquo;s concern with lyrical, traditional subjects and his predilection for experimental, innovative media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even in 1947, long before Rodriguez became a serious printmaker, he was already an innovative painter who did silkscreen and relief prints for greeting cards on the side. Print was regarded as a lowly craft in contrast to painting, which enjoyed an elevated status among Manila&rsquo;s art lovers. But in the hands of Rodriguez, whose obsession was to give the tedious craft its deserved esteem, the print such as <b><i>Entourage </i></b>is imbued with very painterly strength and dynamism.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It was one of the larger and more popular effigies produced during this period.

Painted in green and yellow, its head was a caricature of former Philippine president Joseph E. Estrada, or Erap, as he was popularly called. The effigy embodied the disastrous effects of Estrada&rsquo;s policies, likening them to the destructive presence of the fictive dragon. The massive work was among the central images carried by the protesters, made to interact with a crowd that reached around 20,000 people that day. UGATLahi devised a mechanical system of levers that allowed them to rhythmically open and close Erapzilla&rsquo;s mouth. A member of the group was positioned inside the effigy&rsquo;s hollow frame. He used flammable insect spray and a lighter to ignite a small tongue of flame from the effigy&rsquo;s mouth (Ito 2005a, 185). The spectacle of the effigy exhaling fire was a &ldquo;fitting symbol for the lies that did him in&rdquo; (San Juan 2001, 168-69). The effigy was paraded from the Welcome Rotonda in Quezon City to Mendiola, Manila, where it was set to flame around late afternoon amid songs and chants of &ldquo;Erap resign now!&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Sobra nang pahirap, patalsikin si Erap!</i>&rdquo; (Too much suffering, oust Erap!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The burnt remains of the effigy were later appropriated as found objects for an art exhibition. Its right arm was salvaged from the ashes and was displayed along with photographs of the flaming effigy. Such were the constituent parts of <b><i>Surrounded by the People</i></b>, an installation piece shown at <b><i>Dog Show</i></b>, an exhibition that ran from 9 Dec 2000 to 6 Jan 2001 at Surrounded by Water Gallery along EDSA, Mandaluyong. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Lisa Ito-Tapang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Ito, Lisa C. 2005a. &ldquo;Dissident Puppets: The Effigy in Philippine Radical Politics.&rdquo; MA thesis, College of Fine Arts, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Juan, Thelma S., ed. 2001. <em>People Power II: Lessons and Hopes</em>.

This format helps focus on the grand steps, strewn with palms of victory and flowers, while also emphasizing the regal pose of mother Spain and daughter Philippines looking upward to the sky to signify both their hope and entente cordiale. Spain holds her ward on the hips as if guiding her on their ascent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still in the classico-romantic tradition, Spain wears a Graeco-Roman-inspired red robe with a trailing train and a crown of laurels. Perhaps this is the first time that the Philippines is represented symbolically as a woman in a native costume. Her white pi&ntilde;a<i> </i>blouse complements the red chiffon upper garment of Mother Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of pure red, blue, white, and ocher in this painting may unwittingly have suggested this color combination to the future designers of the Filipino flag. The brilliant ocher and green tones as well as the energetic brushwork also helped animate the mood of the painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Luna did several oil studies preparatory to the final idea that shows the two figures with their backs facing the viewer.

The Aragonese saint is distinguished for his ardent devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. During intense moments of prayer, he would be lifted from the ground. It is such a state that Arceo chose as the main scene in his polyzonal composition depicting the saint&rsquo;s life. The ecstasy scene is surrounded by smaller ones showing other inspiring episodes of San Pascual&rsquo;s life on earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arceo evoked the sanctity of the subject by limning him in very fine strokes. His finely shaped face, hands, and habit are rendered in red and ocher tones that seem to glow against the monk&rsquo;s deep-brown habit and the greenish-blue sky. The brown vertical form of the saint contrasts with the pale color of the kneeling bench; hence the saint seems to be rising from the earth. This upward motion is accentuated by the dark blue-green cloud forms suspended behind the saint. The highlights on the saint&rsquo;s face and hands repeat the color of the halo around the chalice and host floating in front of the saint. Arceo used red paint to trace the borders of the smaller vignettes around the main scene. Typical of religious murals from the 16th to the first half of the 19th century, the mural is replete with inscriptions intended to educate its viewers. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Although it is a portrait of a particular individual, it is better known as<i> </i>&ldquo;<i>dalagang </i>Filipina&rdquo; (Filipina maiden), the ideal type that was the universal image and model of Filipina pulchritude for many decades. She has soft features; the bone structure of her face is neither prominent nor obtrusive. Her face is rounded oval. Her large eyes are kind and mild. Her sensuous lips suggest a smile. Her chin is slightly cleft. Her complexion is a clear light brown with warm rosy tones, enhanced by a yellow bandana that also sets off her dark hair. The graceful neck emphasizes the white native blouse with its wide neckline and large, flaring, and transparent sleeves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amorsolo did not embellish the costume with embroidery as in 19th-century Filipino portraits because his interest was not in recording material prosperity but in creating and celebrating an ideal type of Filipino womanhood. The natural setting of trees and flowers also romanticizes the subject, who holds a tray of flowers tilted toward the viewer as though to present and offer them. This conforms to the traditional image of woman offering something, whether fruits or flowers, in the implication that she whose culturally defined role is to give pleasure and to offer services is herself an offering to the privileged male.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The artist&rsquo;s first major mural was done for the 1953 Manila International Fair. Its theme, 500 years of Philippine history, encompassed legendary origins to the formation of the republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1964 Francisco was commissioned by the City of Manila to do a historical mural for the Bulwagang Katipunan. This depicts in visual narrative the history of Manila from Tondo&rsquo;s valiant rajahs through the Spanish colonial period and the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the American regime, the Japanese occupation, and the postwar years to the 1960s. Each episode is represented by a major event, such as the Blood Compact and the ritual initiation into the Katipunan, or by historical figures, such as JoseRizal and FranciscoBalagtas, and supported by secondary vignettes. The episodes are neither presented in a static manner nor rigidly separated in isolated compartments. They flow into each other through interlining devices in keeping with the nature of the scenes depicted: a meandering stream alluding to the Pasig and to the building of the city, a bright climbing flame suggesting the ardor of the revolutionary passion for freedom, and curling cloud-like smoke signifying the creative imagination composing the literary masterpieces of Rizal and Balagtas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The murals are characterized by sustained vigor and ingenious inventiveness, as in the choice of dramatis personae representing not only renowned persons but also character types, unifying all in a flowing narrative scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bonifacio episode is one of the most dynamic sections of the Bulwagang Katipunan mural. The central figure is AndresBonifacio, founder of the Katipunan, the mass movement that aimed at independence from colonial rule through armed revolution. Calling his men to arms, the heroic figure rises above the massed group of Katipunero and, straining upward and sideward with outstretched arms, seems to break out of the confines of his space, with the billowing red flag behind him enhancing the forward thrust of his torso. Dynamic movement is further heightened by the long bamboo spears. The sense of movement is also dramatized by the varied positions of the figures. Their background space is defined by a stonewall suggesting fortified Intramuros, seat of colonial authority, which must be broken down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Francisco succeeded in forming a visual language that was both Filipino and Southeast Asian: his bright clear colors of folk art, the flowing rhythmic lines creating decorative patterns, the strong but supple sense of design, and the particular disposition of space that satisfies the Filipino penchant to fill up the entire field. The Bulwagang Katipunan mural is a masterpiece in the national heritage.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The danger he went through as a guerrilla and the holocaust he witnessed would haunt him even after the war. The imagery of his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2183\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2183\"><strong>Flagellantes</strong></a></strong></a> series, to which this painting belongs, evokes the suffering and terror of the war years. Central to this series is the Christ figure, crowned with thorns and face covered by the flagellant&rsquo;s veil, while around and above him, fighter planes wreak havoc on human life and civilization as symbolized by classical columns or arcades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this painting, three hooded flagellants beat their bare backs with a whip. As in a dream, the figures are not in a natural setting of country roads or city streets; instead they are in a symbolic submerged landscape where the sea floor, littered with marine creatures, coincides with the tiled floor of a church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The flagellants symbolize sinful human beings in search of salvation in a ritual of purification&mdash;and water is the purifying element after the horrors of war&mdash;or pilgrims in quest of the truth. The arches create rhythmic intervals indicating the passage of time, and the measured distances of the reducing figures reinforce the sense of the temporal dimension; thus the quest for freedom and salvation is a long and historical process. On another plane, the blue-green depths in which the flagellants move signify the submerged subconscious&rsquo; realm that they probe in order to gain understanding of themselves.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Gone are the backlighting and daubs of gentle yellows that characterized his Amorsoloesque years. Instead there is an almost total opaqueness in the canvas. The grayish blue of the sky, the cumulus white tinted with lavender and orange, the marshy greens of the water, and earthy brown of the architectural structure build up the dominant effect of this opaqueness. This is broken only by the glimmer of the water at the left and central portion of the landscape. An interplay of yellow, blue, white, and orange over the water&rsquo;s shimmering viridian green is the painting&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre. A feeling of refreshing coolness results from this convincing rendition of wetness against a heavy, overcast sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The solidity of the nipa houses and church makes for a very stable, almost motionless picture, in spite of its subject, which is a community in celebratory action. The stillness is buttressed by the horizontality of the picture: boats crossing the water, and the greenish-black lines of another boat at the background, which is the vantage point of the scenery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The clarity of the nipa houses and church at a distance contrasts with the obscurity of the human figures at the main boat, which are logically nearer. This is a deviation from the academic norm to which Casta&ntilde;eda used to adhere. The devotees&mdash;musicians, drinkers, rowers, children, and women with umbrellas in boats bedecked with <i>banderitas</i> (small flags)&mdash;are rendered in a rather naive manner, with daubs of paint concealing isometric structure. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Possibly influenced by the illustrated letters in the Punch magazine of Victorian England, it had its local adaptation in the works of Lozano and a few others. Done in dry brush watercolor on Manila paper, it mainly consisted of the capital letters of the patron&rsquo;s name cleverly formed by trimmed foliage to provide support for the human figures in various activities. Each letter was itself a genre scene in miniature, displaying how naturally the artist could situate the figure to form part of the letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With each letter only a few inches high, the art of the miniaturist comes to play in the finely delineated figures of great variety and the tiny exquisite details of their costumes and accessories. Furthermore, the letters of the name, often on two or three levels, are situated in a lighter background of landscapes.

Apart from their artistic value, they are good visual documentation of Manila in the late Spanish period. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

In the Washing of the Feet, the artist was fascinated by the cloak that Christ removed from his body before he performed the washing and which the painter depicted curled up in a sort of conical shape.

This painting depicts FortSantiago on the left with a brig and smaller brigantines. Offices were built above it during the American colonial period. It is known that only sail ships, such as brigantines and schooners, and not steamboats, were anchored by the fort. Cascos plied the area, and their merchant owners lived in them and picked up cargo from the anchored ships to be transported to the provinces. Just outside the walls of Fort Santiago and beside the wharf is a broad walk that serves as a promenade. Most of Carmelo&rsquo;s paintings of Fort Santiago record a period of transition in water transport when sailing ships, such as two-masted brigantines and bateles, were found in the company of smoke-emitting steamboats and larger engine-powered vessels, along with the small bancas and cascos of the folk. In the background left is the commercial quarter where the foreign merchants built their offices by the port.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This painting is striking not only for its authentic detail of the ships at port and the fort with its genre figures, but also for its vivid atmosphere in the sky where rays of the sun emerge from a bank of gray clouds, and in the clear water that reflects the tall masts of the ships. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

While the painting is in the representational mode, the style itself is not realistic. The figures are distorted, their limbs elongated and transformed into machine parts. The men seem to metamorphose into machines in the industrial process. The theme is the dehumanization of human beings. Natural flesh tones are given a blue-green metallic hue, signifying a shift from the organic to the inorganic. The rendering of the anatomy in the torsos and muscles of the workers makes them look more like gadgets or contraptions than people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist prefers linear articulation of the torso and limbs, while tonal contrast is used to heighten the machinelike effect. The rhythms of the composition, as in the parallel outstretched arms of the two central figures mimicking the beams and girders, suggest the mechanical rhythms of industrial technology, while the clock at the left is a symbol of rigidly measured time. Apart from the theme of dehumanization, the painting can also be understood in the light of the disadvantaged factory worker who deserves just compensation for labor that produces a country&rsquo;s wealth and who is entitled to humane treatment by an exploitative society. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

It best exemplifies Ocampo&rsquo;s prismatic style of the late 1960s. In overall monochrome red except where the red tones modulate into yellows at the center, the interest of the work lies mainly in its numerous facets, like multiple crystalline prisms that capture the light at different angles. The numerous adjacent tonal facets create a lively sense of spatial relationships&mdash;shallower and deeper, outer and inner shapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Relative depth is suggested by the tones of the well-defined forms: shades of deep red growing into grays and blacks as they go inward; reds increasing in brightness and luminosity as they project outward. Shapes of lighter tone gather toward the center of the composition where the focus is on three sculptural forms, bright yellow in their highlights, flame-like in shape, and oriented toward each other.

Illustrative of how an increasing number of artists are becoming inclined toward community-oriented work, <b><i>Gilubong </i></b>consists of abstracted narratives culled initially from a found trove of 18 mm footage shot by Atienza&rsquo;s father in his early years as a ship captain. Propelled by a sense of paternal estrangement, Atienza sought to deepen her research by launching into a series of community discussions during which interviews with seafarers would be screened and to which people reacted and initiated sharing about the physical, emotional, and social demands of having families rent apart by having to work the seas. These sessions turned out to be frank exchanges punctuated with singing of neighborhood musicians. The artist&rsquo;s first set of found images were further enriched with underwater footage shot by deep-sea fisherfolk using makeshift compressors as they set out to earn their keep off Bantayan&rsquo;s waters. Atienza also shot footage on a cargo boat traversing Southeast Asia and on a Dutch riverboat traveling through Rotterdam, the city she presently works from and shuttles to between Manila and Bantayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Keen toward keeping herself accountable to her primary audience of seafarers/fisherfolk and their brood in Bantayan, Atienza premiered <b><i>Gilubong</i></b> on-site. These nightlong viewings of stories of &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; lives borne by working the sea became occasions for even more informal discussions about the consequent stress exacted on the natural and social environment. <b><i>Gilubong</i></b>&rsquo;s backstories of charged exchanges between spouses, neighbors, in-laws and other estranged family members resiliently dealing with single-parenting and overdrawn budgets, dwindling fish harvests, infighting between fishers, corrupt local resource regulators, and family crises that need to be surmounted in isolation did not make Atienza&rsquo;s final cut. Only in the more intimate interviews would respondents reveal otherwise repressed pains from being emotionally distanced from kin. <b><i>Gilubong</i></b>&rsquo;s final form in a sense is a much more poetic film text of fragmentary renderings of routines foisted on those entangled in the global traffic of labor across the planet&rsquo;s waters. By confronting viewers with three parallel vignettes of lives at sea, <b><i>Gilubong</i></b>&rsquo;s screenings made for arguably immersive sensory encounters. The work has navigated its way through the makeshift screening spaces of homes, barangays, the Madrilejos National High School gym and church plaza, to the well appointed gallery spaces of Manila, Bacolod, and Kuryokhin, Saint Petersburg, Russia. Collaboratively supported by the NCCA, the Office for Culture and Design, and Dienst Kunst en Cultuur, <b><i>Gilubong</i></b> gained for Atienza residencies at La Trobe University, Liverpool Hope Creative Campus, Artesan Gallery Singapore, and Omi International Artist&rsquo;s residency, New York, as part of her winning the 2012 Ateneo Art Award. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It is 12 cm tall, of at least 18-karat gold, solid-cast, and weighs 1.8 kg. The period between the late 13th to the early 14th century has been proposed as a date for this image. There is some lore surrounding its origin and provenance, but the story of its discovery in 1917 is borne out by the only known primary documentation from this period, written by the American anthropologist Henry Otley Beyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beyer&rsquo;s account states that the image was accidentally found in Esperanza, Agusan, by an unidentified woman. Some have suggested that she was a Manobo, after Beyer cited a statement by the ethnologist John M. Garvan who mentioned that Manobo leaders claimed the image had been secretly kept by some members for many generations, until it was lost in a flood in the late 19th century (Kelly 2011, 262). The image was found protruding out of the mud on the left bank of the Wawa River, a tributary of the Agusan River, after a storm and flood. A local government official named Blas Baklagon acquired the image from the woman, and brought it to the attention of Beyer in 1918. Beyer, who was then chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of the Philippines and concurrent honorary curator at the National Museum, made representation to the American colonial government for the purchase of the image for the Museum. Unfortunately, this proved unsuccessful as the government claimed it had no available funds for this purpose. The Agusan Coconut <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> eventually took ownership of the image from Baklagon, who owed the company an extensive debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1920, Dutch art historian F. D. K. Bosch, a colleague of Beyer, examined photographs of the image and briefly commented on them in a letter to Fay-Cooper Cole, then Southeast Asian curator at the Field Museum in Chicago (Cole incidentally had also conducted extensive ethnographic fieldwork in the Philippines). As word of the image spread, it sparked the interest of Mrs Louise Adriana Wood, wife of Leonard Wood, then United States governor-general in the Philippines. Fearing that the image might be melted down for its value in gold, Mrs Wood enlisted the help of Cole and Shaler Matthews, a professor in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago, to raise funds for its purchase. In 1922, the image was successfully acquired for the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Agusan image depicts a seated female figure in the <i>padmasana</i> or full lotus position, with the legs folded and crossed, and each foot resting on the opposite thigh. She is oriented frontally, and wears considerable ornamentation consisting of a floriated mountain-shaped crown and a halo, neck adornments, a long chain crossing her breasts and back, a low waistband with a quatrefoil near the navel, and floriated rings on the upper arms, elbows, and wrists. She has a rather longish face, with a wide forehead, slightly downcast eyes, a wide nose, full lips, and a short chin resting on a strong neck. Her torso, lean but with pronounced breasts, is carried regally, while her arms are akimbo with fingers curled inward, the backs of her hands resting on her hips. Two loops at the bottom of the image might have secured it to a base previously, but are now missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While these features are clearly apparent, the identity of the Agusan figure continues to be a matter of contention. Beyer suggested that she was a Saivite goddess, while his art-historian colleague Bosch posited that she might have represented a Mahayana Buddhist <i>tara</i>.<i> </i>Later, Juan Francisco argued that closer links to Buddhist, rather than Hindu, images in Southeast Asia made her more likely an Indo-Javanese queen, a goddess of Mahayana Buddhism or a tara associated with Tantric Buddhism. Tibetan scholar Rob Linrothe, on the other hand, identifies the Agusan image as one of the four &ldquo;inner&rdquo; offering goddesses in a three-dimensional Vajradhatu, or Diamond World, mandala<i> </i>(a cosmic diagram).<i> </i>This offering goddess is identified as Vajralasya, who is always shown with her hands on her hips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Stylistically, the Agusan image has been linked to East Javanese (Nganjuk) images, although scholars do not discount production of the image in the Philippines, either by local artists or by foreign artist residents in the area. The presence of the image in the Philippines allows for conjectures on a possible Hindu-Buddhist period in the country (most likely related to the Sri Vijaya and Majapahit cultures of Indonesia) prior to the introduction of Islam and Christianity.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

It has as subject the three martyred priests&mdash;Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora&mdash;grouped as a composite form upon a large cross that doubles as the garrote, the instrument of their execution. The hooded central figure, the skulls, and the bony, tortured fingers upon the beams acquire an awesome expressionist quality. This is further brought out by the painterly approach with its spontaneous brushwork and direct application of pigment in streaks of reds, blues, and blacks that build up a harsh and intense spiritual drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The figures are set against a vast background of endless sky and sea, suggesting history and immortality, marked by lighting and streaked with blood. The subject and theme of this work is clearly historical but, unlike ordinary historical paintings, it goes beyond the illustration or narration of an event with its dramatis personae; this evokes in an expressionist style a heightened mood of heroic martyrdom and sacrifice of great historical significance. The artist is more concerned with conveying the spirit of the momentous event rather than its concrete material circumstances. The execution of the three priests left a lasting impression on the mind of JoseRizal. For many, it marked the awakening of nationalist consciousness that led to the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Rendered in near monochrome grey with hints of color using oil and acrylic paints as well as graphite, Ventura&rsquo;s complex layering technique reveals forms that seem to burst within the pictorial space. The divide in the composition is suggested by the tonal contrast between the left and the right portions of the canvas. Rather than presenting the horses separately as solid elements, the layering shows nuances in texture and value, which heighten the effect of movement and drama. The leftmost figure exposes the horse&rsquo;s skeletal frame; the one next to it its musculature. Morphing into the center is a rigid form akin to sculpture, oriented toward the right side, vividly detailed yet imbued with a semitransparent quality. Forms placed further right consist of human limbs that coalesce with the white horse. A man&rsquo;s body can be found adrift, an aftermath of being struck by the animal or as an indication of struggle against it. The horses on either side show a conical spectrum of the rainbow emanating from their eye sockets, the reverse pattern of colors suggesting opposing perceptions of reality. The turbulent composition is underscored by the text that reads &ldquo;The Battle of the Century.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title <b><i>Grayground </i></b>evokes the motif of the painting on one hand, and intimates the significations of gray as a liminal space, on the other. Presenting a tableau of near obliteration, <b><i>Grayground </i></b>finds resonance in the dynamics and contradictions of contemporary life. The work<b><i> </i></b>testifies to the artist&rsquo;s ability to teeter between one stylistic technique and another, creating dense imagery replete with symbolism and meaning. As a visual strategy, the artist&rsquo;s technique of combining hyperrealist painting, cartoon drawings, and stencil often used in graffiti, results in an amalgamation of elements drawn from the academic tradition and popular genres. Thematically, Ventura&rsquo;s works employ juxtapositions that question contending ideas such as those that have to do with the sacred and the profane, human agency and animalistic tendencies, man and machine, and the ideal and surreal. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

The figures are made of thin metal sheets shaped by the strategic application of heat to suggest the body, wings, and tail and then welded together to form a whole figure. The shiny bronze medium reflects the light at different angles, suggesting movement. Furthermore, rows of fine parallel rods are welded to the solid forms of the wings and tail to suggest spreading feathers as in flight, at the same time that they contribute a dynamic textural quality and a sense of bristling life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this work, two birds interact with each other against a wooden panel. With feathers spread to their fullest span and lightly touching, their positioning with respect to each other suggests a circular and continuous flying gyration, possibly as in a courting dance. The sense of movement is further enhanced and developed by the long, curvilinear lines incised in the wooden background. In fact, the wooden panel, an integral part of the work, is treated as sculpture by means of the artist&rsquo;s incision technique. It also situates the birds in a landscape, with the stylized rows of plants at the lower border suggesting the earth above which is airy space where the birds fly. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

There is a strong central focus on the figure that personifies the multiple concepts of madonna: with a halo of sparkling foliage upon the bright rising sun; Inang Bayan, the Philippines as Mother Country; and Tree of Life drawing vitality and strength from the native soil, as the trunk and roots that extend from her figure suggest. The background, with its tropical bamboos and hills, is the Philippines. In the foreground, symbolism takes precedence; the ground that is also the madonna&rsquo;s flowing skirt with broad <i>maria clara </i>panels becomes the red, white, yellow, and blue of the Philippine flag in supple folds, completed by the orange sun of the halo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A striking device derived from surrealism is the metamorphosis of the central panel of folded and creased white cloth into a long meandering road or river that goes beyond a suggestion of prison bars that dematerialize and open into a tranquil blue space, symbolizing the much desired freedom; the word <i>kalayaan</i> or freedom is written under a fold of white cloth. The road to freedom is not easy, however, for in the foreground are signs of suffering and sacrifice: a small red section of the flag &ldquo;stains&rdquo; the lower section like blood on the white cloth; the cloth itself is crumpled and creased like rugged terrain, and upon it lies a skull, symbolizing the martyrs in the people&rsquo;s struggle for freedom. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Bold brushstrokes traverse the canvas with a diagonal left to upper right orientation. The traces of the paint-loaded brush are highly visible, overlapping, and forming thick ridges, pools of pigment, and streaks and splatters of impasto. There are some areas of defined color-shapes to stabilize and give weight to the composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the title suggests, this abstract painting alludes to nature, indeed to a specific natural scene, which is that of the famous Nikko hills of Japan. Thus the colors used are predominantly on the cool side of the spectrum, greens and blues with their ochers and occasional bright notes. Together, the hues, with their painterly quality, convey the sense of a large and dense forest; the live pigment brings out a feeling of material immediacy and accessibility, at the same time that the composition with its interaction of figure and space implies perspective distance. The orientation of the massed gestural strokes that constitute the figure creates an asymmetry that approaches zen aesthetics also implied in the figure-space relationship: the power of the brushstrokes is able to invigorate and charge the surrounding space with energy. Moreover, gestural painting draws its sources not only from surrealism but from Asian calligraphy as well, which places a premium on spontaneity and quick insight. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Supported by a single metal rod, the sculpture consists of a headlike form carved in wood and encased by a helmet. In place of the human features is a central hollow in the carved wooden form containing a mechanism with a lever and spring, suggesting the potential for movement. The basic simplicity of the form, with the mechanism as its central feature, conveys an intensity of concentration and a mechanical precision beyond ordinary human requirements, qualities essential to the dangerous high-velocity sport of Grand Prix-formula car racing. There is a notable contrast in medium between the impersonal and symmetrical metal form of the helmet and the brown and organic wooden shape with its veins suggesting living warmth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his works Elizalde Navarro has shown a fascination with mechanical forms, on the one hand, and human shapes, particularly &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; masks, on the other hand. Another artistic concern is the interplay of figure and space by the use of metal rods and pipes that create linear patterns rather than solid masses. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3490\"><strong>Marina Cruz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3683\"><strong>Leeroy New</strong></a>, Tatong Torres, Pamela Yan, Cris Villanueva, and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3846\"><strong>Cos Zicarelli</strong></a></strong>, this group exhibition is the intermedia component of the Second Dumaguete Terracotta Biennale. <i>Tampo lapuk </i>is a Visayan phrase that references the additive process involved in making terra-cotta, or baked clay. The exhibition was held at Museo Vicente where the library and memorabilia collection of the educator Vicente Sinco are kept. Sinco established the Foundation University in Dumaguete. The exhibition ran on 10-12 Jul 2007 with the curatorial efforts of Flaudette May Datuin and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3584\"><strong>Riel Hilario</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ang Huwad na Bernardo Carpio Pagkalipas ng Apat na Siglo</i></b> is one of Tapaya&rsquo;s early dioramas. It is a form that he began to experiment with in 2005. A diorama is a multidimensional display medium often employed in museums and galleries to illustrate a historical tableau. The deliberate selection of the diorama as a narrative device is Tapaya&rsquo;s reaction to the exhibition site. Sinco&rsquo;s study room in Museo Vicente is transformed into a place where personal possessions are treated as objects for retelling the past. Here, the room is emphasized as a means of containment or as if it defined the space of a larger, human-scale diorama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The work appropriates the legend of Bernardo Carpio, a Filipino giant chained in a cave in the mountains of Montalban by foreign invaders. Bernardo Carpio&rsquo;s struggle to escape the mountain-prison is believed to be the cause of earthquakes. The pseudo-protagonist in the diorama is portrayed by Uncle Sam. He wears the iconic tall hat emblazoned with the United States flag. His half-naked figure bears the expression of a trickster: his bulging eyes seem to convey malicious intentions while his mouth smiles provocatively. Bernardo&rsquo;s gargantuan body appears to advance effortlessly in between two mountains while symbols of the Philippines&rsquo; colonial encounters frame the scene. A Japanese fighter plane hovers in the air; a Spanish galleon drifts with the water as members of the Katipunan, though miniscule, emerge tactically from the mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The legend of Bernardo Carpio is a recurring theme in the artist&rsquo;s works. Hailing from Montalban, Rizal, where the narrative persists strongly, Tapaya acknowledges its pervading influence on his art. It has led him to produce works that explore the narrative potential of local myths and legends while exposing astute commentaries on identity, colonial history, politics, and nationalism. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

The cover features the protagonist of the <b>komiks</b> novel <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, the viscount-turned-rebel Fernando who travels to the Philippine colony from Spain to seek answers about his identity and origin. He is shown in a fighting stance, brandishing a sword on one hand, and holding a pistol on the other. Smoke emanates from the pistol&rsquo;s mouth as if fresh from firing. The figure wears a helmet, a white upper garment with exposed chest, and pants. He is set against a predominantly red and black background. Sheets of paper with texts announcing a bounty of different amounts as reward for the arrest of the fugitive El Indio<i> </i>surround the man&rsquo;s figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This composition exhibits Coching&rsquo;s signature style in komiks illustration. His mastery of line drawing is evident in the way he brings the character of Fernando to life as a dramatic moment in his saga is captured. He is portrayed in a dynamic pose, of being in between action and being still, either preparing to strike and about to raise his weapons, or pausing in the middle of a battle. This portrayal of movement is crucial in the telling of a narrative using still pictures, and is an area of expertise for which Coching is recognized. The facial expression depicted is one of mixed fury, anxiety, confusion, and surprise, achieved through the arching of the brows and how the mouth is drawn as open. These are fitting for a scene wherein the hero could be coming face-to-face with the enemy, or may have been surprised in having witnessed the unexpected. The figure&rsquo;s gnarled fingers and flexed arms evoke tension and intensity as he tightens his grip on his weapons. Other details such as the frills and folds of the clothing and musculature are effectively rendered through the artist&rsquo;s skillful handling of lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this illustration of Fernando, Coching visualizes an image of a male hero deeply rooted in Philippine folk tradition, a local icon wearing the scaled salakot carrying a bolo. Fernando&rsquo;s dark skin, a feature that earned him the nickname El Indio, may well resonate with the nation&rsquo;s colonial experience and its implications on the question of a hybrid cultural identity. Just like Coching&rsquo;s other strong characters who are driven by dire circumstances or act out of deliberate choice to go against social norms, El Indio is a rebel that could embody a people&rsquo;s struggle against oppression and aspiration for change. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ryan Francis Reyes</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n\r\n<p>Flores, Patrick D., ed. 2010a. <em>The Life and Art of Francisco Coching</em>.

Domingo followed the pose painted by Francisco Pacheco, in which Mary&rsquo;s hands meet at the fingertips in front of her bosom unlike in Murillo&rsquo;s interpretations where they are overlapped on her chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painting shows Domingo&rsquo;s exquisite miniaturistic technique. Mary&rsquo;s face, chin, neck, and hands are finely rendered with hardly any trace of the brush. Her long tresses are delicate, with each strand of hair seemingly rendered one by one by a one-bristle brush. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> particular visual expedient used by Domingo in his paintings is evident here: the bending of the knee of standing saintly figures to suggest movement and prevent rigidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Domingo used golden tones in the background to suggest a blessed atmosphere. The volume of the clouds is achieved by slight brushwork. These white forms surrounding Mary lend a soaring movement, an illusory effect aided by the floating cherubs flanking Mary and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove above her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This painting was donated by a descendant of Domingo to the University Museum in Cagayan de Oro City. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

It is painted in the miniaturist style in which the exquisite refinements of costume, the embroidery, and the transparent fabric and textures are rendered with painstaking skill as in miniature paintings&mdash;all this with the aim of extolling the new material prosperity of the class that benefited from export-crop agriculture as landlords, merchants, and agents of the foreign trading houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Malantic took great pains in capturing to perfection the delicate embroidery on the transparent flaring sleeves and pa&ntilde;uelo or kerchief, as well as the satiny texture of her striped <i>maria clara</i> skirt. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2202\"><strong>Inocencia Francia</strong></a></strong></a> shows off to the viewer a fine gold necklace that she holds between delicate tapering fingers unspoiled by manual work. The marble-topped table, by which she is seated, indicates her social background and provides the opportunity for an incidental still life, an enamel vase holding a bunch of roses, symbol of elite beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Inocencia&rsquo;s sister <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> also posed before Malantic.

Hall of Philippine Religious Images, University of Santo Tomas Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:2.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the end of this hall of the University of Santo Tomas Museum hangs an ivory image of the [<b><i>Crucified Christ</i></b>]. It is considered the largest and the finest ivory crucifix ever made in the Philippines.<b> </b>The image, attached to a wooden cross, is a representation of the recently expired Christ or <i>Cristo expirante</i>, indicated by its head which is hanging down. Despite this, the eyes are not completely shut, and the mouth is slightly open, seemingly awaiting its last breath. The outstretched arms of Christ sag as the body is pulled down by its own weight. However, the horizontal curve of the spread arms complemented by the vertical curvature of the limp body, gives the Christ figure a poised, even graceful appearance, which appears to belie the violence of the crucifixion. The fact is, many Philippine crucifixes are depicted as generally &ldquo;placid,&rdquo; rarely showing extreme agony. The face is calm, evoking a gentle pathos. This quiet suffering is read by some as a projection of the colonized people&rsquo;s own suffering vicariously taken on by Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist has also realistically carved out the musculature of the figure. The arms are taut, ligaments visible, as they strain to carry the weight of the body. The contours of the lean torso are clearly defined, with the ribs subtly visible beneath the flesh. Also visible is the open wound at the side, its bleeding reduced to a trickle. Christ&rsquo;s otherwise naked body is wrapped in a crumpled loincloth, seemingly put together in haste, and bound loosely by a piece of knotted rope. Its folds lend respite to the otherwise strong verticality of the figure. The lower limbs are bent at the knees to emphasize the wounds from Christ&rsquo;s many falls. The feet overlap and are pegged to the cross by a single penetrating nail, the toes still splayed, even in death, conveying the trauma of pain. It has also been remarked that this particular crucifix&rsquo;s attenuated forms may have been influenced by the art of the 16th-century painter El Greco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The [<b><i>Crucified Christ</i></b>], from the head with its meticulously carved hair and crown of thorns, down to the nailed feet, is carved from a single piece of ivory, except for the arms that have been sculpted from separate pieces and are detachable from the body. The cross, which is in wood, has small holes all over, probably used as receptacles for small silver or gold relics or <i>ex votos</i>, or offerings made to the church to fulfill a vow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine religious ivories, such as this crucifix, not only adorned the churches and family altars in the country, but were also exported to Macau, India, Mexico, and Spain. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

During the end of this period, artisans in Batanes and Batangas recut imported green jade artifacts into ear ornaments (Belwood et al. 2011, 30-41). These emerged as prestige goods in the more southern regions of Island Southeast Asia during the Early Metal Age (500 BCE-CE 500), suggesting a long-distance trade that spanned 2,500 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The story of jade in the Philippines begins with a bracelet fragment of green nephrite from Fengtian deposits in eastern Taiwan, likely shaped in Taiwan but found in the Neolithic site of Nagsabaran, Cagayan Valley (1800/1500 <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">BCE)</span>. When high-ranking Taiwanese turned away from using jade for status and began favoring metal, glass, and carnelian beads around 1500 BCE, jade working appears to have moved to Ludao and Lanyu islands (southeastern Taiwan), the Philippines and, later, Batanes. Recent archaeological work in Batanes has yielded a small jade adze with black inclusions (likely Fengtian) from Sunget, Batananda workshop of Fengtian jade in Anaro, Batanes, the latter inhabited between <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>0 <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">BCE </span>and recent centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Fengtian jade came to the Philippines during the Neolithic (4000/3000 to 500 BC), Fengtian <i>lingling-o </i>appeared largely during the Early Metal Age (500<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\"> BCE- </span>CE 500). The Tabon Cave complex excavations headed by Robert B. Fox in the 1960s, for example, yielded no less than 18 green jade lingling-o ear ornaments in Duyong Cave and 14 in Uyaw Cave. Fox (1970) called those with three lotus-bud-like projections &ldquo;Sa Huynh type&rdquo; and those with four projections &ldquo;Hong Kong type.&rdquo; He also noted that debris from the cutting and drilling of nephrite in Batangas reflected a technology that the Maori of New Zealand employed on their own jade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With all excavated green jade ear ornaments in Island Southeast Asia thus far originating from Fengtian in the Central Mountain Range (near Taiwan&rsquo;s Hualian city), a workshop of Fengtian jade found in Anaro, Batanes, and Fengtian jade lingling-o excavated in Palawan, Sarawak, southern Vietnam, and, possibly, Thailand and Cambodia, archaeologists have focused on jade to better understand this ancient regional ancient trade network (Hung et al. 2005). It is important to note that Filipino craftsmen refashioned these ear ornaments and innovated this technology, the latter adopted by the Maori of New Zealand centuries later. Also of interest is that archaeologists in the 1990s began to call these jade ear ornaments lingling-o in direct reference to identically shaped cast metal ornaments that highlanders in northern Luzon continue to produce and use today. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources:</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Bellwood, Peter, Hsiao-Chun Hung, and Yoshiyuki Iizuka. 2011/2012. &ldquo;Taiwan Jade in the Philippines: Three Thousand Years of Trade and Long-Distance Interaction.&rdquo; In <em>Paths of Origins: The Austronesian Heritage in the National Museum of the Philippines, Museum Nasional Indonesia, and the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde</em>, edited by Purissima Benitez-Johannot, 30-41.

Initial works in the series were first exhibited at the Gallery, Regent of Manila, 1978. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\"><strong>Danilo E.

However, even after this exhibit, Dalena continued to paint works on the same subject. Two works from this series won prizes: <b><i>Tres-Seis Dejado</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1974, first prize, Art Association of the Philippines; and <b><i>Jai-alai as Metaphor</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1980, grand prize, Mobil Art Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jai-alai is a type of ball sport known for its speed. Moreover, the sport involves many types of betting, which require predictions on the score outcomes or comparative standing of players and/or teams at the end of the games. Jai-alai is a very popular gambling sport, just like horse racing. In the Jai-alai series, Dalena does not deal with the players or the excitement of the game, but the betting that is done around it. He is therefore interested in depicting people in the fronton, specifically understood as the wall where the ball is hurled at, but also more generally used to mean the entire area where the<i> </i>jai-alai event happens inclusive of the audience hall and betting stations. Dalena often portrays these spaces as filled with bodies, scattered, lined up or massed close to each other, yet each one seemingly indifferent to what is really happening to the other, their sights locked expectantly on the results of the game. In <b><i>Event 13</i></b>, 1978, for example, the people are in the stands, but visibly in a state of anxious impatience and unease. Some are sprawled clumsily on their seats, bored or dozing off; while others are hanging on to the bars, making mindless conversation while waiting for the results of the games. <b><i>Opening</i></b>, 1996, on the other hand, shows a swirl of entangled bodies gushing forth from the entrance to get seats as the games open. In all these instances, the bodies are rendered schematically, as faceless and rounded forms reduced to anonymity, perhaps the preferred state that each wants to be to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art critic and historian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a> remarked on how the betting hall in Dalena&rsquo;s works may be seen as a metaphor of the human condition, particularly for Philippine society in a state of crisis. Dalena himself admits to having been a habitu&eacute; of the fronton at one point when he found himself out of work. It is therefore not difficult to understand how gambling can become recourse in &ldquo;search of luck or miraculous relief.&rdquo; It is this which Dalena satirizes in his Jai-alai series. For against images of a multitude of bettors, it is rare that one finds a winner (<i>llamado</i>). Instead, there are scores of losers, the <i>talunan</i> or the <i>dejado</i>. In <b><i>Talo</i></b>, 1989, for example, a loser leans his head against the wall, as if to take comfort, where there is none, in his own shadow. Betting slips are strewn all over the floor, gnawing reminders of the once liquid cash now turned into litter. The palette&rsquo;s earthy or muted hues echo this forlorn feeling. Yet strangely, Dalena does not leave one feeling totally wasted. Details of the sordid can occasionally make one laugh. Did they just pull up that one body from the crowd over the balcony? Is that person in the audience hall trying to pick that other person&rsquo;s bag? Is a couple there in fact, sharing intimacies?<b> </b>It is perhaps these little things that Guillermo notes as Dalena&rsquo;s &ldquo;sly left-handed compliments,&rdquo; which make him so much part of what he satirizes. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

Filipino wit and humor amidst adversity is effectively portrayed by the artist&rsquo;s caricaturish rendition of personalities.

Jaime Cardinal Sin, with a Jack-of-Diamonds card holds Aquino&rsquo;s right shoulder as he sneers at Juan Ponce Enrile. Enrile meanwhile flashes the &ldquo;Victory&rdquo; gimmick sign of the deposed dictator&rsquo;s political party. A Jack-of-Spades card adorns Enrile&rsquo;s white shirt. Fidel Ramos, in a general&rsquo;s green cap, and the rebel soldier Gregorio Honasan aka &ldquo;Gringo&rdquo; complete the roster of main protagonists, which are all convincingly characterized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A middle-class multitude hovers around the political celebrities, as though participating in a vulgar get-together.

However, the urban scenery, rather than showing images of industrial growth, has a strong folk character that also tells of the struggle for survival in the midst of change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2207\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2207\"><strong>Jeepneys</strong></a></strong></a>, constructed by Filipino ingenuity, are popular means of transportation. The culture does not allow them to be merely functional. They are embellished with all kinds of ornaments, such as metal horses on the hood, false antennae, colored plastic streamers, crocheted curtains, framed religious icons and pin-ups; and painted with arabesques, emblazoned names, and even Amorsoloesque landscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manansala captures the colors, sounds, and pulsing liveliness of jeepneys in a modernist style that places value on design and overall impression rather than on realist detail. The warm colors evoke the sounds of traffic, while the numerous jeepney shapes suggest movement and speed. Clearly, by the early 1950s the modernists had already mastered the lessons of modernism within the Philippine context, as this painting by Manansala shows. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The expressive face lined with suffering, its resigned eyes and mouth open in humble supplication, and the nude brown torso and limbs, with their strained sinews, show Abellana&rsquo;s academic mastery of the human figure.

The composition itself is diamond shaped, the figure&rsquo;s legs supported by a V-shaped base, which is repeated in the lines of the ruined stone building behind him. The figure symbolizes the condition of Filipinos at the end of the war. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">1985. Photograph. Kim Komenich. <b><i>San Francisco Examiner</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The photograph of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2209\"><strong>Joel Abong</strong></a></strong>, son of <i>sakada</i> (seasonal cane worker) parents of Negros Occidental, shocked the world and turned attention to the plight of the nation&rsquo;s extremely poor. Newspaper photographer Kim Komenich of the <b><i>San Francisco Examiner</i></b> was in the Philippines in late 1985 to early 1986 to report on the country&rsquo;s conditions. The international news media had been increasing its coverage on the Philippines in the heady days of protest following the assassination of opposition senator Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino and President Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s battle to preserve his presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Furthermore, world sugar prices were falling and families dependent on a single crop suffered dramatically from greatly reduced income. This, coupled with the neglect of the country&rsquo;s health sector and the absence of economic opportunities, made itself felt among the most vulnerable segment of the population&mdash;the children. Joel Abong suffered from tuberculosis of the bone and died days after this photo was taken. In 2011, Komenich visited Rodolfo and Concepcion Abong, Joel&rsquo;s parents in Bacolod City. The mother reportedly cried upon seeing the photograph because they were not able to see the picture when the child was still alive and only saw the photo reproduced in magazines after their son&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rendered in stark black and white, the emaciated body of Joel caused simultaneous feelings of disgust and pity, pathos and discontent. His head appears unusually large on his malnourished body and his eyes become more dramatically anguished as Abong reels from the yawning pain of severe malnutrition and weakening bones. Occupying just half of the pictorial space, the photo literally illustrates the child&rsquo;s want and a presence that approaches near-absence as he expresses sheer hopelessness to someone from beyond the frame. The bareness of hospital facilities only makes this imaged misery more visceral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the photo appeared in newspapers all over the world, the image afflicted the nation&rsquo;s comfortable economic classes as they were wont to represent and perceive the Philippines only through beautiful images. In contrast, Komenich decided to reveal the hidden misery of the peasantry. Filipinos realized that this image of extreme hunger did not hail from distant Africa, but came from a &ldquo;democratic republic&rdquo; amidst a region of rapidly developing economies. This photojournalist&rsquo;s image of Joel Abong managed to convey to an international public the ironies and tensions in the political, economic, and social life of the Philippines during the 1980s, as seen through the lens of a foreign eye. The photo was able to provide a counternarrative to the propaganda images of the Marcos regime and may have influenced public opinion all over the world at that time, indirectly inspiring various advocacies and social actions supported by the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund and nongovernment organizations. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byJPaul S.

Central to the painting is the choice of subject matter: the workers and peasants who are often marginalized in art but who now occupy the entire pictorial space. They are identified as such by their working clothes and by their tools. Their postures and stances convey dignity and self-confidence, not subservience, with pride as producers of the nation&rsquo;s wealth. At the same time, the warm-red background of the sky hints at a smoldering anger, which is combined with a revolutionary optimism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This painting was done in the last years of the Marcos regime at the height of people&rsquo;s mass actions.

This work was a breakthrough in Philippine sculpture. While the neorealist painters had banded together in defense of modernism that depicted genres in various approaches akin to cubism, impressionism, and fauvism, Abueva was practically alone in exploring the Neo-Realist viewpoint in three-dimensional art. During this period, norms of contemporary sculpture were still prevalently defined by the classicism of GuillermoTolentino, on the one hand, and the realism of religious statuary art, on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Kaganapan </i></b>literally interprets the female reproductive function as woman&rsquo;s fulfillment. Thus the artist reduces the female form into its most elemental. Frontally, the figure is a simple, vertically elongated oblong, softly widening in girth at the center. Heaviness and stability are emphasized by the enlarged arms and hands cuddling the abdomen. The monotony of verticality is broken by the horizontal lines gently suggesting the facial features, the sleeve line, and the blouse line. The woman&rsquo;s head is rendered too small in proportion to the figure, with her slit eyes, high cheekbones, neat hair, and flat nose devoid of individualized characterization. The artist&rsquo;s stylistic concern is to show the pensive, reflective form of an expectant mother in its simplest physicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The side view reveals that although form is minimized to its barest, the sculptor was sensitive to a realistic observation of a burdened spine and flexed abdominal muscles as posture suggests a ninth-month wait. The marble oeuvre has an overall texture of a roughly hewn finish repetitively wedged by a small, round chisel. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It ran in the wartime <b><i>Tribune</i></b> for almost a year from 1942 to 1943. The Japanese probably chose Velasquez as one of the illustrators of the <b><i>Tribune</i></b> due to the popularity of his prewar comic strip <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></i></b>, which was a comic look at the cross-pollination of Filipino and Western mores. The characters in <b><i>The Kalibapi Family</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>on the other hand, encouraged local mores and customs and the learning of the Japanese language. Many critics have therefore dismissed Velasquez&rsquo;s <b><i>The Kalibapi Family</i></b> as mere tool of Japanese propaganda. In the 7 Dec 1943 issue, <b><i>The Kalibapi Family</i></b> counters this claim as Velasquez offers a satirical commentary on the dire state of affairs during the war and the inanities of Japanese programs (Cheng Chue 2005, 83-5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Peppered throughout the strip are witty but subtle commentaries referring to the difficulties experienced by ordinary Filipinos who could not eke out a living during the occupation and the rampant food shortage. It also referred to the valueless peso and how little one could buy with one&rsquo;s money. The comic strip shows Tio Tasyo sulking as he laments over the difficulties of buying and selling. Feeling hungry, he goes to a restaurant and checks out the menu and the price of food. Surprised by the cost of food, he asks a waitress if chop suey<i> </i>(mixed vegetables) and a plate of rice really costs 3.50 pesos. The waitress confirms the price, reminding him that the price is inclusive of tax. The next panel shows a rather peeved waitress telling Tio Tasyo not to eat if he has no money. Tio Tasyo then reluctantly agrees to order food, saying he has no choice since he has to fill his stomach. The last panel depicts Tio Tasyo reacting with revulsion as he overhears another customer saying that he has heard that the restaurant serves cat meat as a substitute for chicken or pork. Here, Velasquez questions the wisdom of the substitution the Japanese imposed to address the shortage of resources in the country. In some of his comic strips, therefore, Velasquez was able to use wit and humor to subtly undermine Japanese programs. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</em></strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Cheng Chue, Karl Ian U. 2005. &ldquo;The Stories They Tell: Komiks during the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1944.&rdquo; <em>Philippine Studies</em> 53 (1): 59-90; 77-78.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

His artistic concern here is to put together simple, flat masses into a vigorous composition of organic forms. Using only two colors, the underprinting of intense black and overprinting of ultramarine blue result in a rich interplay of opacity and opalescence. The two heads in passionate caress make up the design fulcrum from which germinate a wealth of fruit, flower, and leaf forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Xylography is an ancient Asian craft founded on frugality of means and material: raw blocks of wood and simple chisels. The native Filipino is innately proficient in it. In the early 1960s, when artists of the Neo-Realist school were doing genre subjects in the medium, Paras-Perez was exploring the expressionistic and philosophical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">First exhibited at the Luz Gallery in 1962 after the artist returned from his masteral studies in the United States, <b><i>TheKiss</i></b> became a high mark in Philippine graphic art. The uniqueness of Paras-Perez&rsquo;s artistry is found in the way he melds primordial Oriental feeling with a highly disciplined Occidental intellectuality. He later moved on to develop a multiple image approach to a single form or figure as he probed symbols and meaning in the Eastern anagram Yin-Yang. Aside from his individual style, Paras-Perez&rsquo;s contribution to graphic arts is his impeccable professionalism in the practice of printmaking ethics.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The frame is painted in bright red, orange, and green. It is composed of three sections, the top a stylized rounded pediment embellished with carved floral and leaf motifs. The remaining sections are the sides or wings identically adorned.

Mary carries Jesus with her left arm; on her right is a rosary, which Jesus also holds. However, certain features distinguish this actual piece. First, Mary&rsquo;s pose is styled like the Kuan-Yin, the Chinese goddess of mercy, as in the tilt of her head. Her garments are also decorated in a uniquely Chinese style&mdash;particularly, instead of simple flowing lines, a series of bead-sized leaflike decorations adorn the hem of her cape. Mary&rsquo;s blue cape is also worn such that the hem is drawn across her figure in curves accented by the aforementioned designs. In turn these designs set off the borders of the sleeves of her red robe and that of her collar. Both the sleeves and the collar are likewise decorated with the gold-leaf designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Christ is uniquely adorned with <b>potencias</b>, rays emanating from the top of his head in the shape of trident-like flames, a symbol of wisdom inspired by Buddha images.

The men and women of the audience are engrossed in listening to the music, a perfect image of gentility. To further bring out the mood of internal absorption and quiet appreciation, the faces of the listeners on the left are set against the open space outside from which emanates the soft warmth of the sunlight translated into the emotional warmth of the artistic experience.

Although there are no recognizable representations in such canvases, Albor has often alluded to the color and light of the Bicol landscape of his youth as haunting inspiration for his abstract lyricism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/584\"><strong>Kuwadro</strong></a>No.22</i></b>, the artist brushed several layers of underpainting in various colors: black, brown, vermillion, and purple in broad strokes and whiplashes. Nuances of light and dark, and effects of receding and advancing of flatness and shimmer are efficaciously played upon. Lines projected from the ends of the canvas intersect at the center. These were drawn in graphite. Layers of whitewash were then applied to achieve an effect of gossamer transparency. The contrast of raw free form and stern, minimal geometricism encompass the elemental contradiction between nature and technology. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The esteemed elder in this photograph is dressed in ceremonial finery, which includes a <i>bayuyok</i> or feather ornament for the headdress; <i>langat</i> or turban; <i>tangkil</i> or boar&rsquo;s tooth armband; and <i>buaya</i> or necklace of rattan and the teeth of a boar, dog, crocodile&mdash;animals honored for their courage and strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Masferre depicts his subjects in a way that celebrates the beauty that comes from the dignity of the ordinary. His photos are not anthropological documentation but works of art because he captures the emotion unique to the individuality of his subjects and expresses his own aesthetic response to what he sees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2218\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2218\"><strong>Lakay Kabayo</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> is a closed composition. Masferre intentionally draws the viewer&rsquo;s eyes into the composition, keeping it within the frame&rsquo;s major focal area. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> looks directly between the eyes of Kabayo, as if one were sitting across the elder, also enjoying a pipe in the Bontok community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The photographer almost fills the frame fully with his subject. By maintaining a background of darkness, Masferre allows the human figure to dominate. His image acquires the powerful solidity and immovability characteristic of a classic triangular composition. Although a soft, three-quarter natural light illuminates the subject, the portrait is characterized by a control of tonality. His use of a strong contrast between dark and light imbues the black-and-white portrait with characteristic vitality and directness. The keen handling of illumination does not only provide textural reality (as in the skin, fabric, and weaving on the necklace) and strength of character; it also adds human warmth, making the photograph exude a feeling of realism. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Felice P.

Lorenzo&rsquo;s heavy brushstrokes and rough textures are built on a much keener adherence to natural proportions and a more sensitive interpretation of realistic form whether of landscape, still life, or human figure. His distortions are always moderate and consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Landscape</i></b> manifests basic qualities that characterized an earlier direction which he had been pursuing since his first Philippine exhibition at the Philippine Columbian Club in 1934.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Heavy brushstrokes work out a richly impastoed surface of tempered colors. This canvas is an ideal model for students studying the many nuances of color and tonal value. A closer look reveals that the brown is rendered from combined touches of burnt amber, sienna, vermilion, crimson, and purple. All hues are moderated by varying amounts of white to create tints. Otherwise, they are mixed with a dash of the respective complementary color to modulate intensity. Pure color is rendered lush and cool as an effect of the skillful interplay of variations of brown and blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pictorial structure is based on a suggested pointed arch formed by the meeting of branches of two giant trees that frame a forest clearing. Foreground and background would have been equivocal because of the absence of shading. Perspective is suggested by the contrasting scale of the gigantic trunks and the diminished size of the nipa hut.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Here the pictorial space is dominated by a large plant that stands in the midst of an urban landscape, occupying the lower fifth section of the field. The influence of cubism is seen in the simplified, geometricizing treatment of the city structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The plant itself spreads out over the entire space. It has a vigorous, spiky character&mdash;its large leaves luminous in white and ocher tones, its bladelike edges signifying burgeoning organic growth that is reinforced by the vertical and diagonal rhythms of the supporting stems or stalks in a cluster of cubist influence. The planes and facets are large and of petallike fineness in texture; contrast is created with smaller curvilinear shapes, between the petallike stamens and pistils of a gigantic bloom. A sense of liveness is conveyed by the various tones of green, ocher, and white modulating in various intensities and with effects of transparency. The flowering plant stands tall against a neutral sky, which is also the ground for the dominant figure. The artist sees to it, however, that the sky is not mere empty void; random marks and inflections, as well as modulations of tone, give it a presence of its own, at the same time it serves to bring out the vitality of the organic plant form. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

This work was first presented in the Second Dumaguete Terracotta Biennale as part of the <b><i>Tampo Lampuk</i></b><i> </i>exhibition in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Set within the premises of the Foundation University, Cruz assembles a classroom environment. Hanging on one wall is a sepia-toned acrylic painting depicting Laura in class. She is caught in the moment of teaching, her mouth slightly open and her forearms upraised with a puppet on each hand. The young students focus their attention on the teacher, their backs turned away from the viewers. The dress worn by Laura in the painting is also recreated as sculpture. Made with epoxy layered with polychrome paint, the form appears hollow yet is sturdy, with the surface made sensuous through its visual and tactile effects. The artist first practiced casting pliable material as part of her undergraduate thesis at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a>. Over the following years, she developed the technique in succeeding works, progressively working with this material. The sculpture&rsquo;s exterior reveals the intricacy of the lace as its impression is cast from the armature of the dress. The figure&rsquo;s posture approximates a teacher&rsquo;s stance: arms raised like a conductor addressing a chorale, leading them in unison and inspiring its members to act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cruz heightened the simulation of the experience by arranging found chairs in the university, as they would appear in a classroom. She used black cloth to form an enclosure where images are projected. The transitioning pictures trace the cycle of appearance, loss, and eventual reappearance of each student, a reference to the routinary attendance checks done by teachers. The element of time is a crucial aspect in this installation. The fleeting images intimate a sense of impermanence and the urgency of time&rsquo;s passing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Laura-in-Absentia </i></b>is Cruz&rsquo;s memory work. It incited a dialogue with the exhibition site at Museo Vicente, an institution that attempts to remember in perpetuity an influential teacher-administrator in the person of Vicente Sinco. On a subjective level, <b><i>Laura-in-Absentia</i></b> is the artist&rsquo;s gesture of homage to her kin of women educators who have largely shaped her vision in art and in life. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

The cubist geometricizing style lends itself successfully to the subject. Structured into planes and facets, the madonna and child figure acquires an essential simplicity and austere purity. The central figure conveys a presence that consists of the combination of vulnerability in the lack of social embellishments, and dignity and solidity in the broadly structured lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist renounces single-point perspective in favor of multiple perspective, particularly in the houses where the planes of the roofs and walls meet at varying angles, the better to convey the sense of crowding. Unlike in the style of analytical cubism, he does not fragment and dissect the human figure, leaving stray clues of its identity. Instead he stays close to the figure, which he simplifies into its basic geometric structure. For Manansala, cubism was not a fragmenting or dehumanizing principle but a structuring one. The artist also brings out the humanism of the subject in the expressive faces&mdash;the mother with a keen and wary look, and the child reaching up to his mother&rsquo;s face in a protective gesture against the cruelty and injustice of the world. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong>Madonna of the Slums</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> is a key modernist painting of the 1950s. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Pictorial space is treated as a flat plane divided into the contoured shapes of the women&rsquo;s figures and the angular forms of the hawker&rsquo;s nipa shed and mats. A perfectly balanced composition becomes the basics of what is apparently a sheer clash of intense hues squeezed straight from the tube.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scarlet and manganese blue are the dominant colors interplayed. Rough brushstrokes of red on the central figure&rsquo;s baro (blouse) echo the redness of the earth on which she squats. The blue mat at the foreground, on which are laid out blue squash, lavender eggplants, and yellow garlic, becomes the picture&rsquo;s stabilizing horizon line; the lean-to is the axis. Plaids of the tapis or overskirt and stripes of the <i>panyo</i> or handkerchief become decorative patterns that are repeated at the background and periphery. These all add up to a truly festive atmosphere. Daubs of yellow, lavender, and turquoise enhance the harmony of the complementary colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">While there is no attempt at capturing objective reality, there is an overall intimation of a crowded, noisy, humid wet market scene.

Ayub Cave, Pinol, Maitum, Saranggani Province, Mindanao, southern Philippines. Collected by Eusebio Z. Dizon and Rey A.

The images caused excitement as such earthenware&mdash;shaped into human forms characterized by individualized facial expressions and distinguished by gender and age&mdash;had never come out of any Philippine or Southeast Asian site. The secondary burial urn under study, known as the Maitum jar, came from these excavations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A museum team headed by Eusebio Z. Dizon began to explore what would be called Ayub Cave, named after the Moro National Liberation Front leader who controlled the area. During 1992 and 1995, archaeologists excavated 29 low-fired secondary burial jars in situ, despite the site having been earlier heavily disturbed. Samples from soot taken from a small pot found inside one of the Maitum urns yielded the calibrated radiocarbon dates of 5 <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">BCE</span> to <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">CE</span> 225 and <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">AD</span> 70 to 370, a period straddling the Philippine Late Neolithic and Early Metal Age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2224\"><strong>[Maitum Jar No. 21]</strong></a></strong> represents the most complete of the secondary burial urns in the assemblage. It consists of a jar and lid distinctly portraying a male, which Wilfredo Ronquillo (2011) describes as a child. Except for traces of red hematite (a mineral) on the lips, other surfaces were left unpainted and bore decorative incisions (etchings) and excisions of clay (added on). The lid consists of a head, shoulders, and an impression representing the throat. The head features perforations for hair incisions, well articulated eyebrows, eyes, nose, and incised teeth. The jar bears excisions defining nipples, a penis, a navel, and a pair of arms and legs on either side of the body. The left ear displays the same contour and orientation as the right ear, a peculiar feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lone earthenware pot found inside this urn bears paddle-impressed marks. This small pot contains parts of human bones, including phalanges and deciduous teeth, soil with pebbles, and shells from land snails. Other Maitum finds indicate that these ancient people were selective in the skeletal remains that they used for reburial. Maitum anthropomorphic jars were found in association with an excavated shell spoon, shell bracelets, a <i>Conus</i> (shell) disk and pendant, tanged metal implements, and glass beads. Such artifacts distinguish the higher-ranked in their society and indicate some form of stratification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">How can one compare the Maitum assemblage in southern Mindanao with the famous burial jar from Chamber B of the Manunggul Cave in Palawan? Both emerged in the Late Neolithic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a>, both used hematite for painting designs such as S-design scrolls, both employed incised and impressed patterns, and both have come to represent the unique vision and sophisticated artistry of potters from the Late Neolithic period. But while the helmsman and the deceased found on the Manunggul lid represent idealized&mdash;ageless, sexless&mdash;figures, the Maitum figures come across as individual portraits of males, females, young, old, pregnant, happy, sad, highly ranked or not, among other indicators of how they had been remembered during their lifetime. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez-Johannot</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Dizon, Eusebio Z. 2003. &ldquo;Anthropometric Pottery from Ayub Cave, Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani Province, Mindanao.&rdquo; In <em>Earthenware in Southeast Asia: Proceedings of the Singaporean Symposium on Premodern Southeast Asian Earthenwares</em>, edited by John N.

Oil on canvas. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3536\"><strong>Alfredo Esquillo Jr</strong></a>. Kim and Fely Atienza collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Esquillo turns an otherwise cloying motif of the mother and child to play up the roles taken in asymmetrical colonial relationships. The painting was one of the most cited pieces in the Whitney Museum of American Art&rsquo;s 2003 exhibition <b><i>The American Effect: Global Perspectives on the United States 1990-2003</i></b>. In turning the iconic image on its head, Esquillo deliberately renders the visages in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a>Kinley</i></b> as put-on or appended with the face &ldquo;seams&rdquo; showing, thus making transparent the performative aspect of the pairing. In the painting, maternal tenderness is subverted when one of the encircling hands of the parental stand-in, American Gov-Gen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> McKinley, is turned into an eagle&rsquo;s claw and a rifle&rsquo;s edge peeks out of another sleeve. In the painting, McKinley coddles an infantilized colonial subject whose face arguably passes off as a young Emilio Aguinaldo. <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2225\"><strong>MamaKinley</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, along with other works in the exhibit, may be faulted for clich&eacute; demonizing of an already much-caricatured imperial power, yet the painting still emotionally resonates in the way the metaphorical adult figure keeps the toddler-midget in check even if appearing unhappy in his arms. Esquillo further paints stern rather than endearing expressions on both the parent&rsquo;s and child&rsquo;s faces. Even on the count of dress, the voluminous fabric physically outfitting the baby only subtly disguises a still very readable American pennant that practically swaddles, if not smothers, the child into submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>MamaKinley</i></b> was shown in America at a time when post-9/11 critique of Unites States retaliatory measures done in the name of its &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo; was hushed if not suspected of being unpatriotic under a heightened homeland security context. Esquillo has since painted a sequel to the work, which is less faithful to the paper doll cutout character of the figures in <b><i>MamaKinley</i></b>. This sequel, <b><i>MamaKinley 2</i></b>, 2008, would inevitably be read against global realignments where the United States is no longer seen as the impregnable imperial power that it used to be. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Degen, Natasha. 2003. &ldquo;Whitney Museum&rsquo;s American Effect Exhibit Opens.&rdquo; http://dailyprincetonian.com/street/2003/10/whitney-museums-american-effect-exhibit-opens/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legaspi-Ramirez, Eileen. n.d. &ldquo;Alfredo Esquillo: Reclamation Project.&rdquo; ART iT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spencer, Jared. 2003. &ldquo;The Global Mirror: America from Afar.&rdquo; <em>Columbia Daily Spectator</em>, 9 Jul. http://columbiaspectator.com/2003/07/09/global-mirror-america-afar.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

The elements of this work are basically two large cubes on the same level equidistant to a plain and upright metal support divided into two unequal sections for a lighter effect. The cubes seem to float in air but are in fact joined to the support by a transparent sheet of glass. The main interest of the work lies in the two cubes that are emblematic of the concepts &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo;; they contain compact metal assemblages of found objects, including tubes, rounded cogs, and planes, organized to subtly suggest sexual features. The geometric formality and technical clarity of the work are mocked by the strong and intense expressionistic character of the twin assemblages made of painted metal parts that are twisted and warped, dented, and irregularly textured. Because of the spontaneous handling of the metal in the cubes, a tension arises between order and chaos, controlling reason and arbitrary impulse; these convey the sense of a streamlined structure with an unpredictable, irrational core. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The Manunggul jar from Palawan was used about 2,700 years ago to protect the remains of the dead. It is valued as the most impressive work of ancient pottery in the Philippines. It was discovered in the Manunggul Cave, Lipuun Point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The jar has a beautifully sculpted lid, unlike other burial jars that have simple handles on their rounded covers. This lid features a pair of small, three-dimensional figures on a boat. The figures represent the souls of the dead rowing their way to the afterlife. The first one has his arms crossed over his chest, while the second holds a paddle in his hands. Both have neatly proportioned limbs and doll-like facial features. Although executed in primitive style, the soul figures are of rare sculptural quality for the period. Their boat to the other world is also crafted in detail. It has a human face carved on its prow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the figurative sculpture on the lid is the jar&rsquo;s center of interest, even the body of the jar invites attention. Graceful curvilinear designs fill its upper section. These designs were painted in red hematite (the primary mineral ore of iron) for emphasis and to provide variation from the jar&rsquo;s predominantly brown hue. As red was considered a sacred color by the tribal group from which the jar comes, it was used by its potters on special burial vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Manunggul jar<b><i> </i></b>stands as sociological evidence of a society with clear beliefs in both the existence of the soul and life after death, thousands of years before contact with organized religions. It also reveals the high level of artistic skills possessed by its neolithic makers, for only a master potter could have created a jar of such original and striking beauty. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Its finesse presages the exquisite skill of the artist&rsquo;s many award-winning pieces in Europe and the United States. Approached with sensitivity as portrait subjects, the two mendicants and their plight are portrayed compassionately. Finely modulated shadows establish a sympathetic mood, softening the rugged textures of the dishevelled clothes. A complementing soft light endows the faces of the children with quiet dignity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Focused are the two subjects, occupying almost the whole area of the painting and situated on the immediate foreground. Hidalgo suggested depth through the use of deep shadows in the background. Evoking a cool atmosphere are the shadows and the bright yellow-green shrubbery seen at the right, glazed with a misty light that is a telltale mark of the artist&rsquo;s early works. The bronze tones of the beggar&rsquo;s skin, red stripes of the young girl&rsquo;s skirt, and the thin blue stripes of the young boy&rsquo;s shirt provide color variety and contrast. The oblique position of the violin in the boy&rsquo;s left hand, repeated by his right leg&rsquo;s bent position, and the diagonal line created by the collar of the girl&rsquo;s blouse that has fallen on her left shoulder offset the verticality of the beggars&rsquo; forms. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Her explorations of images of the Filipino draw from such sources as the <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b>, circa 1590, the <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala </i></b>(The Christian Doctrine in the Spanish and Tagalog Languages), 1593, and turn-of-the century photographs. These archetypal images are cut out and arranged in a composition by means of photo-transfer technology on the print surface. At times, she crops or cuts up the human figures to emphasize their two-dimensionality, which they have in common with traditional Asian art. She may also treat them as silhouettes, which she prints or scribbles on with random design to imply various contents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist eschews any suggestion of perspective in depth by spreading them on the print at all angles and positions. To foreground design and texture and to enhance the flatness of the surface as print/text, she incorporates fragments of texts in old Tagalog orthography as well as gestural scribbles. The texts, printed in the xylographic method of the early engravings, have an aesthetic value while they also provide a historical context. The various figures of the inhabitants of the Philippines in the precolonial and Spanish colonial periods do not only show the variety of costumes but also imply cultural colonization along with class stratification within the colonial order. The relations of the figures pose questions of identity and of illusion versus reality, or sometimes assume the character of mirror images, which suggest self-consciousness in the tensions arising from the encounter between indigenous culture and the colonizing project. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Despite the small dimensions of this landscape, its intense concentration links microcosm to macrocosm. In this image of mystical evocation, the ancient past and the interplanetary future converge, as they reveal an underlying similarity of structures. The winding and tortuous mountain trails of what seems like an abandoned sky city of the Andes, Macchu Picchu, perhaps find a contemporary echo in the elaborate system of gas pipelines in a highly industrialized region, like the Ruhr in Central Europe, which the artist visited in his travels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perspective is elaborated into a contrapuntal network of lines that touch at points, separate, and recede in an irregular zigzagging movement. On the one hand, the images of ancient cities and ghost trails in mountain fortresses include organic allusions to strong and ancient roots. On the other hand, the images of industrial pipelines convey in their formidable metallic structures a latent protest against the concept of Western progress and the human toll that it exacts. The aura of this work, spiritual or magical, stems from the exquisite control of light and tone; it is remarkable how a large tonal range can be accommodated within its small square format. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b><i> </i>at this time had been running editorials and cartoons strongly criticizing President Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s suspension of the<i> </i>writ of habeas corpus<i> </i>and the threat of martial law. The editorial accompanying this cartoon continued the periodical&rsquo;s relentless tirade against the Marcos regime by pointing out the loss of civil liberties if martial law is declared. The editorial asserted that &ldquo;there would be no justice at all, no liberty at all and even less economic progress than ever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this editorial cartoon, Izon personifies martial law and associates it with a rifle signifying abuse of the military. Izon utilizes synecdoche or the use of parts to represent a whole in his illustration of a military policeman about to squash the figure of civil liberties with the butt of a rifle. The viewer sees only the legs of what can be discerned as a military policeman recognizable by the tucked-in trousers and combat boots. The use of inflected lines, shadows, tonal gradations, and motion lines contributes to the filmic quality of this piece. Because editorial cartoons are single-paneled works, the ability of the cartoonist to capture the essence of the message in a brief but effective and powerful manner is very crucial. Through the use of recognizable symbols and because of the dramatic rendition, the potential ills of martial law are effectively depicted in this cartoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Izon also utilizes exaggeration and diminution of size to contrast martial law and civil liberties. While martial law is huge, looming like a dark and menacing shadow, civil liberties is small, dainty, and feminine. Civil liberty&rsquo;s personification as a woman has its roots in the classical era in the West when liberty was personified as a goddess. It is interesting to note that in language, for instance, the term &ldquo;<i>La Liberte</i>&rdquo; is feminine. Izon harnesses this old trope but reworks the representation of a goddess into a Filipino woman with long black hair. She is shown as helpless, about to be defiled by martial law. Like the allegorical Filipinas, this image reflects women&rsquo;s bodies as passive and therefore in need of defense from transgression. This gendered representation is a common trope in editorial cartoons.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It is one of the first examples of shaped canvases, as its shape echoes that of an oval dresser mirror with side hinges on a wooden framework standing on a broad horizontal base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The play of tones creates an unstable, shifting, dreamlike quality, as in the frame that gradually modulates from lavender at the sides to orange rose at the base. The oval mirror with its mottled blue-violet field is at once surface and depth, suggesting a marine landscape with delicate corals and seafoam. Taken as a mirror for the contemplation of the self, it reflects not surface appearance and likeness but the inner landscape of the psyche or the unconscious, unfamiliar, and awesome nocturnal sea, undifferentiated and without reassuring landmarks. The ragged upper edges of the frame serve to effect a transition between this sea imagery and the real world. The geometric quality of the frame with its right angles, restores stability and order; hence, conscious reason. Moreover, the transition from deep lavender, the color of sleep and the unconscious, to rose-orange, the color of dawn and reality, at the base implies the emergence into consciousness and coming to terms with a new day.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Geography and Map Division, Library of Congress collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The project began with a royal request for an accurate map on 1 Jun 1729. Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes Tamon assigned the Jesuit cartographer Velarde to chart the map, who in turn asked Bagay and Suarez to execute it. Due to its size, it had to be struck on several copperplates then assembled together. Bagay did the map and two other panels, each consisting of three views of life in Manila. Suarez also did two panels similarly consisting of three scenes each, one on top of the other. Each panel was accommodated in one copperplate. In examples where the entire work is intact, the map is flanked by the four panels, each of three vignettes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artistic finesse and maturity of the map section is well evident in the symbolic frame bearing the map&rsquo;s title and the details of the dedication. The frame is adorned with two seated muses raising with their right hands a drape on which the details of the commission are inscribed. This cloth is topped by the royal Spanish coat of arms held up by trumpeting putti. Other conventional details in the map are vessels sailing in the waters surrounding the islands. The two panels, each containing three vignettes drawn by Bagay, all involve multifigure scenes. All the scenes are annotated with inscriptions underneath. The topmost vignette of the panel shows Chinese people in costumes denoting their station. The first is dressed in 18th-century European costume including a flowing cape, a wide-brimmed hat, a curly wig, and a beard; the second is the local merchant also garbed in European-inspired dress sporting a<i> </i>salakot (woven hat) and a fan; the third is a fisherman holding his catch; and the fourth is a cargador with several rolls of rope. The middle vignette of the first panel shows four Aeta, three of whom are dancing while one holding a bow is watching them; these Aeta are labeled &ldquo;<i>cafres</i>.&rdquo; Also in this picture are a &ldquo;Canarin&rdquo; or a native of Canara and an Indian sailor, personages frequently seen in Manila because they served in Indian trading boats. The lowermost vignette shows a mixed marriage as portrayed by a European in 18th-century court fashion, his bejewelled <i>indio</i> (Christianized native) wife, and their mestizo son. Also in the picture is a native of Ternate with his lance, shield, and dagger; he listens to a Japanese laborer in tight breeches and armed with a samurai sword. The topmost vignette of the second plate shows two Spaniards conversing, one of whom is followed by a servant who carries an umbrella to shade his master. Both gentlemen wear fashionable 18th-century European clothes consisting of tight knee-length breeches and wide-cuffed coats; they also sport curly wigs. In the background are two indios coaxing their roosters to a fight; behind them are Aeta, one of whom has his arrow aimed at an animal under the tree. The middle vignette shows an interior where a Persian, a Mongolian, and a Malabar converse. The Persian sucks opium from a waterpipe. The lowermost vignette of the second panel shows a cityscape of Intramuros. In the foreground are several indios, left to right: an indio with a cape, called <i>lambon</i>; an indio with black veil, called <i>cobija</i>, on her way to mass; a woman carrying a basket of guavas; two seminaked children; and a man labeled as a Visaya, holding a bolo. In the background, a couple dance the <i>comintang</i> in front of a rusticated building to a tune played on the bandurria by a third person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Suarez vignettes also number six, presented in threes in two plates. While Bagay&rsquo;s scenes consist of figures simply situated against an empty or near-empty background, Suarez&rsquo;s are elaborate, complex, and extremely detailed scenes. This shows that the latter was a veteran in the job, his career antedating Bagay by 15 years. The topmost vignette of the first panel is a scene introducing the most common trees and plants in the Philippines. In the right foreground, a coconut palm is balanced by a clump of bamboo on the left. A man, standing on a ladder against the bamboo, is about to strike it with his bolo. In the middle ground are a papaya tree and a jackfruit tree with overhanging fruits on its trunks. In the middle foreground is a man astride a donkey, with a child beside him showing a bat that he has caught. In the middle ground, two men carry a sick person reclined on a hammock. These scenes show that Suarez mastered the linear perspective. The middle vignette of the second panel depicts an aerial view of the port of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. The lowermost panel is a view of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a> port. The topmost vignette of the second panel by Suarez is a tilted rural scene depicting a crocodile in the foreground and two farmers, one tilling the soil with the aid of a carabao and the other using a carabao to pull a sled. In the middle ground stands a tree from which hangs a cobra that is about to devour a pig; the snake is labeled &ldquo;<i>sawa</i>.&rdquo; The middle vignette displays a map of Guam. The island is surrounded by water in which sail galleons and native boats. The lowermost vignette displays a map of Intramuros, the Pasig River, and the districts across.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bagay and Suarez were certainly chosen for the project because of their skills. Proud of their accomplishments, they signed &ldquo;Indio Tagalo&rdquo; (Tagalog native) after their names. Their successful projects prompted Father Velarde to remark that in Manila &ldquo;there are excellent embroiderers, painters, silversmen, and engravers whose lines had no equal in the entire Indies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1734 Murillo Velarde map would eventually be revised in the succeeding years based on the changing fortunes of the Jesuit order in the 18th<sup> </sup>and 19th centuries. The 1744 reprint of the map shows the symbolic frame moved in the upper portion with a revised text, while an image of San Francisco Xavier riding on a seahorse is depicted in the lower part of the map, signifying the Jesuit missions in Mindanao. The 1788 version shows the absence of the text &ldquo;<i>la Compania de Jesus</i>,&rdquo; which reflected the Jesuit&rsquo;s loss of power due to their expulsion in 1768, while an ornamented frame replaced the images of the inhabitants of the islands. In 1859, the phrase &ldquo;<i>la Compania de Jesus</i>&rdquo; eventually returned to the reprinted edition, following the return to power of the Jesuits in the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

George Hodel collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ramon Orlina pioneered the use of glass as a sculptural medium. Naesa (ASEAN spelled backward) is one of the important series he did in glass after he completed a number of works in the ASEAN countries, particularly Singapore, where he has become well-known for his public sculpture. Most works in this series are abstract. In them arise linear rhythms and contrapuntal passages, centripetal and centrifugal trends moving inward into shell-like recesses or outward in open forms interacting with, as well as reflecting, the surrounding space. In these forms, of a remarkable integrity, takes place a lively interplay between transparent and translucent passages, polished and frosted surfaces, prismatic areas and smooth planes, long graceful movements and sharp, angular definitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From solid sculptural figures, he has created pieces with hollows and apertures with increasing technological demands. A variety of tones and hues have appeared, at first light green, later deeper bluegreens, although other hues, like reds, are rare. Some works bear figurative allusions, such as mother-and-child or lovers in embrace. The appeal is highly visual in the fluid convolutions of form and in the modulating tones of green, now lighter now darker, as the angles change with the light. The multiple layers of depth suggested by the interpenetrating chambers and the smooth crystalline surfaces also invite one to a precious tactile experience. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Watching the versatile Malantic conjure his likeness on canvas undoubtedly helped influence his early inclination to the arts. The cropped immediate foreground rendition of the two sitters, with their torsos regally vertical, suggests their preeminent position in Manila society. Formality is evoked by the paucity of colors, mainly the black of the suits, the silvery blue-green of the vests and the pink tones of the faces, this last color being echoed in the red edges of the leather-bound book that Felix holds. In contrast, the muted chroma brings out the soft elegance of the pleated chemise, the silken vests and their exquisitely reproduced buttons, Don Narciso&rsquo;s Isabela Catolica medal, Felix&rsquo;s embroidered collar and leather-bound volume tooled in gold. Malantic&rsquo;s sharp draftsmanship rendered the clear lines of the sitters&rsquo; faces, while subtle modulation of tones endowed them with a pulsating presence. Fine brushwork, rendering the layered application of the colors, point to Malantic&rsquo;s academic schooling. Only four signed Malantics, this portrait included, are so far known to be in existence. The rest are the portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Francia, signed and dated 1870, and the portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2202\"><strong>Inocencia Francia</strong></a></strong></a>, signed and dated 1870, both also in the Leandro V.

Not so subtly subtitled <b><i>Umutot Ka Hanggang Gusto Mo</i></b>, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2236\"><strong>Nardong Tae</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Fart as Much as You Want, Nardo the Shit Guy) consists of the travails of Bornek, a fan boy of Nardong Putik (Nardo in Mud), the real-life amulet-bearing folk villain from  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong> who ran circles around the law from 1948 until he was finally killed in a dramatic car chase in 1971. Putik gained a reputation for stealing from the rich to apportion his stash to his fellow poor. He was also known to escape armed clashes with nary a scratch alongside a seemingly supernatural ability to extract himself from prison. As a spoof of Nardong Putik, <b><i>Nardong Tae</i></b> is a classic neighborhood bullies-get-their-just-desserts tale overlaid with pseudoscience and risqu&eacute; street humor. Bornek is transformed into a <i>taong tae</i> (walking poop) after he gets beaten up and entombed under a giant turd comet descended from outer space. Already fatherless to begin with, the incident further turns the odds against Bornek who traumatically attempts to finish school amidst the scorn and verbal abuse cast on him by both teachers and fellow students offended by the stink and funk he brings upon school premises. Bornek eventually leaves for Manila to turn himself into an &ldquo;agent of the republic&rdquo; by studying criminology at a university in Recto. He, however, turns to the dark side as one of his teachers attempts to kill him the day before graduation. He unleashes his noxious gases and fecal matter, which wipes out the school and a whole generation of law officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On one level, <b><i>Nardong Tae</i></b> invokes the abject to potentially thwart the sanitizing tendencies of bourgeois tastemakers in the art world who would be the first likely visitors of the canon-making exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. Cordero&rsquo;s uncanny merging of urban folk&ndash;punk horror visuals and grime-suggestive graphics replete with expletives and taunts to polite society force a coming to terms with another world where the unspeakable gets brusquely spoken and where fiction and real life mesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This happens as the antihero Nardong Putik&rsquo;s vaunted antics spill over to the public reception of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\"><strong>Ramon Revilla</strong></a>, or in the comic&rsquo;s case, where Bornek gets his comeuppance as his fart and shit annihilate the people and institutions that alienate him. More than a decade since <b><i>Nardong Tae</i></b> propelled Cordero&rsquo;s credentials to cult celebrity proportions, the eventually exalted status of the comic and its later three-dimensional manifestations as sculpture demonstrate how the abrasive nature of art born of a poetics of the dire, base, low camp, and oddball gaudy still gets ultimately mitigated in the grasp of niche consumerism just as many earlier counterculture motifs became enfolded into artistic streams ravenous for the new. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Caruncho, Eric S. 2009. &ldquo;Louie Cordero&rsquo;s Visceral Art.&rdquo;<em> Inquirer.net</em>, 31 May. http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/sim/sim/view/20090531-208056/Louie-Corderos-Visceral-Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jonathan Levine Gallery. 2010. &ldquo;Louie Cordero Sacred Bones.&rdquo; http://jonathanlevinegallery.com/?method=Exhibit.ExhibitDescriptionPast&amp;ExhibitID=43FEB98A-19DB-5802-<br />\r\nE0051F31F1FBCF3A.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mapa, Diego. 2007.

Upon Tabora&rsquo;s death in 1632, it was given to the Jesuits. Assigned the title &ldquo;Reina y Gobernadora de Nave Almirante&rdquo; (Queen and Ruler of the Admiral&rsquo;s Ship), the image accompanied the galleon La Encarnacion across the Pacific Ocean four times. It was given the name Virgen de Antipolo because native tradition says that it twice disappeared from the shrine and reappeared on top of the tipolo tree each time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To successfully paint a verdadera imagen, an authentic portrait of the cult image, Asuncion was supposed to have fasted, knelt, and prayed in front of the statue. The result is a half-body portrait, which is a veritable <b>trompe l&rsquo;oeil</b>, with all the jewels and the rich embroidery of her brocaded robe seeming to jut out from the painting. Mary also wears dangling earrings, rings on all her fingers except the thumb, crown of stars and a gem-studded gold crown, surmounted by an arch of golden rays and the bejeweled 12 stars of Juda, all realistically captured by Asuncion. A speck of white paint on the ball of her eyes gives the illusion that Asuncion painted a living person posed as the Virgin. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The decorative flatness of their form and stylization of anatomical details combined with the attempts to render the folds of the drapery realistically point to the fledgling attempts of the artist at naturalism, a sensibility soon to be achieved by Fausto Quiotan; hence the artist is christened &ldquo;Predecessor of Fausto Quiotan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The figures&rsquo; flatness is offset by the rhythmically undulating lines of the hem of Mary&rsquo;s cape, white veil, and hair. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Concrete cast. 267.9 x 500.3 x 321.3 cm.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a></strong>. University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong> </i></b> is the sculpture of a standing, nearly nude young man whose feet are together; upper torso is slightly bent backward; arms are spread to the sides with palms up; fingers are slightly splayed; and the head is tilted back, with eyes closed, mouth slightly agape; and the genitalia covered by a leaf. The <b><i>Oblation</i></b> stands on a pedestal of roughhewn rocks from the Marikina River that represents the various islands of the nation&rsquo;s archipelago. Covering its feet and front legs is a spray of <i>kataka-taka </i>(life plant) leaves, which symbolizes constancy, perseverance, and the spirit of service. The sculpture is done in the Beaux arts style. The identity of the <b><i>Oblation</i></b>&rsquo;s model has been a source of contention. Tolentino himself averred that the sculpture was based on two models&mdash;one for the body&rsquo;s build, and another for the long proportions&mdash;but never identified the actual models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The original concrete cast <b><i>Oblation </i></b>was inaugurated on 30 Nov 1935, and initially stood at the quadrangle of UP Manila. On 11 Feb 1949, the statue was transferred to UP Diliman and placed in the Oblation Plaza where it remained until the bronze version replaced it. The first bronze <b><i>Oblation</i></b> was cast by Tolentino in 1958, based on the plaster mould pulled from the original <b><i>Oblation </i></b>statue, which is made of painted reinforced concrete and is currently located in the third floor lobby of the UP Main Library, Gonzalez Hall. The bronze <b><i>Oblation </i></b>was commissioned by the UP Golden Jubilee Committee, which appropriated 15,000 pesos for Tolentino to cast the statue at a foundry in northern Italy. The bronze <b><i>Oblation </i></b>was unveiled to the public on 29 Nov 1958 (Ca&ntilde;ete 2012, 164). It is located in a landscaped plaza in front of the main administrative building Quezon Hall of UP Diliman. Since then, several bronze works have been done. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3461\"><strong>Anastacio Caedo</strong></a> made three versions for the UP campuses of Manila, Baguio, and Iloilo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a> made four versions for the UP campuses of Los Ba&ntilde;os, Tacloban, Miag-ao, and Davao; and Grace Javier Alfonso made two versions for the UP Open University and Philippine General Hospital. All three artists used casts pulled from the 1935 version. The <b><i>Oblation</i></b> at UP Cebu is by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3406\"><strong>Fidel Araneta</strong></a>, who adapted the pose of the 1935 version, but used his own design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">According to Tolentino, the <b><i>Oblation</i></b> as the preeminent symbol of UP &ldquo;stands for truth, and truth is without embellishment at all &hellip; the figure of youth standing on the soil of the motherland, his head among the clouds, his arms ready for the stars, is the perfect background of the spirit of sacrifice&rdquo; (Bacungan 1948, 8).

The <b><i>Oblation</i></b>&rsquo;s meaning is variously associated with sacrifice for the common good and academic freedom. As an icon, the image of the <b><i>Oblation</i></b> has been used in Philippine contemporary art, editorial cartoons, and UP&rsquo;s promotional materials. It has also been appropriated in ritualistic and performative acts such as the Oblation Run held annually in December by members of a student fraternity group. Finally, the Oblation Plaza has also been the preferred site of protest acts concerning various issues in the university and Philippine society. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byReuben R.

She has produced a body of work in glass consisting of irregularly shaped planes often combined and contrasted in texture with rocks, pebbles, jade, and metal. In this work, a table sculpture, the plane of glass is shaped like a crest of ocean wave&mdash;on one side an arching curve, on the other side the dynamic fingers of spray. The glass medium lends itself perfectly to images of water because of its clarity, purity, and transparency. The handblown technique produces clusters of bubbles, large and small, creating a lively textural interest and bringing in the elements of randomness and spontaneity. At the same time, they allude to the lunar-solar symbolism in her prints and other glass works. An etched curving line along one side enhances the plasticity of the form. To add to the effect of lightness, the glass plane opens up in the lower section where it interacts contrastingly with the jade-rock base with its rugged organic texture and solid mass. Unlike opaque materials, the glass medium brings into the sculptural concept the element of change because of its particular sensitivity to environmental conditions, with reflections and shadows forming part of the totality of the work. The artist has also done large glass screens of cosmic imagery conveying the illusion of an ethereal universe. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Envisioned by Eugene Tan, this program was the second in the annual series of exhibitions that &ldquo;explore the curatorial and collaborative process.&rdquo; The exhibition involved five curators from Southeast Asia who each engaged with two selected artists. The Singapore-based curator Isabel Ching worked with artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3484\"><strong>Louie Cordero</strong></a> and Ronald &ldquo;Poklong&rdquo; Anading. The floor space of the warehouse-styled Osage Kwun Tong measured 15,000 sq ft with a 14 ft high beam free ceiling. Curated to appear like several rooms, each artist was designated an enclosed space to realize their project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Anading&rsquo;s site-specific work is a four-channel video projected upon each wall of the room, the moving images scaled to take up the edges of the floor up to the ceiling. The artist&rsquo;s video reconstructs memories evoked by his mother who worked as a domestic helper in Hong Kong. He referenced a collection of photographs she sent in the course of 11 years. Inscribed with a short description of the places she visited at the back of each photo, such mementoes made up Anading&rsquo;s connection to his estranged mother. These clues allowed<i> </i>Anading to revisit these places, where he recorded the search using a video camera. These places were leisure areas like parks, malls, or tourist sites visited by his mother. Foregrounding spatial and temporal distance, Anading&rsquo;s findings revealed how the landscape of Hong Kong had changed since his mother&rsquo;s encounter with these sites: how these spaces looked different or were beyond recognition in relation to the dated photographs and that this in turn determined whether he would still find these places at all. By placing himself behind the camera, the artist&rsquo;s revisiting of the places heightened a sense of absence even amidst his effort to create a shared experience. Anading was present in these spaces while his mother was not.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the exhibition space, the landscapes captured by Anading are layered over by the shadows cast by the viewers who enter the room, suggesting a chance interaction. Resisting a single narrative, each video is looped separately, and their juxtaposed sequence is altered during each viewing. In <b><i>Ocular</i></b>,<i> </i>the artist emphasizes the fragmented quality of memories. He implicates the viewing public in the encounter of unfamiliar places and fleeting moments to which he himself testifies. In this project, Anading extends the bounds of the camera from merely an objective device. He proposes it as a medium that allows one to behold a world filtered through the artist&rsquo;s desires and subjective experience. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

Oil on panel. 40.6 x 40.6 cm. J.M. Olivar. Private collection. The <i>pasion </i>altarpiece was displayed in the family altar before which folk gathered to chant the pasion or Christ&rsquo;s life and passion from handwritten or printed books during Lent. In the early 1700s this genre grew in popularity. Its composition follows certain conventions&mdash;in particular, the painting is sectionalized into three parts depicting the Institution of the Holy Eucharist, the Feast of the Passover, and the Washing of the Feet. It is replete with inscriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:.05in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:.05in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Olivar altarpiece, named after the signature in the piece (probably the painter), the composition is divided horizontally into two planes. The Institution of the Holy Eucharist occupies the upper half, following the renaissance Last Supper conventions showing Christ flanked by the apostles, six on each side. Olivar jotted down the names of the holy personages under their figures. Apparently he painted himself in the person of a genuflected angel on the lower right corner of the scene, under which he inscribed his signature, J.M. Olivar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasion altarpiece was inspired by apocryphal narratives. Above the Last Supper, flanking a heavenly spectacle showing God the Father, the Holy Spirit, Mary, and the saints, are inscriptions that narrate the story of San Gabriel administering the Holy Communion to the Virgin and San Pedro giving the sacrament to Old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/197\"><strong>Testament</strong></a> personalities Enoc and Elias &ldquo;whom the angels carried to heaven.&rdquo; Enoc and Elias, however, are shown being administered by an angel with his name, Ariel, inscribed under him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lower half of this work is divided into the Passover and the Washing of the Feet. Writings below the scene state that the Passover feast consisted of <i>cordero</i> <i>asado</i> or roast veal,<i> pan azymo</i> or unleavened bread, and <i>lechugas agrestes</i> or wild lettuce. The Washing of the Feet is similarly preoccupied with earthly particulars that fascinated the faithful. The inscriptions state that Christ removed his cape (which lies stiffly on the floor), took the &ldquo;holy towel&rdquo; and tied it around his waist, poured water on a basin, approached each of the apostles and proceeded to wash their feet (except for Simon Peter who initially refused to be washed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Olivar altarpiece is definitely of 18th-century vintage. Small and fine details, like parts of limbs and facial features, were apparently rendered with a sharp brush if not a quill. A rhythmic but rigid arrangement of figures and objects was a result of a conscious desire to follow the conventions of painting, then at an early stage of development. The restricted palette, consisting of only three colors&mdash;blue, red, and ocher&mdash;and their wash-like manner of application although they are oil based, also point to an 18th-century provenance. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Older than iron, the earliest archaeologically excavated gold ornaments&mdash;beads from Guri Cave, Tabon Cave complex, southwestern Palawan&mdash;trace back to 500-300 BCE (Bunag-Gatbonton 2014). Perhaps because pothunters had often come ahead of scientists to ancient burial and settlement sites, archaeologists have rarely found gold artifacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1973, a team from the National Museum of the Philippines excavated gold face covers dated from the late 14th to the early 15th century in Katagman (now San Antonio), Oton, Iloilo. Called the [<b><i>Oton Death Mask</i></b>], the ensemble was the first of its kind to be systematically recovered and declared a National Cultural Treasure. So far, the largest quantities and the widest range of gold ornaments have emerged from Butuan and Surigao in northeastern Mindanao and in Samar in eastern Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ancient Filipinos made two types of face covers for their high-ranking dead: (a) gold masks with the eyes, nostrils, and mouth cut out; and (b) gold sheets to cover orifices, sometimes accompanied by a diadem (ornamental headband). They cut and hammered pure gold sheets into shape, in some cases preparing these in situ as snippings were recovered close by. In other instances, they sewed the gold sheets onto a support as evidenced by perforations along the gold sheet borders. Because gold sheets sought to cover orifices that gold masks exposed, the two types may have represented differences in their notions of death (Miksic 2012, 252).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gold masks for the dead can be found in many ancient cultures, but gold orifice covers are unique to Coastal China, Taiwan, and Island Southeast Asia (former and current Austronesian speakers). Reasons for employing gold face covers varied: to usher the dead into the ranks of their sacred ancestors, to show their divine radiance, or to protect them from the profane eyes of the living (John 2013). For some Austronesian speakers, the dead were potentially malignant spirits that resisted going away. Funeral practices up to ethnographic times called for confusing and preventing the spirit of the deceased from returning to haunt the living. Families and villagers would bundle corpses and transport them out of their homes through windows, spin them in circles, or follow circuitous routes to the burial site so that they would lose their way should they attempt to return. Great effort was thus placed in giving proper burials, so placing gold covers on the eyes, nose, and mouth of a high-ranking decease may have, in effect, served as protection for the living. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Purissima Benitez- Johannot</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Bunag-Gatbonton, Esperanza. 2014. &ldquo;Kalinangan Pinanday sa Ginto: A Cultural History of the Function of Gold in Philippine Society.&rdquo; PhD diss., University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John, John N. 2013. &ldquo;Philippine Gold in Early Southeast Asia.&rdquo; <em>Arts of Asia</em> 43 (1): 78-88.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miksic, John N. 2012. &ldquo;Gold Face Covers.&rdquo; In <em>Paths of Origins: the Austronesian Heritage in the Collections of the National Museum of the Philippines, the Museum Nasional Indonesia, and the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde</em>, edited by Purissima Benitez-Johannot.

The sculptural image was allegedly found on the shores of a village called Lagyo, enshrined on a <i>pandan</i> bush and being worshipped by the residents. Standing 20.5 in tall, the wooden image depicts a lady standing with her hands clasped in prayer. How the image came into the possession of the Tagalog inhabitants remains uncertain (Santos 1982, 16; Roces 1980, 55-57). The people of Lagyo said that they had been worshipping the image for a long time already and that they had experienced miracles when they implored the image in times of need (P.D.L.L.T. 1897, 6). The two friars who came with Legaspi &ldquo;recognized&rdquo; the image as that of the Blessed Virgin, and a chapel was built to shelter it (Roces 1980, 57).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Due to the many miracles attributed to the image particularly in aid of navigators, the image was named <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia /  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2245\"><strong>Our Lady of Guidance</strong></a></strong> </i></b>. She was proclaimed Patroness of the Galleons, Captain of the Ships of Castille, and, by a royal decree in 1758, the Sworn Patroness of the City of Manila. She was borne in procession every time a galleon would leave the Philippine port, and was beseeched for help when the galleon&rsquo;s return was delayed. The image was bestowed with a gold cane by a Spanish admiral as thanksgiving for being saved from a mishap at sea (Roces 1980, 65).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Lagyo was renamed &ldquo;La Ermita&rdquo; or the hermitage. The shrine for the image was destroyed by various catastrophes and was rebuilt many times. The most devastating of these was the earthquake of 1771, which led to the long-term transfer of the image to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a> (P.D.L.L.T. 1897, 8). The image stayed in the cathedral for nearly one and a half centuries. The archbishop of Manila resisted returning the image to Ermita. This incident gave rise to the <i>bota flores</i>, a protest procession turned into a fiesta tradition where the residents of Ermita marched to the Manila Cathedral to pay homage and toss flowers to the image. The procession was led by a <i>capitana </i>in a traditional mestiza costume and featured boys in sailors&rsquo; attire. The image was eventually returned to Ermita church in 1918. Bota <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> further blossomed in grandeur on the streets of Ermita after the image&rsquo;s return.

Shrine of Our Lady of Caysasay and Minor Basilica of San Martin de Tours, Taal, Batangas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wooden image of the Immaculate Conception was allegedly found in 1603 by a fisherman named Juan Maningkad. The image was caught in Maningkad&rsquo;s net at the Pansipit River and was brought immediately to Taal by Prior Fr Juan Bautista de Montoya. A big feast was held to mark the finding of the image. The image was then entrusted by Father Montoya to Taal matron Maria Espiritu. However, the image vanished from her home and was found later on the church altar. Thereafter, the image was returned to Maria but again the same thing happened. These events were considered a sign from heaven, so the image was enshrined on the church altar. However, the image also kept vanishing from the church altar only to be found on top of a <i>sampaga</i> tree beside a well in the midst of a nearby forest. In one of the instances when the image was found, a <i>casaycasay</i> or kingfisher (<i>Halcyon chloris</i>) was allegedly flying around the tree. Thus the name of the bird was incorporated into the title of the renowned Virgin from Taal (Barcelona 2004, 55).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image of <b><i>Our Lady of Caysasay</i></b> is made of pine wood. Its paint bears traces of water damage. It is said that the image may have been lost during a shipwreck, as it was brought by Spanish soldiers who were supposed to give the image to a native community. The image itself is carved with garments resembling those worn in Europe (Galende 1987, 84). In later years, the image began being draped in queenly robes of beaten metal and cloth and adorned with a crown and an aureole of 12 stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three edifices now stand as landmarks of the devotion to the Virgin of Caysasay: the Minor Basilica of San Martin de Tours (Taal Cathedral), the Shrine of Our Lady of Caysasay, and the stone arch beside the well and the sampaga tree. This well is known for its supposedly miraculous waters. The Shrine of Our Lady of Caysasay was built in 1639 near the site where the image was repeatedly found. A 120-step staircase made of Chinese granite pieces connects the Shrine of Caysasay and the Taal Cathedral. The image of the Virgin is shuttled back and forth between these two places to accommodate the wishes of her devotees. The celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Caysasay every 8 Dec is infused with colorful rituals and is popular among Chinese-Filipinos. On 8 Dec 1954, the image was honored with a pontifical coronation under the name of Pope Pius XII (Galende 1987, 84; Barcelona 2004, 55-56).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A religious <i>komedya</i> written by Perfecto Conde of Batangas, Batangas, titled <b><i>Haybing</i></b><i> / <b>Comedia Religiosa</b></i>, was first staged on 8 Dec 1929, and many times thereafter, dramatizing the discovery of the image and the life of a Chinaman Haybing whose life was miraculously saved by the Virgin of Caysasay (Tiongson 1999, 12-13). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Dino Carlo S.

For this church, a new image with ivory hands and face was given as a gift by acting governor-general Luis Perez de Dasmari&ntilde;as. A <b>de bastidor</b><i> </i>(hoop)-type image, the Virgin has ivory head and hands attached to a wooden body, which has an <b>andador</b><i> </i>or wooden frame for a skirt. The child is carved entirely in ivory. The <b>santo</b> was carved by a non-Christian Chinese from Ilocos under the direction of Capt Hernando de los Rios Coronel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1646 the Dutch attacked the Philippines. Five naval battles ensued near Marinduque. Although greatly outnumbered, the Spanish fleet defeated the Dutch Armada. It was believed that the Virgin&rsquo;s intervention secured Spanish victory. From then on the Virgin&rsquo;s image has been honored with a feast, called La Naval de Manila, on the second Sunday of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image has been housed in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> of the Dominicans, including the last in Intramuros, which was a neo-Gothic structure designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\"><strong>Felix Roxas</strong></a> Sr. Damaged during the British invasion in 1762, the image was subsequently restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image consists of a woman with a maternal face punctuated by almond-shaped eyes, which identify its maker, and a chubby child Jesus with proper folds of baby fat.

Her great veil embroidered with gold metal thread and its <b>plancha</b><i> </i>(beaten and embossed silver), forming the front part of her chemise and skirt, are from the 19th century. She has a set of <b>aureola</b><i> </i>(halo), <b>rostrillo</b><i> </i>(rays around the face), and <b>corona</b><i> </i>(the last with a smaller version for the Ni&ntilde;o)&mdash;all circa 1811. To symbolize her authority she holds a governor-general&rsquo;s<i> baston </i>(cane), which holds a row of episcopal rings donated by Dominican bishops. For her canonical coronation in 1907, donations of jewelry and cash from all over the Islands were gathered to create a gift for her and her child&mdash;two crowns of 18-karat gold created by Estrella del Norte. In 1908 a scepter of 18-karat gold was designed for her by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3840\"><strong>Crispulo Zamora</strong></a>, which was topped by the pectoral cross given by Archbishop Gonzales of Toledo, Spain.

Early 17th century. Wood. Approximately 120 cm in height. Antipolo City, Rizal Province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Our Lady of Antipolo</i></b> is popular for being a dark-skinned image. The heads and hands are made of dark hardwood and polished with oil, causing the further darkening of the wood over the years. This gave the image a golden brown complexion Filipinos have identified with. In 1639, Chinese residents of Antipolo rioted and tried to burn and strike the image with their weapons. The image sustained wound-like cuts on its right cheek and neck, which are still visible today (Mercado 1980, 49). The image is a <b>de bastidor</b> type&mdash;meaning, the heads and hands are attached to a mannequin frame, on to which the blouse, skirt, and cape of richly embellished luxurious fabrics are draped (Jose 1991, 121, 192). The image of the Virgin of Antipolo stands regally with hands poised below her bosom holding a field marshall&rsquo;s baton in memory of the cane that Gov-Gen Arrechedera offered her after her last voyage in 1746 (Mercado 1980, 84). The image wears an imperial crown, a diadem, and an aureole of 12 stars. From the gifts of devotees, the image accumulated over the centuries a notable treasury of jewels, many of which no longer exist. On both hands she wears large gems, giving the impression that the image has a diamond ring on each finger. To this day, the image stands on a pedestal created from the <i>tipolo</i> tree, which is reputedly the same tree where the Jesuits found her whenever the image disappeared at night from the mission village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This statue of the Virgin Mary was brought by Gov-Gen Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora to the Philippines in 1626 from a parish in Acapulco. The image was bestowed with the title &ldquo;Paz y Buenviaje&rdquo; ( <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong> and Good Voyage) by a public decree dated 8 Sep 1653 under Gov-Gen Sabiniano Manrique (Mercado 1980, 45, 77). This title is historically intertwined with the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade. Faced with the perils of spending many months at sea, the travelers on the galleons implored the heavens to give each galleon a safe voyage. It was the custom then to enshrine an image of a saint on every galleon that was to sail. Among all those that boarded the galleons, only the image of <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2248\"><strong>Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage</strong></a></strong> </i></b> has a record of eight successful voyages: six successful round trips and two aborted midway although these ships were able to return safely. In addition, attributed to this image was one victorious naval war against the Dutch at the port of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong> in Jun 1647. It was remarked that every time the image was on board, peace and harmony reigned within the ship. Elaborate thanksgiving celebrations were done in the Lady&rsquo;s honor each time the galleon docked safely on Philippine shores. The fluvial procession in her honor was held several times, including on the occasion of her canonical coronation in 1926 (Mercado 1980, 16-17) when she was taken on a procession from Antipolo down to Rizal Park. The tradition of the Virgin&rsquo;s fluvial procession on the Pasig River was detailed in  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> &rsquo;s zarzuela, <b><i>Junto al Pasig </i></b>(Beside the Pasig).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The parish shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo celebrates its annual feast on the eighth of December, the date dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. However, more popularly attended is the annual Antipolo pilgrimage season, which peaks in the month of May (Roces 1980, 89; Mercado 1980, 56). The Virgin of Antipolo and the devotion to her title has been the subject of significant Filipino art, music, film, and literature. As she is the symbol of peace and good voyage, the tradition of imploring her blessing for a safe trip continues to live and evolve even as other forms of travel developed through time. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Dino Carlo S.

		"text": "<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Mother). Early 18th century. Wood. Approximately 91 cm in height. Naga City, Bicol region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wooden image depicts a crowned Madonna and Child, with the infant Jesus looking toward his mother. The image stands on a silver base and is covered with a silver <b>frontal</b><i> </i>and a voluminous cloak. A <b>rostrillo</b> (an oval frame of rays) surrounds the face of both the Virgin and the Child (Gorospe and Javellana 1995, 20). The title &ldquo;Pe&ntilde;afrancia&rdquo; came from the place Pe&ntilde;a de Francia, meaning Rock of France. A Frenchman named Simon Vela was believed to have been sent by a prophetic voice to a rocky mountaintop in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>anca, Spain, to unearth an image of the Virgin Mary, later known as Pe&ntilde;afrancia. For many Filipino Marian devotees, the title Pe&ntilde;afrancia is almost synonymous to &ldquo;Mother of Bicolandia&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;Ina&rdquo; (Gorospe and Javellana 1995, 2-3, 30-31). The image was honored with a canonical coronation under Pope Pius XI in 1924 (Santos 1982, 42).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image of <b><i>Our Lady of Pe&ntilde;afrancia</i></b> was commissioned by Fray Miguel Robles de Covarrubias when he was called to serve as rector of the cathedral and vicar general of Nueva Caceres, the Hispanic name of Naga during the early 18th century. Fray Miguel commissioned a local sculptor to carve a wooden image based on his revered picture of the Virgin of Pe&ntilde;a de Francia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional belief has it that the sculptor slaughtered a dog and used its blood to paint the image dark, to emulate the skin tone of the Aeta who dwell in the mountains of the region. However, after being thrown into the Bicol River, the dog reportedly sprang back to life and returned to his master. The story quickly spread across the region, igniting a fiery devotion to the image. This is just the first narrative in a continuously expanding anthology of miracles from devotees (Gorospe and Javellana 1995, 18-19). Alluding to Bicolandia&rsquo;s mythology of monsters haunting the forests, such as the doglike aswang,<i> </i>the sacrificial dog&rsquo;s reincarnation was reinterpreted as a sign that the miraculous Virgin had exorcised the land of its fearsome mythical creatures (Santos 1982, 42).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image was originally enshrined in a chapel built along the banks of the Bicol River. The present shrine was built by Bishop Ysidro Arevalo in 1741 and renovated by Francisco Gainza during the late 19th century to accommodate the growing number of devotees. As the devotion grew even more, a larger church was built on the other side of the river to house the image. This church was elevated to the rank of a minor basilica in 1985 (Gorospe and Javellana 1995, 18-19, 24-25, 82).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The feast of <b><i>Our Lady of Pe&ntilde;afrancia </i></b>is celebrated on the third Saturday of September. The novena starts with the <i>traslacion </i>(transfer) where the image of the Virgin along with the image of the Divino Rostro are borne on shoulders of strictly male devotees, the sculpture moving in a wavelike manner with devotees competing to get a chance to touch the image as it is transported from the Minor Basilica to the cathedral. On the eighth day of the novena and as highlight of the festivities, a fluvial procession on the Bicol River is held in the Virgin&rsquo;s honor. The Pe&ntilde;afrancia festivities draw pilgrims from all parts of the country and serve as annual homecoming event for Bikolanos (Gorospe and Javellana 1995, 38-79). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Dino Carlo S.

Oil on metal with gold, pearl, and diamond appliqu&eacute;.<i> </i>20 x 15.5 cm. Anonymous Chinese painter. Roman Catholic Parish Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, Binondo, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:4.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Socorro</i></b> is perhaps the only remaining example in the country of a painting by a Chinese artisan dating to the 16th century. It is recorded to have been venerated as early as 1588 in the Church of the Holy Kings, in the first site of the parian outside Intramuros prior to its transfer to Binondo. The absence of painters among the Philippine natives, due to lack of a representational painting tradition in the culture, led the missionaries to hire artistically talented Chinese immigrants to execute painting needs in the early days of the colonization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Socorro</i></b> shows the full-length image of the Blessed Virgin carrying her Infant. The rendering points to a Flemish engraving prototype. Mary&rsquo;s tilted head, the alignment of the tip of her right eyebrow with the right corner of her mouth, and the lopsided configuration of her right cheek recall a wide range of depictions by European artists from Jan Van Eyck to Albrecht Durer. Although the Chinese painter strove to copy the Flemish print closely, he was not able to hold back his Oriental sensibility. The face of Mary is almost ball-like in its roundness. Under the markedly arched eyebrows, her half-dosed eyes are more heavily shaded, evoking Sinitic eyes. The lips are also strikingly small, reminiscent of the proverbial &ldquo;bee stung&rdquo; mouth of women in Chinese paintings. The blue cape, flaring from under Mary&rsquo;s cape, had a traditional image of the Buddhist goddess of mercy Kuan-Yin for inspiration. It may be said that the cult of the <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Pronto Socorro</i></b> was intended to replace the devotion to Kuan-Yin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like other native cult icons, the <b><i>Socorro</i></b> is embellished with ornaments of gold further inlaid with precious stones affixed in strategic places. Both Mary and Jesus wear appliqu&eacute;d crowns with diamond encrustations. The image is protected by glass in an ornate frame mounted on a stem, suggesting that it was carried in the manner of a monstrance by one person during processions. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Manaoag, Pangasinan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:1.8pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image of <b><i>Our Lady of the Rosary </i></b>was brought from Spain via Mexico by Fr Juan de San Jacinto, OP, for the former Augustinian mission of Santa Monica around the early 1600s. Santa Monica was a prosperous settlement near the Baloquin River, which was often raided by people from the mountains. In response to this crisis, the Dominicans, who had taken over the mission, transferred the location of the settlement to a hilltop across the river and dedicated it to the protection of <b><i>Our Lady of the Rosary</i></b>. In this new site, a small chapel was built and the image brought by Father de San Jacinto was enshrined in an altar. This hilltop is where the present minor basilica stands to welcome the huge number of pilgrims that visit Manaoag every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tale of how &ldquo;Manaoag&rdquo; was attached to <b><i>Our Lady of the Rosary </i></b>begins with the local townspeople. This version poses an alternative narrative about how the image of Our Lady was enshrined in its present location. According to the story, a radiant lady holding an infant in her arms appeared upon a low tree before a weary farmer who was on his way home. The farmer tried to run away in fright but was held back by a sweet voice calling his name. The lady then gave him the message, &ldquo;Son, I want a church built here in my honor. My children shall receive many favors in this place.&rdquo; The farmer spread the news and people began to flock to the apparition site, which later on became a traditional pilgrimage area for the people of Santa Monica and their neighboring towns. When pilgrims were asked where they came from, they answered, &ldquo;Dimad Apo yamantatawag&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, &ldquo;from the lady who calls.&rdquo; This response later on evolved to Manaoag, which not only replaced Santa Monica as the name of the town but also became the renowned title of the lady. Apart from Manaoag, the people call Our Lady <i>Ina</i> (Mother) and, in Ilocano, <i>Apo Baket</i> (Venerable Lady) (Nelmida-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> 2004, 52-55; Barcelona 2004, 9-10).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The image consists of full body with clothes all carved in wood (<i>tallada</i>), and fitted with carved ivory face and hands. Although the image by itself is carved with clothes, it became a customary act of devotion to dress the image in richly embroidered vestments composed of a metal breastplate, mantle, and veil donated by devotees. Adorning the virgin&rsquo;s forehead is a crescent-shaped diadem, <b>rostrillo</b> (rays set around the face), and <b>aureola</b> (halo) of stars. Her image appears with the infant Jesus who also wears an imperial crown. The virgin&rsquo;s image holds a rosary, along with a scepter and a marshal&rsquo;s baton. It stands on a carved wooden cloud base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 21 Apr 1926, the image of <b><i>Our Lady of Manaoag</i></b> was canonically crowned under Pope Pius XI through Apostolic Nuncio Msgr Guillermo Piani (Barcelona 2004, 11). An approval by Pope Benedict XVI created a Special Bond of Spiritual Affinity between the Shrine of Manoag and the Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome (Shrine of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2251\"><strong>Our Lady of the Rosary of Manaoag</strong></a></strong> 2012).

The subject is a statue brought from Acapulco in 1718. The painting is striking because of the impact of its straightforward presentation. The cult figure, triangular in shape because of the bell-like spread of her saintly robes, occupies almost the entire space of the painting; before her are three bunches of flowers: red roses on the left, blue on the right, and yellow in the middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painting was executed in techniques quite different from those used in the 19th century. Rather than painted with wide sable brushes, the features of Mary and Jesus seem to have been rendered with a pointed brush or pen or a quill, as in book illumination or engraving on copper. Gold leaf is profuse on Mary&rsquo;s robe. It is of reddish quality, much richer than those observed in 19th-century gold-tooled religious paintings. The confinement of the colors to red, blue, and ocher also suggests an 18th-century provenance. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Among this was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2253\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2253\"><strong>El Pacto de Sangre</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>. Luna chose to paint this mural partly to delineate the goodwill between the Spanish colonial administration and partly to favorably portray Filipino culture. Having done research in indigenous culture, Luna depicted Sikatuna&rsquo;s dagger, cup, mail vestment, and salakot (woven hat) to highlight the sophistication of native culture at the time of Spanish arrival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subject refers to the pledge of friendship undertaken on 16 Mar 1565 by Sikatuna and Miguel Lopez de Legazpi. Sikatuna is depicted at the lower left corner of the painting, with his back turned to the viewer; Legazpi, at left near center, faces Sikatuna. At the right of the picture is Fray Andres de Urdaneta, the Augustinian priest who also served as navigator of Legazpi&rsquo;s expedition. Right of Urdaneta, in full armor, is the youthful Felipe de Salcedo, a nephew of Legazpi.

It also establishes a formal, almost tense atmosphere. Brilliant, chromatically rich hues, like red, silvery blue, and rich blue green, likewise intensify the solemnity of the ceremony. As in <b><i>Spoliarium</i></b>, the figures are not evenly distributed; thus tension rather than serenity is evoked. The obvious asymmetricality is neutralized, chiefly by the presence of white and glinting objects on the right like the scroll on the table, Legazpi&rsquo;s breastplate, and Sikatuna&rsquo;s adornments. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

In its lively folk spirit and richness of design, it proves without doubt that a masterpiece can be done in the highly accessible medium of pen-and-ink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The panoramic view of the Laguna town has the Sierra Madre range in the background against which is seen the church at the center. On both sides the town spreads out in narrow, intersecting streets lined with neat, modest houses, their balconies and windows ornamented with plants. At the center foreground, the large head of Christ and the finely detailed statue of Veronica displaying her veil thrice imprinted with the holy face indicate the folk art of wood carving and making santos for which the town is famous. On the left, a couple of horses and a carabao allude to fiestas and the <i>taka</i> (papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;) figures, while on the right a <i>komedya</i> is being performed on a stage. Paete wealth is symbolized by the bunch of lanzones fruit, the fish from the lake, and the rice fields at the foot of the mountains. All the figures are done in meticulous and detailed style, with some influence of synthetic cubism creating a multifaceted appearance. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

A truly meditative piece, this abstract expressionist work manifests the dynamism of conflict. Violent movement is a physical presence in the canvas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This work, which won the first prize in the 1971 competition of the Art Association of the Philippines, became controversial because most people could not relate it to the competition&rsquo;s theme, which was the 400 years of the City of Manila. The judges defended the piece as an artist&rsquo;s spiritual interpretation of imagined life in Manila when its estuaries were still navigable.

Another story with legendary tones says that the crucifix was carved by a man who presented himself to the priest in exchange for food and shelter. The old man carved the image in three weeks and mysteriously disappeared just as he had come. The crucifix is noted in church inventories of 1934. Whether the crucifix goes back to the previous century cannot be ascertained as the inventory books were burned during the fire of 1851 that destroyed the Pakil convento (parish house).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The [<b><i>Pakil Crucifix</i></b>] belongs to the tradition of the plague crucifix. The crucifix, an image with Jesus Christ (corpus) nailed to a cross, is a central figure in Christian iconography. Early European representations of the crucified Christ presented him as a king in glory. Spurred by the many disasters, especially plagues, that scourged medieval Europe, artists took to depicting Christ in a state of extreme agony. Through such plague crucifixes, believers sought consolation in contemplating the Savior arrayed as one of them in deepest misery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Enshrined in a rococo-inspired side altar on the right of the main portal and along the church nave, the crucifix of hardwood is flanked by smaller images of Mary and a thin and gaunt San Juan. Every sinew and every bone of the rib cage appear etched at the surface to suggest the great pain of the cross. Christ&rsquo;s arms, stretched to their limits, are mere bones, yet his face exhibits the calm of resignation to the divine will. The head tilted to the right, with eyes half open, is a picture of beatific bliss. To mitigate the horror of crucifixion, streams of blood coming from the many wounds of Christ are depicted in stylized fashion, reminiscent of chrysanthemums painted in the Chinese manner. A rivulet of blood, running down the center of the crucified figure, is painted in thin crimson strokes. This seeming contradiction of the triumphant theme underlying this depiction of suffering is accentuated by <i>potencias</i> (triple metal rays of light emanating from Christ&rsquo;s head), a wig, and a richly embroidered loincloth overlaid with a chased metal ornament; all of these were later added by devotees. The devotees&rsquo; anointing of the corpus&rsquo;s lower limbs with balsam has given them a deep dark patina. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by ReneB.

It is an image that he has nurtured since childhood and which he enriched with each performance that he attended. Filled with the spirit of childlike wonder and excitement, the painting depicts the colorful flurry of the battle scene, with the protagonists in red costumes for the Moro (Muslim native) and short tiger-skin attires for the Amazonas (Amazon women), fencing with their swords. Backstage, other actors and actresses wait for their cue, put on makeup, or change their costumes. These activities, however, are full of observed detail that tell of the collective life and daily interaction of the members of a theater group, rich in emotional connotations. The audience also crowds around the stage and avidly follows the performance. The artist tilts the stage to present a larger surface and the entire pictorial space is covered with numerous figures in seemingly inexhaustible stances, attitudes, and gestures. Individually, despite their number, the figures are drawn with consummate suppleness and mastery of form, conveying continual movement and flashing colors. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Cast by Juan Reina, under commission from Fr Jose Beloso, OSA, Santa Monica Church, Pan-ay, Capiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:2.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Pan-ay bell has earned for itself the reputation as the largest bell in Asia and is referred to by the locals as <i>dako nga lingganay </i>or<i> dakung lingganay </i>(big bell).<b> </b>It hangs from the belfry of the Santa Monica Church in Pan-ay, surrounded by eight other smaller bells, cast by different <i>fundidores</i> or bell casters, at different periods. The Pan-ay bell was made in 1878 by Reina (also spelled &ldquo;Reyna&rdquo;), under commission from Father Beloso, who served as parish priest of the town from 1844 until his death in 1888. It was cast at the site (Pan-ay) from 70 sacks of coins donated by the local townspeople.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not much is known about the Pan-ay bell, although there is some lore surrounding its origins. For example, stories circulate that the coins used in manufacturing the bell were of gold and silver, though this is hardly true. The notion may be traced to the custom of throwing gold and silver coins into the molten metal, at which time the priest would bless the bell, lead a procession solemnly around the furnace, and recite a Psalm. It is highly likely that the coins collected from the townspeople were of copper, which is a main element in bronze. Bronze was quite normative for many Philippine bells. There is also a more remarkable account of how the bell was hauled down by Muslim raiders and dumped into the sea, only to be returned to the belfry by some unseen hand. While quite fantastic, it is no different from similar miraculous stories of venerated objects disappearing for one reason or the other, only to reappear mysteriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Circumstances relating to the life of Reina, the bell caster, are equally interesting. He is said to have settled in Iloilo city&rsquo;s J.M. Basa St in 1868 and there established a smith and casting shop. Another source places him in nearby Molo, at Calle Fundicion. Father Beloso was known to have summoned Reina to Capiz to make the Pan-ay bell. It is also told that apart from being a bell caster, Reina was also a dentist. There supposedly occurred a falling out between Reina and Father Beloso over a bell that broke a month after it was cast. The parish priest wanted it recast for free, to which the bell caster could not agree. However, things were eventually resolved as the priest had a horrible toothache that could only be cured by a dentist, who happened to be no other than Reina himself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Pan-ay bell carries Reina&rsquo;s trademark, consisting of a simple cross on a stepped base. This mark is present in the other bells that he made, even though they do not carry his name. Although Reina is known as the bell&rsquo;s maker, two other names are inscribed together with his on the bell: Benitus a Regibus (Benito de los Reyes) and Hilario Sunico. The addition of the names of the two older master bell casters was a sign of respect on the part of Reina. The bell also bears an inspiring inscription that reads (in translation): &ldquo;I am God&rsquo;s voice which shall echo praise from one end of the town of Pan-ay to the other, so that Christ&rsquo;s faithful followers may enter this house of God to receive heavenly graces.&rdquo; It is a voice that may be heard from eight kilometers away. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Marilyn R.

His figurative works, often in mural scale, deal with historical themes, as in this painting with allusions to the Marcos period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Deviating from the traditional realist approach to historical painting, this work is surrealist with a haunting dreamlike quality; it combines recognizable public figures with symbols, such as the monster robot signifying militarism and a beautiful nude woman signifying the quest for identity. Within the stage-like pictorial space, the artist brings together the dramatis personae, although thinly disguised, of the historical conjuncture that led to the EDSA uprising: Marcos, Cardinal Sin, the war robot, and a predatory skeletal female figure in mestiza dress. At the center is a Filipino family group, noble and of a vulnerable innocence and purity, while on the left sits a beautiful nude who contemplates herself before a mirror. The crossed flags of the United States and the Philippines seem to be given equal weights, but the Philippine flag points to the side of the Filipino family and the symbol of national identity, while the American flag falls on the side of the threatening figures, thus implying their links to American interests. Abstract elements of texture and tone add richness to the painting. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G. Guillermo</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

His works, marked by vigor and dynamism, is often mural in concept, showing an entire society in struggle. His most important works convey the idea of class contradiction and show forces in conflict. In <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2260\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2260\"><strong>Panginoong Maylupa</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, the landlord, depicted as a formidable-looking bespectacled figure (spectacles here allude to the elite <i>ilustrado</i> or educated class, which is also the landed gentry) in collusion with a blond figure hovering above him, tramples heavily on the backs of the peasants working in the field, with his fist raised as though wielding a whip. The blond figure represents the United States and other foreign powers to which the Philippines exports raw materials and agricultural products but from which it imports costly finished products. The dynamics of this painting basically derives from the artist&rsquo;s compositional device of showing the landlord from the point of view of the masses as he looms over them at a steep angle and makes threatening gestures, causing the peasants to cower in fright. The peasants are in various attitudes of defeat, suffering, supplication, and initial defiance. There is a strong sense of compositional design in the placement of the figures, which positively contributes to the expressiveness of the work. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

From memory he would recreate these into surreal compositions, such as in the seascape <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2261\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2261\"><strong>Pantalan</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>. Here he painted biomorphous forms laid out like a crisscross pile of lonely derelicts. An illusionary texture of crisp, mossy stumps of wood decaying in aqueous soil is rendered in thin, controlled applications of pigment in finest calligraphic methods of washing, bubbling, splashing, and brushing. The marshy blues, blacks, and browns, built up into scaffoldings on an elegiac quagmire, dramatically contrast the brilliant, flat yellow of the tropical sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When talking of feeling as reflected in his painting, Sanso says: &ldquo;I paint suffering, loneliness, and anguish, because I know these intimately.&rdquo; But Sanso&rsquo;s angst is never literal nor emotional. Rather, loneliness is expressed in restrained reveries of a looming atmosphere, and in this particular work, it is silhouetted with the diminutive shadows of two stalkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">About his creative process, Sanso reveals: &ldquo;First I think of things in space, in light, and the objects spring out of the picture slowly.&rdquo; Thus like the abstract expressionism of his Parisian milieu during his artistic formation in the mid-1950s, Sanso painted from the unconscious; but unlike abstract expressionism, the physical presence that he painted transcended to the sublime. Thus whether the seascape is of Brittany, Para&ntilde;aque, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong></a>, Montalban, or a <i>pantalan</i>, it actually is a mindscape created by a romantic artist in catharsis. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

Inspired by the nativist cults of Mount Banahaw, Bose did this installation using indigenous and organic materials. A mystic altar stands upon a background of dried tree branches massed together to form an improvised chapel, as in the forested slopes of the holy mountain. Above it, like a colorful retablo (structures for religious images), are three vertical banners filled with Christian religious imagery indigenized into the Philippine setting and characterized by the sacralization of secular heroes associated with the Philippine Revolution against Spain, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>. The imagery also includes the native and unorthodox representation of the Holy Trinity as three co-equal figures seated in a row and the image of a babaylan or precolonial priestess-shaman above episodes of the anticolonial struggle done in a folk style. Above all this, a native saint, astride a horse and brandishing a bolo, rides off to the revolution. On both sides of the altar are displays of the flag as it evolved from the early Katipunan banners to the present national symbol of sovereignty. Part of the installation are the lighted tapers in front and on the side of the altar. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

His <b><i>Jeepney</i></b> series, exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum as one part of the show, was a brilliant culmination of the Neo-Realist style of early Philippine modernism applied to a folk subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Here the underlying cubist/geometric principle is brought to full advantage as it makes possible a dense and multilayered imagery rich in semiotic elements. In the highly compressed pictorial space, there are street graffiti and random texts, one of which is the word &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo;; jeepney ornaments, including the aluminum charging steeds on the hood as a magnified motif; and a number of human figures, like driver and passengers&mdash;all part of the jeepney culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The geometrizing tendency is derived from cubism, but the style is enriched by overlapping transparencies of form that suggest spatial layers and densities. The strong, driving lines and bladelike shapes that radiate or suggest centrifugal/centripetal movements revive from exploding energies of futurism. The concatenation of figures, suggesting crowds, speed, sound, and light, captures the multisensory urban experience. The powerful dynamism of the work brings together the spatial and temporal dimensions, dream and reality, the past and the present. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The original mural, commissioned by the American Insular Government of the Philippines in 1903 for 10,000 pesos, was finished by Hidalgo in time for its participation in an exhibition at the 1904 Saint Louis International Exposition. The title alludes to the subject of the painting: the depiction of &ldquo;peace and liberty under American dispensation&rdquo; (Roces 1995, 170). Placed in the Marble Hall of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a> in time for the opening of the First Philippine Assembly in 1907, the mural was later destroyed along with other Hidalgo paintings during the Battle of Manila in 1945. This study was first owned by collector Alfonso T. Ongpin in the 1930s, and was then purchased by Don Eugenio Lopez alongside other works by Hidalgo in the 1960s. In 1972 it was donated to the Eugenio Lopez Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An allegorical painting depicting the colonial narrative of the Philippines surrendering her sovereignty to the United States in exchange for &ldquo;civilizational tutelage,&rdquo; <b><i>Per Pacem et Libertatem</i></b> is an example of the Beaux Arts manner of academic Salon painting using mythical figures as representations of virtues and nations. The Philippines is the woman with a bandaged head and broken sword on the lower left raising the olive leaf of peace to another woman representing America, clad in cuirass armor and holding a long sword, standing on the center-right. Naked male youths, one of whom stands behind America holding the stars and stripes banner, surround these two female figures and form a spiral line ascending in a cloud toward the upper center, where a third female figure personifying Education and Enlightenment holds aloft a torch. Along with this color study, several drawing sketches done in <b>papel de marquilla</b> (piece of paper) of the allegorical figures found in <b><i>Per Pacem et Libertatem</i></b>, including a complete composition study in chalk and charcoal, survive and are also now in the Eugenio Lopez Foundation collection, attesting to the attention to detail and exhaustiveness of studies that preoccupied Hidalgo in preparation for the now destroyed mural. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Reuben R.

Ironically, the book was one of those that made up his honorable mention&ndash;winning entry in the 11th International Biennial of Prints, Tokyo, 1979. The Permutation books are a logical progression from Olazo&rsquo;s diverse engagement with print media, ranging from cast paper, collage, paper relief, to the more conventional woodcuts and serigraphs. The work is a literal and figurative exercise in mining the plastic, physical, and visual properties of layered planar material. Rather than using paper as mere bland flat surface, Olazo&rsquo;s books consist of sheets with variably cut out voids on each page. Through these spaces, one sees the layers of subsequent pages with other cutout shapes. The reader thus sees an illusion of pages penetrating into each other because of the infusion of light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps because of the discipline and physicality imposed on the artist by printmaking, Olazo does not associate tedium with the repeated gestures of building up volume and depth by laboriously applying tint, one sheer plane at a time. Unlike more traditional printmakers who produce multiple editions to challenge the exclusivity of painting, Olazo casts his lot in a long-term project that eminent historian and critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a> refers to as a &ldquo;brilliant concatenation of forms&rdquo; (Guillermo 2011). In committing himself to exploring the potentials of the creative technologies enabled by both printmaking and painting, Olazo effects the fusion of material aspects in his composite media. In essence, the Permutation<b><i> </i></b>books play off the allure of the unique against the compounded and manifold transformations made possible by working within the framework of repetition. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi- Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Source</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guillermo, Alice G. 2011b. &ldquo;Romulo Olazo: A Life for Art.&rdquo; In <em>Romulo Olazo</em>.

After his studies at Yale University from 1948 to 1952, he pursued his mentor Josef Albers&rsquo;s principle of color interaction. This theory asserts that color is not defined by itself but only in relation to another color, and that its quality would vary in terms of intensity and tonal value when set beside another color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To Bernardo, color is concrete physical presence and, when compounded in new planar arrangements, would engage its perceiver in an objective and analytical exercise. This canvas thus presents the exacting nuances of two tints: pink on the upper half and salmon on the lower half, interplaying although hardly contrasting since each tone is as subdued as the other. The drabness is broken by the construction of diagonal lines rendered like scaffolds. The blue-black, white, and vermilion of the scaffold appears to be advancing, in contrast to the recessive pink and salmon. The tinted areas of blue-black and vermilion suggest an effect of transparent overlapping of forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painting appears deceptively simple, but on closer scrutiny reveals lines interlocked at varying angles, giving an illusion of movement that folds down, opens up, clips to one side, and turns to the other in mechanical cadence. Bernardo&rsquo;s geometricism reflects a scientific intellect and a disciplined hand that could be interpreted as a local aspiration for an international aesthetic of order. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong> </strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

This impulse emerges from the manner in which the individual pieces are organized, resembling a storyboard or comic frames. A closer examination, however, reveals that these are arranged in random fashion, defying a linear narrative. This randomness makes the gathering of images appear like a visual translation of scenes from a dream, imaginative fragments, or streams of visions from one&rsquo;s unconscious in the tradition of automatism. Rendered in chalk and charcoal, the drawings are executed in a brash and aggressive manner. The figuration is generally associated with the schematic quality found in children&rsquo;s drawings, which further contrasts with the provocative imagery of the subject matter. The work contains graphic depictions of people engaging in explicit sexual acts and other taboo behavior, such as bestiality, necrophilia, and sadomasochism. The disturbing mixture of pain and pleasure is visualized in the gory images of nude bodies, mutilated body parts, knives, blood, and other chilling details. There are also representations of people in a traumatized state or suffering from anxiety. All these subjects are situated in a bare room, giving the impression that they are isolated or trapped in a small, cell-like space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The work explores sensitive themes that challenge the bounds of art, confront social standards and values, and bring up questions about the limits of normative human behavior. By gathering images of what society regards as perverse and corrupt, it invites reflection on our notion of what is acceptable and what threatens the social fabric. <b><i>Phlegm</i></b> was exhibited at Art in General, New York, 2001, during the artist&rsquo;s residency there, and at the fourth Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, Queensland Art Gallery, in Brisbane, Australia, 2002. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ryan Francis Reyes</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

During the Japanese occupation, his comic strip <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2268\"><strong>Philosopher of the Sidewalk</strong></a></strong> </i></b> was one of the four comic strips allowed by the Japanese censors to be published in the <b><i>Tribune</i></b>. <b><i>The Philosopher of the Sidewalk</i></b> was a silent cartoon that hardly had any dialogue and relied mainly on the nonverbal context of the narrative to deliver its message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A comic strip of three panels came out on 25 Jan 1942 referring to food shortage during the occupation<sup> </sup>(Cheng Chue 2005, 77-8). The Philippines suffered from shortage of resources during the occupation, leading the Japanese to institute programs of rationing and substitution as a stopgap solution to the problem. Comic strips in the <b><i>Tribune </i></b>were used by the Japanese to promote these programs. These comic strips usually lauded the policy of substitution, promoting the use of readily available local products in place of imported goods.<b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is interesting to note that in this particular comic strip, Gat created a counter-narrative that questioned the wisdom of these programs. In this comic strip, the philosopher is seen wondering why people were queuing. The next panel shows him joining the queue and the last one reveals the climactic phrase when the philosopher asks the vendor if he has anything else besides rice. In contrast to Gat&rsquo;s style of illustrating before and after the Japanese occupation, this strip is devoid of the acerbic quality of many of his cartoons. Gat was known for his use of bold and dynamic lines and for the humorous and exaggerated facial expressions and body configurations of his characters. That the illustration in this strip seems tame is an indication of heavy censorship during this period. Nevertheless, the narrative content of this strip is a pointed criticism of conditions of the time, depicting the shortage of supplies that led to long queues and rationing.

Much of her sculpture deals with woman&rsquo;s experience and the feminist drive to identity and self-determination. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2269\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2269\"><strong>Si Picasso at Ako</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, which shows a woman in her familiar traditional role as family cook, can be seen in the context of her feminist concerns. It portrays a harried housewife throwing her hands up in despair at the burnt fish in the frying pan. Like her bust portraits and other works, it reveals a remarkable sensitivity to the portrayal of emotional states. Her hair in disarray, her face ruddy with kitchen heat, and her mouth gaping in distress, the woman is every woman as housewife, while the burnt fish on the pan is the daily disaster with which she must cope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometimes the artist creates a group composition with other figures, such as a little girl watching and perhaps being initiated into woman&rsquo;s traditional role, a dog wantonly scratching itself in the belly, and the figure of the male chauvinist indifferent to woman&rsquo;s plight. Symbolism has marked much of Lluch&rsquo;s latest works, in an effort to express the subconscious layers of woman&rsquo;s plight in its nonrational, intuitive, emotional aspects, particularly her fears and aspirations. While this work implies a woman still caught in narrow traditional roles without access to creative options, in many of her works Lluch has explored images signifying woman&rsquo;s awakening consciousness of herself as an independent and self-determining person.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

This strong vertical line of the arm is repeated and reinforced by that of the flagpole. At the base of the monument are several figures in various attitudes of suffering, death, and despair, but these are transcended by the standing figure, the &ldquo;Spirit,&rdquo; which also unifies the group composition and represents the triumph of the anticolonial spirit despite temporary reverses. The sculptor uses expressionist distortion, lengthening the limbs to bring out the concepts more sharply. Likewise the figures are composed at angles to each other to create a dynamic contrapuntal movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Generally, Castrillo&rsquo;s work in bronze welded together in strips, bringing out a geometrizing tendency, is characterized by jagged, angular shapes rather than by classical mellifluous forms.

An earlier, smaller version of this painting was done by de la Rosa in 1902, and this appears to be compositional precursor of later versions of <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b>. The motifs consist of a line of predominantly female and some male farmers planting new shoots of rice crops in a wet field positioned at the center of the composition; the wet field they are on is bordered by narrow <i>pilapil</i> (rice paddy) hedges that demarcate other wet and planted fields in the foreground and background, creating a shallow orthogonal perspective ending in a horizon line demarcated by a row of bamboo groves and other trees; lastly, overhead are hovering gray rain clouds, indicating the scene as the start of the monsoon rice-planting season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this 1921 version, the center line of farmers planting rice is divided into two groups. The gap between the groups is filled in by an openwork bamboo basket at the right-center foreground from where more rice shoots are stored, ready for planting. A bare-chested farmer, wearing pinkish pantaloons and a conical hat, is also placed at the extreme left side of the background to add greater stability to the composition. This version also increases the size of the background of planted rice fields, and counterbalances the placement of the bamboo basket with a steeply roofed thatched house to the left-center background. The horizon line of trees is also more prominent, while the grey cloud cover is broken with gaps near the horizon, and toward the upper left-center, where a bird is silhouetted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a successful example of a native genre scene utilizing an academic realist style that eventually gave birth to an entire tradition of depicting Philippine rural scenes that would be popularized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> and the Conservatives of the Mabini School from 1920 to 1950. A descendant of the <b>tipos del pais</b> (country scenes) and rural landscape scenes of the latter Spanish colonial period, <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b> was the result of Filipino artists transcribing the academic realist style to become legible to American colonial officials eager to showcase peaceful industry in the countryside after the Philippine-American War. <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b> would also play an important role in the crafting of an incipient narrative meant to produce Filipino nationalist affiliation with the scenery and life of lowland agrarian society rather than with urban lifestyles engendered by industrialization. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Reuben R.

Another larger version, also titled <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b> and dated 1924, is in the Paulino and Hetty Que collection (Cruz 2008, 96-7). Both paintings share almost the same composition. The scene is set in a wet rice field with shallow <i>pilapil </i>(rice paddy)<i> </i>hedges forming orthogonal patterns rising toward the left horizon line. The field is populated by three groups of farmers. Three women in the left foreground are centered around a woman standing with her back to the viewer, a red <i>tapis</i> (outer skirt layer) covering her checkered <i>saya </i>(dress), and her right sleeve undone to show her bare shoulder. A second group is in the middle ground composed of nine figures positioned around another woman wearing a flaming orange saya and conical hat. A third group is in the right background, broken into a left grouping of two farmers with carabaos, and another seven farmers planting rice on the right. The horizon is dominated by a slight rise at upper-middle left, surmounted by a church with a single bell tower at its center pediment surrounded by trees. The sky is heavy with gray rain clouds, indicating that this is monsoon planting season, and casts a slight overcast light over the scene. An openwork basket filled with rice shoots ready for planting is at the center foreground, counterbalancing both the church at the upper-left background and the figures distributed from left foreground to right background. The 1924 version varies via the use of a slightly more intense sunlight, throwing most of the human figures under stronger shadows, and lighting up the rice shoots in the foreground, as well as the planted rice field in the left background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b> is a recapitulation of Fabian de la Rosa&rsquo;s 1904 prizewinning entry at the Saint Louis World&rsquo;s Exposition, but situates it in a more suburban milieu. The highly sensualized depictions of women farmers (Roa 1992, 96-97) also change Amorsolo&rsquo;s narration of the rice planting scene from a depiction of agrarian economic production to a more nuanced association of agriculture with female fertility and reproductive sexuality. The use of more vigorous brushwork, particularly on the clothing and bare shoulder of the woman at left foreground, also indicates Amorsolo&rsquo;s adaptation of Spanish Impressionist models like that of Joaquin Sorolla, albeit still modulated with a leaden gray lighting in tune with the academic classicism of Fabian de la Rosa. The various versions of <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b> also confirm Amorsolo&rsquo;s habit of making multiples of the same title with slight variations, a trait also taken from de la Rosa. In no small part due to Amorsolo, the subsequent patronage from art collectors, and repeated appearances in educational publications, &ldquo;planting rice&rdquo; as a subject matter in painting became an iconic image in Philippine art history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Reuben R.

It was part of the <b><i>Kulo</i></b><i> </i>(Boil) exhibition, 2011, a project held by the University of Santo Tomas (UST) fine arts alumni in commemoration of the UST&rsquo;s 400th anniversary and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s 150th birth celebration. The furor and pre-terminated exhibiting of<b><i> Kulo</i></b> spurred by reaction to <b><i>Poleteismo</i></b> became a landmark incident in the discourse of art and the public, as well as on issues of intervention and censorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Poleteismo </i></b>is a multidimensional, site-specific installation. Its exhibition in the CCP featured a three-wall assemblage of various signage, religious, political, movie, and celebrity posters of public personalities and icons, including Jesus of Nazareth, Mary, the holy family, various saints, Uncle Sam, Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Jr, Lito Atienza, as well as car plates, pin-up girls, and variable educational materials. The two-dimensional images were interspersed with crosses, rosaries, icons, Christmas lights, penis ashtrays, condoms, CDs, and various everyday objects. Included in the installation is <b><i>Relics</i></b>, 2004, a life-sized wooden cross juxtaposed against other icons and objects, including a gigantic rosary, an image of a bleeding hand, a piece of cloth, a UP sign, and a moveable penis. Below it are a stack of magazines, shot glasses, bottles with liquid, and a speaker. The central part of the cross has a convex mirror wherein one can see one&rsquo;s self reflected upon part of the installation surface. The work thus places a likeness of the viewer within the sociopolitical critique proposed by the work. Even before apprehending the breadth of the installation, the viewer will see component parts such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong>Altar</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>, 2005, a wooden altar filled with different colored plastic piggy banks, and<i> <b>Poon</b></i>, 2005-10, a plaster of Paris sculpture of a composite image of Jesus of Nazareth and Mickey Mouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In terms of spatial density, composition, and material elements, <b><i>Poleteismo</i></b>&rsquo;s<b><i> </i></b>precursors evolved as these were exhibited in various sites before the controversy associated with the installation at CCP. Elements of the work would be exhibited as part of <b><i>Hardware 1</i></b>, 2002, at the Vargas Museum in the University of the Philippines. Cruz previously used some of the components of <b><i>Poleteismo</i></b> in other works such as <b><i>Colonial Conception</i></b>, 2003,<b><i> Sungdu-an 3:</i></b> <b><i>Making the Local</i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Santong Pinagpasasaan</i></b> (Ravished Saint), 2005. It also served as the backdrop of the Stonefree music video <b><i>Anghel sa Lupa </i></b>(Angel on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong></a>), 2006. <b><i>Poleteismo</i></b> was also a part of <b><i>TuTOK: NEXUS</i></b> exhibited at the ground floor lobby of the Loyola House of Studies, Ateneo de Manila University, in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">None of these earlier incarnations of what would become <b><i>Poleteismo</i></b> elicited the charged reactions that spiraled into protest actions, public debates, a senate inquiry, and legal charges being filed against the CCP, Cruz, and <b><i>Kulo</i></b>&rsquo;s curators while the exhibition was at the CCP. Opinions from within the art sector similarly became entangled in questions about aesthetics and the consequent visuality of critique as personalities, such as former First Lady <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos, National Artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5405\"><strong>F. Sionil Jose</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\"><strong>Abdulmari Imao</strong></a>, weighed in. For art educators, the climate for discussion underlined the wide gap in visual literacy existing between those who made art and those who encountered it. The CCP organized a roundtable discussion including members of its board, then CCP curator Karen Ocampo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, and the exhibition curator Jay Pacena, but it was at this juncture that a deeply divided CCP board articulated its own ambivalence about issues of accountability both to its publics and the artists who have traditionally regarded the CCP as a safe haven for both the provocative and the ideologically challenging. Heated exchanges that fueled further media coverage and public opposition, primarily from conservative Catholic sectors affronted by the parodying of venerated images, particularly of Mary, eventually caused the CCP to close <b><i>Kulo</i></b>. In anchoring its decision to an arson attempt, this preemptory move by the CCP to secure itself physically effectively curtailed the right of Cruz and his fellow artists to exhibit their works for the whole duration of the CCP exhibition contract period. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Maria Portia Olenka C.

Tempera on board. 91.44 x 62.23 cm. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Cortez Medalla</strong></a>.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> collection.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Medalla is best known for his <b><i>Bubble Machines</i></b>, but this small work represents his initial pursuit of art out of the ordinary. It rejects volume and instead stresses the two-dimensionality of the painting surface by means of flat linear figures. Its influences are children and primitive art, with a strong Dadaist strain and an affinity with Art Brut, mocking the seriousness of high art and introducing the element of play, features that would increasingly come out in Medalla&rsquo;s other works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subject of the portrait, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\"><strong>Fernando Zobel</strong></a>, an eminently dignified figure in the arts, is here deconstructed and converted into a spontaneous and irrational, yet charming icon with a grinning head. His torso is filled with all kinds of characters, symbols, emblems, and masks. There are design areas on both sides, one of which contains the letters &ldquo;From Gaybriel,&rdquo; the sobriquet with which Medalla signs his works in this series. The influence of Art Brut is seen in the scratching or sgraffito technique, which produces irregular outlines and mottled textures. The playful, childlike appearance of the characters also creates a decorative effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This work belongs to Medalla&rsquo;s first solo exhibition of predominantly large canvases on which he applied oil mixed with seashells, gravel, and sand. Starting with <b><i>The Unicorn</i></b>, 1956, Medalla used strong and steady lines to delineate the figure as a single, large subject, surrounding this with colorful ideograms. Other figures in tempera on paper follow in this vein. His subjects are smiling broadly and devoid of personality, with only titles to identify them: <b><i>Self-Portrait</i></b>, 1957, now in the National Museum; <b><i>Imagining the Portrait of Fernando Zobel</i></b>, 1956, the second Zobel portrait in the Cultural Center of the Philippines; and <b><i>My Sister Bingkutay at the Sewing Machine</i></b> and <b><i>The Joyous Kingdom</i></b>, 1956 and 1957, respectively, in the Ateneo Art Gallery collection. The last mural, comprised of multiple figures, Zobel purchased and donated to the Ateneo Art Gallery along with his Philippine contemporary art collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Medalla celebrated texture, color, and line in this series. Like the 1940s paintings by Jean Dubuffet (1901&ndash;85) and Jean Fautrier (1898-1964) of the School of Paris, thick impasto served as skin for Medalla&rsquo;s figures. Reviews of Medalla&rsquo;s first exhibition were largely laudatory: art writer Joan Edades called his naive and brazen style &ldquo;a milestone in Philippine art&rdquo; and poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\"><strong>Jose Garcia Villa</strong></a> hailed him in equally superlative terms. Three years on, Medalla would leave the country and return only rarely, but he never gave up his Philippine passport. Presenting innovative concepts that challenged the commerce of art and the notion of permanence in sculpture, he went on to experiment with machines, the human body, and people&rsquo;s psyches. Today he is viewed as a leading transnational avant-garde in the recovered history chapters of Kinetic Art (1962-66), Participation Art (1969 to mid-1970s), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a> (1978-present). Throughout these periods, he would continue to draw and paint and organize the renegade and avowedly inclusive London Biennial. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The dioramas were carved by sculptors mostly from Paete, Laguna, building a total of 60 tableaus from 1974 to 2011. Alice and Lucinda, the alter egos of Lena Cobangbang and Yasmin Sison, represented themselves as miniature tourists symbolically encroaching upon the museum&rsquo;s spaces. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> component of their work consisted of asking architecture students to build a maquette of the gallery space within which the A&amp;L miniatures were placed. Another component of the project involved inserting other wooden polychromed figurines of A&amp;L as tourists intervening in the dioramas of the Ayala Museum. Blending organically with the tableau&rsquo;s design and configuration, the wooden miniatures of A&amp;L were photographed, and prints were compiled in a mini photo album as part of the exhibition. In the diorama depicting the rice terraces, one of the miniatures was rendered in a squat position and positioned beside an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> as if she were one of the workers on the terraces, this while the other tourist looks over the unfolding scene. In the densely packed diorama alluding to the EDSA Revolt, A&amp;L became almost indistinguishable from the sea of figures converging in protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Primary Destinations </i></b>draws attention to how the museum has become a tourist enclave. It is a quirky commentary on the museum&rsquo;s tendency to function as a treasure trove and as a powerful institution disseminating grand, essentialist narratives. It is an evocation of the tourist gaze and one&rsquo;s partial encounter with history through the representational mode of the diorama. The three-dimensional images&rsquo; translation into postcards and the initial plan of installing the whole set of figures in the museum shop was an attempt to reinforce the act of acquisition of souvenirs as an act of collecting that is normative for both the tourist and the museum. <b><i>Primary Destinations </i></b>is consistent with the practice of A&amp;L, who play with notions of parallel universes, time travel, and alternative fictions. The wooden sculptures and postcards were exhibited at the University of the Philippines Vargas Museum as part of <b><i>A&amp;L: The Parallel Lives Museum</i></b>, 2012, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila as part of <b><i>The Philippine Contemporary</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

Seated on a chair, the woman holds a young girl close to her, the girl leaning upon her lap. The woman appears to be guiding the child as she learns to read the book. The scene portrayed opens up reflections on the role and status of women in Philippine society in the 19th century. <b><i>Primeras Letras</i></b><i> </i>translates to &ldquo;first letters&rdquo; in English, and was a common title for books introducing the Spanish alphabet and language to beginners, implying that the woman in the painting is teaching the rudiments of reading and writing to a new learner. That an activity such as this takes place in a domestic setting underscores the limited access of women to formal education in Spanish colonial Philippines. The image provides a glimpse of how women responded to such constraints, claiming as they did a space traditionally identified as mere women&rsquo;s domain as a site of their own empowerment, in this case through the transfer of knowledge and acquisition of literacy. In addition, the crucial role of the woman as a child&rsquo;s first mentor is stressed in the composition. The artwork also presents a common theme found in Philippine art: the mother and child. The recurring image of woman as maternal figure indicates a culture&rsquo;s privileging of the mother, and thus suggests that Philippine society is matriarchal in character (Fajardo 1998). With the onset of Christianization in the Philippines, a strong devotion to the Virgin Mary emerged, intensifying the presence of the mother figure in both social and artistic spheres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This painting marks a transition from the 19th century <b>miniaturismo</b> style to <b>genre painting</b> that achieved its peak in popularity with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> in the first half of the 20th century. It bears the diligent manner and painstaking attention to detail of the 19th-century miniaturismo style, as seen in the evenly spaced nails of the slatted wooden flooring, the crisscrossing frame of the sawali wall, and the delicate lines and embroidery of the clothing. The rendering of minute details attempts to capture the physical or material environment where the subjects are situated. However, in contrast to miniaturismo portraits commissioned by the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated) patrons who wished to play up their intricate clothing, furniture, or fine jewelry and ornament, this work focuses instead on the activity that the subjects are engaged in. This subtle shift demonstrates a rising interest in a moment of everyday life as opposed to a mere representation of elite lifestyle indicators. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ryan Francis Reyes</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Fajardo, Brenda. 1998. &ldquo;Filipina as Mother and Other Identities.&rdquo; In <em>Perspectives on the Vargas Museum Collection: An Art Historical and Museological Approach</em>, edited by Patrick Flores, 63-68.

Such adjective is atypical of the Amorsolo school of painting to which he belonged. Miranda often deviated from his peer&rsquo;s academic norm of rendering atmospheric, shimmering light. Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda noted that this deviation&mdash;&ldquo;having a tendency to be verbatim&rdquo; and a propensity to drama&mdash;comes from Miranda&rsquo;s experience as scenographer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The theatricality of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2277\"><strong>Procession</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> lies mainly in the stark contrast of light. The yellow luminescence of the picture is a beacon that guides the nuns in their vespers march and leads the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to the painting&rsquo;s formal apex: the convent&rsquo;s interior. The quality of light tempers as it falls on the green lawn and the floral bush at the foreground. Dusk envelopes the rest of the landscape. About two-thirds of the pictorial space is dark. Eventually, a beholder empathizes with the total solemnity of the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Empathy is sustained by the rhythmic movement of the vertical white figures. The floral bush at the foreground provides an accent to this vertical regularity. The white lilies echo the whiteness of the nuns&rsquo; robes, as they also lyrically allude to saintly purity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another point of high contrast is Miranda&rsquo;s choice of color. The wide areas of green, turquoise, and purple are accentuated by sparse areas of vermilion and yellow, their complementary colors. The color scheme provides a strong sensual appeal that does not detract from the painting&rsquo;s solemn intent. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

The artistic director Francesco <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a>mi conceived of an &ldquo;exhibition of exhibitions&rdquo; in <b><i>Dreams and Conflicts: The Viewer&rsquo;s Dictatorship</i></b>,<i> </i>where each of the invited curators helmed a thematic exhibition. The curator Hou Hanru conceptualized <b><i>Zone of Urgency</i></b> (<b><i>Z</i></b>.<b><i>O</i></b>.<b><i>U</i></b>.) for the Arsenale section of the Venice Biennale, in which Alfredo Juan and Isabel Aquilizan also participated. Along with 40 international artists, the multidisciplinary projects in<i> <b>Z</b></i>.<b><i>O</i></b>.<b><i>U</i></b>.<i> </i>reflected on &ldquo;contemporary trends that transform the city into divided zones of war, where urgency is at the core of all activities&rdquo; (Camiz 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alfredo Juan and Isabel&rsquo;s project for the Venice Biennale extends their practice of gathering resources from the community and engaging them through a collaborative production. For <b><i>Project M201</i></b>, they collaborated with contemporary artists, manufacturers, and a designer. The Aquilizans&rsquo; work process is shaped by their experience as migrant artists who come from a country accustomed to &ldquo;making do&rdquo; as a strategy for survival. Rooted in their personal experience of tending to five children and moving across borders and time zones, their works involve assembling together mundane and accessible objects that elicit personal memory and nostalgia. For <b><i>Z</i></b>.<b><i>O</i></b>.<b><i>U</i></b>., the Aquilizans deeply probe the personal as well as complex issues alluding to armed conflict and colonial pasts, nationhood and identity, as well as processes of cultural appropriation and transformation. The declarative &ldquo;In God We Trust&rdquo; evokes the practice of emblazoning biblical passages in jeepney<i> </i>decoration, a popular expression of religiosity that has also become a motif in the work of many other contemporary artists. When related to the patriotic slogan of the Unites States, the statement amplifies <b><i>M201</i></b>&rsquo;s<i> </i>colonial entanglements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Project M201 </i></b>recalls the origins of the jeepney<i> </i>as a military vehicle, a postwar surplus object that occupies a critical place in the transformation of the <i>auto calesa</i> into motorized public transport. Alfredo Juan and Isabel&rsquo;s version is stripped bare of ebullient ornamentation, revealing the impeccable sheen of stainless steel. <b><i>M201</i></b>&rsquo;s interior is reconfigured as both a space for conveyance and a personal space. The body is locally produced, in collaboration with Lem-J Motors in  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong>. It is furnished with domestic objects, including an altar with the child Jesus by Lirio Salvador, and decals installed by Roger del Mundo. A video by Kidlat and Kawayan de Guia simulating the<i> </i>jeepney<i> </i>as it plies the streets of Manila thickens the layers of meaning in this installation. The efforts of various individuals in the creation of the work blur the distinctions between artists, mechanics, and technicians. A deliberate challenging of the perceived boundaries of fine arts, folk and popular culture is also accomplished in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Project M201 </i></b>proposes a rethinking of the jeepney<i> </i>as a representation of Filipino identity in an international contemporary art stage. The vehicle as mode of signification emphasizes travel as an undertaking that is essentially evocative of transit or changing positions. <b><i>M201</i></b><i> </i>is likewise a fitting counterpoint to the context of Venice, where the narrow and convoluted streets leave no place for vehicles, much less for the famed &ldquo;King of the Road&rdquo; of the Philippines.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by Louise Anne D.

The work captures a view of a street in Paete, Laguna, actually showing a small bridge spanning the mountain stream that transects the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painting affirms Roxas&rsquo;s distinction as a consummate realist. What evidently drew him to paint the scene was not just the bridge but also the imposing colonial-style house standing on the opposite side of the bridge. Each of the two entrances of the bridge was highlighted by brick posts, one on each side. Three of these posts could be seen in the painting. The bridge span partly covers the foundation and first floor of the house. It is the backside of the house that faces this side of the street, as could be gathered from the appearance of the corner of the upper floor nearest to the viewer, which is usually neglected for being the kitchen area. A rear azotea whose balustrade is decorated with flower pots can also be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Roxas painstakingly painted the important details of a middle-class house. The walls of the main part of the house feature iron-grill balustrades and sliding capiz windows. Four colonettes rising up to the overhanging eaves provide variety to the texture of the lattice shutters. The gabled roof, covered with red tiles, has an attic window. The rising posts of the bridge and the vertical shape of the house as well as that of the painting itself mark the removed elegance of the place. The rich textural variety suggested by bricks, tiles, and wood is expediently evoked by Roxas&rsquo;s rugged brushwork. The vibrant impasto and solid modeling of shapes give evidence of his training at the Academia de Bellas Artes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Roxas submitted this piece to the Exposicion Nacional de Bellas Artes de Madrid in 1892, when he had already permanently left Manila, having migrated to Paris where he died. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Classicism, however, could be observed in this particular work by Asuncion, such as in the benign but restrained expression of the ivory face and the relaxed, open hands. Matching the cream color of the ivory is the rich peach color of the brocade, embroidered with gold thread that sets off the red felt heart of Mary, which is pierced by seven swords. Elaborately executed is the silver halo behind the head of the Virgin. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Their gaze and bodily stances are directed toward the artist who also occupies the position of the viewer. They are painted in full figure. The mother&rsquo;s dark skirt and father&rsquo;s equally dark-toned trousers, in contrast to their light upper clothing, have the effect of raising the figures and giving them an advantage of height over the viewer. Within the domestic setting of the rich interior, the standing male figure of the husband/father conveys the position of authority, enhanced by his straight posture and his arm akimbo forming a right angle to his waist. He stands slightly to the side in order to present his family; here the male assumes the active role of presentation. The wife/mother, in turn, presents her children who occupy the center of the painting. They have a formal, unsmiling expression in order to impress their importance on the viewer and to convey a high moral tone as models to be emulated. Following the convention of ilustrado portraiture, the artist painstakingly recorded their Sunday finery in all the minutiae of embroidery, as well as transparent textures of their costumes, jewelry, and accessories in the style of <b>miniaturismo</b>.<i> </i>The grouping has for its center the flowers in a glass vase, symbol of beauty and abundance. The globular chandeliers and the open door create an illusion of depth in the elegant interior, while the velvet curtain at the left and the classical column at the right close the composition. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

American <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Collection, Ateneo de Manila University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An album that seeks to explain the customs of the Philippines, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas</i></b> is believed to be the first collection of photographic works made by a Filipino. The dedication page states: &ldquo;Al insigne y laureado pintor filipino D. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a> y Novicio Dedica este album-libro,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2282\"><strong>Recuerdos de Filipinas</strong></a></strong>, en homenaje de admiracion a s&uacute; talento de artista&rdquo; (Dedicated to the famous and award-winning Filipino painter D. Juan Luna y Novicio as tribute of admiration to his talent as an artist). This inscription is noteworthy for the appropriation of the name &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; by a non-Spanish. Here is Laureano, who hails from Iloilo, recognizing a compatriot from the province of Ilocos, demonstrating that &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; now refers to the people of various provinces comprising the country Philippines. Further, the work acknowledges a fellow Filipino who has just become famous internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The album is composed of 37 sections, each with a photograph serving as illustration of the activity or the people being introduced to a Spanish-speaking reader, the work&rsquo;s language being Spanish. Pictures can be categorized into five sets: (1) important events such as wedding and funeral, (2) daily activities, (3) profiles of people, (4) the land, and (5) the structures. The author-photographer selects scenes that he considers &ldquo;typical&rdquo;: bathing as a common activity; types of people from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a> to a Caroline import to the Philippine Exposition in Madrid, to a mestizo; and the church as monument of culture among the Filipinos. Photographs are titled with <i>un/una</i>, <i>en el/la</i>, <i>tipos</i> to underscore objectivity, while the present progressive tense of Spanish verbs is used, denoting that the pictures depict the &ldquo;present&rdquo; state of Philippine culture and society. While the photo titles seem to be distant and disinterested, the descriptions overflow with passion, as can be seen in this passage (translated from the Spanish) referring to washing clothes: &ldquo;And languishing in their tender illusions, they await with impatience the return of their dear beloved, of delirious loves&rdquo; (95).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first photograph that serves as the book&rsquo;s cover, <b><i>Una Boda</i></b> (A Wedding), shows how people back then celebrate the important occasion of consecrating their union. The couple rides a carriage that would transport them from the church to their home. It affords a glimpse into the past: men and women in formal attire of the time, wearing white hats, men playing drums and trumpets at community festivities. Yet the band members and guests behind the newlyweds&rsquo; carriage march with bare feet, apparently a common yet puzzling practice, as verified by other pictures, where people wear formal clothing with their feet dirtied by the earth as they move along. The bride and the groom are not smiling and their formality is further stiffened by the pressure to be composed under the glaring heat of the afternoon sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Laureano&rsquo;s work is priceless for its work of documenting the people&rsquo;s preoccupations, their clothing and looks, equipment, shelter, some flora and fauna, and the roads and other public facilities. There are pictures of pristine landscapes while others show places that already have infrastructures built by the people, demonstrating art, technology, and culture. It appears that people were looking at the photographer when the pictures were being taken, some puzzled, others annoyed, but all with the recognition that an image of them was being taken. It is not clear whether their permission to be photographed was sought. Just the same, the pictures seem to have been taken with a gaze from above the social ladder that&mdash;even though belonging to a fellow countryman&mdash;looks upon the subjects as &ldquo;special others&rdquo; that need to be scrutinized and presented to a viewer who does not belong to the subjects&rsquo; environment, the foreigner in Europe. Inevitably, a colonial gaze imbibed by the ascendant Filipino haunts the settings that Laureano pictured. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by JPaul S.

As an aggressive cultural organizer-curator-researcher, Villa worked with several succeeding generations of diasporic and/or mixed-ancestry Filipinos, including Eliza Barrios, Reanne Estrada, Manuel Ocampo, Stephanie Syjuco, and Jenifer Wofford. Villa&rsquo;s mentoring of mixed-race artists and artist-scholars has spurred these artists to address complex subjectivities in relation to citizenship and allegiances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a></strong> </strong> </i></b>comes in the fairly early phase of Villa&rsquo;s practice, a decade after he had already been doing minimalist painting and sculpture using ritual garments, ceremonial objects, bodily imprints, and other artifacts from Asia, Oceania, and Africa. In <b><i>Ritual</i></b>, the artist takes on a mediating role and combines shamanistic performance elements, such as drumming, dancing, and trance poetry, as assertion of Villa&rsquo;s argument that art actions are a means to rehistoricize. It was through such performative as well as organizing and pedagogical work that Villa meant to collectively mobilize art-world agents against the inequitable conditions of non-Caucasian artists and migrants like him. Villa himself describes <b><i>Ritual</i></b> as a weaving together of a composite visual anthropology that drew from his understanding of Western Sudanese culture and what came to be known as Jackson Pollock&rsquo;s action painting performance filmed by Hans Namuth. In keeping with Villa&rsquo;s coming to terms with his own personal and artistic trajectories, he overtly referenced Namuth&rsquo;s documentation of Pollock&rsquo;s live painting alongside <b><i>Crazy Masters</i></b>, a video on African trance ritual. This latter video was screened in a nearby space as Villa put on an afternoon-long performance where he enacted concepts of birth, transformation, and rites of passage stories. The narratives were of peoples and languages coming to be, and of encounters between Villa&rsquo;s shifting personas and those of other bodies from elsewhere and from other times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villa used the French anthropologist Marcel Griaule&rsquo;s <b><i>Conversations with Ogotoemmeli </i></b>as a textual anchor. <b><i>Ritual</i></b> patches together seemingly disparate elements as seen in the meetings between personas who are not known to each other and are of unequal stature such as the Dogon chief Ogotemmeli and Griaule. While the work argues in behalf of self-determination and positions itself against imposed notions of authenticity, the work can also be read as a problematically slapdash melding of cultural practices. <b><i>Ritual </i></b>may be considered a seminal work as it was staged within a specific Northern American historical juncture that was opening up to a more plural appreciation of cultures coming from a different space and time. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Johnson, Mark. 2013. &ldquo;1976 and Its Legacy: Other Sources: An American Essay at San Francisco Art Institute.&rdquo; <em>Artpractical.com</em>, 11 Sep. http://www.artpractical.com/<br />\r\nfeature/other-sources/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roth, Moira. 1989. &ldquo;Carlos Villa&rsquo;s Ritual.&rdquo; <em>High Performance</em>, Fall, 29-33.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

Rizal Park, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Rizal Monument</i></b> is a national monument and the tomb of Philippine hero  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>. Designed by Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling (1848-1919) and unveiled in 1913, it is a sculptural group consisting of a cast bronze statue of Rizal with allegorical figures and a granite obelisk on a base where his remains are interred. It is located in Rizal Park or Luneta (formerly Bagumbayan), Ermita, Manila, near the site of Rizal&rsquo;s execution and is adjacent to the Independence Flagpole and across the Kilometer Zero marker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 28 Sep 1901, the United States (US) Philippine Commission passed Act No. 243 &ldquo;granting the right to use public land upon the Luneta &hellip; upon which to erect a statue to Jose Rizal.&rdquo; The act also created a committee to raise funds for its erection by public subscriptions. Two other legislative acts facilitated its construction. Act No. 893, enacted by the Philippine Commission on 19 Sep 1903, appropriated 15,000 US dollars as contribution of the Insular Government. On 9 Jan 1906, the Philippine Commission further approved Act No. 1436 granting free entry of the materials for the monument. An international competition for the design of the monument was announced on 15 Mar 1905. Winning entries among the 40 scale models were disclosed on 16 Dec 1907 with Italian Carlos Nicoli&rsquo;s <b><i>Al Martir de Bagumbayan</i></b> (To the Martyr of Bagumbayan) and Kissling&rsquo;s <b><i>Motto Stella</i></b> (Guiding Star) garnering the first and second prizes. The contract was eventually awarded to Kissling on 11 Oct 1910 reportedly due to Nicoli&rsquo;s &ldquo;failure &hellip; to sign the contract according to his agreement.&rdquo; In 1912, Rizal&rsquo;s remains, which were contained in an urn, were reinterred in the monument. They were transferred from his sister Narcisa&rsquo;s house in Binondo to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>Ayuntamiento</strong></a> in Intramuros and finally to the base of the monument. The monument was inaugurated the following year during Rizal&rsquo;s 15th death anniversary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The classical depiction of Rizal in an overcoat appears to have been partially based on his studio portrait with Marcelo del Pilar and Mariano Ponce taken in Madrid. The inclusion of a book alludes to his novels and other writings. Other figures on the base encircling the three sides of the monument include a woman cradling an infant and a man with a boy reading a book. All figures emphasize the importance of education. Renato Constantino (1970) cites the monument as an example of the American sponsorship of Rizal as national hero. Others have pointed out though that Rizal was already revered as a hero even before US intervention. The monument&rsquo;s design elements have been appropriated in numerous Rizal monuments in and outside the Philippines, including those in Madrid and Jinjiang City, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On Sep 1961, as part of the National Cultural Shrine project of the Jose Rizal National Centennial Commission, the Rizal monument was remodeled by superimposing a stainless steel shaft over the granite obelisk, increasing the height of the monument from 12.7 m to 30.5 m. However, the modernist design of  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong>Juan F. Nakpil</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> and Sons was criticized by some government officials and members of the press&mdash;notably, Secretary of Education <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5653\"><strong>Alejandro R. Roces</strong></a> and National Library director Carlos Quirino. The shaft was eventually removed in Apr 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the 1960s, honor guards from the Philippine Marine Corps have been posted at the monument. It has likewise become customary for visiting heads of state to lay wreaths at the monument. During its centenary in 2013, the Rizal monument was declared a national cultural treasure and a national monument by the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> and by the National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Commission of the Philippines, respectively. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Roberto Eliseo G.

Working in a range of both analog and digital media such as film, video, and installation, Ermita&ntilde;o takes a Javanese gamelan set and rigs its elements with automated beaters to produce a video-triggered ensemble of digital programming and human intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In keeping with a desire to have the virtual animate the real, the conductor at center faces four screens that each corresponds to an ensemble &ldquo;member&rdquo; whose performance is manipulated through sensory interfaces that set off computer-coded sound. Ermita&ntilde;o&rsquo;s ambivalence toward human agency is evident in how the gamelan element frames the work in identity politics, exploring what it means to be from and working in Asia and the Philippines even as he was &ldquo;generally wary of waving the third world flag.&rdquo; As if to underline this further, he asserts that he finds affinity with the Balinese (as opposed to the Javanese) gamelan and its use of quarter measure, which is also found in round music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2285\"><strong>Robot Gamelan Quartet</strong></a></strong> </i></b>is recognizably melodic whereas Ermita&ntilde;o&rsquo;s other works have largely been atonal.<b><i> </i></b>As in Ermita&ntilde;o&rsquo;s other pieces, he interchanges the positions of the human and mechanical as conduits of improvisation. In contrast to his earlier work, this consists of a possibly more tangible experience given the audience participation. This latter aspect is particularly evident in relation to the <b><i>Gangan Ensemble</i></b>, another confluence of video, sound, and rule-bound interactions that Ermita&ntilde;o collaborated on with artist-curator Tengal Drilon. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Cavemanifesto. 2008a. &ldquo;Documentation of the Robot Gamelan.&rdquo; Posted 24 Nov. http://cavemanifesto.blogspot.com/2008/11/documentation-of-robot-gamelan.html</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. 2008b. &ldquo;ISEA Update: Robot Gamelan Beaters.&rdquo; Posted 11 Jul. http://cavemanifesto.blogspot.com/2008/07/isea-updaterobot-gamelan-beaters.html.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gangan Ensemble. 2008. &ldquo;Gangan Series II: Volume Control.&rdquo; http://gangan-series.blogspot.com/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ISEA2008. 2008. &ldquo;Interview with Tad Ermitano.&rdquo; 13 Jul. https://isea2008.wordpress.com/2008/07/13/interview-with-tadermitano/.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

What is particularly notable about this painting is that the subject has a strong total presence unsubmerged by the magnificence of her attire. She gazes steadily at the viewer with a self-confident yet modest demeanor, the severity of her hair tempered by the faint suggestion of a smile, while she plucks a bloom from the <i>azucena</i> plant beside her, symbol of chastity and purity. The face and the hands show the masterful modeling of the artist with the varying tones bringing out her distinct features&mdash;the deep-set and lidded eyes, strong nose, and resolute chin&mdash;with a remarkable sense of bone structure. The transparent jusi blouse, with its broad silky stripes and elaborate embroidery, is rendered in the miniaturist style; here the artist&rsquo;s prodigious skill captures in sharp clarity the motifs of flowers and curling vines as well as the scalloped borders of the pa&ntilde;uelo and the sleeves, while the fine yet crisp texture of the pi&ntilde;a cloth is contrasted with the white, pleated cotton undershirt. To complete the image of material prosperity, she wears a complete set of jewelry with as many as four gold rings on the hand holding a book, symbol of learning and piety. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

These were inspired by the artist&rsquo;s daily exposure to construction activities as he went about his work on his family&rsquo;s real estate development project south of Manila. Graders, loaders, beams, cables, and scaffoldings of rising edifices became visual forms embedded in his mind. He perceived this as sheer linear motifs blazing a stark, desolate tropical skyline. With a needleless syringe filled with oil colors, Zobel drew slashing lines that cut across the canvas from one side to the other. On first impression, the Saeta could look like strands of yarn entangled between two knitting rods, or scratches of a draftsman&rsquo;s blade cut across a plywood. On closer look, a viewer&rsquo;s enticement is sustained by the motion of the linear cadence. Zobel stated: &ldquo;The real subject matter of these paintings is movement&mdash;movement observed and felt, never imitated, yet dearly expressed.&rdquo; Appearing improvised and spontaneous, the streaks are actually deliberate, set against a backdrop of bright orangey amber that gradate to a lighter tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although Manila based at that time, Zobel was a constant traveler to the art centers of the world. This explains the influence of abstract expressionism and action painting as practiced by American artists such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Back in Manila, Zobel admired the works of his colleagues <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\"><strong>Lee Aguinaldo</strong></a>, a fact that reinforced his preference for the trend. The decisiveness and strength articulated in the black slashes of movement became a hallmark of Philippine abstract painting of the period, vis-&agrave;-vis the distinct styles of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Hernando R.

More than the saint, however, it is the townspeople the painting celebrates: they are depicted realistically without idealization. Blanco likes to point out and identify each individual face&mdash;that of Inggong Laklak, Goriong Kuping, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> Mael, Inang Elang, etc. Fisherfolk and peasants, old and young, are all in one way or the other related to each other in the extended Filipino family. In each portrait, character is revealed through the distinct facial expression, the look in the eyes, the quality of smile or frown, the turn or pose of the head, the general stance. A rowdy group at the center jokingly threatens to throw a fellow villager into the lake. Blanco himself, wearing an undershirt, happily lifts his youngest child over his head.

Design by Agustin Saez, with execution and improvements by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\"><strong>Isabelo Tampinco</strong></a></strong> and collaborators.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Possibly the finest example of a carved church interior, of whatever artistic style or period, in the Philippines is that of the 19th-century Church of San Ignacio in Intramuros, Manila. Whereas carved decorations in most churches were concentrated on the retablos (wall-like structures with sections for religious images) and altars, pulpits, doors, and <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>Via Crucis</strong></a></b><i> </i>(Stations of the Cross), those of San Ignacio not only elaborated on these but also dominated the galleries, door frames, columns, and ceilings. Since the entire work was conceived as a whole, the resulting unity of style and consistency of quality mark it as a masterpiece in the history of Philippine sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Work on the interior may have been started in 1882 or 1883, a few years after the cornerstone was laid in 1878. Glimpses of the interior must have been so impressive that even though construction was still ongoing, plans, samples, and models of the church and its decoration were requested by the government in Dec 1886 to be sent to the Madrid Exposition of 1887; more examples were sent to the Exposicion Universal in Barcelona in 1888. The carved works of art exhibited in these fairs garnered for Tampinco a silver and a gold medal, respectively. Although popularly attributed to Tampinco and his associates, credit for the ornamental design must be given to Saez, director of the Academia de Dibujo and professor of drawing at Ateneo Municipal. The major source on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\"><strong>San Ignacio Church</strong></a>, which is an illustrated commemorative album published a year after its inauguration, reserves the last and major portion of its acknowledgements to Saez, the Spaniard who conceived the interior in &ldquo;Graeco-Roman&rdquo; style. To Saez are specifically assigned the plans for the pulpit and the main altar. From the hand of his compatriot Jose Fuentes came the designs for the two side altars. Subsequent Filipino authors claim, however, that Tampinco improved on the design so excellently that they could very well be called his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the Jesuit church, 50-60 workers and wood-carvers were employed, including Tampinco&rsquo;s brother-in-law  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3599\"><strong>Crispulo Jocson</strong></a></strong>, Manuel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3774\"><strong>Mariano Siauinco</strong></a>, Gaspar Bautista, Pedro Nepomuceno, and a master of detail known only as Luis. The pulpit was crafted by Flores and Jocson; from Flores&rsquo;s chisel came the images of San Ignacio de Loyola and the Sagrado Corazon de Jesus, while from Jocson&rsquo;s emerged that of the Inmaculada Concepcion. Tampinco spent six or seven years executing this <i>obra maestra </i>(masterpiece), and in the end sent a bill to the Jesuits for 26,086 pesos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon entering the church, one felt transported, as M.M. Norton waxed poetic in 1915, &ldquo;to the rich and ornate of Europe, in some capital where the cultured worship&rdquo; (Manuel 1955). Columns of reinforced concrete faced with fluted carved hardwood, resting on white marble plinths and topped by composite capitals, formed a pair of colonnades flanking both sides of the nave. In between the arches spanning the colonnades were medallions in high relief portraying Jesuit saints. Beginning from one&rsquo;s left, these were San Luis Gonzaga, San Estanislao Kostka, San Francisco Javier, San Alfonso Rodriguez, San Pedro Claver, San Francisco de Geronimo, San Juan Francisco Regis, and San Francisco de Borja. Resting on the colonnades was a gallery, also sporting fluted columns. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>&rsquo;s eye was then drawn to the magnificent <b>artesonado</b> (coffered ceiling)&mdash;that is, the ceiling was divided into rectangular trays, each with a series of recessed squares or <i>casetones</i> in the manner of today&rsquo;s egg cartons. Each square, bordered by braided bands encircling flowers, featured an arrangement of acanthus leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over the crossing, where a dome was usually constructed, was an octagonal inner space inserted into a rectangular area; within the eight panels were 10 portrait medallions for each of the original companions who with San Ignacio de Loyola founded the Society of Jesus. The palm and oak motifs framing these and other bas-relief symbolized the victory and fortitude of the Jesuit saints. The four corners of this part of the ceiling featured the evangelists. The ceiling over the main altar boasted a dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, from which radiated shafts of light. Javellana (1991) conjectures that Tampinco rightly took advantage of the church&rsquo;s Easternly orientation, because of which highlights were accentuated and shadows deepened: &ldquo;His coffered ceiling was best appreciated when morning light filtered through the choir windows and portals of the church. It was at that time of day too when students and other worshippers entered the church because it was the customary time for public worship.&rdquo; Indeed, the entire ceiling was so lavishly endowed with carved bands of flowers, circles, grooves, scrolls, and leaves that it is not difficult imagining worshippers engrossed in this heaven gazing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pulpit featured two large reliefs, the subjects of which were the Descent of the Holy Spirit and the Great Commission to Spread the Gospel, flanked by three narrower ones representing Faith, Hope, and Charity. On the gradually curving staircase leading to the pulpit were images in relief of the Four Evangelists and San Pedro. Not to be outdone was the underside of the staircase, which was fully carved along the lines of the artesonado<i> </i>ceiling. The pulpit, as with most of the woodwork in the church, was finished with a thin layer of varnish to enhance the panels&rsquo; natural colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main and side altars were realized according to the neoclassical style. Accordingly these were conceived more along architectural, three-dimensional lines than those of the previous planar, baroque-retablo types. Tall fluted Corinthian columns flanked the images in the niches and supported pediments emblazoned with more reliefs, angels, and symbolic figures. These altars of hardwood rested on white Carrara marble bases, imported from and partially carved in Italy and finished in Manila by the Spanish artist Francisco Rodoreda. His firm&rsquo;s <i>lapidas </i>or tomb markers can still be seen in many old churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The magnificent treasure-house of wood carving that was San Ignacio disappeared in flames when it was bombed by US airplanes in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No better epitaph has been written than that by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E.

Ni&ntilde;o, Cebu City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:2.5pt; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and his troops landed in the island of Sugbu (former name of Cebu) on 28 Apr 1565, they burned down the whole settlement they found there to drive all residents out of the land. The statue of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o was discovered among the ruins by Juan de Camus, one of Legazpi&rsquo;s sailors. The icon was wrapped in white cloth and kept inside a Spanish crafted wooden box. The image&rsquo;s survival from destruction by fire and its discovery were considered miracles, and Legazpi decreed the propagation of the devotion to the Holy Child. This is the first of the multitude of devotions to the Holy Child in various localities in the Philippines (Bautista 2001, 15-16). The image was then entrusted to the Augustinian Missionaries and six years after, a church was built on the site where it was found. This church was named after the Holy Name of Jesus and is considered to be the first Christian church ever built on the Philippines (Florendo 2001, 27).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The primary historical significance of the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Cebu lies in the theory that it was among the images that Ferdinand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\"><strong>Magellan</strong></a> brought with him from Spain in 1521 (Jose 1991, 117). The image of the Holy Child that Magellan brought is said to be a product of the Spanish colony of Flanders in Belgium. Carved in wood, it was dressed up in the traditional costume for children of the Spanish court of the late 16th and the 17th centuries. It had a long-sleeved shirt with lace ruffles and gold-embroidered vest over a pair of trousers tucked into a pair of gold boots worn up through the middle lower legs. The image also wears a princely ensemble comprised of a crown, a sash, a belt, and a long flowing cape. The Holy Child&rsquo;s right hand is raised in benediction, as it holds a scepter symbolizing martial law and power to impose justice. Its left hand holds an orb with a cross, symbolizing the dominion of the child Jesus over all creation and the sovereignty of Spain over a vast territory around the globe (Bautista 2001, 13). The vestment of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Cebu is predominantly red. The image stands on a tall ornamented pedestal. Noteworthy adornments of the image include a chain of old Spanish gold coins, the <i>toisonne </i>allegedly bequeathed by King Charles III, and a golden ram pendant. The image was originally ebony in color but was repainted in pale yellow after World War II to conceal a scratch on the image&rsquo;s right cheek (Florendo 2001, 21).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">According to the account of Magellan&rsquo;s chronicler, Antonio de Pigafetta, a beautiful image of the Holy Child with other images was presented to Hara Amihan, the wife of Rajah Humabon of Cebu as she was baptized with the Christian name Juana. Juana was brought to tears as she beheld the image and thus asked that the image be left with her (Bautista 2001, 14-15). This account extended to tales of Juana leaping and dancing the <i>sulog </i>(the dance of the tides) along with her handmaidens as she took possession of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. Her reaction marked the warm reception and adoration the Filipinos have since accorded the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. Juana&rsquo;s jubilant acceptance of the image of the Holy Child has since been regarded as having given birth to the Sinulog dance and eventually the Sinulog festival, a celebration that honors the feast of the Holy Child of Cebu annually every second Sunday following the feast of the Epiphany. The Sinulog dance and festivities are punctuated with shouts of &ldquo;Viva! Pit Senyor!&rdquo; as the Holy Child is referred to by devotees as &ldquo;Senyor Sto. Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; (Florendo 2001, 57-9, 109). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Dino Carlo S.

Lush, tropical orange and yellow hues light up the canvas, carefully balanced by cool shades of green. The sumptuous colors are matched by a profusion of geometric shapes that create zigzags and sunbursts all over the bird&rsquo;s body. The three sunburst shapes are general centers of interest, causing the viewer&rsquo;s eye to move in a circle from one point of the painting to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subject itself has been abstracted to such a degree that it can barely be made out by the viewer. Traditional perspective and anatomical detail are disregarded in the painting. Ocampo employed the bird shape simply as a take-off point for his study of color relationships and shape interactions. He placed no emphasis on the realistic appearance of the bird, and chose instead to fragment the sarimanok into a complex puzzle of variously shaped, rainbow-hued pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the artist himself wrote the year he painted the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong>Sarimanok</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>: &ldquo;I am more interested in how shapes, hues, values, textures and lines interact with one another in space, than in capturing a photographic semblance of nature.&rdquo; In the process of creating a new reality on canvas, Ocampo developed a style that may be considered uniquely Filipino. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Noel Valdellon and N.

Sibayan&rsquo;s performance and concept-based works, such as <b><i>MoMO</i></b> (<b><i>Museum of Mental Objects</i></b>), are posed as institutional critique. Conflating multiple roles assumed by various individuals working in an art institution, her performance involves wearing an enlarged scapular consisting of hand-sewn pouches. It is filled with hand-sized works of artists who are invited to exhibit in this literal pocket space within a particular duration. Envisioned as a &ldquo;performance art gallery,&rdquo; Sibayan fulfills various curatorial duties, among them preparation of exhibition notes, exhibition design, documentation and archiving, publicity, and audience development. As the owner and artist of the Scapular Gallery, her performance renders her agency visible. She is engaged in the production of the work as exemplified by the trace offered by the scapular and the use of her body as vehicle for site-specific works. In the process, she exposes the limits of her body and her autonomy as a singular entity emulating the work of an art institution. Sibayan describes the gesture as a &ldquo;movement away from the center and into the periphery of production, circulation, and reception of art&rdquo; (Sibayan 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The impetus of <b><i>Scapular Gallery Nomad </i></b>is a personal and political one, borne from Sibayan&rsquo;s reflection upon her artistic practice on the one hand, and the initial trajectory of her career as a cultural administrator, on the other. She relates how her works had been &ldquo;legitimized&rdquo; by the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) via a group show in 1974 and a solo exhibition in 1975. She was later involved with CCP as a curatorial assistant to Ray Albano from 1976 to 1977, and as an artist who explored the CCP as a site of performance. After returning from her studies in the United States, she was appointed as director of the CCP Coordinating Center for Visual Arts, 1987-89. Tasked with the project of reconfiguring a center that had emerged from a dictatorial regime, Sibayan saw the conflicting discourse between museums and the self-criticality of contemporary art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sibayan&rsquo;s referencing of the scapular as a miraculous object that protects the bearer from eternal doom is a poetic and cogent articulation of resistance to institutional systems. After resigning from her post in the CCP and withdrawing from the art world for several years, <b><i>Scapular Gallery Nomad</i></b><i> </i>marked her return to a space that would enable her &ldquo;devotion&rdquo; to art. The scapular also functions as an amulet, affording the artist a level of autonomy and protecting her from having to perform roles constricted within historical or institutional parameters. <b><i>Scapular Gallery Nomad </i></b>was performed in the following museums from 1997 to 1999: the Vienna Secession, Austria; CAPC Mus&eacute;e d&rsquo;Art Contemporain de Bordeaux, France; PS1 Contemporary Art Center, New York; and the Hayward Gallery, London; and from 2000 to 2001, at the Earl Lu Gallery, Singapore; and the Museum of Far East Antiquities, Stockholm, Sweden. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Louise Anne D.

This play environment retains its authenticity even as visitors discover the balloons are actually cast paper orbs worked over through serigraphy. <b><i>Seven Chairs</i></b> is the pivotal piece of Yan-Santos&rsquo;s 2009 solo exhibition, <b><i>Makes Sense</i></b>, which could be seen as a collection of objects associated with socializing rituals and faintly veiled disciplinal measures that mold the wayward into the proper and acceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Having established herself as a printmaker early in her creative practice, Yan-Santos counts on the physical and cognitive imprints in her assemblages and installations to create layers of meaning. Drawing upon her own biographical circumstances and her playful approach to her chosen media, the artist is able to weave into her work the languages of mirth and distress that accompany the experiences of mothering and coming of age. The realization that no single balloon nor chair is like any of the others<b><i> </i></b>encourages the viewer to engage with each of the objects&rsquo; idiosyncratic features. As a tableau of difference in contrast to the cookie-cutter setups that come along with commercial children&rsquo;s party packages, the work could be taken as a critique of such subtle instruments of homogenization. Instead, it endorses a utopic situation where everyone wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Yan-Santos&rsquo;s inclination to play up the dissimilarities draws from the capacity of these mundane objects to stand in for the individuated personages of children&mdash;in her specific case, an eldest son with special needs. This ability to induce meaning out of the innocuous in the grammar of the everyday and widely accessible lends the work an easy but calculated legibility. As in her other pieces, references to the innocence of youthful experiences are mitigated by the potentially troubling. Games of chance often leave the deepest of childhood scars on the player who is left standing because everyone else is already in place. As a mother of a young child with learning disabilities, Yan-Santos infuses the work with the insight that even play can traumatize a child who is still in search of self. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Bartolome, Antares. 2009. <em>Lived Universals</em>.

The left square is framed and collaged with a crumpled paper tacked with red tapes, while the right square suspends a seesaw-like plank of wood with five round clocks on top. Attempting to get a meaning or message from this work would miss the artist&rsquo;s point. Here Chabet is simply drawing the perceiver&rsquo;s attention to the intrinsic quality of a material&rsquo;s rawness vis-&agrave;-vis the idea of precision, such as the wood&rsquo;s material grain contrasting a clockwork quality. He further contrasts the idea of randomness in a crumpled paperbag and torn pieces of tape against the essence of accuracy in the way the 90-degree frames and the 180-degree angle of the plank are engineered with an architect-painter&rsquo;s exacting sense of design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Sometimes art has too much art.

He demurs at being labeled a conceptual artist of the avant-garde, yet he has actually been pursuing this traditional Western genre for the past two decades as guru of idea art in the Philippines. Idea, effects, newness, temporariness, order, linearity, materials, processes, sensory experience&mdash;these are the values/nonvalues with which Chabet is most concerned. And these are the very strategies with which he revolts against the intellectual mediocrity and commercial craftiness of &ldquo;high&rdquo; art. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Various effects of light and dark, impressions of blots, fingerprints, dots, stipples, and stains enrich the surface with tonal and textural nuances that make this lithograph appear like an etching and aquatint print.

		"text": "<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:.05in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Completed ca 1671. Wood, gesso, paint. Anonymous. Silang,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin-top:.05in; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Candelaria Church in Silang, Cavite, houses three retablos or reredos, wall-like structures with sections for religious images&mdash;namely, the <b>retablo mayor</b> and two collaterals found on the epistle and gospel sides of the church. The retablo mayor is the church&rsquo;s main altarpiece and is dated to the second half of the 17th century, some three decades after the stone church was built under the supervision of Fr Juan de Salazar, SJ. It is probable that the retablos were built in stages, the images of Christian martyrs and saints installed only after the dates of their beatification or canonization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The retablo mayor<i> </i>subscribes closely to the template for many retablos throughout the islands. Largest of the retablos in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/383\"><strong>Silang Church</strong></a>, it is rendered in wood, gesso, and paint, and is thin with a flat rather than undulating surface. It has three tiers with symmetrically disposed niches and <b>relleves</b><i> </i>(bas-reliefs), decorated with motifs inspired by different cultures. Conforming to practices then, the retablo was made from modular pieces of wood, no member more than two and a half meters long, with parts contracted to different artisans and later pieced together in the church where they were painted and gilded. The retablo mayor underwent refurbishing throughout the years. Its last maintenance work, done in the 20th century by the Talleres de Maximo Vicente, involved repainting with soft pastel colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>Retablo</strong></a>s had catechetical intent, and in Silang, the main altar functions as a &ldquo;visual hagiography&rdquo; (Javellana 1991, 116, 122) of the Virgin Mary. Both the freestanding sculptures and bas-reliefs in the retablo make reference to important &ldquo;events&rdquo; in her life&mdash;from her Immaculate Conception (relleve on the altar table) to her Coronation as the Queen of Heaven (leftmost relleve on the second tier). The images in the central sections of both the first and second tiers also invoke her title as the Virgin of Candelaria, a reference to Christ&rsquo;s presentation in the temple, represented in iconography by the Virgin carrying the child Jesus in one arm, while her other hand holds a candle. Despite the importance given to the Virgin in the retablo mayor,<i> </i>it is the Santo Ni&ntilde;o de Ternate, flanked by Jesuit saints and angels with musical instruments, who occupies the central niche in the topmost tier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the main retablo is devoted to the Virgin&rsquo;s role in the Christ story, the two transept retablos emphasize other Christian personages. The epistle transept (on the right side facing the altar) depicts Jesuit male saints and blessed; while the gospel transept (on the left side facing the altar) features women saints, with the exception of one male saint, probably Paul. The topmost niche of the epistle transept represents the Japanese martyrs, Paul Miki and his companions, whose cult came to Manila during the 16th century after news of their death by crucifixion. Saint Teresa of Avila&rsquo;s transverberation or spiritual marriage is depicted in the gospel transept, in what appears to be a continuous narrative&mdash;the Christ Child is seen shooting the arrow of Divine Love guided by Joseph and Mary, while Teresa appears to be reeling from the arrow that pierced her heart. Golden rays, swirling clouds, and hovering cherubs surround her, symbolizing her heavenly experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taken together, the sculptures in these retablos highlight Marian devotion, yet acknowledge the centrality of Christ. The images also reflect the Jesuit contribution to the panoply of the holy, represented by its &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo;&mdash;saints and martyrs&mdash;fulfilling their missions in different parts of the world. The depiction of women saints, on the other hand, reiterates the call to martyrdom and sainthood, exemplified by a devotion to God in both body and spirit, evidenced by chaste lives, service, and propagation of the faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The style of the retablos<i> </i>is an interesting blend of elements from Spanish, Mexican, Asian, and native artistic traditions. Plateresque elements, for example, may be found in the fine carving, resembling the work of <b>plateros</b> (silversmiths), from which the style takes its name. The use of plant motifs, medallions, twisted or Solomonic columns, and polychrome are also associated with this style. At the same time, baroque features are evident in the use of split pediments and the overall density of the ornamentation, though still quite controlled. A rococo element, on the other hand, is represented by the cream-colored paint used as the base color of the entire retablo. The rendering of hills and clouds seems to have been Chinese-inspired, while the dwarf-like forms of some of the figures have a naive and folksy quality. This curious mix of elements from various cultures gives this retablo its peculiar charm and intimates, as well, the various sources from which Philippine art may draw inspiration. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byMarilyn R.

The painter, in academic garb, is engrossed in doing a sketch of a woman reclining on the bed in front of him, while a standing man in a beret, presumably the teacher, looks on. These are composed closely together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main concern of the artist is not as much to portray an activity as to create a design with figures. The light-hued, bent arm of the model against the dark background makes a contrapuntal movement with her lower arm stroking her hair, echoed by the artist&rsquo;s two arms resting on the paper. The curving contour of the white-clad body is a strong design element emphasized by the painter&rsquo;s dark head. This strong contoured line of her body tilted sideways, along with the pillows supporting her head, and the profiles of the two men bring out a two-dimensional tendency in the shallow space. Furthermore, the artist works in a painterly style, not concealing brushwork but working in bold, rugged strokes, using varied hues such as blue, green, orange, and red to suggest relative depths rather than modeling with tonal gradations. The work shows the influence of the post-Impressionist Cezanne in its composition and style. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

It was part of the fashion for portraiture in the mid<b>- </b>and late-19th century when the landowners and merchants, who benefited from export-crop agriculture with the opening of the country to international trade, began to enjoy a huge economic surplus. Such a portrait as this of Soterania Puzon clearly reflected the new wealth of the emergent mestizo or indigenous classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More than beauty, the portrait conveys wealth with its access to material refinement and economic power. The unsmiling severity of the lady&rsquo;s face only adds weight to the indubitable sense of social ascendance with all its material evidence; it is in these terms that she was to be admired and emulated rather than for any natural qualities, such as personal charm or feminine appeal. Instead of the usual transparent bodice, she wears a blouse of thicker material but with exquisite openwork <b>calado</b><i> </i>embroidery and scalloped edging; and instead of the usual stripes, her <i>maria clara</i> skirt has an opulent design of roses in bands. On her fingers are multiple rings in heavy gold, of indigenous design, as well as a rare neckpiece with pearls. She holds a feathered fan, a sign of consummate elegance, in a resolute manner. Her regal bearing is enhanced by a gold-tiara comb. A marble-topped table and fashionable rattan chair provide the setting for this woman secure in her wealth and position. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The gladiators who fought in the arena were often captive kings, nobles, and warriors from the territories conquered by Rome. &ldquo;Spoliarium&rdquo; was the name given to the basement hall of the Roman Colosseum to which, after the bloody ordeal in the arena, the dying or dead combatants were dragged, there to be despoiled of their last worldly belongings, and where relatives and friends went to claim the bodies and those abandoned were put to the torch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the center of the painting, two dead gladiators are seen being dragged by arrogant Romans across the space of the stone floor to be dumped in a dark corner along with other bodies. On the left, two elderly scavengers in Roman costume, hunched like vultures, greedily eye the dead men&rsquo;s effects: leather boots and straps, protective metal linings, talismans, and other accessories; while beside them another Roman raises his fist in protest at the inhuman spectacle. On the right, a woman seated on the ground with her head bowed and her back to the viewer mourns a loved one, while nearby an old man with a torch searches for the body of his son amidst the smoky haze. The vast hall of the Spoliarium is suggested by the massive stone walls and the dimly espied steps on the left where the crowd pours in from the arena into the hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The composition of <b><i>Spoliarium </i></b>is basically triangular, with emphasis on diagonal lines for dynamic effect: Luna moved from the smooth marmoreal style of the classical academy to a more spontaneous approach. The influence of baroque and romanticism is seen in the looser brushwork leaving flecks of color, the sense of movement and turmoil in the vociferous gestures and straining muscles of the figures, the chiaroscuro in the flickering highlights and transparent layers of darkness, and the deep emotional tone that contrasts harsh stentorian voices with deep, elegiac mourning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The drama of the work arises from its contrasting moods, in particular, the noisy, avid crowd on the left and the grieving figures on the right. In the portrayal of the two groups is brought out the relationship between dominant and dominated, victor and victim. As such, this painting of imperial Roman cruelty has been interpreted as an allegory of Spain in the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

A large body of his realist work consists of portraits of laborers and the urban poor; he also did a series of construction workers engaged in building the edifices of the Marcos period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this painting, there are also workers putting up a structure; however, it is important to note that this was one of the major works of the social realists painted after the Marcos regime and during the Aquino administration. Here the team of workers, done with a consummate realism of detail and scale verging on <b>trompe l&rsquo;oeil</b>, are busy putting up a large billboard image consisting of several panels, some still unfinished and not yet in their proper sequence. Upon closer look, it is a mammoth head of former president Marcos that they are raising up, although the EDSA Revolt had earlier removed him from power. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the people&rsquo;s demands in the post-EDSA period was for the new government to dismantle the Marcos political structures, but here, ironically enough, his image is seen restored to its former dominance. This stemmed from the perception that the Corazon Aquino government, while it showed a progressive promise at the start, moved increasingly toward right-wing interests as it launched its total war in the countryside to wipe out peasant resistance. In this way, it showed its true face as not much different from that of Marcos with which it shared landlord and comprador interests with foreign support. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The style of<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2302\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2302\"><strong>Sungkaan</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> reveals his training at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura (Academy of Drawing and Painting), which stressed the modeling of the figure in light and dark. Skilled in anatomical rendering, Pineda was a realist who did not idealize his figures. He was also one of the early genre artists to choose indigenous games for subject. In this work, two elderly figures in light native dress, possibly husband and wife, are shown playing <i>sungka</i>, an indoor Asian game played on a <i>sungkaan</i>, a wooden device with seven hollows on each side and two larger hollows on both ends where one successively drops in or scoops up cowrie shells, the winner amassing the greater number. While the subject in itself is simple, the work was not meant to be only an illustration of the game but a fully accomplished painting. The two players are seated facing each other by the large <i>capiz</i> window, which provides light and ventilation to the room. It is the old woman&rsquo;s turn, her eyes focused on the game; both show an intense absorption. The light falls on her fully visible face profile; the man&rsquo;s profile is in backlighting. Tonal contrast is brought out between the bright outdoors with plants in the sunlight, and the shadowy indoors. It was Pineda&rsquo;s interest in genre to portray a mood of concentration, suggesting the spirit within, rather than figures in action. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The interior of the <i>bahay na bato</i> (house of stone), the typical 19th-century mansion of the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated), is given importance as setting here. Vividly captured is the structural interaction between indoors and outdoors, which is its significant feature: the <i>ventanillas </i>or small windows under the window sill and the openwork wood carving that create designs of figure and space while they function in the circulation of air, and the capiz windows that filter the sunlight into the room. The broad shiny floors and the furnishings, such as the Vienna chairs, capture the bahay-na-bato ambience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a setting for the fine ilustrado couple dressed for a fiesta, as indicated by the banner hanging from the window of the opposite house&mdash;as was the custom in those days&mdash;and by the procession in the street below. All is not well, however, for in this masterpiece of body language, the two are having a little spat. The man peevishly looks out of the window, his elbow and legs forming angles, while the woman, in an elegant <i>maria clara </i>dress, looks away, facing the interior with downcast eyes; the figures of the two are in contrapuntal position.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Her work, like the tapestry <b><i>Fun Koyu </i></b>of the Tboli<b><i> </i></b>series, is impressive in its scale, richness of material, technical inventiveness, and creative power. On the burlap support is added abaca fiber and coconut shell in a large multilayered composition, variously textured and encrusted on the surface and in the inner layers like the skin of a strange creature in which sections are half-exposed to reveal the mysterious network of veins and viscera. The colors&mdash;applied in dyeing, staining, and painting processes&mdash;achieve unusual depth in this work in which the earth-brown, deep red, and black tones are drawn from the Tboli chromatic code. Aside from saturating the material in color, the artist combines numerous stitching techniques, stretches cords and strands to form linear patterns on the surface and apertures, binds elements together, ties knots and creates a diversity of textural motifs; all these have mosaic-like encrustations of coconut shell and colored webs of abaca fiber. Space also becomes a concern in cutout sections and apertures revealing multiple levels. The artist allows for openings or paintings in the fabric, as the work ends irregularly in loose strands to avoid the sense of mechanical intervention and instead conveys the impression of fluidity and continuity of art as in life.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written byAlice G.

In this particular painting of the series, the historical setting is in the early years of American colonization. The left side contains an allusion to the Philippine-American War, with the American soldier aiming his rifle at the crucified figure of a native Christ. At center, the civilian population of women and children are being subdued while, toward the right, the process of subjugation and moral corruption is completed with the woman dressed in the United States flag and the duo of the American marine and the prostitute below the emblem of the eagle. All around the horizontal image is a border consisting of tarot cards transposed into Philippine subjects, such as the babaylan<i> </i>or shaman and the figures of native Maranao and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> warriors, a Katipunero (Katipunan member) soldier, a warrior on horseback, and a native lady, all dressed in colorful ethnic or historical costumes. Throughout the work are found allegorical figures representing Inang Bayan (Mother Country) as Justice and Stability, as well as symbols, seals, and flags of the two countries to convey conflict between, on the one hand, imperialist aggression and, on the other hand, the struggle for independence. The various figures of the native tarot represent the different forces and ideals playing a part in the historical process. Their juxtaposition may give rise to several insights about American hegemony in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist uses vivid folk colors enhanced with gold, as in medieval illuminations that the labels and lines of text also evoke. The figures themselves are done in a folk figurative style, implying an opposition to the dominant classical tradition. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Arellano uses the word in pertaining to the meaningful unity of form and concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arellano&rsquo;s visual vocabulary can confound the viewer uninitiated into her particular way of appropriating and repurposing images from multiple sources. This triumvirate of Buddha mothers&mdash;she has made a point of asserting that these, notwithstanding the similarity to the tripartite deity of maiden, mother, and crone, are not goddesses&mdash;is characteristic of her oeuvre, being replete with allusions to spiritual and personal themes. Her aim with this inscape is to underscore the need to search for the sacred in the mundane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The central figure, Dea, is a fantasy self-portrait that ties in with difficulties that Arellano underwent in the experiences of giving birth by Caesarean section, becoming a mother, and also becoming a stepmother. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1158\"><strong>Endo</strong></a>wed with wings and four pairs of breasts, Dea appears to be in the midst of breaking out of her old skin. A cobra stands between her legs in a protective gesture, like how the Muchilinda, a gigantic serpent with several heads, is said to have shielded a meditating Gautama Buddha from a fierce storm with his hood. To the left is Vesta, a vessel of life who provides milk and honey as nourishment. She makes a gesture of generosity, and, upon her back, carries a large lizard, a symbol of fertility. To the right is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a>, who, by virtue of old age, is free from reproductive and sexual duties, and represents the promise of arriving at love lost through intellectual pride by way of turning inward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2306\"><strong>Tatlong Buddhang Ina</strong></a></strong> </i></b> was exhibited at the 6th Havana Biennale in 1997 with <b><i>Eshu</i></b>, a floor piece depicting a deity of roads, especially crossroads, from the Yoruba religion. The four-legged, three-armed figure holds a bottle of wine and a cigar in his right hands, and a trident in his left. <b><i>Eshu</i></b>, according to Arellano, is like Dea, in that it functions as a fantasy self-portrait. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Jaime Oscar M.

The artist visually reinterprets gods, ancestor-spirits, Filipino myths, cosmology, and oral traditions from different Philippine regions. Such are Agtabaynon, a great sea hawk with human body and a character in Bukidnon cosmology; Mebuyan, a female deity with multiple breasts believed to nurture the soul of unborn babies; and the Visayan <b>pintados</b><i> </i>or precolonial indigenous people with their ornamental and elaborate tattoos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Tau-tao</i></b> displayed at the National Art Gallery of the National Museum, 2008-12, depicts the Bukidnon myth of the afterlife. Feleo created a built environment that enthralls visitors with the mysticism of the cycles of life of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> spirituality. The exhibit featured six life-size human figures representing the six deity characters of Bagobo spirituality and the afterlife. It depicts the transformation of the dead body from decay to ascension. He used sawdust, wood, metal, rocks, and other organic materials to create an immersive site work. He was able to create a process of making art from indigenous <b>pinalakpak</b>, a process of slapping together materials &ldquo;made of sawdust, water and glue kneaded into a brown mass&rdquo; (Guillermo 2001, 120-29).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this artwork, Feleo fuses ethnographic research on the Bagobo community, an ethnolinguistic group living in the southern part of Mindanao, as he visually imagines and creatively translates into visual and tactile form these indigenous oral memories and knowledge. Furthermore, Feleo links the concept of <b><i>Tau-tao</i></b> to Philippine cultural traditions, with the practice of placing the dead in secondary vessels, its presence influencing the concerns of the living. His interest in folk memories, indigenous culture, and local mythologies demonstrates an intimacy with our history with the intent of transforming and reconciling deep stories of the Filipino past into a new vision of Filipino shared consciousness. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Clod Marlan Krister V.

Her eyes do not meet that of her reflection in the looking glass, but seem to be contemplating or appraising her body, in particular her abdomen, where scars characteristically caused by undergoing a Caesarean section can be made out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This pensive sculpture, modeled by Teresita &ldquo;Tita&rdquo; de Quiros, marks a shift from the humorous, sometime self-mocking character of other major works by Lluch, such as <b><i>Cutting Onions Always Makes Me Cry</i> </b>and <b><i>Aerobics</i></b>, commentaries on domestic work and exercise, respectively, which were produced in the same year as <b><i>Thinking Nude</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The female nude as a category of art has been subjected to rigorous critique by various feminist thinkers for how it reinforces and perpetuates patriarchal values, turning the woman, usually idealized and arrayed in a passive, pliant pose, into an object of desire and offering it up for the enjoyment of the male spectator. In the hands of a woman artist, therefore, the nude has the potential to become even more problematic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With <b><i>Thinking Nude</i></b>, Lluch negotiates the fraught history of the genre and reclaims the female body from patriarchal protocols by putting forward an alternative representation. The portrayal of an active subject who takes her body into her own hands and is absorbed in thought, intent not on being beheld by and arousing pleasure in the viewer but on self-discovery, the sculpture challenges the different discourses&mdash;artistic, medical, economic&mdash;that seek to regulate and contain the body of women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Feminist art historian and art critic Flaudette May V. Datuin, however, has cautioned that re-functioning the nude in this way does not abolish the problem of male surveillance, as there is a vast range of interpretive possibilities for the female body, which includes the possibility that it can yet be reappropriated for voyeuristic purposes. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Jaime Oscar M.

Private collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saprid made his mark in sculpture with his series on the <i>tikbalang</i>, the half-human and half-horse of Philippine mythology. The artist, however, does not endow the tikbalang with a fearsome quality; instead it has become a playful, witty, somewhat comic creature. Saprid exaggerates its long equine head, its maned neck, and its gangly limbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this work, the tikbalang is a flower child of the late 1960s playing the guitar, a peace pendant hanging from its neck. Anticlassical, Saprid creates figures with a dynamic quality that arises from his particular handling of the medium. His technique of welding strips of metal with a blowtorch produces a jagged effect along the seams where the edges join together. Saprid transforms this unevenness to advantage as the sections of rugged metal capture the fight in a restless way, suggesting movement. Likewise a vital part of Saprid&rsquo;s figurative style is the interplay of figure and space; for space not only surrounds the figure but weaves in and out of it through the spatial intervals, nets, and apertures. The relative thinness of the bronze fragments allows for the interaction, creating a continuous spatial flow between and among the various elements of the figure. Thus even with metal, the artist is able to achieve an airy quality, which, in the case of the tikbalang, is eminently suitable to the mythological subject. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

His explorations have led him to discover the traditional arts of cultural communities, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> and Tinguian in the north, the Maranao and Tausug groups in the south, and other creative groups like the Tboli and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> also in Mindanao. Inspired by the weaves of these ethnic groups, Rodriguez has done a number of tapestries using their materials and weaving techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this work influenced by Tinguian weaves, the tapestry is done in a supplementary weft-weaving technique accented at intervals by knots of cloth incorporated into the threads. This technique lends the work an appearance of a system of notations, literary or musical. Rodriguez,<b> </b>however, goes from the ethnic to the individualistic when he embellishes the weave with minute marks and random scribblings. These include tiny accents of gold foil for ornamentation in a personal and unorthodox approach, which reinforces the consciously naive quality of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The artist&rsquo;s avowed concern in tapestry making is to merge fiber craft with art. Rodriguez also did a number of large-scale hangings and prints on cloth, experimenting with local dyes in a batik process. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

The theme was a favorite subject of Philippine paintings from the mid-17th to the late 19th century. The &ldquo;transito&rdquo; was de rigueur in the private chapels of stately homes or in the devotional corners of less affluent houses. This is due to the fact that San Jose was invoked for a happy death, as tradition states he was assisted in his deathbed by no less than Jesus and the Blessed Virgin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Extremely filial, Filipino artists have thus been fascinated with the subject, doing various interpretations that show how solicitous Jesus was to his dying father while Mary looked on with pitiful sorrow. The above version situates the death scene almost in a Philippine setting, if only for the wooden furniture used. The legs of San Jose&rsquo;s bed, for example, are in the style of a balustrade post ending in a ball-and-claw design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The execution is less fine than <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a>&rsquo;s but employs the miniaturistic technique he learned under Domingo&rsquo;s tutelage. Evidently, the anonymous painter for this scene saw a set of Domingo&rsquo;s album of costumes, for Mary&rsquo;s pose seems to have been inspired by the lady Domingo portrayed in <b><i>Una India Vestida de Duelo </i></b>(An Indian in Mourning Clothes). A young angel holding Joseph&rsquo;s basket of carpentry tools is reminiscent of the young boy painted by Domingo in the title page of his albums. All details in the <b><i>Transito </i></b>have been painstakingly limned to the last detail, including the fleur-de-lis patterns in gold leaf distributed on the saintly robes and San Jose&rsquo;s blanket. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The faces of the musicians are those of night owls&mdash;bloodless yellow in hue, eyes open and staring absently with accustomed sleeplessness, their skin dry and paper-thin on their bony skulls. Massed together, they express a close, interactive concentration in their music, while their off-center position lends the scene an offbeat quality. Although they are in formal attire, the formality is subtly mocked by the wrinkled cuffs of their sleeves that tell of hours of work to earn a living and of the sleazy undertones of their milieu. The mood slips into a twilight zone between conscious and subconscious as the checkered floor (the black-and-white pattern allusive of notes in rhythm) tilts and slides unevenly to the right and the wooden frames of the hall and their reflections create an irregular contrapuntal design. In the haze of merging music and drink, the figures melt transparently into one another, the checkered floor with the table and the piano with reeling fluidity. The empty chair and table at the right convey a sense of solitariness and the lonely silence that follows conviviality. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Watercolor on paper. 104 x 131 cm. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3382\"><strong>Saudi Ahmad</strong></a>. Artist&rsquo;s collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The painting depicts a scene in which a woman floats above a tree as people gather around and observe her from a distance on the ground. The woman appears as an apparition as indicated by the expression of the people surrounding her whose poses suggest deference to a holy presence or respect toward an authority figure. Set against a backdrop of mountains and foliage, the crowd appears to be a family of nobility accompanied by their entire entourage. The scene is meticulously rendered in detail, from the figures&rsquo; colorful attires to the various objects they are holding. On the left side are mostly women wearing blouses with sashes and cloth wrapped around their bodies. These women carry colorful parasols, fans, and banners. On the right side are mostly men wearing turbans and headgear, and holding weapons such as spears and swords, which suggest they are warriors. The painting is executed in the artist&rsquo;s trademark nuanced colors made up of transparent layers which produce rich linear patterns and textures that unify the entire composition. The artist&rsquo;s painstaking technique of producing this subtle blending of watercolors gives the painting its vitality and character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This work is a fine example of figurative painting from the Islamic south, an underdeveloped art form that has not become popular due to the attitude of orthodox Islamic theologians who preach against figurative art (Sakili 2006). The painting demonstrates that this notion of absolute prohibition of figurative representation in Islamic art continues to be challenged. It exemplifies how still fairly unknown contemporary Islamic Filipino artists possess a penchant for vibrant colors. The painting is also a showcase of folk Islamic artistic sensibility in that the works of Ahmad have gained worldwide recognition. Coming from the Maguindanao group, Ahmad is known for his brilliant palette that he employs to chronicle festivities and everyday events such as the Hariraya festival, weddings, harvests, and burials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Though representative of a stream of folk Islamic art from the Philippines, the painting relates to Catholic traditions, which pose the Virgin Mary as a ubiquitous icon. This is a motif that has been traced to the presence of older representations of a mother goddess indicative of a precolonial matrilineal society (Fajardo 1998).

It was day two of the revolt and people were blocking the march of government soldiers and tanks, which were out to crush the mutineers. Representatives of the religious orders were placed in front of a group of protesters as an appeal to the people&rsquo;s general soft spot for religious leaders. The nuns willingly placed themselves at the forefront, praying with the rest of the crowd. The tanks and soldiers stopped. Government forces retreated.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two Daughters of Saint Paul sisters, Sr Porfiria Ocariza and Sr Teresita Burias, kneel in front of a throng of demonstrators preventing the onslaught of military tanks at EDSA, main site of the 1986 People Power Revolution. Reporter Ed Lingao is the man with shades reflecting the unseen presence of tanks that were about to crush the people. A mass of persons against a singular guardsman, soldiers menacingly hovering over kneeling people, an anonymous gun-bearer as opposed to distinct individuals, pensive poses in contrast to the openmouthed nuns in front: all these in the midst of anxious faces of the crowd that would soon topple the government. The crowd was reciting the Hail Mary and they were pronouncing the &ldquo;hail&rdquo; part of the prayer as this picture was taken, thus explaining the leftmost sister&rsquo;s half-open mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taken behind a soldier tasked to disperse civilians, the photograph is a captivating image of the Filipino people&rsquo;s determination to end the dictatorship. The dictator&rsquo;s forces were about to attack the people but they were confronted with an indomitable lot who would not concede their space. The image captured the iconic moment in 1986, the play of power and images in the political life of the Philippines. While the photograph may be read as the clash between binary oppositions&mdash;good and evil, prayers versus violence, male and female energies&mdash;the image also encapsulated the influence of the Catholic church in the political life of the nation. The photograph was first published in <b><i>Manila Times</i></b> on 24 Feb 1986 and thereafter reproduced in countless newspapers and magazines reporting the revolution.

Finding his element in such materials as runo grass and bamboo, he created the fantastic open-air labyrinth <b><i>Archetype </i></b>or <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong>Uma ti Biag</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Kankanay for &ldquo;Garden of Life&rdquo;) on the grounds of the CCP in mid-1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A large circular labyrinth made of 2.44 m runo reeds assembled together by basket weaving and thatching techniques, it is of archetypal symbolism. It leads the viewer through a high and winding bamboo corridor with several turns that may cause anxiety and bewilderment, and finally ends, to his relief, in a central clearing, which is &ldquo;home,&rdquo; the Cordillera <i>dap-ay</i>, a sacred ritual ground. This is represented by the artist as a circular sunken pit, .30 m deep and 3.66 m in diameter. At its center, presiding over the ritual space lined by monolithic stone seats, is an archaic <b>bulul</b><i> </i>or image of a Cordillera guardian spirit. In this zone, which is home, one recovers warmth in the welcoming hearth and familiar community offering food and drink. In the artist&rsquo;s worldview, the center is intensely vitalized with the power of life against indifferent nature and the forces that destroy human beings. The labyrinth became a site for <i>ca&ntilde;ao</i>, a sacrificial ritual, and for performance art. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Stations 1-12 are attributed to an anonymous 18th-century master from Tanay. Stations 13-14 appear to be of different styles; the 13th depicting the Pieta or Angustia, is crudely carved. The 14th, depicting the Deposition, is carved in the manner of 19th-century sculptures. All the stations are framed by a wooden border and enclosed in the church&rsquo;s wall by a stucco frame surmounted by the number of the station and a cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first 12 stations are gems of sculpture. All figures, except that of Christ, have round bulging eyes; the soldiers have masklike faces. Stylization is evident in the faces of many soldiers who wear goatees, handlebar moustaches, and garments and plumed helmets that look like stage costumes. Anachronisms in the costume may be seen, as in the clothing of the women of Jerusalem that resemble those of Spanish peasants, and of Veronica who wears a nun&rsquo;s veil. Proportions are used symbolically, as seen in the diminutive figures of a child and a woman standing in front of Pilate&rsquo;s tribunal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The naivete and improper proportions of the figures mark the first 12 reliefs as products of the 18th century, the same century in which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\"><strong>Tanay Church</strong></a> was built. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by ReneB.

Willie Vicoy. <b><i>Time </i></b>and <b><i>Newsweek </i></b>magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"artworkdetails\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For several decades the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2317\"><strong>Vietnam War</strong></a></strong> was covered extensively by the international press. This is one of the countless photographs Willie Vicoy produced in his coverage of the war as part of the news organization United Press International. Through the set of photographs to which this photo belongs, Vicoy covered the flight of refugees as North and South Vietnamese communists were battling the United States-supported southern government. When this was taken, President Nguyen Van Thieu had just surrendered a big part of South Vietnam to the communists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A woman holds her stricken child and offers her to the camera. Cropped tightly like his other snapshots, the picture makes a moving statement on the war by offering three views: the middle-aged woman in peasant hat and clothes looks at her child, the baby looks at the camera, and the viewer looks at the photograph. The shifts in vantage points interrogate the objectives of a war that takes its toll on ordinary people as the conflict approaches its final confrontation in the summer of 1975. Behind them is the battle-scarred Vietnamese countryside that has experienced death and destruction for two decades by this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The photograph appears reproduced in color as cover of <b><i>Time</i> </b>and <b><i>Newsweek</i></b> magazines, subduing the drama of the scene with a pastiche of other images from the earlier years of the war. What makes the focal picture particularly compelling is its isolation, done through narrow cropping, which could be seen in parallel to the bracketing of the experiences of millions of Vietnamese peasants reeling from indiscriminate bombing. While other war pictures revealed the mass of anguished refugees fleeing the scene of confrontation, this one focuses on a singular predicament of annihilation experienced by one mother. In this way, the image is universalized as the depiction of the Vietnam War and became crucial in the international community&rsquo;s renunciation of American intervention. The plight of a people of a distant place had thus been foregrounded for the world&rsquo;s eyes to focus on. The contribution of Vicoy&rsquo;s work to Filipino photojournalism comes from his established presence in the coverage of international conflicts. Here Vicoy underscores how the Filipino photographer&rsquo;s interest is no longer merely confined to national borders. It is especially significant that Vicoy, as an Asian, is able to depict the victims of war with empathy and humanity, thus influencing international public opinion on the human cost of the Vietnam War. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by JPaul S.

Its subject matter is drawn from Roman antiquity, specifically during the time of the persecution of the Christians by emperors such as Nero. Thus the principal figures are two maidens stripped of their garments and exposed to men leering at them and inspecting them like mere objects or commodities.

The figures are fully modeled, and their gestures from the left to the right create a chain of movements that rise and fall, ending with the bound feet of the second maiden. The architectural setting, while smaller in space, recalls that of Luna&rsquo;s work, which also features stone steps with descending figures on the left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Women as hapless victims of men was a theme derived from 19th-century romanticism. But while it evoked pathos, it could not envision them as active, self-determining beings struggling against the patriarchal order. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

At lower left, below the lake, are portions of an irrigated farm where people are engaged in various activities. Where the main road forks out is a triangular island of grass. At top right is a partial view of the residential area suggested by a bamboo grove, other trees, and nipa houses fenced with bamboo poles&mdash;all rendered meticulously to the smallest detail. In the left foreground stands a woman in native costume, with her back turned to the viewer. Her figure reinforces the sense of balance in this subtly symmetrical composition. On the sky at top left are a pair hawks, one with a snake dangling from its beak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Senson is better known today as a vital influence on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\"><strong>Carlos V.

Presented as Dalena&rsquo;s sixth solo exhibition at Finale Art File, 2012, as part of the Endframe <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\"><strong>Video Art</strong></a> Festival, the artist projects on the gallery&rsquo;s massive walls video footage of a flooded landscape, inundated in the wake of typhoon Sendong as it hit land on 17 Dec 2011. The images documented and shown are post-storm scenes depicting the typhoon&rsquo;s damage consisting of hundreds of dead and missing persons, a desolate house emptied out by the flood, and logs floating adrift on still and silted waters. Strewn across the floor are remains of three massive balete, <i>antipolo</i>, and white lauan tree logs, among the many forms of debris washed out to sea.

The city was left devastated by the typhoon after flash floods caused the Mandulog River to overflow. Thousands of displaced logs and uprooted trees from the city&rsquo;s hinterland areas swept through the nearby communities and were cast out to Iligan Bay. The three logs, salvaged and stockpiled, were chopped into smaller pieces and transported to Manila for the exhibition. The installation is a transient work: the logs used are currently housed in the outdoor compound of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau, Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center, Diliman, and much like in <b><i>Tungkung Langit</i></b>, serve as a setting for improvised play among children encountering the assembled timber remains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A contribution to the tradition of Philippine installation art developing over four decades, <b><i>Washed Out</i></b> is distinguished for its appropriation of natural and found wooden materials salvaged from actual sites of tragedies.

In black and white, it was done through etching and mezzotint. Mezzotint is an archaic method of creating rich fine textures and tones by using a rocker. The work resulted from the artist&rsquo;s sojourn among the Subanon in Mindanao, which enabled him to represent his subjects in authentic detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main figure is a mother carrying her child in the foreground. The features of ethnic costume are distinctive: the cloth wrapped around the head, the <i>malong </i>(cylindrical skirt) formed into a portable hammock to carry the infant, and the large loop earrings that celebrate her femininity. The closeness of mother and child is reflected in the flexible malong that serves both as her costume and the cradle. The large headdress blends into the second mother-and-child figure on the right, a shadowy echo of the first. Higher up are Datu Bog and a third woman seated together. While the work reflects the polygamous custom of the tribe, it is the woman as mother and nurturer of life that is given primary importance rather than the man, as in traditional male-centered images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The woman as mother in the foreground is shown in all her beauty and strength as she carries her child with pride and confidence in the joyous affirmation of the continuance of the life of the tribe. This work also shows the vigor of cultural communities in their struggle for survival and self-determination.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

In regard to her work <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2324\"><strong>You Lived in My House</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, Cruz intimates how it was informed by the &ldquo;double-edged nostalgia&rdquo; and riffing off from everyday objects associated with the &eacute;migr&eacute; couple Ilya and Emilia Kabakov. The work is an uncharacteristically narrative piece as Cruz supplies it with the lengthy full title <b><i>You Lived in My House, Ate All My Food, Then You Left Me without a Trace, Leaving Me Titanic VHS, a Kenny G and UB40 CD? Thanks Very Much!</i></b><i> </i>In this installation, she invokes her continuing preoccupation with the history and process of painting particularly in regard to Constructivism and hard-edge abstraction as these are transposed unto patched-up walls and hurriedly painted over street rubble landscaped around a rickety structure accessorized in Philippine kitsch. Cruz literally plumbs through these diverse sources and overlays them to evoke an aesthetic sensibility found among organically built structures built within urban informal settlements. <b><i>You Lived in My House</i></b> could be taken as illustrative of the amalgam of work that has populated the series of <b><i>Bastards of Misrepresentation</i></b> projects shown across America and Europe as they overtly seek to destabilize categories such as identity and culture. These projects are also framed within a visual and verbal rhetoric given to puns and undisguised self-celebratory phrases that not so accidentally resonate in texts on the parallel Paris exhibition. Taken together, the combined texts and works demonstrate artist-curator Manuel Ocampo&rsquo;s own curatorial logic of putting together &ldquo;gritty, dirty, edgy, perverted, superficial, double standard, sarcastic, trivial, base, unstable, discordant, tasteless and baroque&rdquo; work meant to challenge the premises behind what constitutes the improper and artistic in relation to presentation and representation.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p><em>ABS-CBN News</em>. 2013. &ldquo;Pinoy Artworks to Be Exhibited in France.&rdquo; 21 Feb. http://tcdn03.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/02/21/13/pinoy-artworks-be-exhibited-france.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz, Maria. 2014.
