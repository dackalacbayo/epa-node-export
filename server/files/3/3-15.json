		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Advertising</b> is concerned with informing and influencing the public, through paid space or time in any of the media of mass communication, to patronize certain goods or services or to support persons or policies. Illustrations, letterings, format layouts, or designs by visual artists are generally employed in print media (like newspapers and magazines) or in outdoor media (like billboards and posters) to draw attention to the product, activity, or idea being endorsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Line drawing and artistic lettering dominated print-media advertising before lithography and photography became technically and economically practical. Withthe development of color printing in newspapers and magazines, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\"><strong>painting</strong></a> techniques and color photography have been employed for the sake of realism as wellas to attract readers and viewers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a> has not completely taken over the function of painting and drawing in printed advertisement, there being instances when products are better rendered in paint or pen-and-ink than through photographic means. Neon and electrical signs were earlier used in outdoor media for advertising purposes before they became appropriated as postmodern art trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest advertisements appeared in newspapers. The <b><i>Registro Mercantil de Manila</i></b>, 1824-33, was the first newspaper in the country to advertise local products by publishing the <i>precios corrientes </i>or current prices. <b><i>La Esperanza</i></b>, 1847-50, featured the first boxed announcements. By 1848, as could be seen in <b><i>Diario de Manila</i></b>, 1848-52, local newspapers were filled with boxed notices announcing sales, auctions, lost and found cases, and the arrival and departure of ships. <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>, 1859-60, began featuring illustrated advertisements, generally simple vignettes representing the products. It was <b><i>El Comercio</i></b>, 1869-1938, which began the practice of devoting pages to advertisements, mainly boxed notices. In its first years, <b><i>El Comercio </i></b>also featured an advertisement with a full illustration&mdash;that is, the edifice of Botica Zobel. In 1892, <b><i>La Pavera </i></b>contained more artwork in its advertisements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1900s, business establishments flourished due to the more liberal policies of the Americans. Improved commerce promoted print advertising for clothes, hats, shoes, cigars, beverages, phonographs, and sewing machines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1346\"><strong>Advertisements</strong></a> frequently contained copy in both Spanish and English and were trilingual in Tagalog newspapers. The artists employed to illustrate these announcements, perhaps still not adjusted to the impersonal nature of their job, signed their names. This was common in Spanish or Filipino-owned publications, like <b><i>Excelsior</i></b>, 1905-41, and <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino</i></b>, 1910-15. Similarly identified were the advertising illustrations of Luis Viejo y Morera, staff artist of both the secular <b><i>Excelsior </i></b>and the Jesuit-owned <b><i>Cultura Social</i></b>, 1913-41,and of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3721\"><strong>JorgePineda</strong></a>, <b><i>Renacimiento</i></b>&rsquo;s frequent cover illustrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising illustration was influenced by current styles in painting and design. The works of Viejo and Pineda had art nouveau borders or frames consisting of sinuous lines often adorned with fruits, flowers, and leaves enclosing both the illustration and copy. An example is the advertisement for the Quiapo Saloon by Viejo&mdash;a watercolor rendition of Uncle Sam, flanked by the interior and facade of the saloon, holding a weighing scale (the left containing a big coin, off-balanced by the right containing glasses of beer) before a crowd of men with arms extended toward the potables, recalling earlier icons showing souls in purgatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pineda&rsquo;s drawing for the advertisement of Talleres de Fotograbados y Zincografia de Renacimiento Filipino recalls his genre paintings. The announcement shows a watercolor of a female assistant in profile&mdash;understood to be the symbolic muse of the newly emancipated photographic art&mdash;pouring developing liquid over a picture. As in the genre paintings for which Pineda was known by then, the dainty damsel in the advertisement wears loose, long tresses, and delicately embroidered sleeves. She is set off by a glass-paned window instead of a dark room. Pineda did another version with the girl simply holding a picture. Among products for which Pineda designed advertisements are the Kati-Alis ointment for skin irritations and the Balsamo Milagrosa ointment for muscular pains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">American advertising agencies emphasized the impersonality of the announcements. The signature of the artists who executed them seldom appeared intheir works; hence, although  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">FernandoC.Amorsolo</a></strong> was the chief artist of the Pacific Commercial Company, none of his advertising illustrations bear his signature. Other artists employed by Pacific Commercial Company were Zozimo Dimaano, JoseEsperanzaCruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\"><strong>IrineoMiranda</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3397\"><strong>PabloAmorsolo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3712\"><strong>JoseV.Pereira</strong></a>. After <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino </i></b>closed down, Pineda became chief artist of Carmelo and Bauermann Incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amorsolo is best remembered for his vignette of Saint Michael crushing Lucifer, which adorned the label of San Miguel gin, a product of La Tonde&ntilde;a. Amorsolo himself was one of the earliest media celebrities to grace an advertisement, perhaps antedating movie stars as advertisement models. His photograph of himself holding a palette before a canvas was juxtaposed beside the picture of Buick&rsquo;s Marquette car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the American firms in Manila in the first two decades of the 20th century simply had an advertising manager to handle advertising requirements. The Pacific Commercial Company was an exception. It had its own department exclusively for advertising. In 1921, H. Edward Bullis established the first advertising agency, Philippine Publicity Service Inc (PPSI). Advertising historian Isabelo T. Crisostomo described the PPSI as a clearing house for advertisements coming from the United States. In 1925, the first Filipino-owned agency, the Philippine Advertising Bureau, was created by Florentino Garriz. Among the artists who worked there was the watercolor painter of costumes Ricardo Gloria. The closure of American agencies after World War II led to the emergence of locally owned advertisingoutfits that employed, among others, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3686\"><strong>HernandoR.Ocampo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>CesarT.Legaspi</strong></a>, later National Artists. After Irineo Miranda&rsquo;s earlier efforts, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\"><strong>LauroA.Alcala</strong></a>, more popular as a cartoonist, spearheaded the establishment of a fine arts degree program majoring in advertising art at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>College of Fine Arts</strong></a>, University of the Philippines, in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the development of advertising as trade and industry, outdoor advertising in the form of posters and billboards came into vogue. It was also common practice to insert slide images of advertisements in between movies. Most of these were unimaginative in design, if not totally inspired by American examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the &ldquo;peace time&rdquo; era, mobile advertisements, such as those posted in the tranvia, and radio advertising came into widespread use. The most active advertising practitioners were Antonio Lagos of Hales Shoe Company, Frank J. Herier, ManuelBuenaventura, Jorge Revilla, Luzon Ocampo, and AlejandroRocesSr. Procter and Gamble Company, an international American firm that acquired Philippine Manufacturing Company in 1935, launched the first truly corporate advertising scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Comic stripadvertisement became popular in prewar years. AntonioVelasquez created various characters to personify products. Among his well-loved cartoon heroes were Isko for ESCO shoes, Tikboy for Tiki-Tiki, Capitan Cortal for the popular analgesic, and Nars Cafe for Cafiaspirina. He also drew advertisements for Plymouth sedan, Milkmaid, Kanebo, Peoples&rsquo; Shoes, Chrysler, and Might in  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2295\"><strong>Shanghai</strong></a></strong> perfume. Other print advertisements of the period were text heavy and in English, with supplementary line drawings or photographs that promoted an Americanized lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Post-World War II advertising marked the return of American firms. Although they dominated the industry and the culture projected through advertisements, many Filipinos put up their own advertising business or entered into joint ventures. D. L. Brodt, an American, opened the first postwar advertising agency, which later was named Philippine Advertising Associates, the precursor of J. Walter Thompson Company (Philippines). In 1945, Gene Hubilla founded Commercial Advertising Company. Among the first purely Filipino-owned agencies were Philiprom founded in 1945 and Pan Pacific Advertising founded in 1946. The Andres Soriano group also put up the Advertising Association. By 1949 the first full-color print advertisements were published. This established the trend of using photography as basic medium instead of text. The influence of Hollywood and the use of local movie stars as come-ons were standard practice. Grant Advertising, a branch of one of the biggest advertising firms in the United States, established an office in Manila. Ace Advertising Agency was founded by the Ramon Araneta Companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1950s, field advertising&mdash;that is, billboards and vehicle posters with soundtrack&mdash;became more popular. Cinema advertising developed. Family-owned workshops for hand-painted movie billboards on canvas, such as the Sagmit Advertising in Tondo, employed self-taught artists who painted promotional images utilizing aesthetics found in <b>komiks</b>. These outdoor billboards measure 12 ft by 12 ft, and were usually found in Quiapo and Cubao. In the mid-1970s, the billboards with the copy &ldquo;Put a Tiger in Your Tank,&rdquo; displayed along Philippine highways, were painted by Quirino Hipol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Package designing became lucrative. Full of vitality was retail advertising, such as Aguinaldo&rsquo;s, Berg&rsquo;s, and Oceanic. Among the artists in the print-advertising field during this period were HernandoOcampo and CesarLegaspi. The Philippine Association of National Advertising was organized in 1958 to professionalize advertising practices and solve ethical problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising became a highly technical and competitive field. The television, which was introduced in the Philippines in 1953, soon became the country&rsquo;s most popular advertising medium. Color printing became too expensive; thus the trend was to use black-and-white studio photography. Fashion advertising also attained sophistication. Company investments in advertising tripled in the mid-1960s. While there were only 15 advertising agencies during the previous 15 years, there were 48 by 1960. Western campaigns and norms as syndicated by multinationals were the cultural realities with which to contend. This stunted the imaginative growth of local advertising art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of creative photography in advertising started to develop. Nonetheless, there were some breakthroughs. The Philippine Advertising Counsellors dared to popularize local scenes and language in their campaigns, like those for San Miguel Beer and Banco Filipino. With the introduction of new trends in layout photography and art rendering, advertising art attained professionalism. Edwina Koch Arroyo&rsquo;s designs rejected Caucasian models for brown-skinned beauty queens. Instead of using studio photography, she set the trend by employing the talentsof well-known photojournalists DickBaldovino, Evaristo Nievera, and Sonny Yabao. These were refreshing, relevant, and intimate ways of capturing consumer attention. The advertising industry was generally in a slump during the martial law period (1972-86), although the government&rsquo;s numerous development programs made tremendous use of advertising schemes and skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the atmosphere of anti-imperialism and nationalism in the 1970s, more and more Filipino values and ideals were projected in advertising images. Himlayang Pilipino, a memorial park, promoted Philippine legends, such as &ldquo;Si Malakas at Maganda&rdquo; (Strong and Beautiful) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a>atLaura </i></b>(Florante and Laura), as well as national heroes like Tandang Sora, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\"><strong>Emilio Jacinto</strong></a>, and Gabriela Silang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There have been rapid technological changes in the field of advertising in the past 40 years. Black-and-white print ads in the 1960s, for instance, eventually transitioned to the use of color advertising and billboards from the 1970s and beyond. The rise of animation, cable TV, and other electronic forms of mass media was witnessed in the 1990s. While television still remains the main medium for advertising, over radio and print to date, new media such as the use of LED billboards, digital advertising, and the Internet have been considered as new frontiers since the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The influx of multinational advertising companies and the growth of small local agencies since the 1960s eventually gave rise to the need for self-regulation and coordination within the sector. More industry-based organizations emerged after the founding of the Philippine Association of National Advertising in 1958. Some organizations, such as the Advertising Club (1947-51) and the Advertising Standard Council in the 1990s, were short-lived, while others such as the Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies of the Philippines (4A&rsquo;s) remain active. A major federation was the Philippine Board of Advertising, founded in 1974 during the early years of martial law. It later changed its name to the Advertising Content Regulatory Board (AdBoard).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition to the University of the Philippines, more private and public tertiary institutions opened their respective fine arts, visual communications, or advertising programs, including the University of Santo Tomas, St. Paul University, Technological University of the Philippines, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, and the University of the East. Graduates of these courses supplied the growing local demand for designers, art directors, visualizers, and other professionals. Since the 1980s, advertising professionals have also sought employment as overseas Filipino workers, especially in countries within Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of advertising practitioners also pursued parallel practice in the fine arts. Among the painters and sculptors who also work in the industry are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3831\"><strong>Edwin Wilwayco</strong></a>, Pete Jimenez, Pablo Biglang-awa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3734\"><strong>Cid Reyes</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The founding of new institutions within the advertising industry gave rise to broader avenues of professional validation, such as the rise of local awards and competitions for design and advertising since the 1980s. The 4A&rsquo;s has organized the annual Creative Guild of the Philippines Awards since 1987, renaming it as the annual Kidlat Awards in 2008. The AdBoard held its first AdBoard Recognition Awards (ARAW) in 1995, while an offshoot, the ARAW Values Advertising Awards, was launched in 1998. Other newer competitions have surfaced since, such as the Tambuli Awards of the University of Asia and the Pacific held since 2005 and the adobo Design Awards held since 2010. A number of these awards, such as the ARAW, have emphasized a wider range of formats and the practice of values-oriented advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine agencies and designers also participate in international awards, such as the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Clio Awards, Mobius Advertising Awards, and the New York Festivals International Advertising Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the successful campaigns and advertisements over the years incorporate strong emotional values and humor. However, from the 1980s to the present, values that set back progressive ideas have continued to proliferate, such as Caucasian endorsement of local products (clothes, beverages, cigarettes), stereotyping of gender roles (laundry and cooking products), nuances of racism, degrading of women as sex objects to sell unrelated products (liquor) or services, overtly sexualized portrayals of minors and models, stereotyped portrayals of homosexuals, distortion of history, and the promotion of particular standards of beauty (skin whitening products). Controversies arising from the use of such advertising strategies have continued to hound the industry from the year 2000 up to the present. Increased amounts of spending for political advertisements also remain a controversial issue during the national and local election seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The struggle for advertising that conveys nondiscriminatory, truthful, and progressive messages has continued from the 1980s up to the present. A positive phenomenon to counter this is the trend toward cause-orientation. Since the 1980s, developmental advertising has become the commitment of more and more companies led by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), and Nestl&eacute; Philippines. DBP has dramatized positive traditional values and virtues, such as family unity, respect for elders, industry, and dedication. PLDT has focused on livelihood, self-sufficiency, and excellence. Nestl&eacute; inculcates individual and community discipline as values for national development. Many product campaigns have since emulated these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another development since 2000 is more collaborations between ad agencies, companies, nongovernment organizations, and contemporary visual artists. These gave rise to award-winning campaigns, such as Pilipinas Shell and Pacific Paints&rsquo; (Boysen) <b><i>Project EDSA (Everyone Deserves Safe Air)</i></b> in 2011, where a series of murals using air-purifying paint were produced along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Manila and DDB Manila&rsquo;s collaboration with women&rsquo;s rights group Gabriela on &lsquo;Bruise&rsquo; outdoor ads on the issue of violence against women in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising has also played a major role in the promotion of local and international tourism with the Department of Tourism (DOT)&rsquo;s campaigns, &ldquo;WoW Philippines&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s More Fun in the Philippines&rdquo; in 2012, both developed by BBDO Guerrero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Innovations in high-tech animation, photography, computer-generated graphics in outdoor advertising, neon signs, illuminated poster advertisements in shopping malls, use of mascots, total product improvement, and total corporate promotion have made local advertising even in an energy-strapped economy, a lively, complex, and globalized industry. The sense of social commitment and nationalism, and the high morale and level of excellence of the country&rsquo;s advertising practitioners are being strengthened&mdash;for advertising, more than an industry, is a powerful educational and cultural tool. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Spanish painter Pablo Picasso was one of its earliest practitioners, using found objects and discards. While assemblage may include collages and small constructions, in its more recent development, assemblages have been put together using larger elements and actual objects from stuffed animals to toothbrushes. An American phenomenon in the mid-1950s, it reflected the brashness of contemporary American society. American pop artist Robert Rauschenberg made assemblages of an aggressive character, one with a stuffed goat enclosed in a rubber tire, and another in an actual mattress dripped over with paint. Assemblages often break down the distinction between two-dimensional and three-dimensional art or between painting and<b> </b>sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, a number of artists, throughout the 1960s to the early 1970s created assemblages from various objects and embedded their creations with a distinctive character or narrative flavor. LambertoHechanova and EdgarDoctor did three-dimensional works with machine parts to build torso-like constructions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J. Elizalde Navarro</strong></a>&rsquo;s mixed media assemblages combined found objects and metal parts in a variety of forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Practitioners in this medium who emerged in the 1980s are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>de Arogante and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3437\"><strong>Gabriel Barredo</strong></a> with their playful, highly imaginative works. Arogante explores the use of recycled copper wires, brass wires and components, and other mechanical discards while Barredo combines assemblages from metal, wood, and found objects to produce kinetic installations. The assemblage <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2178\"><strong>Erding Erdrayb at ang Kanyang Palasyong Agaw-Tanaw</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Driver Erding and His Now-You-See-It-Now-You-Don&rsquo;t Palace), 1981, by JoseTenceRuiz aka Bogie<b><i> </i></b>combines objects and images that capture a jeepney driver&rsquo;s mindset of mixing the sacred and the profane. Decorating the movable panels, these objects and images evoke talismanic faith juxtaposed with allusions to a Japanese anime robot, and the fusion of local and global contexts. Using a discarded pay telephone box transformed into a torso of a man, the work explores the Filipino worker&rsquo;s plight in the streets of Manila or as an overseas Filipino worker in Saudi Arabia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">RobertoFeleo has also brought out new aspects in assemblage. His works, called <b><i>Sapin-Sapin </i></b>(Multilayered), show a conglomeration of pop, traditional and historical images, objects and icons, both made and found. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a> was among the early pioneers of incorporating indigenous materials in art. He used found matter as materials for his paintings, collages, and assemblages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Social themes are present in many assemblage works of artists emerging from the 1980s to the 1990s. Rey Paz Contreras and Tala Isla-Contreras both integrated discarded hardwood forms such as <i>travieza</i> (ironwood from old railroads) and <i>pinagtrosohan</i> with textiles, bead jewelry, and bones to produce works related to land, nature, and the people connected to it, eventually forming the Daambakal Sculptors Collective from such explorations. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3747\"><strong>Norberto Roldan</strong></a> combines texts, images, and found objects from everyday life to explore themes such as history, collective memory, and contemporary socioeconomic conditions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Gaudinez combines <i>retablos </i>(altarpieces), multi-paneled <i>urnas </i>(urns), inlay, and images from archival sources to examine themes such as history, myth, and folklore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rising patriotic and feminist consciousness in the visual arts is also reflected in the acrylic on assemblage works of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong>, who included materials such as <i>sawali</i> textiles, and papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; figures in her &ldquo;Sawali&rdquo; period in the mid-1980s and in works such as <b><i>Balabal ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Minggay</i></b> (Grandmother Minggay&rsquo;s Shawl), 1995-96.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From year 2000 to the present, many Philippine visual artists continued to produce assemblages in addition to other media such as painting and installation. For instance, artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3370\"><strong>Pacita Abad</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3562\"><strong>Nona Garcia</strong></a> experimented with paper and photo assemblages, respectively, alongside producing works in painting. Others have explored how assemblage can also cover the dimensions of space and sound; examples are the works of Noel Soler Cuizon who makes interactive assemblages, and Lirio Salvador who combines everyday discards and industrial materials to produce musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Assemblage remains a potent media for artistic expression and is increasingly intertwined with installation art and larger forms. The Philippine Pavilion at the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015&mdash;the country&rsquo;s second time to participate in this event since 1964&mdash;included as one of its three contributions a massive metal, wood, and velvet assemblage by Tence Ruiz, titled <b><i>Shoal</i></b>, for the exhibit <b><i>Tie a String around the World</i></b>, curated by Patrick <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

Depending on the variety and age, bamboo can be put to several uses. It may be usedin constructing the <i>bahaykubo </i>(nipa hut), ritual structures, theater platforms, fiesta decorations, as well as containers, personal accessories, tools, musical instruments, writing materials, furniture, and works of art. Thick bamboo is often used for house posts, ritual and theater structures, fiesta decor, containers, furniture, and writing materials. Thin bamboo is used for personal accessories and musical instruments. Works of art may use any kind of bamboo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Working with bamboo involves cutting and cleaning it, peeling off its smooth outer layer, cutting it into sections, and splitting, stripping, or weaving it. Decoration involves incising, burning, carving, and dyeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboo is widely used as posts, framework, and floors for the bahay kubo and various indigenous houses. Bamboo may also be stripped, plaited, and woven as <b>sawali</b>, or carefully flattened out to serve as sidings and walls. The use of bamboo creates a cool airy effect and allows the circulation of air through the slats of the floor and the sides. Bamboo is also made into detachable ladders, window supports, <b>papag </b>(beds), chicken coops and nests, and fences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboo for ritual includes platforms and altars for offerings.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong>Altar</strong></a></strong> s may be elevated platforms decorated with leaves, like those used for the <i>pagdiwata </i>(dealing with the spirit) rituals ofthe Tagbanua. They may also be as simple as the <b>tambara </b>built by the ethnolinguistic groups of Davao. To build a tambara, a single bamboo pole is cut to about 90-120 cm, then split halfway. The split section is opened so that a flat object, like a plate, can be laid on it. On the plate are ritual offerings. A raft-likeplatform is made for the Ibanag healing ritual called <b>atang-atang</b>.<i> </i>On this platform are placed food, drinks, cigarettes, and a chick for the spirits. The whole structure is decorated with paper cutouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In many provincial towns, bamboo is also used as framework for the balconies called <b>kubol</b>, on which the girls stand as they sing &ldquo;Hossana Filio David&rdquo; and shower the priest with flowers from their baskets on Palm Sunday. Bamboo is also used in the <b>galilea</b>, the four-posted structure under which, during the Easter morning <i>salubong </i>(meeting), the images of the Virgin Mary and the Risen Christ meet. From under the structure which is decorated with coconut leaves and <b>papel de japon</b><i> </i>(japanese paper) cutouts, the angel is lowered so she can remove the Virgin&rsquo;s black veil.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboo has been used for the posts and frameworks of stages for theatrical performances since the Spanish period. For these platforms, big bamboos are tied together to serve as principal posts; smaller bamboo is used for the divider (later covered with curtains or leaves), the horizontal frames from which <b>telones </b>(backdrops) are hung, the benches backstage, the railings on the sides and back, the stairs at the back, and the prompter&rsquo;s shell in front. In multilevel stages, catwalks may also be made of bamboo. All bamboo pieces are tied with rattan strips or doweled with bamboo pins. In San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, the framework and catwalks of the three-level facade of <i>komedya </i>palaces, which featured balconies and many rows of arched windows as well as parapets and flagpoles, used to be made entirely of bamboo. Both the bamboo and the labor for these structures were offered as donations and prayers to the patron saint San Dionisio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboo is similarly ubiquitous in fiesta decorations. Bamboo posts and rounded arches are used for the <b>arco </b>or ceremonial gateways through which the procession of the patron saint passes. During the Spanish period these triumphal arches could be elaborate woven and painted structures with arches, pillars, pediments, statuary, and bas-relief designed by architects in various European architectural styles. The folk version of the arco consists of a number of bamboo poles supporting a lintel, above which a pediment may be suggested. The poles may be decorated with winnowing baskets, flowers, leaves, paper cutouts, and drawings. Poles may also be linked by elaborate crisscrossed patterns. The pediment of the arco may be decorated with paper and shaped to form crowns and triangles with cross finials. All the parts are profusely ornamented with bunches of flowers, fruits, vegetables; town products, such as hats; gold and silver foil; and colorful buntings that create a festive atmosphere. In the towns of Santa Maria, Malolos, and San Miguel in Bulacan, the arco tradition is called <b>singkaban</b>. A photo of the inauguration of the Republic of Malolos on 23 Jan 1899 featured a singkaban triumphal arch. Singkaban is used during festive occasions in Bulacan towns. In this art, Francisco Eligio is considered a master artist. He employs the processes of <b>pagkakayas </b>(shaving) in creating the designs of <b>rayos </b>(rays), <b>abaniko </b>(fan), <b>dinanglay </b>(letter Y shaped design), and flower garlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ancient way of writing on bamboo called <b>surat Mangyan</b> is still practiced by the Hanunuo Mangyan of Oriental Mindoro. Using a stylus or knife, the traditional <i>ambahan</i> poetry is etched on the skin of the bamboo. In 1993,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Ginaw Bilog</strong></a></strong> was given the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (National Living Treasure Award) for preserving these traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboo furniture is made in towns like Angono, Rizal, and Pangasinan province. In recent years, bamboo furniture and sala sets have gained popularity in many households both for their light organic character and pleasing design, and relatively low cost. Designs can use bamboo for the seat or backrest, or the furniture piece as a whole. Geometric patterns can also be incised with dyes on the bamboo surface, or the material can be used in combination with abaca, steel, or other materials. Sometimes the entire root system of the bamboo plant can be integrated into the design. Bamboo for housing and furniture has to be harvested when it is sufficiently mature or <i>taga sa panahon </i>so that it is hard and can resist termites. The traditional bamboo furniture artist is exemplified by Vicente Villaluz of Angono, Rizal. An innovative designer of modern bamboo furniture is Budji Layug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manygroups, such as the Mangyan of Mindoro, use bamboo to make betel-nut or lime containers incised with geometric and stylized designs and fitted with a lid attached to the body with twine. In the north, cut lengths of bamboo are used as water or salt containers. These are usually darkened with spot and entwined with fiberfor design and ease in carrying. The Maranao use a piece of bamboo to make <b>lakub </b>(tobacco containers). These feature colorful geometric designs using crepe paper as dyes. There are, of course, baskets made of bamboo in different shapes and sizes for various functions. In these, bamboo can be combined with other materials, such as vines. Bamboo baskets include the <b>labba </b>of the Ilocos, the <b>bakul </b>of Pangasinan, the <b>bakid </b>of Laguna, and the <b>balugan</b> of Lanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manyother household and personal objects are made of bamboo. The Tboli, Mangyan,and Aeta make well-crafted bamboo combs decorated with geometric and stylized incisions, as well as with vines, brass, or beads. Lice pickers of bamboo are shaped like pointed knives and incised with traditional designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboois widely used for musical instruments in the form of flutes, zithers, harp and buzzers. The Tinguian <b>bungkaka</b>, a split-bamboo percussion instrument, is incised with chevrons and other figures, darkened with soot to make the figures emerge, and decorated with bands of woven vine. The Maranao <b>kubing </b>(jew&rsquo;s harp) is decorated with <b>okir </b>incised into the bamboo and colored with dye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abamboo tool that doubles as a musical instrument is the Bukidnon planting stick. A bamboo pole is cut&mdash;the lower end to be pointed like a spearhead and the upper end slit to create sound. The whole pole is ornamented with strands of folded buri leaves. As the pointed end of the pole is struck on the ground, a hollow thumping sound is made by the other end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, the most famous bamboo instrument made by Filipinos was the Bamboo Organ of Las Pi&ntilde;as, Rizal. Designed by the Recollect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a> in 1824, the organ has pipes of bamboo and metal. The PangkatKawayan orchestra includes the <b>angklung</b>, xylophones, and percussion entirely made of bamboo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bamboo as a medium of sculpture has been explored recently. An example of bamboo sculpture is FranciscoVerano&rsquo;s <b><i>BambooFugue</i></b>, 1972. Inspired by the <i>dap-ay</i>, a sacred ritual ground, RobertoVillanueva&rsquo;s maze titled <b><i>UmatiBiag </i></b>(Garden of Life), 1989, used bamboo and <i>runo</i> poles to evoke the mysteries of birth. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3718\"><strong>Impy Pilapil</strong></a>&rsquo;s artwork with hanging bamboos called <b><i>Chime Halo</i></b>, 2008, produces pleasing sounds when struck against each other. Other artists who have used bamboo for their installations are SantiagoBose, PazAbadSantos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2096\"><strong>Basketry</strong></a></strong> is the art of fashioning containers by weaving, plaiting, or braiding organic materials from leaves, vines, midribs, and boles into hollow three-dimensional shapes that fuse design and function. More than any other folk art, basketry reflects its social matrix, the tropical environment, and the occupations of the folk that draw from the resources of land, river, and sea. There are basically three kinds of baskets: carrying baskets, storage baskets, and trapping baskets. The Cordillera groups, which have one of the basketry traditions in the country, have carrying baskets for grain or food, such as the <b>pasiking </b>(backpack); the hunter&rsquo;s <b>takba </b>with its cover of tiered fibers for carrying meat; the <b>chagee </b>for the transport of fruits or vegetables, also worn with short straps around one&rsquo;s back; and the conical <b>kayabang</b>, supported by a sash around the forehead. They also make tapered standing baskets with strong supports for carrying rice and vegetables on the narrow trails of the terraces. The flaring or tapering sides are not merely for decorative effect but also for accommodating areas of greater stress. For instance, the backpack with its tapering shape is so constructed that the weight will not be concentrated at the base but distributed along the sides supported by thehunter&rsquo;s back. The Luzon Aeta make strong double-walled carrying baskets combining nito, <b>bamban</b>, and rattan. The round <b>bilao </b>can also be considered a carrying basket used for winnowing rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Inthe Visayas and in Mindanao, the Tiruray, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Tboli, and Mangyan fashion finely crafted baskets and bags for carrying personal objects, which also serve as colorful accessories to their costumes. Baskets may be ornamented with tufts of animal hair, broad and colorful panels of woven beads, and brass bells. Compared to the lowland folk, the ethnolinguistic groups show a freer and uninhibited approach to material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All regions have their own storing baskets. Among these are the <b>bakul </b>or the lowlandgrain baskets of Pangasinan; the Ilocano <b>labba</b>; the Bontoc round oval <b>akob</b>, with its close-fitting lid to hold cooked rice or camote for lunch in the field; and the <b>koppit</b>, with its several close-fitting sections. The lowland <b>bulligan</b> is used for rice storage in Laguna. From Bulacan are egg baskets of split bamboo in which acurving base secures the eggs firmly in place. Palawan groups make household baskets, big and small, with geometric designs playing on different materials and fitted with covers. Examples of these storing baskets are the <b>lusong </b>and <b>tingkap </b>of Palawan, reinforced at the foot with a heavy piece of bamboo. The rectangular and lidded <b>rambit </b>are seed baskets of the Palawe&ntilde;o. In the south, the Maranao, Maguindanao, and Tausug have also brought the art of basketry to perfection with an added note of color. The <b>marigai </b>are rice containers in bird shapes, single or tiered, made of flattened pandan leaves dyed in vivid colors. Maguindanao baskets are made of soft sea grass dyed in magenta, violet, green, and yellow pigments, giving them a distinctive character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are not only baskets for trapping animals and catching fish but baskets with more specific functions. Catching fish in the rice paddies requires the <b>salakab</b>, made of bamboo stakes curving out from a single node of bamboo. There are creels and traps for eels, shrimps, snails in the paddies, as well as <b>bobo</b>, which has an inner cone to catch small river fish. Cordillera folk make baskets adapted to the work of farming in the rice terraces. <b>Agawin</b>, made of fine rattan, are baskets used forcollecting snails in the rice paddy. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> <b>butit </b>is an open-cage basket used for collecting locusts or grasshoppers. Pangasinan folk make fish creels with high shoulder points worn tied to the waist. An example is the <b>hasang</b>, with a flexible cone at the mouth used for catching and retaining fish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Basketry exemplifies the creative use of materials from the environment. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> is gathered from dense groves, then cut and split into strips for coiling and weaving, the outer skin acquiring a yellow sheen with age and use. Bamboo rapidly grows into tall and slender boles with vigorous, spiky leaves springing from the nodes; thus bamboo as a material has a finesse and purity, combined with resilience and strength. Coconut midribs make for strong structure, and they are often used to reinforce other materials. Also made into baskets are large leaves, dried and flattened, from the crown of the bun palm and anahaw with its light broad fronds that suggest a natural fan or instant sunshade. Vines, such as the dark nito and the reddish <i>sigid</i>, also come into use as they are valued for strength and decorative potential; their dark tones are used in contrast with lighter-toned materials. Folk ingenuity has made use of materials from bark, leaf, vine, bamboo, rattan, fern, pine needle, and pine cone. The use of such a wide range of materials implies an intimate understanding of their natural properties so that these can be enhanced and brought to full use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Forornamentation, naturaldyes are sometimes used, as in Maranao and Maguindanao baskets. But the very shapes themselves are aesthetically pleasing in their interplay of form and function, as basketry is highlighted not only as artifact but also as process and performance continually renewed by the folk artist. Likewise most of the ornamentation has to do with light and dark contrasts produced in the same material by alternating inner and outer skin, or in the use of different materials of contrasting tones that are woven into geometric designs. Color often plays only a secondary role, since natural dyes would little withstand the daily wear and tear of domestic or occupational use to which the baskets are subjected. Besides, their natural hues, ranging from very light brown to black, preserve the organic vitality of the materials and the precious sense of the basket having been produced from within the bosom of nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Originally,basketry and its related forms&mdash;for example, matweaving, hat weaving, and the craftingof personaladornments, such as anklets, with their rich geometric motifs&mdash;had a communal meaning and function. This function was to mediate between humans and nature in an animist worldview where the hunter, the farmer, and the fisher continually communed with the spirits of field, river, sky, and sea for survival and daily sustenance. On another level, these motifs and stylized natural forms signify human beings as part of nature through which they share the common vitality of all living forms.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Book design</b> is the artistic structuring and proficient reproduction of bound pages of text and images protected by cardboard, cloth, or leather-bound covers. The creative and integrative use of images, not merely as illustration to a text, have produced the category of &ldquo;book art&rdquo; in the history and practice of book publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many Filipino cultural groups, like the Tagalog, llocano, Pampango, and Cebuano, had a syllabary and a system of writing before the 16th century. This writing was done on pieces of bamboo or palm leaves, which may be considered the first &ldquo;books&rdquo; in the Philippines. The Mangyan of Mindoro and the Tagbanwa of Palawan use a native syllabary, which they etch on bamboo nodes or bamboo slats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the onset of the Spanish colonization, the members of the native aristocracy strove to learn the Spanish language and Roman alphabet; by the first quarter of the 17th century, they had become <b>escribientes </b>or <b>escribanos </b>(scribes or amanuenses). When the friars established presses, some of these scribes, like Luis Beltran, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5598\"><strong>Tomas Pinpin</strong></a>, Diego Talaghay, Domingo Lagos, Jacinto Magarulao, and Raymundo Mag-isa, were trained to be printers and bookmakers. Since then, Filipinos have trained and become involved in book production, whether in the form of the more rudimentary and personal handwritten codices, or in the more impersonal product of the handpress, the printed book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Spanish period, scholarly priests illuminated their writings or hired scribes to rewrite them, and painters to decorate them with borders, illuminated letters, and images. Book collectors who wished to have copies of texts, published or unpublished, similarly commissioned scribes and illuminators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Osario Venerable</i></b> (Venerable Charnel House), Fr Agustin Maria de Castro&rsquo;s compilation of biographies of Augustinian clerics in the Philippines through 1780, is found Manuel de Gracia&rsquo;s painting of the adoration of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. Another artistic manuscript created by de Gracia is his transcription of Father de Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>Historia del Insigne Convento de San Pablo de Manila</i></b> (History of the Noble Convent of Saint Paul of Manila), 1770, in which he painted an image of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Gracia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Anales Ecclesiasticos de Filipinas</i></b> (Ecclesiastical Annals of the Philippines), on the other hand, was commissioned by a book collector whose initials F. D. (Francisco Durano) are inscribed on the manuscript. The text, originally written in Spanish and Latin by various church scribes, chronicles church history from 1574 to 1682 through reports, appointments, and letters of correspondences. <b><i>Anales</i></b>, which was probably written in the late 17th century, is in the orthography and decorations of the late 18th century. Consisting of 479 folios, the <b><i>Anales</i></b> is replete with illuminations reminiscent of the spontaneous medieval style. For example, a report on the death of Don Fernando Montero de Espinosa, the seventh archbishop of Manila, used the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; for an illustration of the dead archbishop wearing his ecclesiastical robes and headdress while lying on a funeral bier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As 18th-century works, both de Gracia&rsquo;s creations and the <b><i>Anales</i></b><i> </i>were influenced in their layout by printed books of the same period. As manuscripts, they were, however, less rigid and regular. Other finely designed manuscripts, dating later and known to still be in existence, chiefly dwell on the <i>pasyon</i>, magical incantations, and local history. They continued to be visible until the 1930s, as seen in painter-poet Hernando R. Ocampo&rsquo;s book of love poems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Printing was also introduced by Spanish colonization. Initially, printing from woodblocks was used by the earliest printers, who were Chinese immigrants. At least nine works were impressed through this method until 1607, including the first books published in the country&mdash;the <b><i>Wu-chi Tien-Chucheng-Chiaochen-Chuan Shih-lu</i></b> (Testimony of the True Religion), a treatise on the Christian faith and other matters, 1593, and <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</i></b> (Christian Doctrine in the Spanish and Tagalog Languages), 1593. Both pamphlets featured illustrations on their title pages, cut from blocklike text. The layout observed a single-rule border. The text of the <b><i>Doctrina</i></b> was printed in the Roman alphabet in gothic type except for the translations into Tagalog, which used the old Tagalog script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Typography came about in the early 1600s with the <b><i>Libro de los Quatro Postrimerias</i></b> (Book of the Four Deaths), 1604, regarded as the first material printed in this method. The printer was Juan de Vera, a devout Chinese convert. The Dominican historian Diego de Aduarte credits de Vera with &ldquo;achieving everything necessary to do printing.&rdquo; An analysis of the fonts as represented in local books showed that the types were cast locally, apparently identical with those from de Vera&rsquo;s foundry. The punches were cut and the matrices struck in Manila. Early books were called <b>folio </b>or <b>quarto</b> to indicate their sizes depending on the number of times the sheets were folded (Buhain 1998, 8). <b>Folio</b> sheets, for instance, were folded once to make four pages while <b>quarto</b> sheets were folded twice to make eight pages. Smaller editions of books came out toward the end of the 18th century (Buhain 1998, 8). The most commonly used paper during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries were <i>papel de arroz</i> or rice paper, linen paper, <i>papel de hilo</i> or <i>papel de china</i>. Book paper exclusively came from China until the late 19th century, when it was also imported from England. Binding and book covers were also very rudimentary until the mid-19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The elegance of locally printed books was judged primarily by the regularity of the typesetting and the finesse of the layout. The friars, enraged by typographical errors, scolded both careless typesetters as well as scribes. The most common ornaments consisted of arabesques struck from types arranged into bands that often formed the borders of the title page. Other types of ornaments included asterisks, crosses, eggs, darts, hearts, and tendrils. In the breaks between chapters could be seen woodcuts or copper engravings of cherubs, vases of flowers, and other motifs. Important publications featured engraved illustrations. The presence of the coat of arms of a noble house or symbols of a religious order indicated their involvement with or endorsement of the contents of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 1593, the religious orders, such as the Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans, and Jesuits, established their own presses. By 1800, and after the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, only three presses remained: those of the Colegio de Santo Tomas owned by the Dominicans; the Convento de los Angeles in Sampaloc owned by the Franciscans; and the Conciliar y Real Seminario de San Carlos, which the Jesuits purchased from the Augustinians in the mid-1700s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Published in 1713 by the Franciscans was the first book featuring illustrations complementing the text, <b><i>Ang Infiernong Nabubucsan sa Tauong Christiano</i></b> (The Hell That Opens for the Christians). Serving the didactic purpose of evangelization, the book presented an image of hell as a place where people burn as punishment for refusing to be converted to the Christian faith. Its pictures were engraved on copper by the Franciscan Francisco Rodriguez. In 1760, Nicolas de la Cruz <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a>, then manager of the Jesuit Press, printed <b><i>Manga Panalanging Pagtatagobilin sa Caloloua nang Tauong Naghihingalo</i></b> (Prayers of Guidance for the Soul of the Dying). The title page was artistically adorned with type ornaments. The book also contained several copper engravings by de la Cruz Bagay himself, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3783\"><strong>Francisco Suarez</strong></a>, and Luis Suarez. The most ornate title page was that of <b><i>La Razon en las Medidas </i></b>(The Reason in Measurements), a book justifying measurements used in the galleon in which the bibliographic particulars were framed within an elaborate triumphal arch drawn and engraved by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3421\"><strong>Lorenzo Atlas</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the arrival of the four-cylinder and rotary press in the 19th century, printing became more technically proficient and fast, but the personal imprint of bookmaking of the previous period vanished. The friars who were the first chief writers of both scholarly treatises and local church history, which encompassed the geography and culture of their flock, shifted their energies to censorship. Books became increasingly secular in subject, with the <i>insulares</i> or Spanish immigrants becoming more involved in book publishing and in supervising the press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most artistically designed, locally produced book in the 19th century was the <b><i>Discurso Pronunciado por M.R.P. Fr Hypolito Huerta</i></b> (Speech Delivered by the V.R.F. Fray Hipolito Huerta), published in 1851 by the Imprenta de Diario de Manila. The title page features a gothic arch framing the bibliographical details, constructed out of type ornaments. The most profusely illustrated locally produced book was <b><i>Milicia de Jesucristo</i></b> (Army of Jesus Christ), a handbook for the use of the Third Order of the Dominican Order. This was by Fr Francisco Gainza and was published in 1859. It contained some 30 engravings by Felipe Monteclaro and Carlos Borromeo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The secularization of printing press ownership began in 1814. The first private printshop entrepreneur was Manuel Memije, proprietor of Imprenta Filipina. Modern printing presses using new letter types and involving more manpower were established in the country in the late 1840s. These were owned by Establecimiento Tipografico del Diario de Manila, which published the first daily newspaper. In 1858, Manuel Ramirez and Baltazar Giraudier established Imprenta y Litografia de Ramirez y Giraudier, which led to the publication of the illustrated magazine <b><i>Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>, 1859-60 and 1882. Although the book design tended to be formal and impersonal, the type design and layout were more professional. Botanical illustrations, such as <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b> (1877-83) by Augustinian friar Manuel Blanco, documenting Philippine flora through detailed drawings of plants, underscore the transition of art production in the late 19th century from religious subject to secularization of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With insulares and foreigners taking over the publishing business, the <i>indio </i>(Christianized native) and Chinese mestizo printers opened smaller printing shops publishing mainly novenas and calendars in the vernacular. Publishers of vernacular newspapers in the provinces also printed novenas, <i>awit</i> and <i>korido </i>(metrical tales), and other printed materials. These often featured on the cover an illustration depicting the saint to whom a novena is dedicated, or a scene from the awit or korido. These pamphlets were mostly functional but not artistically or technically outstanding. Color printing was introduced in the 1890s, as seen in some extant issues of the newspaper <b><i>El Pajaro Verde</i></b>. The same period would also usher in photography and its usefulness in documenting everyday life in the then Spanish colony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American period introduced technology that is responsible for the characteristics of Philippine modern book design: glossy pages, leather or clothbound covers, colored photographs, and graphic design featuring colors and stamping in silver or gold. These artistic elements are seen in special publications, like yearbooks, anniversary issues, and school annuals. Excellently lighted pictures were reproduced in the photogravure process done mainly by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\"><strong>Antonio Garcia</strong></a></strong> Granada, professor of engraving at the University of the Philippines School (now College) of Fine Arts since its incipience in 1909. Printing the most glossy publications up to the 1960s, Carmelo and Bauermann Inc supplanted the Establecimiento Tipolitografico Ciudad Condal de Chofre y Ca, which was founded in 1880 by Salvador Chofre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary materials were complemented by artistically designed book covers. Important painters, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3721\"><strong>Jorge Pineda</strong></a>, designed book covers like that of <b><i>Cantos del Tropico</i></b> (Songs of the Tropics) by Manuel Bernabe, showing the Philippine muse in color. Amorsolo drew many illustrations for books, ranging from novels like <b><i>Parusa ng Diyos</i></b> (Punishment of God) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a> to primary readers like the <b><i>Philippine Readers</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5546\"><strong>Camilo Osias</strong></a>, the latter printed in the United States. A locally printed, elegantly designed book was <b><i>Fifty Philippine Birds</i></b> by Dr Canuto O. Manuel, 1936, featuring beautiful drawings in color by Macario <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, the new commercial interest in print media and advertising greatly increased enrollment in editorial design and graphic reproduction courses in fine arts schools. The proliferation of imported art posters and art books in the market contributed to a consciousness of contemporary book design. However, artists were still generally limited to design and layout of calendars, exhibition catalogues, corporate annual reports, yearbooks, posters, souvenir programs, and other promotional items. Limited editions of poetry books were published in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, illustrated books, also called coffee-table books, came into vogue. Most of their designs tended to be trendy, following modes taken from Western graphic annuals. In the following two decades, a substantial output of these expensive books have tackled a variety of topics, such as art, tourism, advertising, food, fashion, and history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1974 publication <b><i>Beyond Art</i></b>, written and designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3702\"><strong>Rodolfo Paras-Perez</strong></a>, demonstrated the many imaginative possibilities of book design even for such a scholarly topic as a treatise on the history and development of a single work of art. Paras-Perez&rsquo;s other books on artists&rsquo; lives and works are <b><i>Tolentino</i></b>, 1976; <b><i>Manansala</i></b>, 1980; <b><i>Sanso</i></b>, 1988; and <b><i>Zobel</i></b>, 1990&mdash;all landmarks of book design. With himself as author and designer, there is total unity of visual design and textual content as Paras-Perez carefully elucidated the philosophy, feeling, and changing style of each artist. He also designed Epifanio San Juan&rsquo;s English translation of Balagtas&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> at Laura</i></b><i> </i>(Florante and Laura), and illustrated this with woodcuts printed from his original woodblocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1978, the book <b><i>Turn of the Century</i></b>, planned and produced by publisher-fictionist-essayist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5183\"><strong>Gilda Cordero-Fernando</strong></a> and book designer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3736\"><strong>Nik Ricio</strong></a>, was published. A recipient of international book design awards, Ricio&rsquo;s excellent reinterpretation of Philippine art nouveau so strongly appealed to nostalgia and national pride that it attained the widest patronage ever for illustrated books. Perhaps the most prolific of all book artists, Ricio&rsquo;s other outstanding designs are <b><i>Being Filipino</i></b>, 1981, <b><i>History of the Burgis</i></b>, 1987, <b><i>The Soul Book</i></b>, 1991, and <b><i>The Body Book</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1993, for GCF Books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Frey Cabading&rsquo;s design for the two-volume <b><i>Philippine Atlas</i></b>, published by Fund for Assistance to Private Education, won a citation in the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1974. His design for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\"><strong>Nick Joaquin</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Almanac for Manile&ntilde;os</i></b>, 1979, received an award from the 1980 International Graphic Biennale in Czechoslovakia. He also did Felice P. Sta. Maria&rsquo;s <b><i>Household Antiques and Heirlooms</i></b> in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book designs of Paras-Perez, Ricio, and Cabading are exemplary not necessarily because they are concerned with what is new in the international graphic scene but because they are able to present the topics or themes of a book as conceived by the author, rendering them with distinctive visual character and impeccable reproduction. Other notable contemporary book designers are Edwina Koch Arroyo, Margarita Simpliciano, and Frances Viana, who use very simple but cosmopolitan approaches to book design. The underground press during the martial law period contributed to the spirit of protest art, as exemplified by <b><i>Ulos</i></b>, the cultural journal of the National Democratic Front. Artists who were members of Artista and Manunulat ng Sambayanan worked in illustrating essays, drawing comics, and collaging of images, related to issues on human rights, and the search for social justice in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Children&rsquo;s book publication through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/111\"><strong>Adarna</strong></a> House ushered in the collaboration of writers and visual artists. Spearheaded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5033\"><strong>Virgilio S. Almario</strong></a>, later National Artist for literature, flipbooks and storybooks that emphasized Philippine culture were illustrated by artists such as Marci Dans Lee, Katti Sta. Ana, Jess Abrera, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3472\"><strong>Mariano Ching</strong></a>, among others. Visual artists also worked for and with graphic novel publishers, such as Zines, Visprint, and Excelsior, thus combining their personal art practice with art for mass distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1980s, desktop publishing came into vogue with the popularity of PCs and software such as Pagemaker, which made small-scale publishing more accessible to a wider public, including do-it-yourself mode of publication (Guillermo 2014). The computer also introduced the e-book as a new book format. E-books in portable document format (PDF) became popular because they were downloadable and did not take up too much space. In the 2000s, readers like Kindle and the iPad ushered in a new format for book design. In this format, such as that used in e-Pub, the basic unit of design is a single page as it appears on the screen. The book is a text file that is designed to be malleable, allowing freedom for readers to manipulate the font size, highlight parts, bookmark pages, and write notes. Unlike printed books and PDF files where the text is fixed, the settings in ePub can be adjusted, eventually affecting the flow of the text. In the Philippines, publishers such as Flipside and C &amp; E books started marketing e-books to the public in late 2000. While e-books are gaining popularity, many readers still prefer the sensory lure of printed books. A 2012 National Book Development Board (NBDB) readership survey revealed that there were three million e-readers in the Philippines but that 90 percent of the 80 percent of Filipinos who read books still preferred their books in print with original covers (Lape&ntilde;a 2012). The high prices of electronic reading devices have also made e-books unreachable for many. In order to attract readers to e-books, many layout artists design these to look like the physical copies in an attempt to provide readers with almost the same experience of reading a printed book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1980s to the present, various institutions have given recognition to book designers for their outstanding works. BG Y. Hernandez and Fidel Rillo are among those who have received recognition from the NBDB and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\"><strong>Manila Critics Circle</strong></a>. The Philippine Board on Books for Young People through the Alcala Prize also annually awards talented and exceptional illustrators of children&rsquo;s books and books for young adults. Among those who have received the Alcala Prize are Ferdinand Doctolero, Mariano Ching, Yasmin Doctor, Hubert Fucio, and Ferdinand Guevarra.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

Dress is usually complemented by specific accessories and hairstyles for each group, community, or nation. If a particular type of dress becomes popular at a specific era and location, it becomes the &ldquo;<b>fashion</b>&rdquo; of the time. When the dress for past historical periods are recreated for the present whether for theatrical performances, religious rituals, or social occasions, it is usually called a <b>costume</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dress may differ according to gender (male, female, others), class (slave, free person, noble, lower class, middle class, or upper class), age (child, youth, adult, or elderly), civil status (single, married, or widowed), occupation (peasant, merchant, soldier, teacher, priest, and others), rank (governor-general, bishop, or mayor during the Spanish colonial period), and personal taste of an individual. Variations may also occur because of differences in climate (lowland or highland); foreign relations (open to influences from other countries or isolated from all other nations); cultural influence (colonized by a Western nation for many centuries or exposed to the mass media of today); and indigenous, regional, or organizational identity (uniform patterns, cuts, and colors used by one ethnolinguistic group to distinguish themselves from other groups, whether ethnic, lowland, or modern urban).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More than any other form of culture, dress reflects the dominant traditions as well as the emergent values and aspirations of a given people. To trace the shifting silhouettes of Philippine apparel, therefore, is to discern the structures of as well as the major changes in Philippine society from the indigenous to the Spanish, American, and post-World War II periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Living Indigenous Tradition </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The precolonial dresses worn by the indigenous peoples of the archipelago are similar to many of those worn by other indigenous groups in Malaysia and Indonesiaand are typified by the attires of the late 16th-century Tagalog. Tagalog males wore loose waist-length, collarless <b>baro </b>or shirts, which had short or long sleeves. These shirts could be of cotton, linen, or muslin, and were usually blue or black for commoners but red (called <b>chininas</b>) for chiefs. To cover the lower half of the body, the Tagalog had the cotton <b>bahaque or bahag</b>, a strip of colored cloth passed around the waist and between the legs reaching halfway down the thighs (Morga in Blair and Robertson 7:75-7). Tubular skirts, like today&rsquo;s <b>sarong</b>, could also be passed between the legs and tucked onto the front of the waist or worn crossed over the shoulder, the other end under one arm. Accessories included a <b>balarao </b>(short sword) hanging from the waist; a long and narrow <b>putong </b>folded in many fancy ways around the head; and jewelry-like gold-chain necklaces, gold armlets called <b>calombigas</b>, chainlets worn from the calf to the knees, rings of gold and precious stones, and bracelets of gold or ivory. The <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b>, circa 1590, provides the earliest visual documentation of the male and female dresses of the Tagalog, Visaya, Zambal, Cagayanon, and Aeta.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tagalog women covered the lower part of the body with a barrel skirt like a sarong, which was knotted at one side. On top of this skirt was sometimes wrapped a kirtle of silk decorated with gold embroidery on the fringes. For tops they wore small, loose, collarless jackets with short or long sleeves and reaching to the waist. Called <b>varo </b>or baro these could be made of all colors, and embroidered around the neckline and sleeve ends. They wore neither shoes nor underwear but were laden with (mostly gold) jewelry, which included huge hoop earrings, several necklaces, bracelets, rings with precious stones, and anklets. Hair was usually anointed with oils and perfumes, tied up in a knot and decorated with ribbons or flowers (Morga in Blair and Robertson 7:77-8). Upper-class females may even wear golden diadems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dress similar to those of the precolonial Tagalog continued to be worn by other ethnic groups in the islands, specifically among the five percent who were not substantially changed by Spanish and American colonization. Similar to the Tagalogbahag is the <b>wanes</b> or G-string of the Bontok male. This long piece of woven cloth, approximately 20.32 cm wide and 2.13 m long, is passed once between the legs and several times around the hips, leaving its two end panels hanging freely on the front and at the back. Naturally dyed in red, black, and white, the G-string may be decorated with patterns of horses, snakes, lizards, spears, and shields. Round hats with feathers, pipes, necklaces with fertility pendants, <b>bolo</b> hung from the side, or wraparound blankets for the cold may complement the Bontoc male apparel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bontok females wear a traditional wraparound rectangular skirt, called <b>lufid </b>or <b>gat-teng</b>,<i> </i>which has three versions: the knee length, two-panelled skirt called <b>kinarchago</b>,<i> </i>which is for working in the fields or the house; a longer three-panelled skirt called the <b>inorma </b>or <b>pinagpakan</b>, for special feasts and occasions; and the dark-colored <b>kayin</b> worn only by the dead. To fasten the lufid, the Bontok woman wears a long white sash or belt, provided with fringes at both ends. Called <b>wak-es</b><i> </i>or <b>bakget</b>, this sash is tied twice around the waist and over the skirt, and secured by a knot at the back. Before World War II, most women woreno blouses but only exquisite tattoos on their arms, breasts, and necks. The hair was held up by strings of beads or with dried snake vertebrae, a talisman against lightnings and angry anito. Blankets serving as pockets were slung over shoulders to hold babies, vegetables, or rice seedlings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thetraditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> apparel likewise recalls the old Tagalog. To this day, Bagobo males wear, for special occasions, the knee-length breeches of woven abaca cloth held up by a belt, and the long-sleeved abaca jackets, which are open in front. The dark patterns of the waxed abaca cloth are enlivened by small beads and shell sequins sewn onto both the pants and jacket in dense complex patterns. Similar to the Tagalog putong and Visayan <b>puron</b>, the Bagobo <b>tangkulo</b><i> </i>is a large piece of red cloth decorated with beads and tassels at the edges, and folded in many ways to crown the male&rsquo;s head. A long bolo hanging from a belt on the side, bags trimmed with tassels and bells, bracelets, necklaces, and anklets are the usual accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bagobo women&rsquo;s traditional costumes are the ankle-length barrel skirt of handwoven abaca fiber, which is folded in front of the waist and secured with a belt, and the long-sleeved, collarless, waist-length blouses, which used to be of abaca but are now usually of commercial cotton. Blouses are decorated with beads, sequins, and embroidery. Hoop earrings, several bead necklaces, brass bracelets from waist to elbow, and several anklets with bells complete the Bagobo female costume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the typical dress for males and females of the tribes, each tribe had special garments for the different classes like the nobility, freemen, and slaves, as well as key personalities like the datu and the shamans. Their clothes were distinguished by the kind of materials used (imported silks or damasks) or the amount and quality of jewelry worn all over the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a whole, the indigenous attires of native Filipinos reveal an intriguing complex of meanings. Through their clothes, the natives came to terms with nature. In extracting threads from cotton and abaca and color from native plants, the nativesharnessed nature toward their own needs. In embroidering and weaving suns, stars, snakes, lizards, flowers, and birds into their clothes and snake vertebrae into their apparel, they established harmony with nature. In wearing loose, collarless garments made of natural fibers and wearing light and minimal clothing, they conquered the tropical climate by opening up to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Moreover, through their clothes, the indigenous Filipinos reaffirmed the priorities and values, as well as the hierarchies, of the ethnolinguistic group. In glorifying the warrior who wore the most number of tattoos among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a> and the red or embroidered putong among the Tagalog, bravery was enshrined as one of the most important values in the tribe, and one essential to its survival. In allowing the shaman to vest himself or herself in special clothes (sometimes female garb for male shamans), they underscored the importance of the native priest as the medium to the gods, who must be placated to ensure a good harvest, victory in war, health for the infirm, prosperity and well-being for the newly born, the newly baptized, the newly wed, and a comfortable afterlife for their beloved departed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finally, through their apparel and the material culture that went with them, the indigenous people underscored and secured its identity as a group separate from others. This identity served as a rallying point against invaders, both local and foreign. Thus the Tausug insisted on wearing their turbans in face of the European cultural onslaught,just as the Tinguian refused to give up their G-strings in spite of the Spanish orders and threats of incarceration. Dress, like the native animism, were an antidote to colonization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Hispanic Tradition and Local Transformations</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1565 Miguel Lopez de Legazpi started the systematic colonization of the islands. Pueblos founded by the Spaniards became the centers for the propagation of Christian and Hispanic culture. After burning the vestiges of what they called the pagan culture of the natives, the Spaniards set themselves up as the model for imitation in everything, from religion to dress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 18th century, the<i> indio </i>or colonized man donned garments that began to show some European influence. The Tagalog male wore knee-length breeches called <b>salawal</b>; a baro or native shirt, now with collars, cuffs, and cravat, but worn untucked; a square putong that could be used as a headpiece or a handkerchief; and for formal occasions, the <b>lambong </b>gathered and draped across the torso from one shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <i>india </i>or colonized woman still wore her precolonial baro (blouse), <b>saya </b>(barrel skirt), <b>tapis</b><i> </i>(overskirt), and a kerchief. For gala occasions, however, a square <b>pa&ntilde;uelo </b>was folded diagonally and placed over the woman&rsquo;s shoulders and modestly crossed over her breasts. Slippers or shoes, rosary necklaces, and scapulars began to take the place of indigenous bead or gold necklaces. Significant was the introduction of strings to draw the upper part of the barrel skirt tight around the woman&rsquo;s waist. The 18th-century dresses of native males and females are documented in the vignettes that Nicolas de la Cruz <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a> etched around the Murillo Velarde map of the Philippines in 1734.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the opening of the islands to world trade in the 19th century, the new agricultural export economy brought untold wealth to the mestizo families whose lands were planted to abaca, copra, sugar, coffee, and tobacco. This new economic and political elite sought to be equal to the Spaniards&mdash;in religion, education, language, cuisine, and fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the beginning of the century, upper-class males sported striped or plain, loose silk pantaloons called <b>saya-saya</b>, which were embroidered at the hem. Over this was worn a shirt of transparent, embroidered <b>pi&ntilde;a </b>(pineapple fiber) or <b>jusi</b> (pineapple fiber mixed with banana fiber) with collars, cuffs, and cravats. Top hat, shoes (but no socks), and handkerchiefs underscored the costume&rsquo;s European aspirations. Lower-class males continued to wear the knee-length breeches of the previous centuries, and a loose long-sleeved shirt with a collar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the same time, wealthy ladies reinterpreted the baro-saya-pa&ntilde;uelo ensemble according to the silhouette of the Napoleonic era. In the 1830s mestizas wore the empire-waisted saya with short, tight-fitting baro and small pa&ntilde;uelo, complemented with pi&ntilde;a veils, handkerchiefs, and slippers; or the normal saya gathered tight with a tapis, and a baro with long, tight, cuffed sleeves, worn with wide shawls and Spanish veils. The fashions of the 1830s are amply documented by the <b>tipos del pais</b> (inhabitants of the country) albums of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1850s, informal wear for rich mestizos included European-type pants and shoes, and the baro of handwoven pi&ntilde;a or jusi. Plain or striped, the baro had a European-type collar, cuffs, and buttons in front, although it remained untucked, even when a<i> </i><b>frac </b>or coat with tails was worn over it for formal affairs. <a 1096=\"\" 24=\"\" 4=\"\" articlepage=\"\" dev-epa.info-aid.net=\"\" href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2&lt;a href=\" https:=\"\" index.php=\"\" sys_controllers=\"\"><strong>100</strong></a>&quot;&gt; <strong>Embroidery</strong> decorated the shirt. For weddings, fiestas, and other formal affairs, the elite could opt for completely European ensembles. Top hat, cane, and handkerchief embellished a gentleman&rsquo;s costume. Males of the lower classes now wore light colored cotton pants with drawstrings at the waist, and long-sleeved, collarless shirts that fell to the middle of the thighs, and the putong resembling a large kerchief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1860s, Victorian crinolines started to invade Manila. The saya began to flare out from the waist down with the help of several petticoats, while the baro adopted the wide Victorian angel sleeves, and the pa&ntilde;uelo interpreted itself as a European <b>fichu</b>. Baro, pa&ntilde;uelo, and saya came in bright colors and usually in stripes big and small, but the tapis tended to be dark in hue.<i> </i>Combs, hair pins, earrings, necklaces, rings, bracelets, and slippers completed the attire of the affluent classes. Women of the lower classes still wore the baro of sinamay with sleeves that had started to widen. Over this chemise was worn an <b>alampay</b><i> </i>(big kerchief), either folded diagonally and thrown over both shoulders or folded horizontally and thrown over one shoulder. Cotton saya in bright checks or stripes were covered tight with silk tapis from Baliuag. Tapis and alampay were usually matched. Small <b>criolla</b> earrings and scapulars were used by the lower classes. Mid-19th-century apparels are recorded in the albums and paintings of Jose Lozano and C. W. Andrews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the end of the century, male formal fashions from the upper class caught up with the European, especially because the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated both the arrival in the Philippines of more Europeans, European goods and magazines, as well as the travel of Filipinos to Europe. By the end of the century, another type of suit became popular among students. Made of white linen or cotton, the <b>americana cerrada</b><i> </i>from South America featured a white coat that was buttoned in front, all the way up to the upright collar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the end of the century, the loose, collarless, long-sleeved baro or shirt of the lower-class male began to have buttons in front and was called the <b>camisa de chino</b><i> </i>(Chinese shirt)<i>. </i>This could be made of local or imported material&mdash;plain, printed, or embroidered&mdash;with or without a pocket. Cotton pajama-like pants continued to be used by the working class, but more formal occasions called for the long European-type <b>pantalon</b> (pants). The putong now became a <b>panyo</b> or handkerchief, and <b>salakot </b>(wide, round hats) of gourd or <b>nito</b> vine were embellished with silver ornaments to distinguish the native <i>cabeza. </i>As demanded by urbanized society, even indios now began to subject themselves to the ordeal of wearing slippers at mass or for visits with the upper class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the end of the century, the European bustle ensemble, which drew the skirt up to the derriere and allowed it to fall behind in a sumptuous train, inspired the skirt ofthe so-called <b>maria clara</b>. Named after the heroine of JoseRizal&rsquo;s novel <b><i>NoliMeTangere</i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not), 1887, this ensemble consisted of a gala skirt that flared out in a rounded <b>cola </b>or train at the back. The skirt was usually made of imported Chinese silks, velvets, or satins, used whole or cut into alternating gores. The saya could now be worn <b>de suelta</b><i> </i>or loose, meaning without a tapis in imitation of French fashions. The baro had wide sleeves, whose design often matched that of the sloped pa&ntilde;uelo. The pi&ntilde;a or jusi of both baro and pa&ntilde;uelo could be dyed in pastels or dark colors (the latter for old people or for widows), but dyed or not, both always flaunted the <b>labor </b>(embroidery) of flowers, birds, butterflies, as well as the names and monograms of the owner. A short- or long-sleeved, round-collared undershirt called <b>chambra</b> modestly covered the torso under the transparent baro and pa&ntilde;uelo, while <b>salawal </b>(drawers), <b>medias </b>(stockings), and <b>enaguas</b><i> </i>(long slips) were wornunder the saya. Jewelry included <b>peinetas</b><i> </i>(gold combs) and <b>agujillas</b><i> </i>(hair pins); <b>aretes</b><i> </i>(earrings) of <b>sinampaloc </b>(tamarind-like) or <b>rosita</b><i> </i>(roselike) design; necklaces of the <b>alpahor</b><i> </i>(flat chain) or <b>tamborin </b>(round, filigree beads) type with pendants of crucifix or oval <i>relicario </i>(reliquary) called <b>agnos </b>or gold-embroidered scapulars hanging from golden chains; <b>pulseras</b><i> </i>(bracelets) and <b>singsing </b>(rings) of many designs and stones; an <b>alfiler</b><i> </i>(brooch) for the pa&ntilde;uelo; a <b>porta abanico</b><i> </i>or <b>abaniquera</b><i> </i>chain for the imported fan, and a <b>llavera</b><i> </i>(key holder) for the household keys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A drastic reorientation of Philippine dress occurred during the Spanish period. First and foremost, dress served to reflect and reaffirm the highly stratified structure of colonial society. The descending order of the economic, political, and social hierarchy corresponded to the diminishing degrees of Hispanization in dress, with the Spaniards, both the <i>peninsulares</i> (born in Spain) and the <i>insulares</i> (born in the Philippines), insisting on the European attires in formal, and even not so formal, occasions; the mestizos, both espa&ntilde;oles and sangleyes, wearing mainly native ensembles but interpreted according to the fashionable silhouettes from Europe and garnished with imported European accessories; the indios or colonized natives donning the least Europeanized and most practical clothes; and everybody else outside the hierarchy, including the Chinese, Muslims, and <i>lumad</i>, wearing their indigenous attires underscoring their lack of Hispanization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Second, most notable among the mestizos is the phenomenon of Hispanization that to them was requisite to or accompanied political assimilation of the colony and its representation in the Madrid government. As mestizos worked for equal rights with the Spanish, so they vied with one anotherto acquire the latest food and furniture, ditties and dances from Europe. In fashion, some wealthy half-breeds even imported European clothes, not only from Madrid but from Paris, even as they reshaped the baro-saya-pa&ntilde;uelo ensemble to evoke the empire, the crinoline, and the bustle silhouettes of 19th-century Europe. Hats and shoes, coats and cravats, as well as crinolines, corsets, bustles, and petticoats were imported to underscore the level of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; of the nouveaux riches. Furthermore, to divide the indio cabezas from the mestizo gobernadorcillos and <i>delegados</i>, the former were required to wear the native salakot, while the latter could wear European top hats or bowlers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But Hispanization was not the only goal of these ensembles; for Hispanization also underscored the values of class and gender that the new landed elite espoused. Since the importation of clothes and accessories presumed extraordinary wealth, their use immediately set off the wearer as belonging to a class that was different from the ordinary powerless indio. Jewelry, embroidery, <b>nipis</b> (finest pi&ntilde;a material for baro and panuelo), and brocades distanced the <i>ilustrado </i>(educated) from the uneducated masses, and awed the peasant into openmouthed admission of the superiority of the class that owned the lands he tilled and had the ear of the powerful friar. Similarly, the Hispanic dress emphasized the concept of woman that fitted in perfectly with a system of patriarchal landownership. In this system, woman was treated as prime property whose virginity had to be guarded under layers of clothing to ensure a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; marriage, and as the extension of a husband whose will she must follow, whose children she must bear, and whose reflection she must be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No matter how hard the ilustrado tried, however, they could never be completely Hispanized&mdash;whether in politics or in fashion&mdash;for many conditions precluded the complete acceptance of European fashions. For one thing, the tropical weather necessarily modified or eliminated certain silhouettes&mdash;for example, corsets and petticoats were unbearable in a Philippine climate. Moreover, the ilustrados could only import so much dressing material. More often than not, they had to make do with locally woven fabrics like pi&ntilde;a, jusi, sinamay, and maguey, which when used for European cuts like the empire, just did not &ldquo;work.&rdquo; Similarly, motifs for embroidery were drawn from the <i>gumamela</i>, sampaguita, anahao, as well as banana and coconut trees of the immediate surrounding; color combinations&mdash;checks combining red-oranges with canary yellow and aquamarines&mdash;related more to ethnic colors and tropical vegetation than to European aesthetics. The result was, happily enough, dress indigenized for local use, foreign in ambition but clearly native in general feel and function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The American Tradition and Local Transformations<i> </i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the end of the century, industrial America, coveting bigger markets and raw materials, expanded its territories. It co-opted the leaders of the Philippine Revolution, established itself as the new ruler of the island, and embarked on an Americanization process that was effected through a national network of schools and a cultural occupation that became more powerful with the coming of film, radio, and, after the war, television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In fashion, America soon replaced Europe as the fashion capital for the Filipino. In the first three decades, informal wear for upper- and middle-class males consisted of the <b>americana abierta</b><i> </i>(north American suit), whose silhouette changed (sleek or wide, tight or loose) through the decades as dictated by Hollywood movies. Balls called for formal Western tails or dinner jackets or the <b>chaquetilla</b> (a waist-length formal jacket) and their corresponding ensembles. For everyday casual wear, both the upper- and the lower-class males would wear the <b>camisa de chino</b> or the <b>barong tagalog</b>. By the late 1930s, President Quezon had elevated the barong as national male costume with he himself wearing it as president of the new Commonwealth of the Philippines. This barong, which is embroidered with the Commonwealth flag crisscrossed with the United States flag, was called the Commonwealth barong tagalog with the Tydings-Mcduffie motif. In spite of this endorsement, however, Western attire continued to be used by university students, professionals, businessmen, and government officials, mainly because Western dress was associated with enlightenment and efficiency taught by Western or Westernized tutors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The baro-saya-pa&ntilde;uelo ensemble continued to be the main dress ensemble for lower- and upper-class women in the first three decades, its contours now taking their cue from American fashions. In the first two decades, the bell skirt and leg-of-mutton sleeves and the general silhouette of the Gibson girl were reproduced by stiff saya of <b>pinukpok </b>(beaten abaca) or starched cotton prints that flared out through the <b>serpentina</b> or<b> mascota</b> cut. In the first, the saya was fashioned straight from the waist to a little below the knee, where it was then cut in serpentlike waves, to which were sewn on the bias, a wide bottom panel of the same material. In the second, the cut at the knee was straight all around, to which were attached upright triangles of the same cloth sewn onto the upper skirt on the bias. To approximate the fullness of the leg-of-mutton sleeves, women starched their sinamay baro, while pa&ntilde;uelos stiffened to create triangles framing the women&rsquo;s delicate necks. Long scarves or feather boas sometimes replaced the pa&ntilde;uelo for less formal occasions. In this and the succeeding periods, Pacita Longos and Pura Escurdia were the <b>modistas</b> much sought after by the elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1925, a new costume had evolved, drawing inspiration from the Vionnet gown, which was elegant, softly curved, and slender waisted. It had a baro, whose sleeves were shortened to allow freedom of movement, and a pa&ntilde;uelo of the same material and design as the baro. The saya was elegantly straight, with a long pointed cola that could be tucked onto one side of the waist while walking or held with one hand when dancing. Because the design of the saya was appliqu&eacute;d or embroidered, <b>sinuksok</b><i>-</i>style, on the pa&ntilde;uelo and the baro, this three-piece matching ensemble is popularly known as the <b>terno</b><i>. </i>By the late 1930s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3814\"><strong>Ramon Valera</strong></a> combined the baro and saya into one gown with a zipper at the back, raised and stiffened the butterfly sleeves, and made the pa&ntilde;uelo optional and, later, dispensable. This new version aimed for the comfort of the single-unit American gown of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But considerations of practicality in the urban setting began to erode the popularity of the baro&rsquo;t saya ensemble especially in urban centers and among the new generation of American-educated Filipinas in the city and the countryside. These modern Filipinas preferred to wear the the <b>vestido</b> or knee-length Western dress, which can be considered as the most important contribution of America to Philippine fashion. First worn by the students of the Philippine Normal School in the 1910s, the dress caught on and eventually eclipsed the terno as everyday wear, as more and more women began to study and work as professionals and adopt Americanized ways. Two silhouettes of the vestido became popular. In the 1910s to the 1920s, the dress with a dropped waistline, with long or short sleeves, closed or open necked, sometimes with collar or bib, was worn by girls and young ladies. The hemline fluctuated between knee and ankle level. In the 1930s, the Vionnet dress, which had a slender waist and emphasized gentle curves and slinky fabrics, became the formal mode. Stockings, shoes, and handbags were imported from the United States for both ensembles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">American fashions were introduced to the Philippines by local and American magazines, and most especially through the movies from the late 1920s to the early 1940s, which featured American actors wearing these suits, dresses, gowns, accessories, hairstyles, and makeup. Print media and cinema conspired to create in the Filipino artificial needs for American-type clothes and accessories. As  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5419\"><strong>Teodoro M. </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w</strong> </strong> observed, because of the &ldquo;Americanization of our wants and needs&rdquo; we &ldquo;find ourselves unnecessarily forced to use foreign objects, or to prefer the foreign to our own, on account of the failure of our own ways&rdquo; (Tiongson in Nograles-Lumbera 1982).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But even as Filipinos strove to follow American fashions, these fashions could not help but be adapted to the Philippine situation. Native fabrics, local motifs, and a folk sense of color came into play in the design and construction of these attires, thereby changing and modifying the original look and silhouette from the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Significant in Philippine fashion and culture is the adoption by Filipinas of the American vestido, which introduced a whole new set of values for women. For many Filipinas who were previously encased in the terno, which hampered movement and discouraged spontaneity, the vestido meant &ldquo;liberation&rdquo; because it allowed a woman to turn, bend, tilt, sway, stretch, and relax; corollarily, it encouraged her to feel, think, speak, and act on her own and as she pleased. Although the acceptance of the vestido may be seen as another evidence of colonial imitation, it may also be read as both result and proof of the development of women as professionals and workers wanting to be as efficient and mobile as the men in the workplace. Interestingly, in the American period and the post-World War II era, the American philosophy of casual and practical dressing helped to erode colonial and class standards and even to break the indiscriminate imitation of the icons of fashion, whether local or foreign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:-1.0pt\">The Philippine Dress 1946-2016</span></span><i></i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Post-World War II Philippine fashion continued to be dominated by the vagaries of American modes, as these were encountered in movies, television, and fashion magazines. The male fashions for formal and everyday wear as well as the terno and the more casual vestido or dress, continued to reproduce American silhouette, especially in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, the fashionable male wore white sharkskin suits, with flamboyant silk ties, Ray-ban glasses, and pointed tango shoes. The more casual wear, however, were simple, long-sleeved trubenized shirts tucked into high-waisted, deep-pleated wide pants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Dior A-line was popularized in the Philippines by Grace Kelly movies. The &ldquo;new look&rdquo; was interpreted in a one-piece dress or in a two-piece ensemble with puffed-sleeve blouse, both with the signature wide flaring, below-the knee skirt. In the same decade, the same balloon skirts were &ldquo;deflated&rdquo; and began to hug the figure in the new line called the &ldquo;pencil cut.&rdquo; Both silhouettes are reflected in three female ensembles of the 1950s: the &ldquo;A-line&rdquo; terno whose skirts flared out with multiple layers of petticoats and tulle; the &ldquo;pencil cut&rdquo; figure-hugging, ankle-length lame or velvet terno; and the &ldquo;mermaid&rdquo; terno, which was &ldquo;pencil cut&rdquo; to the knee, and &ldquo;balloon&rdquo; from the knee down. For &ldquo;wienie roasts&rdquo; and &ldquo;barn dances,&rdquo; pedal pushers were preferred. Skin-tight toreadors, which were so tight they had to be held down by stirrups, appeared at the turn of the decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important breakthrough for the barong tagalog happened in the term of President Ramon Magsaysay who wore the barong tagalog to his inauguration, and thereafter to all occasions, formal and semiformal, in keeping with his image as a &ldquo;man of the masses&rdquo; and as a conscious strategy to dissociate himself from the Quirino administration, which became known for its luxurious lifestyle. From then on, the barong tagalog was worn by all classes for all kinds of occasions, acquiring legitimacy and dignity in the eyes of all Filipinos. This, however, did not happen to the terno, which became the favorite of socialites who wore them in different couturier versions to the grandest balls in the 1950s and 1960s of the Kahirup, the Mancomunidad Pampangue&ntilde;a, and the Club Filipino. For ordinary female folk who could not afford the terno, it was the short <b>balintawak</b> as well as the <b>kimona</b> and saya that were used for formal wear and everyday clothes, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, men&rsquo;s formal wear made them disappear in the dark, because it invariably was a suit of imported dark material like marzotto, worn with a small-collared trubenized shirt, a nondescript tie thin as the coat&rsquo;s lapels, and a tiny tie pin. Less formal wear meant long-sleeved shirts, polo shirts, and Banlon T-shirts. Later in the decade, blazers or Edwardian coats came into fashion even as pants began to bell-bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early 1960s saw the shift and sack dress becoming popular, especially with matrons. But no sooner had the shift established itself than the tent dress came to the fore, with haltered neck and no sleeves, sporting a line most appropriate for the young. By the mid-1960s, the miniskirt invented by Mary Quant took the Philippines by storm, the way the Beatles did. Skirts went so high special minipants had to be invented as a safeguard against wanton winds and eyes. The mini was matched by twiggy makeup, haircuts, shoes, and accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s saw everyone turning more and more to casual clothes that allowed freedom of movement or &ldquo;character&rdquo; clothes that allowed one to be one&rsquo;s self and to &ldquo;do one&rsquo;s own thing.&rdquo; With the rise of activism, dressing up became &ldquo;<i>burgis</i>&rdquo; (bourgeois) or plain &ldquo;corny.&rdquo; &ldquo;Casual&rdquo; or &ldquo;rugged&rdquo; became the rule, and this often meant bell-bottom pants and T-shirts and long hair &ldquo;blowing in the wind.&rdquo; Just the same, a wide range of female fashions showcased various lengths for clothes (long, maxi, midi, mini, hot), many types of attires (pants, pantsuits, caftans, kurtas, T-shirts, blouse and skirt, comfort-fit, biggie), and a wide array of &ldquo;looks&rdquo; (rugged, formal, hippy, way-out, revivalist). It was this decade, too, that saw gender differences erased in many articles of clothing&mdash;for example, pants, jackets, caftans, shirts, socks, shoes, bags, glasses, and underwear. The cry of the restless 1970s was equality, diversity, and freedom from all constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the martial law period from 1972 to 1986, the national dress became even more politicized as the Marcos couple, positioning themselves as the &ldquo;parents&rdquo; of the New Society, promoted their own brand of nationalism by emphasizing pride in what was Filipino, whether in architecture (e.g., the Coconut Palace), events (e.g., the <b><i>Kasaysayan ng Lahi</i></b>), or dress (e.g., <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos&rsquo;s fashion show <b><i>Bagong Anyo</i></b>). In 1975, Marcos proclaimed a week in June as Barong Tagalog week. Most of all, the first family took to wearing the barong tagalog and the terno in official portraits and most formal occasions. While the barong tagalog, in the 1970s and 1980s, became the object of experimentation by designers who wanted it to become haute couture (e.g., the Cardin barong of 1971, which was tapered, buttoned in front, with simple cuffs and less embroidery), now it sported simple geometric designs associated with the modern Marcos style. Marcos himself wore the traditional barong in all formal occasions and the shirt jacket version in all other occasions. In the 1980s the informal, office-type polo barong, of polyester material which was buttoned in front and could be long-sleeved or short-sleeved, with or without pockets, began to rise in popularity. On the other hand, Imelda Marcos decked herself in eye-catching ternos (without pa&ntilde;uelos) by leading couturiers not only for state events but almost all events where she guested including derelict barrios, mesmerizing the commonfolk with attires that recalled the aesthetics of jeepney art or <b>okir panolong</b>. Like Asian royalty, she was shielded from sun and rain by a wide umbrella carried by a statuesque aide. Because of her ubiquitous ternos and immense powers, Imelda was called the &ldquo;Iron Butterfly.&rdquo; Thus were the national costumes used to project a benevolent patriotic image for the couple even as they plundered the economy through their conjugal kleptocracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the aftermath of the Aquino assassination in 1983, the emphasis turned to commonsense dressing in the midst of political crisis. T-shirts and denims were the rule, and these were often used to identify political camps (yellow for Cory and Ninoy; red, white, and blue for Marcos and Imelda; and red for the forces of the Left) as well as to communicate messages, like &ldquo;Marcos Pa Rin&rdquo; (We&rsquo;re Still for Marcos), &ldquo;Hindi Ka Nag-iisa&rdquo; (You Are Not Alone), or &ldquo;Kung Hindi Tayo Kikilos, Sino ang Kikilos?&rdquo; (If We Do Not Act, Who Will?). After the fall of the Marcoses in 1986, President Corazon Aquino replaced the formal terno associated with Imelda Marcos, with the wide-sleeved, collarless, and embroidered kimona (in jusi or pi&ntilde;a) worn over a long sleeveless gown of the same or other materials. The focus was still on the Filipino but with emphasis on austerity and simplicity, in reaction to the extravagance and excess that now began to be called &ldquo;Imeldific&rdquo; after the lady with 3,000 pairs of shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This casual orientation on clothes continued to the 1990s and 2000s. Formal wear continued to be the soft-line kimona and skirt for females and barong tagalog of many designs and materials for males, especially during the decade of the centennial celebrations from 1986 to 1998. Casual wear included slacks and polo shirts and, for the younger generations, denims and T-shirts. The last even became the canvas for artistic expression as artists like Benedicto Cabrera aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3524\"><strong>Neil Doloricon</strong></a>, Egay Fernandez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\"><strong>Nunelucio Alvarado</strong></a> popularized their Philippine-themed artworks through T-shirts. For their part, Stariray, Sari-Sari, and Pidro-File came out with all types of Filipiniana designs&mdash;from <i>butong pakwan</i> (watermelon seeds) wrappers to the cover of the <b><i>Doctrina Christiana</i></b> (Christian Doctrine) of 1593. Today the growth of ready-to-wear retailers found in shopping malls has further streamlined the consumption of clothes and apparels in urban centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Renewed interest in the terno began to be felt in the decades of the 1990s to the 2010s. The interest took the form of more scholarly studies on the evolution of the terno, which was pioneered by Salvador Bernal and Georgina Encanto in their book <b><i>Patterns for the Filipino Dress: From the Traje de Mestiza to the Terno</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1992, and further developed by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3722\"><strong>Patis Tesoro</strong></a></strong> &rsquo;s <b><i>The Art of Embellishment</i></b>, 1994, Jose R. Moreno&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Costume</i></b>, 1995, Gilda Cordero Fernando&rsquo;s <b><i>Jamming on an Old Saya</i></b>, 1995, <b><i><span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Slim</span></i></b>, 2009, and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2973\"><strong>Gino Gonzales</strong></a></strong> and Mark Higgins&rsquo;s <b><i>Fashionable Filipinas</i></b>, 2015. Similarly, the barong tagalog and its history have been the subjects of books like Visitacion de la Torre&rsquo;s <b><i>The Barong Tagalog: The Philippine</i></b> <b><i>National Wear</i></b>, 1986, which was updated into <b><i>The Barong Tagalog: Then and Now</i></b>, 2000, and Tesoro&rsquo;s <b><i>The Art of Embellishment</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from these historical studies on the national costume, a new perspective on fashion as art began to gain ground with the Salvador Bernal exhibits <b><i>From the Traje de Mestiza to the Terno </i></b>in 1992, and <b><i>Ramon Valera and the Terno</i></b> in 1994, the art-fashion show <b><i>Jamming on an Old Saya</i></b>, which had four artist-designers interpreting the terno in 1995, and the Metropolitan Museum&rsquo;s exhibit of historical ternos in 2003. The recognition of fashion in general and the terno in particular as art forms became final with the inclusion of fashion as an artistic category in the National Artist Awards and the proclamation of Ramon Valera as the first National Artist for fashion design in 2006. Today, the terno continues to be interpreted in many imaginative ways by leading Filipino designers both here and abroad, and showcased in weddings, Santacruzan, beauty contests, and formal <i>rigodons</i> of elite balls. However, unlike the barong tagalog, which is used for everyday and formal wear, the terno has become mainly a costume for special events. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">An <b>effigy</b> is an image, likeness, or representation of a person, made in order to be destroyed or burnt in protest or as expression of anger. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2099\"><strong>Effigies</strong></a> commonly paraded and burned during mass demonstrations are considered a &ldquo;striking and effective form of protest art&rdquo; (Guillermo 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning in the mid-1970s, hundreds of effigies have been produced ranging from simple figures to life-size, elaborately designed, and moving puppets. They are made from locally available and inexpensive materials, usually from <b>papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;</b>, cardboard, or straw. These are collectively produced by activist and artist organizations. They are displayed alongside street paintings, masks, posters, flags, banners, and other forms as a visual highlight, conveying the main theme of the protest action and complementing the repertoire of speeches, songs, manifestos, and slogans of the event. The sight of an effigy can attract members of mass media, protesters, and bystanders: eliciting attention, laughter, commentary, and even physical blows as they are paraded during the march. They are created in order to be destroyed; usually mauled and burned during or toward the end of the demonstration in order to symbolize the people&rsquo;s triumph over common adversaries. The largest and most elaborate Philippine effigies have been produced for the annual rallies during the State of the Nation Address of the Philippine president or for large protests on Labor Day, International Human Rights Day, and similar events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a>ly, the form of the effigy is related to the religious and folk pageantry of the Spanish colonial era, assimilated from missionaries who encouraged the local populace to accept the new religion and foreign rule. Tall figures called <b>higantes</b><i> </i>(giant puppets) appear in some fiestas, such as those in Angono, Rizal. With moveable papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; heads and wearing peasant costumes over bamboo frames, the higantes are carried and manipulated by operators hidden inside the frames. Effigies of the Biblical apostle <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>Hudas</strong></a> (Judas) have been burned or exploded in religious playlets across Bulacan, Pampanga, Panay, and Cebu. When colonial control over the archipelago shifted from Spain to the United States in the 20th century, activities such as the hanging of effigies of officials could be considered seditious acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of the effigy as a form of protest art developed considerably since the post-World War II era. By the 1960s, simple straw or papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; effigies and cardboard coffins were used as agitational propaganda by activists opposing American presence in Vietnam and Cuba. They were made by artistically trained or inclined activists or by members of Kabataang Makabayan&rsquo;s cultural arm, the Nagkakaisang Progresibong Artista at Arkitekto, founded in 1971. The effigy, however, disappeared during martial law. Instead, activists developed forms, such as cardboard cutouts and masks that could easily be concealed and used for &ldquo;lightning rallies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, the effigy resurfaced along with rising resistance to the Marcos dictatorship. The growth of the legal democratic movement through organizations such as the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan or BAYAN also produced a new patron and audience for larger forms of protest art. Organizations, such as the Concerned Artists of the Philippines and MASKARA, both founded in 1983, and Artistang Bayan, founded in 1985, responded to the visual needs of mass actions by making murals, streamers, and effigies. Theater groups also used effigies for &ldquo;effigy-lantern&rdquo; plays, <i>dulansangan</i><b> </b>(street plays), and annual &ldquo;Calvary of the Poor&rdquo; marches appropriated from Lenten rituals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the mid-1980s, more effigies were made as demonstrations against Marcos grew larger and more frequent. They ranged from caricatures of political personalities to representations of American imperialism, usually through the figure of Uncle Sam. Examples would be effigies of President Marcos and Uncle Sam featured on the cover of <b><i>Newsweek</i></b>, 4 Nov 1985. But effigies were not always representations of the enemy. They could also convey images of a nascent nation, such as the effigy of Inang Bayan (Motherland) for the People&rsquo;s Cultural Caravan in 1986. They could also represent marginalized social groups, such as the higante of workers and peasants used by the Kilusang Mayo Uno for the May Day Rally in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the late 1990s, more elaborate projects were initiated by BAYAN in collaboration with new organizations, such as UGATLahi Artists Collective, founded in 1992. UGATLahi has since made over 40 effigies. The group developed mechanized or &ldquo;kinetic&rdquo; effigies that could be made to move by using a system of pulleys and levers, as the artist-activists experimented with the use of new materials, styles, and symbols. UGATLahi&rsquo;s larger and more popular effigies, such as <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2177\"><strong>Erapzilla</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, <b><i>Reclining Erap</i></b>, and the portrayals of cronies and government officials as in <b><i>Lechon Baboy </i></b>(Roasted Pigs), were made during the campaign for Estrada&rsquo;s ouster in 2000. In 2013, pig effigies were used once again to protest the corruption of government officials in using the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), popularly known as the pork barrel scam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Effigies have served as a barometer for the various issues and controversies faced by each administration. Pres Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 2001-10, was among the heads of state most portrayed in effigy. References to a Pandora&rsquo;s Box of evils were conveyed through <b><i>Gloria in a Box</i></b>, 2001. She was portrayed as both parasite and predator: the giant <b><i>Bye-Glo: Pesteng Pangulong Arroyo</i></b> (Bye-Glo: President Arroyo the Pest), 2002, and <b><i>Gloria Buwitre</i></b> (Gloria Vulture), 2004. She was also represented as intent on remaining in office through <b><i>Running Glo</i></b>,<b> </b>2003, and <b><i>Kapit Tukong Gloria </i></b>(Gloria Clinging to Power), 2005. Criticisms of human rights violations under Arroyo&rsquo;s term were conveyed through the effigies <b><i>Hitler Diktador Tuta Gloria</i></b> (Hitler, Dictator, Lapdog Gloria), 2006, and <b><i>Reyna ng Kadiliman, Manananggal ng Karapatan</i></b> (Queen of Darkness, Violator of Rights), 2007. In the last years of Arroyo&rsquo;s term, she was portrayed as a captain abandoning ship in <b><i>MV Pilipinas</i></b>, 2008, and as a decaying monster in <b><i>Gloria Forever</i></b>, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When President Benigno Aquino III assumed office in 2010, he was first portrayed in effigy as a magician conjuring promises and illusions. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1251\"><strong>Noy</strong></a>noy Magician</i></b>, however, was not burned to challenge Aquino to act on reforms he promised. In subsequent SONA protests, however, activists conveyed their disappointment with Aquino by representing him as a rotten egg in <b><i>Giant PeNoy</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011; as a two-faced monster feasting with foreign and elite powers in <b><i>Two-Face</i></b>, 2012; and as a giant feasting while the nation starves, 2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLisa Ito-Tapang</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Guillermo, Alice G. 2001b. <em>Protest/Revolutionary Art in the Philippines, 1970-1990</em>.

The high quality of embroidery in the Philippines is partly due to its history and partly due to native talent. Although it is always difficult to pinpoint the origins of an ancient art form, the Philippines&rsquo; early exposure to Chinese and Indian artistic traditions may explain the features of its embroidery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Embroidery has been done by indigenous groups even before the coming of European influence. Among Mindanao ethnic groups, the Blaan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, and Mandaya have highly developed embroidery traditions independent of Western trends. Clothing, whether for male or female, can be densely embroidered with colorful geometric patterns. Blouses can be lavishly decorated with minute satin or cross-stitches consisting of lozenges, chevrons, zigzags, meanders, and <b>tumpal</b> (steep-triangle motif found in Mindanao and Indonesian weaves). In northern Luzon, the decorative stitches of the Tinguian, primarily used to join seams of blankets or borders of clothing, are equally distinctive.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beadwork is prominent in Bagobo clothing, known to the natives as <b>pang-o-lo-bayan</b>. <b>Tutuk</b> or decorative borders or panels on shirts or trousers are covered with fine appliqu&eacute;s over which are fine embroidery stitches, beads, and sequins. Among northern Luzon ethnic groups, the Gaddang are distinguished for beadwork decorations. These may be sewn to a loincloth, blouse, headcloth, pouch bag, or sash. Much of the decoration is simultaneously functional as it conceals shirt seams or weighs down the ends of a loincloth with its fringes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Various ethnic groups use bells, pom-poms, coins, and animal hair to fringe their clothing or accessories. Occasionally, there are stones, seeds, or pieces of wood, which may function as amulets or charms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Appliqu&eacute; and patchwork is a challenging art form among the southern ethnic groups, such as the Tboli and Bagobo but especially among the Talaandig of Bukidnon. On patchwork panels made into shirts or cloth accessories are tiny lozenges, chevrons, or squares. A cotton blouse worked in appliqu&eacute; is described by the Tboli as <b>kegal kenibang</b>. The latter word, &ldquo;an adjective used to describe plants or animals that are mottled or speckled,&rdquo; suggests the tedious process to achieve the desired effect. Among Sulu people, simpler forms of appliqu&eacute; are done for decorative flags, buntings or <b>tabil</b>, a decorative cloth band of colorful patchwork used as a curtain for gatherings, especially weddings. It can also form part of the canopy hanging over a sleeping area. The bottom is fringed with colored strips of cloth and further embellished with dangling cloth flowers or beads. Among Tausug women, the gala dress would include the long-sleeved, tight-fitting <i>biyatawi</i> (blouse) of silk, cotton, or velvet; the loose and wide pants in cotton or silk; and the embroidered textile or <b>habul tiyahian</b>, slung diagonally across the body from the left shoulder. Designs of the embroidered habul include the<b> lukis manukmanuk </b>(bird motif),<b> lukis kabakaba</b> (butterfly motif), <b>lukis bintang </b>(star motif), and <b>lukis ulang ulang</b> (prawn motif).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Relative to beads are sequins, which among the Blaan and Bagobo are made of shells. These can be used so profusely on a shirt that only tiny portions of the fabric are visible. Real sequins, however, are used by other groups, such as the Maranao who use it to decorate their silk wedding canopies. Otherwise, the ancient oriental technique of chain-stitch embroidery is used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the advent of Spain, Western-type embroidery was introduced and later adapted by Filipinos. By the 18th century, embroidery was one of the handicrafts perfected by Filipinos. Ironically, however, Manila was then known in Europe for the <i>mantones de Manila </i>(Manila shawls), which were done in China and loaded onto the galleons to be sold in Mexico during the Manila-Acapulco trade from 1565 to 1815.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although precolonial Filipinos must have been using the needle for their clothes since its introduction from China in the 13th century, formal training in sewing and embroidery must have started as the Spanish missionaries established schools for girls in the country. Such a school was Santa Catalina, founded in 1696, which was also a beaterio, a type of convent. In the 19th century the nuns of Santa Catalina taught embroidery to their students. Similarly, municipal schools for girls then were required to dedicate two hours to needlework per school day.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Throughout the Spanish colonial period, convents churned out embroidery for priests&rsquo; vestments, altar cloths, and costumes for the images of saints. Wealthy parishes could afford metal thread from Europe, which consisted of flat and narrow strips called plate, or of wire coiled around a rod called purl. These threads were used only on equally luxurious fabrics, such as satin or gold cloth. Sections to be embroidered in relief were padded with layers of cardboard or yarn. Skill and patience were required to work satin or <b>banig</b> (local woven sleeping mat) stitches across the cloth without passing the expensive threads underneath the fabric. The techniques of metal-thread embroidery are still practiced today by lay people, although the industry is much smaller, and genuine metal thread has become unaffordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 19th century, Manila was known for embroidery, even in Europe. Santa Ana, Ermita, and Malate were its main centers of activity. The embroidered male <b>baro</b> (shirt), <b>camisa</b> or blouse, <b>pa&ntilde;uelo</b> or shoulder scarf, children&rsquo;s clothes, and handkerchiefs are painstakingly documented in 19th-century portraits of the native elite by painters like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3644\"><strong>Antonio Malantic</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3417\"><strong>Justiniano Asuncion</strong></a>, and Isidro Arceo. Whitish <b>nipis</b>&mdash;light, transparent fabrics, such as <b>pi&ntilde;a</b> (pineapple fiber), <b>jusi</b> (pineapple fiber mixed with banana fiber), or fine sinamay&mdash;were embroidered with designs in white thread, thus creating a local form of whitework then popular in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila embroidery was distinguished for combining satin-stitched designs with <b>calado</b> (openwork). This usually meant applying pulled threadwork, wherein threads of the cloth are pulled together with stitches to create openwork patterns, or drawn threadwork, wherein selected threads of the cloth are cut off to create openwork areas while remaining threads are decorated with various stitches. The first step in calado embroidery is the <b>bakbakan</b>, which involves drawing out a specific number of threads of the warp and woof according to a pattern. The material is then worked on by an expert who joins the threads together in typical calado stitching. The next step is embroidering in the <b>munggo</b>, a small motif within the calado itself, such as the sampaguita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the calado is uninterrupted throughout the entire length of the panel, it is called <b>ilog na calado</b> (river of calado). Embroidery designs have their specific names: <b>flores</b> for satin-stitched flowers; <b>anino</b> (shadow) in which threads cross at the reverse of the motif for a delicate, transparent effect; <b>britanika</b> for heart-shaped motifs; <b>bulon</b> for raised knots made of threads twisted together; and <b>tirik</b> and <b>bitik</b> for variations of the herringbone stitch, creating a geometric design. All these embroidery stitches, called by the general term <b>labor</b>, are combined with calado.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The embroidery process itself involves at least seven steps executed by different workers. First is the drawing of the design, which is subsequently transferred on wax paper. This is perforated and printed on the cloth with a mixture of kerosene, alcohol, and blue dye. The material, set in the <b>bastidor</b> (hoop), is then worked on for calado, after which the embroidery designs are executed on the solid areas. The material is then stitched all around with the <b>auherol</b>, a scallop design for edging. It is then soaked and washed, then finally stretched on the <b>banatan</b>, a rectangular bastidor that evens out the material. The techniques are still used for the <b>barong tagalog</b>, placemats, table napkins, handkerchiefs, and other products.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another technique requiring much skill and patience in 19th-century needlework was <b>sombrado</b> (Spanish, shading). Delicate, curvilinear floral or foliate patterns were cut out from white cotton cloth and applied on the reverse side of the nipis fabric to create a silhouette effect. Extremely fine, invisible stitching secured the appliqu&eacute; to the fabric frequently cut out for a camisa, baptismal gown, curtain, pillowcase, bed hanging, or <b>carroza</b> (processional carriage) skirt. Sombrado also referred to shadow stitches that crossed underneath a transparent fabric to create a semiopaque quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chain-stitch embroidery is also done by machine. It has developed into a small industry in Bulacan, particularly in Bocaue. Locally known as <b>cadineta</b>, it was popular as a form of decorating the butterfly sleeves of the <b>terno</b> in the early 20th century. Along with the first Filipino fashion designers, chain-stitch embroidery for women&rsquo;s formal wear was combined with sequins, bugle beads, seed pearls, and other materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Luzon, Taal in Batangas province is still known for the large floral patterns worked with slightly embossed satin stitches, and Lumban in Laguna province for delicate barong embroidery using silk thread. Frequently used motifs are <b>kinape</b> (coffee bean-like), <b>sinampagita</b> (jasmine-like), and<b> sili-sili </b>(resembling tiny peppers). The <b>apak-manok </b>(chicken&rsquo;s footprint) stitch is widely used to decorate as well as bind drawn thread in calado panels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Iloilo province, the Asilo de Molo is an orphanage as well as an embroidery center. Here the nuns of the Daughters of Charity train orphans to do various types of embroidery. The &ldquo;counted thread&rdquo; embroidery, wherein straight stitches are carefully measured by the number of threads in the fabric it should cross with each stroke, is used in corners of tiny white handkerchiefs. Vignettes outlined in black embroidery thread recall the sensitive lines of pen-and-ink drawings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an export industry, Philippine embroidery rated well in the 19th-century pi&ntilde;a and other nipis articles sent to Europe, and in the early 20th-century exports of lingerie, handkerchiefs, tablecloths, and children&rsquo;s clothing undertaken by Philippine-American partnerships. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written bySandra Castro, with notes from Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Food art</b> refers to the artistry in the presentation and/or packaging of food. This is not garnishing in the Western sense&mdash;that is, the addition of decorative touches, such as parsley sprigs, tomato or egg slices, to a dish or platter. This is artistic enhancement of the food itself or of the packaging in which it is served or sold. It is premised on the idea that the utilitarian need not be plain, that what appeals to the palate may also give pleasure to the eye, that the ephemeral, like the wrapping to be discarded, has its moment worth enhancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This art is not usually expressed on main (poultry, meat, fish, seafood) or vegetable dishes, in which the sensory appeal lies in freshness, or abundance, or the anticipation of flavor. A roast pig on a spit, for example, skin gleaming golden brown, evokes the appetite even without an apple in its mouth; so does a basketful of red steamed crabs, or a fish from the grill, crusty with coal-burnt skin, or a platter high with noodles sprinkled with crisp bits of crackling, smoked fish, and kamias sections, on a rich <i>palabok </i>(shrimp gravy) sauce. The visual appeal here lies in natural colors and shapes, and the flavors they promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Relishes and desserts are the most usual medium for food art. They are prepared much ahead of time, and thus allow time for design and decoration. For example, <b>achara</b>, pickle relish made of grated unripe papaya and vegetable, red and green bell pepper, purple shallots, carrots, cucumber, and <i>singkamas</i> or turnip&mdash;all preserved in and flavored with coconut vinegar, salt, and spices&mdash;is a prime medium for this art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The textures lend themselves to carving into flowers, stars, leaves, words, and even figures of men and women, huts, and carabaos. The colors offer a varied palette, and so these are vertically arranged along the sides of glass jars not only in patterns of colors and shapes, but even into story vignettes: a farmer with a guitar walking under a tree, a woman traversing a field with a market basket on her head, a dancing figure, an arrangement of branches and flowers, or words like <i>alaala </i>or <i>recuerdo </i>(remembrance), or the name of the recipient of the gift bottle. Monocolor pickles, such as singkamas, <i>ubod</i>, or <i>dampalit</i>, are also carved and arranged, or given color accents, like carrots, but it is the papaya vegetable palette that is most often given visual, even narrative, embellishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fruits preserved in syrup, especially in the town of San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan,are another area of food art. <i>Mayumo</i>, the Pampango word for &ldquo;sweet,&rdquo; proclaims the town&rsquo;s specialty: sweets of many kinds. <i>Suha</i> or pomelo, <i>dayap</i> or lime, <i>kundol</i> or wax gourd, santol, rimas or breadfruit, balimbing or star fruit, pineapple, nangka or jackfruit, native oranges, and <i>guyabano</i> or soursop are preserved in a light syrup in glass jars, comprising the original, the indigenous <b>himagas</b> (dessert). But never are they put in plain. They are <b>bordado</b> or carved with flowers, leaves, rosettes, whorls, patterns. They are bottled with these designs facing outward, such that a shelf of these jars&mdash;the fruits translucent in the pale syrup, the light shining through their fancies&mdash;becomes visual pleasure promising gustatory joy. The pomelo rinds, washed in several changes of salt solution and dried, are in large bottle-high sections and can carry designs, letters, and names. The dayap rinds are tiny and rounded, therefore &ldquo;embroidered&rdquo; in lines and whorls. In Laguna the dayap are not usually carved but are stuffed with <b>nata de coco </b>(coconut jelly) before being cooked in syrup, and there is artistry in the milky white peeking through the lime green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>pastillas de leche</b> or sweets of carabao milk and sugar from San Miguel de Mayumo are also famous, not only for their sweet fineness but also for their wrappers. These wrappers are called <b>pabalat </b>(wrappings). These are of multicolored thin paper, called <b>papel de japon</b><i> </i>(japanese paper), cut into stars, leaves, flowers (e.g., rose, <i>cadena de amor</i>, sampaguita), palm leaves and branches, and letters (spelling out &ldquo;Pilipinas&rdquo; or &ldquo;Philippines,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maligayang Pasko&rdquo; or Merry Christmas, &ldquo;Maligayang Kaarawan&rdquo; or Happy Birthday, or specific names of persons).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pabalat artist Luz Mendoza Ocampo uses patterns she personally designed, such as the so-called Maria Clara motif, <b>tinikling</b><i> </i>(dance on bamboo poles), pounding rice grains, nipa hut, birds, and various flowers. The lines of the pattern are traced into layers of papel de japon using a pencil. She then painstakingly cuts into the fragile paper following the details of the pattern by using a sharpened cuticle scissor. While some pabalat artists like Ocampo would use a pattern, others prefer the freestyle method, by cutting the folded paper with small scissors, freehand, without the use of patterns or drawings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pastillas, barely more than an inch long, are wrapped in the plain part of the paper, and the patterned tails float down from the epergnes in which they are displayed on fiesta tables. This fragile art is truly evanescent, since eating one such pastillas means throwing away the art that comes from the labor of many moments. The pabalat tradition in Bulacan is usually practiced by women. Well-known pabalat artists are Amparo Pengson, Rosa David, Nene Pineda, Luz Reyes, and Teresita Ramos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The arrangements and packaging of <b>kakanin</b><i>&mdash;</i>snacks and sweets, usually made of sticky rice&mdash;is still another area for artistry. Kakanin served in <b>bilao </b>(flat baskets) is often a combination of <b>sapin-sapin</b>,<b> ube</b>,<b> biko</b>,<b> suman</b>, etc, and so the colors&mdash;purple, white, pink, green, light brown&mdash;are arranged in patterns. <b>Puto</b> and <b>kutsinta</b><i> </i>(cakes made of rice flour) are steamed in bamboo tubes or molds, large or small; colored white, beige, brown, or purple; sliced in trapezoids, rectangles, or wedges; and arranged in steamers, platters, or baskets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Suman, <b>ibus</b>, <b>tupig</b>, and<b> tamales</b><i> </i>(rice and sticky-rice cakes) are wrapped in coconut fronds, banana leaves, nipa leaves, etc, and give play to another kind of creativity. Pale young coconut fronds are wound around <b>suman sa ibus</b><i> </i>in most places; in Obando, Bulacan, darker green ones are woven into little triangular baskets. Breakfast <b>puto-maya</b><i> </i>is spooned into banana-leaf twists in the Bantayan market, into packets elsewhere. Tamales are steamed in banana leaves, the wrapping style varying with the area&mdash;flat or fat; tied or untied; trapezoidal in Meycauayan, Bulacan. The tupig of the Ilocos are rice cakes served on holidays, or in cockpits, where they are both aesthetic and convenient for eating during such exciting occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>puso</b><i> </i>in Cebu and Cagayan de Oro are fist-sized, woven coconut leaf packages that hold steamed rice or &ldquo;hanging rice&rdquo;&mdash;for lunch in the market, and for traveling. <b>Pus&uacute;</b><i> </i>(also <b>pus&oacute;</b><i> </i>or <b>pos&oacute;</b>) come in various shapes and designs and are also referred to with other names in other places of the country. While it is called <b>balisungsong</b> in Tagalog, it is also known as <b>lambay</b> (Waray), <b>patupat </b>(Kapampangan), and <b>tamu</b> (Tausug, Samal, Yakan) (Nocheseda 2009, 320-21).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The making of pus&uacute; is believed to date back to precolonial times. Nocheseda noted that early Spanish missionaries in Cebu, Panay, Samar, and Leyte had already commented on the rice pouches&rsquo; intriguing designs, their ability to retard the spoiling of the cooked rice, and the way this packaging was convenient for travel. Alcina, as cited by Nocheseda, also mentions the use of pus&uacute; in the <i>paganitu</i> (rituals), performed by priest/priestesses for the spirits. Old dictionaries and accounts written during the Spanish colonial period also reveal that there existed various pus&uacute; designs, many of which are no longer known by pus&uacute; weavers today (Nocheseda 2009, 57-8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Cebu, the rice pouches are woven using young coconut fronds called <b>lukay</b>. The pus&uacute; weaver or <b>mamumuso</b><i> </i>fills the pouches halfway through with uncooked rice right before these are sealed. The pouches are then boiled in water until the rice is cooked (Nocheseda 2009, 60).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are six recognizable variations of the rice pouch designs in Cebu City today, used as offertory victuals in thanksgiving rituals called <b>hikayan</b>, and exorcism rituals called <b>yamyam</b>, both performed by male shamans called <b>tambalan</b> (Inocian 2002, 2). These are the <b>binosa</b>, which resembles a wine glass; the <b>kinasing</b>, which is shaped like a diamond; the <b>dumpos</b> or <b>pudol</b>, a variation of the kinasing with a flattened bottom; the <b>badbaranay</b>, which means &ldquo;unraveling&rdquo; or &ldquo;opening&rdquo;; the <b>binaki</b>, which means &ldquo;frog-like&rdquo;; and <b>manan-aw</b>, which refers to a specific kind of tiny white orchid (Inocian 2002, 2). Nocheseda cites a seventh design mentioned by Inocian called <b>minanok</b>, shaped like a rooster, which is rarely made today (2009, 60). Other shapes that are not associated with offertory rituals are the <b>suso</b> or <b>sinuso </b>(breast-like), <b>pinawikan </b>(seaturtle-like), <b>tinigib</b> (chisel-like), <b>binungi</b> (like an extracted tooth), <b>kinabayo</b> (horselike), and <b>binao</b> (turtle-like).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early morning markets where these snacks are served as breakfast with chocolate, <i>salabat </i>or ginger ale, or tea are the stalls that sprout outside churches during the <i>simbang gabi </i>or dawn Masses before Christmas, the daytime markets where the snacks become <i>merienda </i>or <i>pantawid-gutom </i>(&ldquo;bridging&rdquo; hungers between meals), and the baskets of itinerant vendors. These are the canvases for this art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During feast day of San Nicolas, cookies designed in his iconography are sold outside the churches in Pampanga, and are called San Nicolas cookies. In Bago City, Negros Occidental, the <b>alfajor </b>cookies are made by migrant families from Panay who settled in Negros in the 1920s. With the main ingredients of rice flour and sugar, alfajor cookies are pressed into wooden molds bearing various designs, such as the insignias of the USAFFE and Boy Scouts; comic characters from <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></i></b>; a mermaid motif; and hearts and flower designs associated with weddings, Valentine&rsquo;s, and Christmas day. The cookies are then cooked under the heat of the sun or sun-dried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Food art may also be found in such foods as <b>empanadas</b><i> </i>(chicken pies), which are deliberately fluted and pleated in <b>milles feuilles</b><i> </i>style in Silay, Negros Occidental, or <b>panaras</b><i> </i>whose edges are pinched and patterned in Vigan, Ilocos Sur; in the building of <b>tortas reales</b><i> </i>and <b>castillos</b>, sweets from the Spanish tradition; and more recently, in the decoration of cakes learned from the American tradition. In  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a></strong>, Rizal, one bakery is famous for its breads shaped like lobsters, pigs, turtles, crabs, and most beautiful of all, crocodiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is in the presentation and packaging of native fruits and delicacies, however, that the native aesthetic is best seen. Here food art is expressed in native materials, like fruits, vegetables, and grains; in patterns drawn from the surrounding landscape; and in indigenous ways through colors, patterns, arrangements, and packaging&mdash;making the edible artistic, the gustatory visual, and the ordinary special. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>Furniture</strong></a></b>&mdash;also known as <b>muebles</b> in Spanish and <b>kasangkapan</b> in Tagalog from the word &ldquo;<i>sangkap</i>&rdquo; or ingredients, or <b>kagamitan</b><i> </i>from the word &ldquo;<i>gamit</i>&rdquo; (use)&mdash;are functional and decorative objects found in a dwelling or any building, public or private. Furniture serves three practical functions: as storage and display, as support for the human body, and as surface on which to lay things. Furniture also serves as decorative piece in interiors as this comes associated with prestige and ceremonial functions that vary from culture to culture and from one historical period to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Furniture may be made of any material, such as stone, metal, wood, vines, fiber, glass, and leather. Furniture often relates to interior space. Certain forms of folk architecture, because they have floors of split bamboo, cannot support too many heavy objects, whereas the <i>bahay na bato</i> (stone house) generally has a big number of furniture pieces, most of which are made of hardwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Living Indigenous Tradition </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indigenous houses are simply and functionally furnished. Daily activities are performed outdoors as residences, which have limited space, are reserved mainly for sleeping and storage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baskets and chests are generally for storage. Grain and food are kept in variously shaped baskets, such as the Pangasinan<i> </i><b>bakul</b>,<b> </b>the Ilocano <b>labba </b>or<i> </i><b>laza</b>,<b> </b>and the Laguna <b>buligan</b>. The Tagalog<b> tampipi</b><i> </i>or the Visayan <b>bakag</b><i> </i>is a rectangular lidded basket that stores clothes and heirlooms. A more secure container is the <b>baul </b>(chest), made of wood and fastened by a lock and hinges. Wooden baul inlaid with mother-of-pearl has long been used by the Maranao and other Islamic groups, although it was probably introduced to lowland groups by the Spaniards.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like more affluent bahay na bato, the <i>bahay kubo</i> (nipa hut) may also have an <b>aparador </b>(clothes cabinet), a <b>banggera</b> (built-in rack) for drying utensils attached to the kitchen window, and a <b>paminggalan </b>or a cabinet with two slatted doors for food and utensils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A basic appointment in the bahay kubo is the<i> </i><b>silya</b> (chair) or the<i> </i><b>banco/bangko</b><i> </i>(bench). The banco may be attached to the wall, like that which is built into a structure of the Kankanay <i>bauko</i> house. The typical Kankanay house also displays different baskets for storing tools, jars, and <i>lusong</i> and <i>lay-o </i>(mortar and pestle), as well as those baskets especially designed for storing particular foodstuff, like the <b>anggawin</b> or round basket for edible snails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Colorful mats and cushions, a pile of chests, and the <b>boras</b> (hanging bamboo screen) decorate the Tausug house. In the absence of a table, food is served on footed brass trays covered with a dome-shaped, multicolored cover of pandan leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>banig</b> (mat), although multifunctional, is most often used for sleeping. Laid on the floor at night, it is rolled and kept during daytime. The <b>papag </b>or <b>papagan</b>, a bed of bamboo or wooden slats, is found in lieu of a banig in some lowland villages. The papag has no mattress; over it is placed a mat or sheets and blankets and pillows. The sleeping area within the one-room ethnic house, such as those of the Tboli, is defined not by solid walls but by curtains or screens. The native term for table, <b>mesa</b> or <b>lamesa</b>, indicates a Hispanic origin. However, Pedro Chirino in 1600 noted that the natives used a <b>dulang</b>, a table that is &ldquo;small, low, and round or square in shape,&rdquo; which could be removed after meals. The dulang might still be found in the bahay kubo, although many have been replaced by the waist-high, Western-type table.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Hispanic Tradition and Local Transformations</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Spanish missionaries and colonizers, who first erected more permanent houses in the islands, introduced a variety of furniture. Local furniture likewise incorporated foreign artistic influences through trade; the Chinese design of ball-and-claw on the feet of tables, chests, and benches appears in many 17th-century pieces. Some pieces were adorned with mother-of-pearl, such as one presented to the viceroy of Peru. Rococo-inspired rocaille motifs, modified and flattened, mark later 18th-century examples, like the <b>mesa altar</b> (altar table). In the 19th century, as trade with England and the United States increased, furniture design began to manifest the French Louis XV and the English Victorian influence; gothic and art nouveau came later in the century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first pieces of furniture used by the Spaniards were imported from Mexico, but by 1573 Spanish trade with China delivered houseware and furniture as goods for the galleon. A Chinese-made piece from this period is the <b>facistol </b>(music stand) at the San Agustin museum, a three-sided ebony piece resting on a triangular base supported by crouching sphinxes. This originated from Macao and is dated to the end of the 16th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mexican merchants began to settle in Manila as the galleon trade prospered. It has been hypothesized that meeting the needs of this class required the crafting of furniture by skilled Filipino and Chinese artisans under Spanish supervision. By the early 17th century, Chinese artisans were based in centers of the craft in the coastal settlements of Cebu, Batangas, Manila, and llocos.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Muebles enconchados</b> (inlaid furniture) evolved during this period, patterned after the Mudejar-style furniture of Mexico but with Chinese features. These pieces, mostly oversized cabinets, were made of ebony and elaborately inlaid with silver and mother-of-pearl and embellished with bronze bases, mounts, and capitals. Their feet were formed as stylized lions. Furniture craft achieved a level of excellence during the 17th and 18th centuries. Central Luzon specialized in bone inlaying, while the Visayas produced deftly carved narra pieces. The native inhabitants learned from the Chinese. By the 19th century, furniture makers were producing works in Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija; Baliuag, Bulacan; Paete, Laguna; and other inland towns near rivers and forests. Other centers were Bacolor, Pampanga, and Malabon, Rizal (now in Metro Manila), where the colonial government founded trade schools. However, as late as 1886 the Chinese monopolized the finishing of pieces. More furniture shops opened with the rise of the middle class. In 1891 Manila had six shops, and 30 years hence Manila had 10 importers and manufacturers of furniture&mdash;27 retailers in Binondo and some in Santa Cruz, Quiapo, and Tanduay (Jamir 1975; Sta. Maria 1983). These furniture were often made of hardwood, like molave, <i>kamagong</i>, tindalo, narra, ipil, and palo maria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Notwithstanding the spread of European styles, two distinct regional styles emerged in Luzon, called the <b>Batangas style</b> and the <b>Baliuag style</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Batangas style of Taal and Lipa appeared in the 17th century. The makers of this type of pieces, predominantly Chinese in influence, favored purple and golden-brown tindalo or rosewood, the joints of which were bound by bamboo dowels and thin wedges instead of glue and nails. Early Batangas furniture were simple, graceful, and dignified. They were characterized by flat or shallow carvings that were enhanced rather than obtruded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baliuag furniture came from a town in Bulacan with the same name. Baliuag furniture, most often made of narra, is identified by the use of bone inlay and caning for bed frames and seats and backs of chairs. These pieces look sturdy but are actually fragile. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> dowels hold mortise-and-tenon joints for durability.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippines was also receptive to fashionable European styles in the 19th century. Thus styles like the Louis XV revival, the Louis XVI revival, the renaissance revival, and the Early Victorian persist. The style locally called Luis Quince barely reflects French Louis XV furniture. The former have &ldquo;turned upright supports and a motif of bunch flowers with featherlike scroll&rdquo; (Fernando and Ricio 1978). Original Louis XV pieces are curvilinear; combine red, green, and yellow with black trimming; feature floral, scallop, and pastoral motifs; and use inlays and veneers of metal and marble. However, both styles have identical cabriole legs, the <b>pied de bouche</b> or doe&rsquo;s foot, a design motif probably based on the Chinese &ldquo;dragon&rsquo;s foot which was first seen in Europe by European courts on Chinese imports brought in by Dutch traders&rdquo; (Sta. Maria 1983). Another period style, Carlos Tercero, is of uncertain origin; the prototype may have been named after Spain&rsquo;s Carlos III, who reigned from 1759 to 1788. Chairs and sofas have high backs of woven cane &ldquo;framed by twisted columns with pointed finials and honeysuckle crest. While the front legs are turned, those behind are squarish&rdquo; (Sta. Maria 1983). Later in the century, Philippine furniture also caught up with the revivalist trend, incorporating gothic ornamentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nineteenth-century houses became storehouses of a family&rsquo;s accumulated treasures, typical of Isabelina or later Victorian homes. The period was characterized by the bed, the cabinet, the dining table, and the long seat. Eduardo Ah Tay, a Binondo Chinese, was a renowned Misericordia St furniture maker of the time and was known to have produced pieces representative of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Art nouveau</b> (German,<b> jugenstil</b>), in vogue from 1890 to 1910, presented an alternative to staid classicism and overstuffed Victoriana. Many local artisans were inspired by this return to natural forms, particularly to native plants, like sampaguita, ylang-ylang, bamboo, anahao, and even ampalaya. The Tampincos, a family of sculptors with an atelier in Quiapo, Manila, were commissioned to do architectural details and furnishings, like valances and frames. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\"><strong>Isabelo Tampinco</strong></a> localized art nouveau in wood carving, employing areca and anahaw leaves among other native elements. The painter-critic  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\"><strong>Emilio Alvero</strong></a></strong> is credited for initiating the completely decorated look, binding architectural details with furniture design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The church and its adjoining <i>convento</i> (convent) were prominent structures in the Spanish colonial era. Emulating Spanish lifestyles thus entailed copying the furniture in churches, convents, and also Spanish houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some innovations were done on the pre-Spanish baul. These may have been influenced by the carved patterns of the tooled Cordovan leather that covered chests brought by the galleons. More common today is the household chest, which in northern Luzon is called the &ldquo;Vigan chest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Simple and utilitarian, they are dovetailed and designed to sit squarely on the floor. The baul&rsquo;s sole concession to decoration is the tonguelike drop called <b>chapa</b>, in one, two, or three parts; it is sometimes incised with foliate patterns reminiscent of Chinese or Indian brasswork. Two of four metal disks in parallel rows run up and down the front &hellip; Home-forged iron bales serve as handles; in addition versions sport twin drawers with rustic wooden pulls.&rdquo; While the Batangas baul sits &ldquo;on a separate hollow base with cutouts of Chinese clouds,&rdquo; the Baliuag chest is European in tone (Sta. Maria 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The aparador was a large cabinet with one, two, sometimes three doors. Church sacristies stored various utensils and silver ornaments in huge aparadores. In the 1880s, aparador meant either an <b>aparador ropero </b>(cloth cabinet), later shortened to aparador, or an <b>aparador platero </b>(showcase). Early aparadores were at least 3.048 m tall and could be from 1.82 m to 3.048 m wide. As these did not provide for hangers, clothes were folded inside drawers. When fortunes grew in the 19th century, aparadores began to have a large mirror on their doors and elaborate carvings on the crown. Pieces from Hong Kong were outfitted with mirrors, while later, cheaper American types were imported in large number in the early 20th century. The dirty-clothes hamper, simply called <b>ropero</b>, had a wooden framework with woven rattan sidings. It had a door on one side to ease emptying of contents. A family&rsquo;s porcelain and silver tableware were displayed in a <b>platero</b> or<i> </i><b>platera</b>, a cabinet with open shelves made of hardwood and glass. Across the dining hall stood the <b>vajillera </b>in which porcelain and glassware were kept. Some homes had a third cabinet, the <b>cristaleria</b>, for glassware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Books and curios were placed in a cabinet with layers of open shelves, called the<i> </i><b>estante</b>. An<i> </i><b>aparador de libros </b>(bookcase) also kept books. Many convents had a special aparador de libros, which held parish records. Some are marked with &ldquo;Archivo de&rdquo; followed by the town&rsquo;s name. To secure them during earthquakes, they were fastened down with ringholds embedded in the wall. The <b>vitrina</b> was a smaller and lighter variation of the estante. As its name suggests, it was an open shelf enclosed in glass. While books were earlier kept in massive built-in shelves, by the 17th century the detached bookcase was built as books became smaller. The<b> comoda</b> was an upright chest, with two or more drawers, for table linens and small articles. In church sacristies, long and bulky <b>cajonerias</b><i> </i>stored altar clothes and priest&rsquo;s vestments. The tops of these, wide and polished, were used by the priest as he laid out his chasuble and other accessories in preparation for mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An altar for household<i> santos</i> (religious sculptures) was found in almost every home. The mesa altar, the popularly but inaccurately used term for this piece, is a cross between a table and a comoda. It usually has two to three drawers standing on four legs reinforced by a stretcher. Some have long, slender drawers for storing candles. Early Batangas pieces, like the tables found in Chinese temples, had cabriole legs and wide flanges with the cutout wave profile of the Ming altar table. Early types had one drawer with thin brass pulls, but the more common later pieces had three drawers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the bedroom was the <b>painadora</b>,<b> </b>a dresser or chest with drawers and a mounted mirror. The more elaborate<i> </i><b>tremor </b>had three full-length mirrors, two of which could be adjusted to allow a view of the user from three angles. The<i> </i><b>almario </b>(from Spanish &ldquo;<i>almario</i>,&rdquo; or arms), originally a cabinet for weapons in Spain, in the Philippines refers to a tall, slim, four-posted bedroom piece that stored pillows, mosquito nets, rolled-up mats, and other beddings. Inspired by the Chinese open cupboard, the Batangas style almario consisted of &ldquo;four square vertical pieces topped by flat rails with ends projecting outward, and a cupboard at the bottom. The front and side of the cupboard were made up of scrolled vertical slats and a solid back. The cupboard front had a sliding door of solid wood or scrolled back. There were no shelves in the upper part of the structure. The pillows were simply piled on top of the other&rdquo; (Jamir 1978).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the entrances to living rooms were hat and cane racks, often with mirrors. Called <b>bastoneros</b>, many such stands came from England. Among the local variations were plain, three-legged pieces and fancy art nouveau types with glass-knob hangers and mirrors. Later, deer-antler pieces and accordion-type hat racks, both hung on walls, came into use. All these hat racks served to display a gentleman&rsquo;s array of hats, canes, and umbrellas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Furniture for supporting the human body includes chairs and benches, sofas, and beds. Although chairs were part of the Chinese household, chairs in a wide variety arrived with the Spaniards and not with the Chinese (as earlier thought) with whom the Filipinos traded for centuries. Seventeenth- and 18th-century chairs were boxlike and patterned after the <b>wainscot</b> chair, with a wooden back panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chairs were also an integral part of the church, being both practical and symbolic. The <b>silla episcopal</b> (bishop&rsquo;s chair) was heavy and intricately carved. These used <b>solihiya</b><i> </i>(woven rattan) or could have been richly upholstered in velvet. Several were placed by the main altar for the priests and his assistants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tropical <b>butaca</b> or<i> </i><b>sillon</b> (planter&rsquo;s chair) had a reclining back and long wide arms. The <b>frailero</b>, also <b>silla frailura</b> or <b>silyang prayle</b> (friar&rsquo;s seat), is so named because it was supposed to be wide enough to accommodate a portly friar. The term comes from Spain itself, indicating how the clich&eacute; of fattened clerics was popular even there. The <b>silla perezosa</b> (lazy chair) had overextended flat arms on which one&rsquo;s legs could rest during a nap. Perezosas had rockers, such as those enjoyed by British traders of the early 1800s. The seats and backs of these chairs were made of solihiya to allow free circulation of air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although <b>mercedoras</b><i> </i>or <b>tumba-tumba</b> (rocking chairs) appeared before 1898 (bentwood pieces were imported from Austria in the late 19th century), it was the Americans who popularized them. Most vintage rocking chairs date to the 1930s and were manufactured in Binondo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guests or tenants sat on bancos or <b>kapiyas</b><i> </i>(benches) on the ground floor of a house while waiting to be summoned upstairs. The kapiya (probably from Spanish &ldquo;<i>capilla</i>,&rdquo; or chapel) has its origin in the church pew. Pews were not commonly used in church; the congregation knelt or stood, according to the liturgy. Only prominent parishioners sat on the long benches along the middle of the nave, which could be plain or carved. The Santo Ni&ntilde;o Basilica in Cebu has carved pews emblazoned with the Hapsburg eagle, while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\"><strong>Baclayon Church</strong></a> in Bohol had a pew decorated with genre scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<i> </i><b>gallinera</b> was so named because the slatted bottom half was designed to cage roosters, while their owners transacted business with the residents of the house. The 19th-century <b>directoire </b>type of chair came with or without arms, and had turned and reeded front legs terminating in boots and square back legs; two horizontal stretchers formed the backrest. Many late 19th-century salas had a sofa, popularly known as the<i> </i><b>mariposa</b>, which was derived from the Victorian horsehair sofa and named after its butterfly-shaped back. Like chairs, beds introduced innovation in the Filipino lifestyle. Beds were often of the four-poster variety, which was convenient for hanging mosquito nets. Their sleeping surfaces were made of solihiya to provide coolness and comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nuptial bed was customarily the first furniture piece owned by newly wedded couples. Some Ilocos beds dating to the 1800s were crowned with leaves and flowers, their supporting posts braided or reeded. Characteristic of the Ilocos beds is the symmetry between the head and foot board. Central Luzon beds had magnificent headboards carved from slats of narra or kamagong and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Many turn-of-the-century beds carried a couples&rsquo; monogram, which was also carried onto a child&rsquo;s first bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more popular four-posters in the late 19th century were done by Ah Tay, who blended European design and tropical flora. The headboard might use an ogee arch, while stylized pineapples served as tester corners and halved squashes served as bed supports, prompting the name <b>kalabasa</b> (squash) bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Brass beds were modish but not too popular because they had to be constantly polished. Beds were usually plain with knobs or finials on top of the bed posts. Iron bed steads were also common. They were sturdy and could be easily stored. The bed posts, 1.82-2.13 m long, were usually topped with brass finials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The traditional dulang around which Filipinos squatted during meals gradually gave way, especially among the upper class, to the higher mesa with matching chairs adopted from the Spaniards. Large families required long wooden tables that could seat up to 36 people. Not all tabletops were made of a single slab of narra, tindalo, or molave. To enlarge the tabletop, a slab was framed by thick boards 15.24-30.48 m wide; hence the name <b>binandeja</b><i> </i>(tray-like) in Laguna, Batangas, and Tayabas in Quezon. Some tables were inlaid at the center or edges; legs and stretchers could be carved or turned. To accommodate many guests during a fiesta or other large gatherings, some dining tables had drop leaves that could be raised to increase the table&rsquo;s surface area. Additional space was also provided by identical tables that could be put up end to end; or rectangular, polygonal, or half-moon side tables that could be joined to the end of the dining table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vestibules, living rooms, and bedrooms had <b>consolas </b>(side tables) and<i> </i><b>mesitas</b> (center tables). From the 1860s, marble-topped tables were made by the same shops that specialized in tombstones and other sculpture. Molding and grooves along the perimeter gave shadows to the wide expanse of white. Although local marble quarries were known, the Rodoreda family, marble workers for government buildings, used imported marble from Japan, Europe, and America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writing paraphernalia were stored inside <b>escritorios </b>(desks) and office tables, the tops of which could be folded or rolled up. Most desks were locally made although a number were imported from Hong Kong, Europe, and the United States. Lighter in appearance was the &ldquo;friar&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo; This had a drawer on each end of the table, a hinged slanting lid that could be raised, and cabriole legs. In the bedroom, porcelain wash basins were set on wood or marble <b>lavaderas</b>. The <b>costureros </b>(sewing tables) for hand-operated and treadle machines were also found in bedrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1851, Michael Thonet exhibited his cane and steam-bent wooden furniture, popularly called <b>Vienna furniture</b>, at the Crystal Palace exhibition in London. Supplanting heavy Victorian furniture, Thonet furniture had sleek silhouettes where every line had a structural purpose. Dismantable and mass-produced, its wooden parts could be shipped, then assembled upon reaching their markets. Imported <b>bentwood</b> tables, chairs, hat racks, and baby strollers furnished Philippine houses, offices, schools, and even clubs like Club Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 1914, bentwood ceased to be manufactured in Europe, and production stopped altogether. Entrepreneurs from San Miguel, Bulacan, met orders from Guam, Hawaii, and the United States. Instead of beech, they used rattan bent in several ways&mdash;by steaming, holding over a benzoline or kerosene lamp, or immersing in boiling water for half an hour. Rattan furniture, locally known as <b>batibot</b>, came in both Viennese-bentwood design and Victorian-wicker design. Black nito was also used to accentuate light-colored rattan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The American Tradition and Local Transformations</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mass production and urban overpopulation have resulted from 20th-century industrialization. The crowding of population centers altered the Filipino concept of domestic space. Furniture became smaller to fit <b>accessorias</b><i> </i>(row houses). <b>Art deco</b>-inspired assembly-line furniture sets for the bedroom, living room, and dining room were in demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Iron bedsteads from the United States and brass beds from Singapore competed with handcrafted wooden beds and eased these out of competition. The Cosmopolitan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in Escolta, founded by E. M. Bachrack in 1902, imported iron beds that were sold on easy installment plans. Parson&rsquo;s Hardware imported beds from Singapore. Only in 1910 were iron beds with cane bottoms manufactured in Binondo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During this era, Philippine batibot chairs met stiff competition from bamboo chairs manufactured in the Wanchai district of Hong Kong. However, by 1938, Filipinos wrested control over the local rattan furniture business. Leading rattan furniture manufacturers were L. Provedora Inc, Gonzalo Puyat and Sons Inc, Matibay Rattan Arts and Decoration Inc, State Rattan, Quiroga Bed Factory, Rattan Adjustable Furniture, Rattan Products Manufacturing Co., Nazareno&rsquo;s Rattan Craft, and Tuason and Sampedro Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Filipino blend of the Art Nouveau filtered down to domestic abodes in the 1920s up to the 1930s at the height of the American period of the country. The space allocations and plans of homes accommodated outdoor furniture as porches and verandahs became the mode of predominantly two-level and single-storey chalets (Manahan 1994). Wicker chairs and tables with rounded edges inspired by the Victorian and Edwardian periods were crafted inside prisons, which came to be known as &ldquo;<b>Bilibid furniture</b>.&rdquo; As a reformation discipline, utilization of convict labor for the mass manufacture of the furnitures was initiated. The Victorian style Peacock chair became the most in demand item coming in three sizes with varied costings (Lico 2012). By the 1930s, art-deco furniture was in demand to fill in the residential forms erected in the urban landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War I, Filipino <i>pensionados</i>, sent to United States to pursue their graduate degrees and specialization, exhibited a fondness for American models in their furniture choices. The straightforward simple lines, austerity in carving and surface embellishment provided a respite from elaborate designs and exaggerated motifs. The affordability of the furniture made it a popular choice for most homeowners. Since mass production was introduced during the 1930s, machine-based aesthetics characterized the off-the-floor purchase of the Filipinos to furnish their interior spaces. The &ldquo;Ambassador&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Quezon&rdquo; sala set became a popular choice. Streamlined and ergonomically designed, it graced most homes of the period. The low chairs were characterized by boatlike forms resembling deck chairs used in cruise travel that became popular in the period. It was fashioned after chairs designed by Warren MacArthur for the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in 1932 (Lico 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Philippine Furniture 1946-2014</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1950s ushered the massive reconstruction of buildings and homes after the destruction and chaos of World War II. The shortage resulted in a frenzy of hastily erected residences, constructed to provide immediate occupancy for the homeless residents affected by the war. Subdivision developments and walk-up apartment structures located in suburban Manila surfaced as an option for the families fleeing the congestion of the city. Furniture pieces made of painted hardwood combined with rope and cane were sold in mass-produced volume, with convenience and utility becoming the salient consideration in its design. Upholstery and more novel materials, like iron, brass, glass, veneers, leather, and marble, were experimented on. Color was infused in the decoration and embellishment of furniture. <b>Oriental</b> and <b>Scandinavian Moderne</b> pieces became unique accent pieces connoting a newfound sense of sophistication. However the uniformity of the architectural style of the homes included economical attributes affecting the choice of furnishings and furniture. The &ldquo;form follows function&rdquo; of the <b>Modernist</b> aesthetic was applied as well to the design of furniture (Lico 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the mid-1950s to the 1960s, corporate architecture promoted the contemporary look expressed in glass, steel, and leather. Furniture of this period derived inspiration from the work of Mies van der Rohe (e.g., his Barcelona chair), Marcel Breuer, Harry Bertoia, and Eero Saarinen. The look was interpreted in the Philippines by Cancio-Calma and by designers who had ventured out on their own from the Aguinaldo store team. Old furniture houses, like Puyat and Baluyot, continued to make custom pieces. Arte Espa&ntilde;ol was known for wrought iron; Rattan Art, for rattan and wicker; Jaime Ortol and Pilar Zaragosa, for Spanish; Florentino&rsquo;s, for Chinese; Joaquin Imperial, for French; and Nicfur, for less expensive pieces of modern furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Filipino &ldquo;Dream House&rdquo; concept privileged the interior designing of homes documented in local publications, such as the <b><i>Philippine Arts and Architecture Magazine</i></b>,<b> <i>Women and the Home</i></b>,<i> </i>and the society lifestyle pages of major newspapers in the 1950s to the 1960s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the biggest influences during the postwar era came from a well-known department store. In 1953, Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Department Store on Echague St, Manila, opened a Decor Arts department that displayed original furniture from Europe and the United States. The owner Francisco Aguinaldo hoped that local versions of these pieces could be made to reach a wider audience. The Aguinaldo&rsquo;s<i> </i>model rooms and vignettes, created by upcoming designers and architects&mdash;among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2659\"><strong>Wili Fernandez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2638\"><strong>Ched Berenguer-Topacio</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2642\"><strong>Lor Calma</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2694\"><strong>Edgar Ramirez</strong></a>, Myrna Cruz, and Bonnie Ramos&mdash;became the ideal models of interior spaces. The interior decoration and design services offered by them eventually started the awareness of interior design as a profession. These contemporary modern styles pervaded most the interior spaces of homes and offices. Rectilinear, finely crafted, hard-edged, austere furniture were used in order to accomplish a crisp minimalist look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In light of the nationalistic spirit prevailing in the late 1950s and early 1960s, affluent collectors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\"><strong>Luis Araneta</strong></a> and Arturo de Santos turned to Filipino objects. Pioneer decorator Rosario Luz brought into vogue the &ldquo;<b>new ilustrado</b>&rdquo; look, combining Filipino antiques with contemporary furniture. Folk art objects also began to be used, such as <b>moriones masks</b>, <b>pastillas</b> or milk-candy wrappers, and <b>taka</b> (papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;). The trend toward reviving native artistic traditions was strengthened by the research of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\"><strong>Fernando Zobel</strong></a>, Benito Legarda, Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3740\"><strong>Alfredo Roces</strong></a>, Alejandro Roces, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5183\"><strong>Gilda Cordero-Fernando</strong></a>. This trend continues in pieces such as the antique-style gallinera, kapiya, <b>cama</b>, <b>tocador</b>, butaca, aparador, platera, mesa and silla, and mesa altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By then, schools such as the University of Santo Tomas, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, the University of the Philippines, and the College of the Holy Spirit began offering four-year degree programs in interior design, two years of which were spent in the liberal arts. Furniture designing further developed as a unique niche of the profession. Practitioners of interior design, which included Ernest Korneld, Arturo de Santos, Phylis Harvey, Ronnie Laing, and Edgar Ramirez, began designing custom-built furniture pieces commissioned by their clients. The Philippine Institute of Interior Designers, organized in a meeting at the Summit Restaurant in Manila in 1964, was formed as an offshoot of the demand for professional interior design work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s welcomed geometric &ldquo;pop culture&rdquo; supergraphics and contemporary materials, like plastic, fiberglass, laminates, and vinyl. The &ldquo;<b>Mod look</b>&rdquo; treated furniture as part of walls, floors, and ceilings resulting in built-in units in the interiors (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a>os and Florendo 2013). Local adaptations of Hans Wegner, Finn Juhl, and the molded furniture of Charles Eames were appreciated and purchased by homeowners. The &ldquo;<b>Bagong Luma</b>&rdquo; design dictum of Rosario Luz&rsquo;s &ldquo;new ilustrado&rdquo; became prevalent as revival reproductions of Philippine antique furniture of the 19th century. Traditional, folk, and precolonial stylistic adaptations predominated in the rendering of new versions of the forms. An eclectic blend of both endemic motifs was fused to the modern lines of the furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1980s onward, furniture experimentation accommodated a conciliation of international and vernacular styles. The renewed interest in indigenous local culture, craftsmanship, and materials evolved into a Filipino modern ethnic design in furniture. The award-winning <b><i>Petal Folding Chair</i></b> designed by Mercedes Berenguer &ldquo;Ched&rdquo; Topacio, for instance, was made of woven split rattan strips and hand-forged iron. It drew inspiration from a blossoming flower as it could be folded and opened as needed. It won the Roscoa International award in 1986. The fine quality of local materials such as rattan and leather provided unique experimentations in furniture and the decorative arts. The aesthetics of the postmodern era in the 1980s dictated divergent interpretations of furniture as sculpture and as an art form. Following <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a>&rsquo;s early furniture sculptural pieces using Philippine hardwood, Jerusalino Araos carved pieces of polished wood in organic shapes. Working with weathered wood, Rey Paz Contreras experimented with combined forms to craft outdoor furniture for garden settings. A chair called <b><i>Making Waves</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3797\"><strong>Claude Tayag</strong></a> is a rigid bench of joined pieces of solid wood, unprocessed and polished by hand. It was a statement of the new creative bent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While there is a strong preference for Filipino-inspired furniture, some advocates followed a trend of abstraction influenced by the global scene. Advancing technology continued to bring new equipments and processes that streamlined furniture manufacturing and even designing. Filipino migration was a formidable factor in creating a new vernacular style in furniture designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of mega communities with high-density spaces introduced compact, built-in, and multifunctional furniture pieces to accommodate condominium living. Confronting the challenges of the global realities, Filipino designers crafted their unique solutions to the emerging concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Furniture artisans infused a sustainable Filipino psyche to their designs. Locally crafted, sourced using new technologies and materials, they have become globally recognized and appreciated.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Installation</b> refers broadly to art practice that incorporates an ensemble of objects and mediums in space. Both objects and space are central components of artworks in this category. The materials contained in space can be individual <b>assemblages</b> or a combination of traditional and nontraditional forms. This mode of art production results in environments that viewers can engage in physically and thus make up art that is not merely visual experience. These artworks can be reinstalled in various sites but are greatly dependent on the particularities of their location, thus they are <b>site-specific art</b>. Artworks that employ modes and methods specific to installation may combine painting, drawing, sculpture, found objects or ready-mades, sound, film, video, and text. They create total environments wherein a viewer engages multiple senses to experience the piece. Site specificity has to do with the integration into and alteration of the attributes of a specific location by way of an artwork. In this way, the site becomes an indispensable element of the artwork or art project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some installations can be reconfigured and relocated to numerous exhibition spaces; from museums and galleries to public spaces like parks, or large-scale exhibition venues like biennales and art fairs. There are pieces greatly contingent on their site, wherein specific attributes of location are intrinsic to the work. Often these artworks are installed only once. While some are permanent pieces, most others are ephemeral, assembled and later dismantled and documented through photographs and videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In North America and Europe, installation and site-specific art flourished as a response to <b>Modernist </b>claims of the primacy of the art object, the singularity of viewer experience, and the increased commodification of art. Movements such as <b>Minimalism</b>,<b> Land Art</b>,<b> Environmental Art</b>,<b> Conceptual Art</b>, and<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a></b> are early influences in the formation of installation and site-specific art. They are founded on several shifts: an emphasis from art object to viewer experience, from art as commodity to art as ephemeral object, and from representation to a work&rsquo;s contingent message. Installations and site-specific art also reveal not only inherent attributes of transmedia but also the material conditions of viewing. Early installations and site-specific works did not have lucrative sales potential in the art market but over the years, they and their accompanying documentation have become prominent pieces in private and public art collections. Installation and site-specific art have become ever more dynamic in material and form, as well as in modes of engagement. These attributes speak to an increasingly more complex patronage system. Often, contemporary installation and site-specific artworks refer to those commissioned by public and private entities, the state, corporations, or private foundations. Projects initiated by individual artists, artist groups, or collectives have also become more common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Landmark pieces that now define early developments in the Philippines hewed closely to environmental and land art. They were responses to the increasing deterioration of the natural environment and the alarming depletion of natural resources. Most artists working in the vein of installation incorporated materials indigenous to site or found on location, including urban debris. They incorporated as themes traditional rituals and forms. The impulse toward nature and environment arose alongside conceptions of indigenous identity. The  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) supported these inclinations through the vision of its curators&mdash;notably, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3385\"><strong>Raymundo Albano</strong></a> who was visual arts director from 1971 to 1985. However, earlier installation works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\"><strong>Shop 6</strong></a>, a group formed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a>, already manifested a turn toward objects and their display in space. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3737\"><strong>Alan Rivera</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Room/Riddle</i></b>, 1975, for instance, had as elements a rocking chair, a rusty electric fan, and a table on which was a note that said &ldquo;Buy me, I am Art!&rdquo; Artists&rsquo; use of ready-mades as well as their concentrated gesture of claiming that something produced by following directions on a written note could be called art underlined the fraught status of the precious art object both from the view of art institutions and the art market.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Raymundo Albano in a 1981 statement claimed that installation has its roots in the local environment, citing festivals like the <b>Pahiyas</b> in Lucban, locales like the jungles of Los Ba&ntilde;os, the jeepney, and religious traditions. Early on, he asserted installation&rsquo;s &ldquo;intimacy with folk patterns&rdquo; and its potential as novel expression of Filipino identity. In comparison to painting, which he regarded as wholly imported, alien, or foreign, Albano asserted that installations were &ldquo;natural born&rdquo; to Filipino artists. The installation of artist Luis Enano Yee Jr aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a> at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2323\"><strong>Wood Things</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1981, combined banana stalks and kapok pods made to look like large insects crawling all over the gallery space. Through texture and play, Junyee was able to recreate the sense of unbridled growth in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An early marker in the development of site-specific art in the Philippines may have been Los Ba&ntilde;os <b><i>Site Works</i></b> organized by artist Junyee at the foothills of Mount Makiling in Laguna province. The outdoor exhibition ran from 10 to 30 Oct 1981 with numerous participating artists working with materials available on-site. The Los Ba&ntilde;os <b><i>Site Works</i></b> was supported by the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Ba&ntilde;os, the Thirteen Artists Program of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, and the Brotherhood of Plebeians. The public launch coincided with the UP Loyalty Day. The three-hectare site housed works by art students and more established artists, including those from the Philippine High School for the Arts and the UP College of Fine Arts (CFA). Junyee and fellow artists saw the project as departure from art meant to be displayed in gallery settings. It had as premise the incorporation of a site&rsquo;s features into the installation pieces. On-site materials were used&mdash;specifically, those &ldquo;discarded by nature,&rdquo; with artists advised not to damage or take from any other natural resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Los Ba&ntilde;os <b><i>Site Works</i></b> sought the cohesion of both art object and its surroundings. Vines, branches and twigs, leaves, rocks, and bamboo were positioned to appear as if sprouting from the ground, floating in air, encompassing an area, or as suspended from tree branches. Artists whose works were included in this pioneering site-specific exhibition were Ted Gagalac, Raymundo Albano, Ginny Dandan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3616\"><strong>Ileana Lee</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3639\"><strong>Lani Maestro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3436\"><strong>Genara Banzon</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3581\"><strong>Hermisanto</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a>, Marlon Reyes, Pablo Biglang-awa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4984\"><strong>Ian Victoriano</strong></a>, Jessie Pastor, and John Cinco; these latter six were students at the UP College of Fine Arts at the time. Professors at the UP CFA would later incorporate installation and site-specific works in their curricula. Art galleries such as  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></a></strong> and Kulay Diwa supported artists to explore installation works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Installation is now a prominent feature of contemporary Philippine art. Contributing factors include interdisciplinary approaches to art making, a greater interest in the role of viewers to make sense of an artwork, the burgeoning of even larger exhibition spaces, and more important, a compelling need for artists to be somehow involved with communities, in various degrees actively addressing concerns through creative practice. In 1989, artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\"><strong>Roberto Villanueva</strong></a> from Baguio City created <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong>Uma ti Biag</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Garden of Life) in the CCP grounds. Constructed from bamboo and reed, the piece had a hollowed center with river rocks and rice granary guardian figures. It clearly culled from worship practices of the Mountain Province in the Philippine North.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Exhibition platforms&mdash;such as the International Baguio Arts Festival, held six times from 1988 to 2002; the biennial Visayan Visual Arts Exhibition and Conference (Viva ExCon), which started in 1990; and the five Sungdu-an traveling exhibitions started in 1996&mdash;have created opportunities for artists to collaborate together in art making. The multifaceted roles of artists have positioned them as curators or community organizers, allowing them to organize venues where installation and its new forms can be made, exhibited, and engaged with. The phenomena also gave rise to artist-run spaces, such as Big Sky Mind, shifting the conditions of art production away from state and commercial institutions, fostering a creative space where contemporary artists could freely explore ideas and explore the possibilities of materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other modes of engagement have since either superseded or been appended to site specificity as a distinguishing aspect of installation work. These new practices and modes include participatory art, social engagement, community projects, and relational art. These more recent tendencies consequently result in ever more varied configurations of form, methods of making, processes of engagement, and modes of display. This includes experimentation with and incorporation of new media, video and film, and exploring the Internet as engagement platform via digital technology. Technology likewise has altered the way space is experienced. Virtual space now intersects with and complements the physical spaces that art occupies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All these have been integrated into Philippine contemporary art through motley forms and practices. Works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\"><strong>Kidlat Tahimik</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3411\"><strong>Agnes Arellano</strong></a>, Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3590\"><strong>Toym Imao</strong></a>, Mark Justiniani, Kawayan de Guia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3683\"><strong>Leeroy New</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3755\"><strong>Mark Salvatus</strong></a>, Toym Imao, and Leslie de Chavez all illustrate the use of these varied approaches. Their projects have traveled to numerous venues: conventional spaces like those of museums and galleries, art fair venues, biennales and international exhibitions, parks, beach fronts, and other shared and unexpected spaces in a neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary projects are also outcomes of festivals, which of late have included the Neo-Angono Public Art Festival in Angono, the Bagasbas Beach International Eco-Arts Festival in Camarines Norte, the Malasimbo Music and Arts Festival in Oriental Mindoro, and projects initiated by AXIS Art in Baguio and nearby provinces in the northern region. These new developments translate into greater examinations of identity, belonging, and being in space and time by way of the innovative lenses that art fabricates and facilitates among those encountering it.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byTessa Maria C.

This popular visual-arts form consists of a series of frames or a single frame with figures of people or animals. Dialogue is indicated by means of &ldquo;balloons&rdquo; containing words and is often accompanied by an explanatory text. Komiks is also called <b>cartoon</b> (from the Italian &ldquo;<i>carton</i>,&rdquo; sketches done on cardboard in preparation for a mural). However, in the Philippines the term &ldquo;komiks&rdquo; is generally used for entertaining pieces, while &ldquo;cartoon&rdquo; includes the <b>editorial cartoon</b> or the single-frame drawing that comments on current events or satirizes the foibles of leaders and institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">History of Komiks </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1885  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>, on a visit to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>, illustrated the tale of the monkey and the tortoise in 34 plates, which he drew in an album belonging to Luna&rsquo;s wife. Because of these illustrations and his illustrations of five Hans Christian Andersen tales that he translated into Tagalog, Rizal is often considered the first Filipino cartoonist.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Precursor of the komiks, the editorial cartoon began to appear in newspapers and magazines of the late 19th century and were generally of critical character. Ignacio del Villar&rsquo;s lively lampoons of middle-class lifestyle were published in the 1885-87 issues of <b><i>Manila Alegre</i></b>. These featured parades at Luneta, bullfights, fiestas, theater, courtship, marriage, and shopping in Quiapo. Other cartoons published in the same illustrated magazine were J. Arestegui&rsquo;s caricatures of celebrities and F. Lazaun&rsquo;s <b><i>Ayer, Hoy, y Ma&ntilde;ana </i></b>(Three Ages of Woman). <b><i>El Temblor</i></b> of 1885, <b><i>Manililla</i></b> of 1888, <b><i>El Caneco</i></b> of 1890, <b><i>El Bello Sexo</i></b> of 1891, <b><i>El Ejercito</i></b> of 1892, and <b><i>La Moda Filipina</i></b> and <b><i>El Telegrama </i></b>of 1893 were other periodicals that carried notable examples of the genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Political cartoons appeared in magazines, labeled as &ldquo;<b>periodicos festivos</b>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<b>revistas tradicionalistas</b>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>revistas comicas, joco y satirico</b>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>El Chiflado</i></b>, 1885-89, published anti-Spanish cartoons. The <b><i>Escuela Permanente</i></b> depicted the crumbling Spanish empire in the Philippines and Latin America. <b><i>Resurrexit </i></b>(He Has Risen),<b><i> Surge et Ambula</i></b> (Arise and Walk) and <b><i>La Fruta Cadaciada Oregine del Pecado</i></b> (The Fruit of the Original Sin) were antifriar graphic works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>El Verde</i></b> of the 1890s satirized economic progress in the country. <b><i>Colonizacion</i></b> (Colonization) is an enlarged drawing of a lean Caucasian figure, while other personifications are dwarfed: Actividad, a sluggish man; Industria,<b><i> </i></b>a Chinese balancing two pails; Agricultura, a housewife tending a garden patch; Moriencito, a tranvia pulled by turtles; Ciencia, a monkey in toga; and Prensa, a kettledrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>El Cinefe</i></b> of 1894 fearlessly published antigovernment cartoons, such as <b><i>Cuestion Palpitante</i></b> (Throbbing Question) and <b><i>En Alza</i></b><i> </i>(On the Rise).<b><i> Te Con Leche </i></b>of 29 Oct 1898 published a work, signed Cobrian, which showed Uncle Sam entertaining with a monkey and a bag of tricks, labeled <b><i>American Amusement: Always Protecting</i></b>. It also published cartoons by V. Tur, such as <b><i>Vida es Pesadilla</i></b> (Life&rsquo;s Nightmare) and <b><i>La Mision de la Prensa </i></b>(Mission of the Press), which attacked the censorship of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>La Restauracion</i></b> of 1898 and<b><i> El Tio Verdades </i></b>in 1899 published editorial cartoons critical of national and international issues, warning the Philippines of American imperialism. In the early 1900s the politically oriented magazines <b><i>Telembang</i></b> and <b><i>Lipang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>baw</i></b> consistently featured cartoon caricatures of political figures. In <b><i>Lipang Kalabaw</i></b>, illustrators used pseudonyms, like Makabuhay, Sirom, Lipay, Makahiya, TikTok, and Tagakadlagan, to escape arrest by the Americans. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3721\"><strong>Jorge Pineda</strong></a> illustrated many cartoons for <b><i>The Independent</i></b>. The American colonial period saw the rise of newspaper publication due to the increase in literacy rate. Political cartoons graced the major periodicals of the day and the most active cartoonists of this period were Jose Perreira and Esmeraldo &ldquo;E.Z.&rdquo; Izon of the<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b>, established before World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The post-World War II period was also a time when journalism was alive and editorial cartoons accompanied the major publications with E.Z. Izon drawing for the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b>, Liborio &ldquo;Gat&rdquo; Gatbonton for the<b><i> Manila Chronicle</i></b>, Bert Gallardo and Isaac Tolentino for the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\"><strong>Demetrio Diego</strong></a> for the <b><i>Daily  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></strong> </i></b>. These cartoonists worked in diverse styles, churning out daily or weekly satires to complement the most important news. These cartoons are recognized as the forerunners of present-day komiks.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The formal history of komiks begins in 1929 when Antonio S. Velasquez and Romualdo Ramos came out with the first issue of <b><i>Mga Kababalaghan ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a> </i></b>(Kenkoy&rsquo;s Antics). An instant hit, <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b> ran in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> </i></b>and its sister magazines until 1941 when the Japanese clamped down on all media. <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> magazine and its vernacular versions&mdash;<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5087\"><strong>Bannawag</strong></a></i></b> in Ilocano, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a></i></b> in Ilonggo, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a></i></b> in Cebuano, and <b><i>Bikolnon</i></b> in Bicol&mdash;were the leading outlets for other cartoonists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II appeared the first comic book, <b><i>Halakhak</i></b>, a 10-issue series inspired by English comic books brought over by American GIs. These combined novel writing, painting, and cinematographic elements in one work. On 27 May 1947 Don Ramon Roces and Velasquez organized Ace Publications, which put out <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>, featuring the komiks of Velasquez, Jose Zabala Santos, Damian Velasquez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\"><strong>Larry Alcala</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, Tony Roullo, E. D. Ramos, Fred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\"><strong>Carillo</strong></a>, A. Y. Manalad, and Hugo Yonzon. Because the komiks were so popular, Ace Publications put out other comic books in rapid sucession: <b><i>Tagalog Klasiks</i></b>, 1949; <b><i>Hiwaga Komiks</i></b>, 1950; <b><i>Espesyal Komiks</i></b> and <b><i>Kenkoy Komiks</i></b>, 1952. These comic books flourished for more than a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, Alcala, Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos, Corky Trinidad, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\"><strong>Danilo Dalena</strong></a> were most active in the field. Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Kalabog en Bosyo</i></b> and <b><i>Mang Ambo </i></b>were very popular. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\"><strong>Nonoy Marcelo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1516\"><strong>Tisoy</strong></a> </i></b>appealed to young urban-bred adults. Trinidad, then based in the United States (US), often drew caricatures of world leaders, like Ferdinand Marcos. A number of his cartoons have been collected and published in anthologies. Dalena&rsquo;s searing caricatures appeared in <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> in the late 1960s and <b><i>Asia-Philippines Leader </i></b>in the early 1970s. Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Asyong Aksaya</i></b> was best known during martial law years. In the 1980s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a> created very insightful sketches on social problems published in the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b> and <b><i>Observer </i></b>magazine. Notable cartoonists of the period include Jess Abrera, Arnel Mirasol, Esmeralda Izon, Ludwig Ilio, Nonoy Marcelo, Dengcoy Miel, Roni Santiago, Norman Isaac, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3524\"><strong>Neil Doloricon</strong></a>, and Rene Aranda who livened up the pages of the periodicals with their witty political satires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Roces clan continued to dominate the komiks industry through their publishing outfits Atlas Publishing and Graphic Arts Services Inc. A number of independent komiks came out during this period but failed to topple the Roces monopoly. An example is <b><i>United Komiks</i></b> in 1963, which was published by Pablo Gomez&rsquo;s PSG Publishing (Valiente 2012). In the 1970s, American comic book publisher DC Comics started recruiting Filipino illustrators, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3732\"><strong>Nestor Redondo</strong></a>, Alfredo Alcala, and Alex Ni&ntilde;o whose talents were eventually recognized at the Comic-Con International&rsquo;s Inkpot Award in Denver, Colorado (Valiente 2012). Ernie Chan, Whilce Portacio, Gerry Alanguilan, and Leinil Yu are some of those who lent their talents to foreign outfits. Their success and readiness to mentor and share opportunities with younger artists spurred production in the Philippines even in the midst of the waning of the comics industry in the late 1980s. In the early and mid-1980s, komiks continued to gain popularity with big writers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\"><strong>Carlo J. Caparas</strong></a>, Elena Patron, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5146\"><strong>Nerissa Cabral</strong></a>, Hal Santiago, and Mar Santana taking the lead (Valiente 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the late 1980s, komiks started to decline in popularity due to several factors. Komiks as a major form of entertainment lost its viability due to the availability of other forms of media, such as television. Television sets became more affordable at the time, due in part to the availability of cheaper, non-Japanese brands imported into the Philippines. Television also offered more variety in content after the EDSA Revolution when censorship became more lax. Some artists attribute the decline of the komiks industry to the Roces monopoly, which allegedly stifled creativity and diversity, and the failure of publishing outfits to give proper remuneration to illustrators. Due to the meager wages they were receiving, many comic book artists joined the advertising and animation industries, which offered more attractive pay (Valiente 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decline of komiks, however, did not spell the end of the industry. The 1990s saw the rise of independent comics, such as <b><i>Flashpoint</i></b>,<b><i> Alamat</i></b>,<b><i> Zenith Graphics</i></b>,<b><i> Exodus</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>TaekwonDoggs </i></b>(Valiente 2012). <b><i>Culture Crash</i></b>, a comic book published by a group of Fine Arts students in the University of the Philippines, became a cult favorite in this decade. Many comic book artists of this generation appropriated styles and techniques from Japanese comics (<b>manga</b>), such as multiple framing, a monochromatic or &ldquo;toned look,&rdquo; and the cleaner and more tapered facial features of characters (Calingo 2007). Many also dealt with superhero themes similar to American comics. The rise of independent comic books saw a noticeable shift in demographics from the masses as the largest audience of komiks from the 1940s to the 1980s to a niche group of enthusiasts largely from the middle class. Unlike early komiks, which could easily be bought in newsstands and markets, these independent komiks are bought in specialty stores, at comic conventions held annually for comic book fans, or accessed online. It is ironic that while the Internet supposedly democratizes production and distribution of information, computers have remained out of reach for majority of the masses, thereby limiting access to online content, including comic books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Komiks in the form of single or multiple panel comic strips appearing in comic books and daily newspapers&mdash;such as Larry Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Kalabog and Bosyo</i></b>, 1947; Ben Alcantara&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1440\"><strong>Gorio and His Jeepney</strong></a></i></b>, 1950s; Nonoy Marcelo&rsquo;s <b><i>Tisoy</i></b>, 1963; and Roni Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Baltic and Co</i></b>., 1970s&mdash;were also very popular. In the 1980s, Larry Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Slice of Life</i></b>, a full-page strip in <b><i>Weekend Magazine</i></b>, Tonton Young&rsquo;s <b><i>My Little Pupung</i></b>, and Pol Medina&rsquo;s <b><i>Pugad Baboy</i></b> appealed to a wide readership. In the 2000s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3375\"><strong>Manix Abrera</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kiko Machine</i></b> and Lyndon Gregorios&rsquo;s <b><i>Beerkada </i></b>(Beer Buddies) entertained readers through their witty portrayals of everyday life. Young artists have also been counting on increased online access in the long term as they see this as a way to reach a broader audience. They continue to produce work that are no longer intended as print versions, opting to establish a presence among the geographically spread out publics who encounter their work in the virtual world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Types of Komiks</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The komiks has several formats. The first is the <b>daily strip</b>, usually consisting of three or four frames. The same form has also been used for long narratives parcelled out four frames at a time. The second is the <b>full-page strip</b>, appearing in weekly magazines. Serial novels or short completed stories, called <b>wakasan</b>, have also appeared in full page. The third is also full page, but rather than being divided into frames, is spread over the entire page. This kind was popularized by Alcala in his <b><i>Slice of Life</i></b>, and by Zabala Santos in his <b><i>Lifestyle</i></b>. Comic strips can also occupy several pages in magazines. This is the most common form of serialized komiks novels from which films are derived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are generally three kinds of komiks according to content: <b>humorous</b>, <b>narrative</b>, and <b>instructional</b>. The first category, humorous comics or the &ldquo;<b>funnies</b>,&rdquo; are of two groups: <b>human caricatures</b> and <b>animal comics</b>. These were both influenced by American comic strips&mdash;the first, by such strips as <b><i>Dagwood</i></b>, <b><i>Blondie</i></b>,<b><i> Li&rsquo;l Abner</i></b>, and <b><i>Peanuts</i></b>, and the second by <b><i>Mickey Mouse</i></b> and <b><i>Felix the Cat</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines the first humorous comic strip using human caricatures was <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which first appeared in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> on 11 Jan 1929. Kenkoy included a family composed of Mang Teroy, Aling Matsay, Rosing, Kenkoy&rsquo;s rival Tirso, and other colorful characters, such as Talakitok, Talimusak, and later, in separate strips, Nanong Pandak and Ponyang Halubaybay. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\"><strong>Mars Ravelo</strong></a> followed suit with <b><i>Rita</i></b> and related characters Gorio and Tekla, Engot and Ipe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Komiks caricature, which involves the exaggeration of physical features, is a common device to elicit laughter. This can include the manner of dressing, which can be comic or satirical. Komiks humor also stems from the language. The very names and epithets can be funny, such as Ponyang Halubaybay and Kurdapya, names that explode social pretensions. Linguistic humor can also be found in the m&eacute;lange of vernacular languages, English, and Spanish, thereby reflecting the country&rsquo;s long colonial experience. The comic strips of Alcala and Marcelo freely coined and popularized words, such as &ldquo;pahatset-hatset&rdquo; (eating away) and &ldquo;jeproks&rdquo; (way-out, rugged). Humor can also arise from the spelling of English loan words&mdash;for example, &ldquo;bespreng&rdquo; (best friend)&mdash;as well as from the manner of speech of the characters: for example, &ldquo;Haya, hayik sa kamay ng yoya&rdquo; (Go on, kiss grandma&rsquo;s hand). Humor also arises from the situations themselves. Many situations puncture the pretensions of the characters, as when Kenkoy in coat and tie is chased and bitten by a dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second category, narrative komiks, may be grouped into six kinds according to content: stories drawn from or modeled after the old <i>awit </i>and <i>korido </i>(metrical tales), such as the artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3477\"><strong>Francisco Coching</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Don Cobarde</i></b> and <b><i>Haring Ulupong</i></b><i> </i>(Serpent King); fantastic adventures in tropical jungles or in distant lands, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5642\"><strong>Pedrito Reyes</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\"><strong>Francisco Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kulafu </i></b>and Coching&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4005\"><strong>Hagibis</strong></a></i></b>; supernatural or strange wonders, such as Ravelo and Elpidio Torres&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><strong>Dyesebel</strong></a></i></b>; love stories, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5540\"><strong>Gilda Olvidado</strong></a> and Joey Celerio&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1006\"><strong>Sinasamba Kita</strong></a></i></b> (I Worship You) and <b><i>Dapat Ka Bang Mahalin?</i></b> (Should You Be Loved?); history-inspired stories or biographies, such as Coching&rsquo;s <b><i>Vibora </i></b>and Fred Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Yamato</i></b>, based on incidents of World War II; and realistic stories based on social problems, such as Ravelo&rsquo;s <b><i>Roberta</i></b>. There are also special comics that were inspired by literary classics, such as Francisco Balagtas&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> at Laura</i></b> (Florante and Laura). Comics on the life of Christ and Catholic saints are also used for didactic purposes. Comics could also be based on true-to-life stories&mdash;for example, that of actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, produced for a fandom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narrative or <b>story komiks</b> has two drawing traditions, the <b>romantic</b> and the <b>realistic</b>. The first was dominated by Coching. The style is characterized by dynamic curvilinear lines and tonal modeling with a fluid, undulating effect. The leading male characters are stalwart in build, and of handsome mestizo or Malay looks, with curly hair and rippling muscles. The female leads are mestiza, graceful, and usually with long curly tresses. It is a style that gives life to the myths and legends of yore and to fantasies of love and adventure. In Coching&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a></strong> </i></b> (The Native), 1952, the story revolves around the dark-skinned and <i>salakot</i>-wearing Fernando and his search for his true identity. A viscount turned rebel, Fernando is Hispanic yet also Filipino&mdash;a trope that found resonance with the public. Aside from Coching, Nestor Redondo, Federico C. Javinal, Mar T. Santana, Hal Santiago, Steve Gan, and Nestor Malgapo also work in this tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The realist tradition, on the other hand, which deal with contemporary issues and problems or expose the true conditions of society, is prevalent in komiks. Based on personal and familial situations, many of the narratives are drawn from real life, and so are the characters who are ordinary people without extraordinary qualities. The style, even and detailed, is based on a keen observation of reality. Outstanding examples of this tradition are Ravelo&rsquo;s <b><i>Roberta</i></b> and Pablo Gomez and Nestor Redondo&rsquo;s <b><i>Batang Bangkusay</i></b>. Working in the realist tradition are Celerio, Redondo, Entes Magpusao, Fred Carrillo, Fred P. Alcala, and Ben Maniclang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third kind of komiks, the instructional cartoons are those that illustrate an analysis or point of view regarding a social or political issue usually produced by institutions and cause-oriented groups. They basically aim to develop social awareness. The drawing style may be realist or nonrealist, depending on intention. To this type belong editorial cartoons made by artists like Alcala, Marcelo, Dalena, Jess Abrera, Edgar Soller, Corky Trinidad, Jose Tence Ruiz, Arnel Mirasol, Net Billones, Norman B. Isaac, and Esmeralda Izon. Marcelo, creator of <b><i>Ikabod Bubwit</i></b>, still uses this character for editorial purposes. Ruiz and Dalena did insightful drawings on social and political issues, which were as powerful as their larger paintings. Abrera lampooned social issues in the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>. Trinidad and Soller have gone on to doing editorial cartoons for international publications. Mirasol and Izon continued to illustrate ideas in their cartoons. All in all, editorial cartoon straddles various drafting styles, from stylized animal images to sketches that have a painterly effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Editorial cartoons have played an important role in social movements in the Philippines. Underground papers, such as <b><i>Ulos</i></b>, have reproduced illustrations done by underground artists as well as aboveground artists sympathetic to their cause. Common themes of these cartoons are the oppression of the peasants and workers, US imperialism, and the Philippines depicted as a woman battling the many-headed dragon representing social problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent years, novelty comic books have also developed, such as <b><i>Don&rsquo;t Take a Bath on a Friday: Philippine Superstitions and Folk Beliefs</i></b>, 1996, illustrated by Katti Sta. Ana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The popularity of comic characters have also pushed the crossover to film, theater, and television. Coching&rsquo;s work have been made into films. Other examples include Ravelo&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong> </i></b> and <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>; Jim Fernandez&rsquo;s <b><i>Zuma</i></b>; Ravelo and Fernandez&rsquo;s<b><i> Captain Barbell</i></b>; Alcala&rsquo;s <b><i>Kalabog and Bosyo</i></b>, as well as <b><i>Asiong Aksaya</i></b>; and Carlo Caparas&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\"><strong>Ang Panday</strong></a></i></b>. The last, like <b><i>Bituing Walang Ningning</i></b><i> </i>(Star without Sparkle), has also been adapted for television. The Kenkoy character has been used for the theater musical <b><i>Kenkoy at Rosing</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2013, digitally printed excerpts of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2236\"><strong>Nardong Tae</strong></a></strong> <b><i> </i></b>(Nardo the Shit Guy) comic series by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3484\"><strong>Louie Cordero</strong></a> was included in the exhibit <b><i>The Philippine Contemporary: To Scale the Past and the Possible</i></b>, 2013-15, at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. The inclusion of the work marks the acceptance of pop culture as part of contemporary art practice. In 2014, Francisco V. Coching received posthumously the National Artist award for visual arts. <em><strong>Written byAlice G.

		"text": "<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong></strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong></strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong></strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong></strong></a><p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Leaf art</b> refers to ephemeral works made of leaf, which may have a functional as well as aesthetic use. Leafart should be distinguished from <b>basketry</b>, which also uses leaves like buri palm, because baskets are made to last. Leaves are used for food wrapping, religious ritual, and modern artistic expression. The most commonly used leaves are banana, palm, and anahaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For wrapping food, banana and palm leaves are most frequently used. Banana leaves have a midrib and two parts of soft plant material<i>. </i>The ribs are usually removed. Not all leaves are serviceable; only resilient ribs are usually chosen. Banana leaves may be used to wrap foodstuffs, like the square <b>tamales</b> sold by peddlers, or they may be used to wrap individual servings of rice cooked in one huge pot. The trunk of the banana, which consists of layers of vegetable matter, can also be peeled off and flattened for wrapping. These may be used with banana leaves as in the wrapping of the <i>kesong puti </i>or white cheese. Here the soft square slab of cheese is first boxed in the strip of banana trunk, then wrapped in several layers of banana leaves, and finally tied with banana fiber. In Pangasinan, <i>panocha </i>or raw sugar is wrapped in banana trunk, then shaped like a gourd by tying.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More flexible and expressive than banana are palm leaves. In Batangas, buri is used for <i>pakaskas </i>or raw sugar. The buri are shaped like circular canisters, liquid sugar poured in and hardened, and the whole covered with buri cut into a circular shape. Stacks of these circular canisters are tied together with buri. Coconut leaf wrappers are used for <i>suman </i>(sticky rice cake) and <i>puso</i> (cooked rice wrapped in heart-shaped coconut leaf). The practice of wrapping suman with <i>ibus </i>(young, light unopened coconut leaves which are pliant<i>) </i>takes several regional forms. In the Visayas, the whole coconut leaf with midrib is laid flat, glutinous rice placed in the center, the leaf folded over it, then bound. In the Tagalog region, to wrap suman, a side of the leaf is removed from the midrib and then coiled closely to form a cylinder; one end is sealed with a piece of midrib, wet rice is placed inside, and the other end sealed. All of it is wrapped with thin strips of ibus. There are various shapes of the puso: <b>kinasing </b>is shaped like a heart, <b>binaki </b>is flat like a frog at rest, and <b>tinigib </b>has one flattened corner like a chisel. Woven from one or several ibus, rice is placed inside the puso and cooked. Other Visayan items that may be called leaf art are impermanent baskets for holding fruit and hats made of woven coconut leaf. In Mindanao and Sulu, the folk weave <i>pinipig</i> or rice-cake containers from palm leaves dyed in magenta and other hues and fashioned in the simple shape of a bird or tapering tree of life. They also weave dome-shaped food covers of palm leaf dyed in different colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is in its ritual uses where the leaf assumes heightened artistic expression. Here coconut leaves are stripped from their stalk and used to line platforms, arched to decorate balconies and entrances, cut, plaited, and folded to create decorative shapes. Anahaw are usually tucked into walls and combined with flowers and paper to make bouquets. Aside from the town fiesta, there are three big fiesta clusters in the Philippines for Christianized Filipinos, each of which has its own uses of leaf: Lent, the Maytime festivals, and Christmas. During Lent and Semana Santa<i> </i>or Holy Week, from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday, leaves play an important part. Temporary structures, called <b>kubol</b> in Tagalog and <b>abong-abong </b>in Ilocos, are set up for chanting the <i>pasyon</i>, a long narrative poem on the suffering and death of Christ. The kubol is traditionally made of a bamboo frame roofed and decorated with coconut leaves, plaited, and decorated with flowers. The kubol is similar to temporary structures built to accommodate guests for a meal at a wedding or a fiesta or to structures built in rice fields for resting or sleeping. In the kubol is an altar with images of saints before which devotees sing the pasyon. The Ilocano abong-abong uses vegetables rather than flowers for decorations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Palm Sunday celebrates the entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. For the high Mass, devotees bring their <b>palaspas </b>or palm leaves to church to be blessed by the priest. The palaspas are long stalks of coconut or buri palm with their fronds plaited into decorative patterns and embellished with crepe-paper flowers. A palaspas has two parts: a decorative handle and the decorated fronds from which hang the woven stars, grasshoppers and other figures from palm leaves or tiny paper flags. The decorative handle may be heart-shaped or woven like a mat or folded into overlapping bows. The fronds may be cut and folded or may be plaited to form zigzag patterns, called <b>kidlat </b>(lightning), <b>espada </b>(swordlike designs), <b>bola </b>(ball), <b>ibon </b>(bird), <b>hipon </b>(shrimp), and other designs similar to those found in floral offerings in Indonesia. Similar ways of decorating palm fronds are found among the Tausug who use kidlat-shaped leaves in an arrangement of fruit and flowers for weddings. The <b><i>galilea</i></b>, an elevated platform decorated with leaves and flowers, is built in the church patio for the choir who will sing the chants of the day. After the fiesta, the palaspas are placed on the walls, doors, or windows to drive away evil spirits and lightning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Coconut leaves are also fashioned into children&rsquo;s toys. They can be shaped as bracelets, rings, crowns, balls, trucks, or whatever anyone fancies or is able to do through folding or cutting. In Bulacan, the practice of leaf plaiting is called <b>puni</b>. Using fresh coconut leaves and dried colored buri leaves, plaiting involves the process of weaving the leaf strands into toys and decorations designed as birds, stars, fish, balls, hats, and play swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The harvest festival of the <b><i>Pahiyas</i></b>, held on 15 May in Quezon province, has as its particular feature the decoration of the outer walls of the houses. The word <b>pahiyas </b>is associated with the general Tagalog word &ldquo;<i>hiyas</i>,&rdquo; which means gem, jewel, or adornment. Its closest vernacular counterpart among the Lukbanin is <i>payas</i>, which refers to decoration. What primarily distinguishes the Pahiyas from other practices of the San Isidro tradition is the use of <b>kiping</b> (variously colored leaf-shaped rice wafers) as staple decorative material. Kiping are molded from leaves of <b>kabal</b><i> </i>(Fagrearacemosa), a plant endemic to Lucban. Kiping are thin, translucent wafers made from rice flour and molded in large leaves and dyed with different colors. The traditional colors used for the kiping are red, green, yellow, and vivid pink. However, with the availability of diversity of choices in commercial food color, other hues such as blue, violet, orange, and white have been used for the kiping. Together with artistic compositions of fruits, bamboo branches, anahaw and coconut leaves, and products of the town, such as <b>buntal </b>hats and <i>bakya </i>or wooden slippers, kiping brighten the fiesta with their vivid hues arranged in rows or as <b>arangya </b>or chandeliers, flowers, wall covers, and hanging mobiles. Since they are made of rice flour, they can later be fried to make a crisp delicacy. Likewise, at the windows of the houses are hung glazed bread molded in the form of fish, horses, and other animals, along with strings of <i>pastillas </i>or milk candy and other sweets which are thrown down to the crowds when the <b>andas </b>(portable platform) of San Isidro passes the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In May, coconut fronds are also used to decorate the kubol<b> </b>carried by four persons to &ldquo;house&rdquo; the muses and queens of the Santacruzan procession. In Pulilan, Bulacan, on 15 May, coconut and palm leaves decorate the carabaos that kneel before the church and the carts that they pull behind them. Coconut fronds also decorate the many stages erected for performances of the <i>komedya </i>or the <i>sarsuwela.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On Christmas, coconut fronds, anahaw, and flowers may decorate the houses where the <i>panunuluyan </i>procession may stop. The same leaves are combined with cloths of many colors to decorate the stage of the <b><i>TatlongHari</i></b> play in Gasan, Marinduque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For fiestas, coconut and anahaw leaves are used to decorate the church and altar, the <b>arco </b>(arches) erected at strategic points where the procession of the patron saint will pass, the kubol where the <i>loa </i>or poem of praise will be declaimed for the patron saint, and the stage on which the play or variety show is to be performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The works of contemporary artists such as RobertoVillanueva, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a>, and SantiagoBose make much use of leaves to convey ecological meanings. Leaf art also signifies a grassroots cultural context different from urban ways of thinking. Many other artists have experimented on expressive possibilities of leaf and its transitoriness, thus adding popular expression to the repertoire of the professional artist. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Mat weaving</b> is the art of weaving or plaiting strips of organic fibers into mats. All regions of the Philippines have a tradition of mat weaving since mats are used all over the country as bedding material. Because mats are made from organic materials, they are cool and suitable to the hot tropical climate. They make an ecologically healthy, light, and portable sleeping surface on the slatted bamboo floors of the native huts or the wooden floors of modern houses of the large majority of Filipinos. Unlike fixed beds, they are also space savers because they are easily rolled up and stacked in a corner after use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most Philippine mats are made of the leaves of pandan or the buri palm, plaited to create a continuous surface. They are often decorated with strips of one or two colors, creating simple linear patterns. Mats from Capiz and Aklan are simple and delicate, with geometric designs on borders; those from Laguna are plain and softly brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mat weaving is women&rsquo;s work. It begins with the gathering of the raw material from plants, after which it is stripped, boiled, dyed, and woven&mdash;the whole process taking several weeks. The quality of a mat is judged from the softness of its material, the fineness of its weave, and the beauty of its design patterns. Because mat weaving in some areas has reached the level of an art, mats do not only serve the function of bedding material but are also sometimes used as medium of exchange in barter. Beautiful mats are especially fashioned for wedding rituals, and in festive occasions they may be used as carpets. Southern weavers also make them in smaller sizes to be used as prayer mats or as household decorations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nowadays, mats are easily bought from native stores or from itinerant woman vendors, but in the 19th century and in the early decades of the 20th century, mats were made-to-order by families and individuals to be given as gifts and to commemorate special occasions, such as weddings, wedding anniversaries, and birthdays. These commemorative mats often bore the letters &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Souvenir,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alaala&rdquo; (all meaning, remembrance), and &ldquo;Mr and Mrs&rdquo; or the name of the family or individual emblazoned along its length bordered with floral or geometric designs. Double mats made of two mats joined together, the ornamented one on top and the plain one serving as lining, are the more durable and more expensive kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Sulu, particularly in the small island of Laminusa off the coast of Siasi, the women of the Samal group weave colorful mats with intricate geometric designs requiring the utmost skill and artistry. These famous Laminusa mats made of pandanus fibers are distinguished by their exceptional pliability, exquisite fineness, and remarkable smoothness and sheen. So soft and pliable are they that they crumple without creasing and are thus often mistaken for woven cloth. Ornamentals like tapestries serve as beautiful wall decors. As two-dimensional art made of plaited organic fibers, they rival the op art canvases because of their recurring colorful geometric patterns. Laminusa mats are usually backed with a thicker, plain mat. An outstanding mat weaver is MaluyLasaSambolani, 1990 Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another center of mat weaving is the town of Basey, Samar, 40 km from Tacloban, Leyte. The Basey mat is made of two organic materials, the sedges of the <b>tikog </b>(from the family of <i>Fimbrylisglobulosa</i>) and <b>buri</b> of the Palmae family. After harvesting the tikog plant, the sedges are sun-dried moderately, then dyed. After dyeing, they are laid out in the open air overnight&mdash;<b>pinapahamogan</b><i>&mdash;</i>to make them more pliable. The final process in the preparation of the tikog for weaving is called the <b>paglagot</b><i> </i>in which a 10.16 cm bamboo sliver called <b>lag-ot</b> is used to polish the sedges; this done, the sedges are gathered into bundles of 200, a family-size mat measuring 2 m x 1.6 m using up four bundles. This takes a maximum of two and a half days weaving time, usually with two weavers working on opposite sides until they meet at the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The natural color of the woven tikog mats serve as the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; background for the process of decorating the mat called <b>embroidery</b>. Strips of the buri palm are used for ornamentation. They are soaked in commercial dyes sold in small packages of five grams. The preferred colors are usually green, red, yellow, various shades of pink, and yellow green. When preparing the dyes, the amount of water determines the strength of the color; likewise, dyes may be mixed&mdash;such as green and yellow&mdash;to produce a desired hue. In order to create the figurative designs, a skilled designer makes an outline drawing on the mat with chalk or crayon. The embroiderer, again usually a woman, inserts the buri strips following the design and uses a household knife to cut them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Existing literature on Basey mat-weaving in the late 1970s reveals that the more popular designs were the <i>waling-waling</i> flower, maps of the Philippines, map of Leyte and Samar, and birds such as peacocks. In the 1990s, the popular designs bore the images of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, the San Juanico Bridge, and flowers. The inclusion of images of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o and the San Juanico Bridge comes from the grassroots, as both symbols are popular in the region and register readily with Samar and Leyte locals&rsquo; shared experiences. The Santo Ni&ntilde;o icon is highly regarded not just in Tacloban City, where these mats are usually exhibited or sold, but also in Cebu and other Visayan areas. In the past, the <b><i>Balyuan Festival</i></b> was celebrated to commemorate the exchange of Santo Ni&ntilde;o images between Tacloban and Basey. The San Juanico Bridge, meanwhile, plays a vital role in the lives of the people of the region as it connects the two large islands of Samar and Leyte. Basey is probably the nearest Samar town after traversing the bridge from Tacloban City. The waling-waling design, like those of maps, birds, and other flowers, were borrowed, if they were not imagined or invented by mat weavers, to suit popular tastes. Floral designs are said to have originated from the front covers of mass-produced notepads during the 1990s featuring plants grown on Western soil, indicating the appropriation of images from popular culture. The combination of traditional weaving with changing popular motifs indicates the process of transformation of Basey mats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After Benigno Aquino Jr&rsquo;s assassination in 1983, his portrait became a popular design among the embroiderers. There was a considerable demand for this design, which was followed by orders for portraits of other people, famous figures, and middle-class individuals who commissioned their portraits and those of their family and friends. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> particular type that gained popularity was the portrait of newlyweds who submit their photographs for copying on the unique medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From these developments, it is clear that the Basey mats no longer function solely as bedding material but have assumed the function of paintings as well. The mat with the San Juanico Bridge becomes a landscape to be admired, that with the Santo Ni&ntilde;o assumes the function of an altar painting for devotions, while portraits serve as reminders of people as well as status symbols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It then follows that the sizes of mats have become more varied, from the standard single or double sleeping mats to smaller mats for portraits and decorative designs, such as flowers. To complete the process, the mats are framed with bamboo and hung like paintings to be appreciated on the walls. Likewise, the mat weavers and the embroiderers have become mutually independent, with the embroiderers simply buying finished mats from the market for them to design. The function of the decorative mats has even broadened to include material for bags and pillow covers, so that the Basey mat has now set its mark on interior design although on a still limited scale. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

Before the coming of the Spaniards, the Filipinos already made small brass canons mounted on a swivel called the <b>lantaka</b>.<i> </i>Panday Pira was widely known as a blacksmith who cast the canons for the pre-Spanish fort of Manila. Part of weaponry are shields and helmets of different materials, shapes, and designs, as well as scabbards for blades, sheaths for spears and daggers, and quivers for arrows. Ornamentation in different techniques is applied to handles and hilts, such as silver and gold inlay, wood carving, carabao horn, bone or ivory&mdash;their handles recurved and weighted to balance the heavy blades. More often, however, handles are made of wood bound with abaca twine to give a firm grip.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Brass casting in the Philippines before the 15th century supposedly began in Sulu. The earliest brassware were cast in Blaan, about 16 km from the town of Jolo. These consisted of kettles, betel-nut containers, <b>bayuhan mama</b><i> </i>(portable mortar and pestle for betel nut), <b>kris</b> and <b>barong</b> handles, gongs, <b>kulintang</b>, and saddle footrests. The Tausug of Sulu specialized in the <b>engraving</b> and <b>inlay methods.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sulu blades, which have been compared with the famed blades of Damascus, are among the finest in workmanship and design. Their excellent weaponry was an important factor in enabling the Tausug to successfully repel Spanish encroachment. Among the Muslims of Mindanao, the generic term for all types of blade weapons is <b>padang</b><i> </i>or <b>parang</b>;<i> </i>these include the kris,<b> </b>barong,<b> kampilan</b>, and <b>tabas</b><i>. </i>Among a number of traditional communities, weapons are part of the male attire, especially in warrior societies. The traditional Tausug costume includes a bladed weapon, either the kris or the barong, worn at the waist.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The making of the kris belongs to the Southeast Asian cultural tradition. It begins with a religious ritual involving Islamic prayers and the sacrifice of a fowl within a sacred site. There are two kinds of kris: the wavy <b>kalisseko</b><i> </i>and the straight <b>kalis tulid</b><i> </i>or <b>sundang</b>, both double-edged. The wavy bladed kris echoes the S-form of the <b>naga</b><i> </i>or serpent, and its base or guard piece and handle may be decorated with elaborate <b>okir</b><i> </i>designs. The precious metals and intricate ornamentations on its handle are usually indicative of the rank of the bearer. A kris can be longer than 75 cm or more, and may sport a wooden scabbard with silver inlay and ornate, fine carvings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The barong, a relatively short knife with a single cutting edge, is recognized by its leaf-shaped blade that ends in a sharp point. Its dull broad back is generally straight in comparison to the razor sharp curving edge or belly. The hilt of the barong can also be richly ornamented, although it is often of wood polished to a high sheen. Efficient for close combat, it was often carried by public officials. The Sama of Cagayan de Sulu have a similar weapon called the <b>badi</b>, which is sometimes ornamented with inlaid bronze particles throughout the length of the blade.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kampilan is another Tausug weapon. Made for cutting, it sports a long and heavy, single-edged blade that gradually widens from the narrow hilt to the larger distal end or tip, which features a small and sharp curved spike. Its spiked tip may be decorated with delicate lacelike motifs. It is sometimes ornamented with horsehair at the sides of the handle, which flares out into a V-shape like the gaping jaw of a crocodile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Lanao the center of brass casting is in Tugaya, along the coast of Lake Lanao, 27 km from Marawi City. For centuries the Maranao have continued the ancient <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>n method of brass casting using the <b>lost-wax process</b>. In the barrios of Ingud, Sugud, and Bulong, the famous Maranao brassware are cast using native materials, like almaciga. A noted brass caster from Tugaya is RasidLaidon, 1990 Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art of making the brass mold was modified in Lanao. The difficulty of engraving the design in the beginning prompted the Maranao to use the <b>strip method</b> of doing the typical Maranao okir design. Paraffin mixed with almaciga and beeswax, in equal proportions, was used. The flat sheet wax was cut into small spaghetti strips. The wax was laid alongside the form to create a series of okir designs, such as the <b>alukaluk</b>, <b>matiburon</b> (round), <b>lapis</b><i> </i>(double bar), and <b>unsod</b> (zigzag). The strip method made possible the speedy production of the design on the wax mold. At the same time, it became a characteristic of Maranao design distinct from that of Sulu and Borneo. The strip technique today is a highly developed method that continues to be the hallmark of Maranao-produced brassware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Maranao still use the wooden bellows of the early blacksmith and the method of putting the locally made crucibles in a pit on top of one another. For Maranao brass casting, different materials are used for the wax mold and the incasement layers, as well as for the preparation of the mold. For the wax mold, the following materials are needed: <b>tiguis </b>or almaciga powder, paraffin or candles, <b>lumbang</b><i> </i>or coconut oil, <b>taro</b><i> </i>or beeswax. For the incasement layers, the first layer needs equal portions of finely ground bamboo charcoal and fine, muddy soil. The second layer needs three parts <b>putud</b> or sandy soil and one part muddy soil. For preparing the wax mold, the following materials are needed: a wooden pattern or model, 7.5 cm thick baseboard, a <b>kawa</b><i> </i>or large pan of lukewarm water, rolling pin, two soldering rods with flat and pointed tips, a steel ruler and a knife for cutting wax strips, abaca fibers for applying lines on wax mold, banana leaves coated with coconut oil to be laid under the wax during stripping, and kerosene for softening wax strips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The lost-wax process is used, in which molten brass is poured into the molds in place of the melted wax. When the molds have hardened after sun-drying for three days, the molds are then broken open. The strip technique is used to create designs on the wax. Bigger and more elaborate pieces are molded and cast by parts. They are assembled by riveting parts with copper or brass rods. For polishing and finishing touches, there are specialists in engraving, copper or silver inlay, and polishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maranao brassware are of many traditional shapes. Large and elaborate decorative vessels, often decorated with inlay are the <b>niana</b>,<b> langguay</b>,<b> baong</b>,<b> kabo</b>,<b> panalogadan</b>,<b> garul</b>,<b> </b>and<b> gadur</b><i>&mdash;</i>which often form part of the wedding dowry. These usually have a base, a rounded body, and a dome-like cover with high finials like a turret. Like the <b>sarimanok</b> (legendary bird),<i> </i>which can also be cast in brass, these are more status symbols than functional objects. Modern interpretations have also been done of the sarimanok, which is an important cultural symbol. For domestic use, there are the <b>kendi </b>(kettle), <b>batidor</b><i> </i>(ewer), <b>dudalo </b>(bowl), <b>sakdo</b><i> </i>(ladle), <b>lutuan</b>,<b> lutugan</b>,<b> karanda</b>, and <b>bintang</b><i> </i>for holding food. There are the musical instruments, such as the <b>kulintang</b>,<b> </b>the<b> gandingan</b>,<b> </b>and the large gongs called<b> agong</b>.<i> </i>Brass casting also produces the <b>lantaka</b> or native canon, as well as handles for various weapons, such as the kris and the barong. Besides the lantaka, canons included those of larger bore. A small canon, called <b>verso</b>, was used for fireworks that attended ceremonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cotabato, a province adjacent to Lanao, also engages in brass casting, with the low beautifully hand-engraved garul as its specialty. Cotabato brassware presently done by the Ilanun ranks second to the Maranao; before 1940 it was the Tausug of Sulu who ranked first. Brassware can be revived in Jolo island and in Siasi, Simunul, Bongao, and Sibutu islands where there are excellent craftsmen, along with the Sama and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>, the boat makers and carvers of Sulu, and some Tausug. A common problem is the increasing difficulty in obtaining charcoal and firewood for fuel; this can be solved by the construction of communal gas or diesel kilns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Betel-nut containers, which may be made in metal, bamboo, and other material for the betel chew, are commonly found among Philippine groups. Most Philippine groups in all parts of the country have a betel-chewing tradition, and epics mention the offering of <i>buyo </i>or betel quid to guests as a social ritual. <i>Apog </i>or burnt shell lime is combined with leaves of the betel, <i>ikmo </i>or pepper vine, the kernel of the <i>bunga </i>or areca nut, and a tobacco leaf as a stimulant that produces the characteristic red-orange expectoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many Mindanao groups make metal betel-chew boxes for carrying lime. Done in<i> </i>the lost-wax process of metal casting, they are found in various sizes and shapes: rectangular, square, round, or octagonal. An occasional betel-nut box may be shaped like a crescent to follow the curve of the waist where it is attached to the belt. Some of these include as appendage a small mortar for pounding the areca nut. Made of brass, they can vary in hue because of their metal alloy. Their most common form of ornament is silver and copper inlay in geometric designs; sometimes curlicued metal decorations are soldered to the box. Since they are often carried by a person, they may be hung by a chain or a beaded cloth strap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tboli metalcraft is among the most notable in Mindanao. According to legend, Tboli brass jewelries and implements are the gifts of Ginton, the god of metalworking and Diwata&rsquo;s son. To please the gods, women wear brass finery in the form of multiple earrings, bracelets, anklets, belts, and necklaces laden with countless tiny bells. So important are these personal ornaments to the Tboli that the necklace called <b>lieghenumbo</b> was traditionally worth one horse. Small figurines in the image of a Tboli man and woman in their traditional attire and scenes of everyday life have been popular themes as souvenir goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tboli have their own vocabulary to refer to the types of metal they use: <b>balatok</b><i> </i>for tempered steel, <b>silod</b><i> </i>for reddish copper, <b>blouon</b><i> </i>for brass-bronze, <b>tambaga</b><i> </i>for gold, <b>futi</b><i> </i>for silver, and <b>tambla</b> for silver alloy. Outstanding examples are the balatok sword incised with geometric patterns and inlaid with brass and copper; women&rsquo;s anklets and toe rings; chain-mail girdles made link by link and decorated with hawk-bell buckles; the sword hilt; and from the late 1960s, figurines for the tourist trade. Except for the sword, most other Tboli metalcraft use the lost-wax casting method (<b>cireperdue</b>), which allows for intricacy of design (Casal 1977, 455-60). In this method, the object is first modeled in wax made out of a doughlike combination of beeswax, tree resin, paraffin, and petroleum. For embellishment, brass workers use wax rolled into thin filaments, which are pressed onto the model according to the desired design. When the wax model is finished, it is entirely covered with powdered charcoal up to half an inch thick, followed by another layer composed of a mixture of charcoal, clay, and grog (filling material) up to two inches thick. This is then set out in the sun to dry thoroughly after which the model is fired in an oven in order to melt the wax, which is drained away. The mold is now ready to use. To melt the brass, the metal is placed in a crucible, which is heated in another oven with bellows traditionally made of bamboo. The oven is initially fuelled with dried grass, then charcoal made from wood or bamboo. Tboli brass casters have been known to recycle metal objects, such as old faucets, in order to create their intricate artworks. When the brass has melted, the crucible is removed and, with the use of bamboo tongs, its molten contents are poured into the mold. After the brass has somewhat cooled, the mold is broken. The finished work is then cleaned and polished with further embellishments, such as added inlays of copper and silver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cordillera groups, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> and the Kalinga, have also developed a formidable arsenal under conditions of tribal warfare. Their earliest weapons were bamboo shields, lances, and stakes planted on the grassy trails, while bows and arrows were rarely used. They later fashioned iron weapons like spears, bolos, and head axes. As a weapon used in head-hunting expeditions, the technology of the head ax was highly developed among the Bontoc, Kalinga, and Isneg tribes. The Kalinga head ax, with its blade featuring an acutely curved edge and long extended spur, has been described as graceful in comparison with the heavier, straight blade of the Bontoc ax. It may have a long wooden handle with incised designs. However, with head-hunting now an obsolete practice, the more commonly used weapon of the Ifugao is the spear, which is used in warfare and in ritual dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For hunting, the Aeta use the blowgun with pointed and iron-tipped arrows while the Batak of Palawan use bows and arrows. The bolo has its many variations among the different ethnic groups. The Ilongot of Nueva Vizcaya have a blade with a curving end and wooden sheath decorated with woven rattan strips. The Yakan of Basilan sport a blade with a more pronounced curve in contrast to the Yakan bolo, which has a straight back and a softly tapering belly. Its brass handle with a narrow grip features incised designs ending in a flourish of small brass chains like tassels. At the turn of the century, the lowland bolo was used as a bayonet as its handle could fit into a Springfield or Garand rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A characteristic bladed weapon of the Tagalog Batangue&ntilde;o is the <b>balisong</b>, the fan knife made in Batangas. The art of balisong making goes back to the American period and has since then been the main occupation of the barrios of Balisong and Bule in Taal, Batangas. Based on the Japanese fan knife, the two-piece handle conceals the blade, but when opened, the fans on both sides lock together to give a firm grip for the projecting blade. It is both a folk art and a product of local technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The balisong is made from machine and automobile spare parts. The hardest and most durable blades are made from the ball bearing, particularly the two concentric rings of metal that hold a number of balls running within the grooves. Blades of lesser quality are made from the <b>muelle</b> (coiled springs). The best native balisong is <i>pasadya </i>or made-to-order with personalized attention given to the customer&rsquo;s specification of material, size, and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The balisong is produced in three basic varieties: the <b>de buyod</b>, characterized by a<i> </i>fine ridge running down the center of the double-bladed weapon; the <b>dahong palay</b>, simple in shape and single bladed with straight back but its cutting edge sharp as a razor; and the <b>hinuhustare</b>, inspired by the shape of a gamecock&rsquo;s <i>tare </i>or spur. Design elements are found on the handle made of deerhorn, which has a natural design of etched brown lines on a cream-colored ground or of carabao horn polished to an ebony black with nailheads of aluminum and copper forming a design (Casi&ntilde;o 1987; Dacanay 1987; Guillermo 1982; Majul 1987).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish period, bells, cannons, and statuary of bronze or brass were cast. By far the most common casted pieces were bells of various sizes and weights. Bells were an important feature of colonial life. Hung from towers or from wooden scaffolds, they summoned the Christians to prayer and tolled the changing phases of a person&rsquo;s life. Early bells tended to have a longer body and a narrower lip and were almost cylindrical in shape, while bells of the late to the 19th century tapered outward more gracefully. Early bells were probably cast in military foundries while 19th-century bells often had the name of the bell caster affixed to its body. Benito de los Reyes was a bell caster active in the first part of the 19th century. The most prolific was Hilarion Sunico whose foundry began operations in San Nicolas in Manila in 1870. Juan Reina was Sunico&rsquo;s counterpart in Iloilo; in 1878 he casted what is regarded as the country&rsquo;s largest bell for the churchofPan-ay in Capiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were at least four kinds of bells. The large <b>campana</b><i> </i>was hung from a beam and was rung by pulling the clapper against the mouth of the bell. The slightly smaller <b>esquila </b>was rotated, propelled by a heavy wooden yoke attached to the bell&rsquo;s head, which acted as a counterweight. A <b>campanilla</b><i> </i>or handbell was rung by an assistant during consecration and other rituals. A series of small bells attached to a wheel was known as the <b>rueda</b>, heard on festive occasions, like Easter and Christmas, or for the communion during the Mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Brass casting is also used for making medals and <b>anting-anting</b><i> </i>(talismans) by artisans in  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong> and Batangas. Medals were traditionally engraved with religious images of Christ or the saints, or with nonreligious emblems, most notably by CrispuloZamora. AnastacioCaedo and his son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\"><strong>Florante</strong></a> were among the famous casters of the metal; later they developed and popularized &ldquo;<b>cold casting</b>,&rdquo; in which copper, tin, zinc, and other &ldquo;soft&rdquo; metals are continuously beaten without preheating and reheating. As anting-anting are objects believed to protect their owners from harm, they are also considered the precursor of modern-day scapulars and other religious items worn by the faithful. Examples include the brass figurine of Santiago Apostol, believed to give courage to its bearer; the octagonal-shaped medals engraved with religious figures to prevent untoward incidents; variously shaped and incised sacred charms to keep a person from <i>kulam </i>or hex, rape, and other harm; or a corn amulet kept in the safe for wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish period, casting was rarely used for statues and sculpture. An example of a cast image is that of Carlos IV, done in 1824, by the mestizo Ambrosio Casas whose daughter married the painter DamianDomingo. Casted sculpture enjoyed prominence during the American period because of GuillermoTolentino, whose <b><i>BonifacioMonument </i></b>is considered a masterpiece. Classicist in style, the group sculpture depicts scenes that led to the Philippine Revolution of 1896. Casting is often used for public sculpture, as seen in the different monuments found throughout the Philippines. Among the artists who have used casting for sculpture are AbdulmariImao, whose abstract renditions of the sarimanok are famous, and National Artist NapoleonV.Abueva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Goldsmithing and Silversmithing</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Goldsmithing</b> and <b>silversmithing</b> are the processes of making objects, usually personal or prestige ornaments, from gold and silver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jewelry, mostly of gold, constitutes some of the most important Philippine artifacts found in ancient grave sites, especially in Butuan and Samar, in association with human fossils and grave furniture. Gold from local deposits was worked into combs, hairpins, earrings, weapon handles, chains, breast plates, headgear, eye masks for the dead, and images of <b>anito</b> or <b>likha</b><i>. </i>Ancient Philippine gold was classified into grades depending on purity. Early jewelry functioned as amulets and charms before they were used as body ornaments. In the images of precolonial Filipinos in the <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b>, 1595, elaborate chain-like gold necklaces adorn the figures of the &ldquo;Naturales Tagalogs,&rdquo; suggesting the ubiquity of gold as part of everyday life. Later on, the Spanish colonizers would introduce the valuation and valorization of gold as precious metal and as currency of the empire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Articles made of silver during the colonial period may be divided into <b>ecclesiastical</b> or <b>sanctuary silver</b> for church use, and <b>domestic silver</b> for household use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Church inventories of objects in precious metal, classified as <b>alhajas</b>, divided these under three categories: <b>alhajas de oro </b>(gold), <b>alhajas de plata </b>(silver), and <b>alhajas de cobre </b>(copper). Under the first category were either pure gold or gold plated ornaments. Silver was the usual material that was plated. By church law, the vessels that held the consecrated host and wine had to be at least gold plated. Considered the most precious of all the church appurtenances were the <b>caliz y patena</b> (chance and paten), <b>copon</b> (ciborium), and <b>custodia</b> (monstrance). Also considered precious was the<b> pyz</b>, a small footless container used for bringing hosts to the sick (Tinio 1982; Jose 1991, 175-8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although they could also be of gold or lesser metals, like copper or bronze, more often than not the appurtenances were of silver. Among these were the <b>incensario</b> (censer) and its corresponding <b>naveta </b>(incense boat or container), which were used for benediction and High Mass. The <b>acetre</b><i> </i>(holy water bucket), <b>aspergillum</b><i> </i>(an instrument for sprinkling holy water), <b>palmatorio</b><i> </i>(a candleholder with a handle used for communion), and <b>portapaz</b><i> </i>(chased silver pieces used for the kiss of peace of the Mass) were other objects usually listed under the category silver. Silver could also be used for communion plates, cruets for holding wine and water, and containers for the sacred oil usually marked with O.I. (<i>Oleum Infirmorum</i>) or oil of the sick, S.C. (<i>Sanctum Chrisma</i>) or sacred chrism, and O.C. (<i>Oleum Catechumenorum</i>) or oil of the catechumens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On special occasions, altars were decorated with silver <b>frontales</b><i> </i>or board facades&mdash;specifically, a large rectangular frontal for the main altar and a smaller frontal for the side table flanking the main altar. Also customarily used for special occasions were the <b>credenzas</b><i> </i>(boxlike tables on each side of the altar),<i> </i><b>sacra</b><i> </i>(at the center containing prayers of the offertory and canon as well as cards with the texts of the mass), <b>lavavo</b> (card on the epistle side), <b>evangelio</b> (card on the gospel side beginning with the Gospel of St. John), <b>relicario</b><i> </i>(reliquary), <b>candeleros</b> (candlesticks), <b>ramilletes</b><i> </i>(stylized bouquets of flowers or fruits), <b>gradas</b><i> </i>and <b>gradillas</b><i> </i>(steplike ornaments on which the candelero and relicario were displayed), and <b>sagrario</b> (tabernacle) with a silver crucifix and a silver bookstand for the missal. For processions, <b>ciriales</b><i> </i>were carried by the sacristans; this was a set consisting of a processional cross and two candlesticks on long poles, which could be of silver. A <b>guion </b>or <b>agnus dei</b><i> </i>was a processional standard consisting of a quadrilateral wooden panel depicting the Lamb of God with silver ornaments and mounted on a long pole; used for the processions of the Eucharist, it preceded the priest bearing the monstrance. To be distinguished from the guion is the <b>estandarte</b>, an embroidered and painted silk banner depicting saints and holy subjects, carried on a T-shaped pole; the pole could be of silver, while the banner could be embellished with threads of silver and gold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A sanctuary lamp with its silver chains was placed in front of the tabernacle. Giant candlesticks, called <b>hachas</b><i> </i>or <b>blandones</b>, were usually used around a funeral bier. Silver baptismal shells were common, and so were other silver ornaments, like clasps for vestments (Tinio 1982, 5-12; Jose 1991, 175-8).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Silver was also used for making and adorning images. The Santo Cristo del Tesoro, a crucifix venerated in the Colegio de Santa Isabel, was wrought in 1634 from gold and silver and encrusted with jewels. The image of San Pedro de Alcantara in Nagcarlan, Laguna, is of pure silver. Silver was used for the <b>aureola</b> (aureole or halo) and <b>corona</b><i> </i>(crown) of the santo. Christ&rsquo;s image had a halo consisting of three shafts of light, called <b>potencias</b>, while the Virgin Mary often wore a <b>rostrillo</b>, a halo that surrounded her <b>rostro</b><i> </i>or face (Tinio 1982, 11). Sometimes a silver <b>mandorla</b>, an almond-shaped halo, surrounded the image. This is especially true of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Crowns had various shapes. The most elaborate was the <b>corona imperial</b>,<i> </i>which consisted of a bulbous top surmounted by an orb. The simple corona or crown was a wreath with pointed finials, while the <b>diadema</b>, worn by women saints, was an arch-shaped <b>tiara</b><i> </i>that was attached over the forehead of the image. Other ornaments, called attributes, could be made of silver, like the staff of San Jose, the plume of San Juan Evangelista, the church on a book (<b><i>Civitas Dei</i></b>) of San Agustin, the palm branch of martyrs, the orb and scepter of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, the skull and cross bones at the foot of the crucifix, and the standard of the risen Christ. Images of the Virgin, like the La Naval, are commonly clothed in silver and gold. The silver vestment consists of breast plate, skirt, sleeves, belt, and cape. The crucified Christ could also wear a loincloth of silver. Silver pins could decorate otherwise plain cloth vestments. Devotees would often lavish a favorite santo with jewelry, consisting of <b>aretes</b> (earrings), <b>gargantilla</b> (choker), <b>pulseras</b> (bracelet), and <b>anillo </b>(rings). Images of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o often had silver boots or sandals. Paintings could also be sheathed in silver in the manner of Byzantine icons. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> such example is the <b><i>Virgen de Porta Vaga</i></b><i> </i>in Cavite, although the silver covering the image was stolen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early 17th century, silver was wrought by artisans from China; but by the 18th century, the technology was mastered by Filipino artisans whose vocabulary of smithing, even today, are of Chinese origin. The silversmith&rsquo;s heavy working table with numerous drawers is called <b>tokoy</b>.<i> </i>The retractable board attached to it, on which work is done, is called <b>lekyo</b>.<i> </i>The goldsmith&rsquo;s wax is <b>tsintse</b>; the wooden board on which the wax is attached is the <b>tsintsepan</b>. The silversmith&rsquo;s tool is kept in a chest called <b>tuwa</b>. The <b>tibo </b>(silver or gold bar) is cut with a <b>gintsam</b><i> </i>(cutting chisel). It is flattened on a <b>tiyain </b>(anvil) and shaped on a <b>kutyam</b> (grooved anvil for shaping round objects). The light hammer used is called <b>katoy</b>. Excess metal is cut by a <b>bandili</b><i> </i>(fine-toothed saw). The finished object is polished by a three-sided file called <b>siyato</b>. A finer file, the <b>tikat</b>, is used for smoothing the piece further; it is then decorated with a <b>toli</b>, a finishing file for engraving. All the <b>tsambwa</b><i> </i>(gold or silver shavings, chips, and dust) are collected in a <b>puntaw</b><i> </i>(dustpan) and melted for further use (Epistola 1977, 3617-23).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Silversmiths also gilded and plated their works. Works were coated with an amalgam of gold and mercury. The object was then baked; hence the name <b>dorado de fuego</b><i>. </i>Mercury evaporated during firing, and the result was a coat of great durability, lasting for centuries. In France, plated sterling silver (92.5 percent pure silver) were called vermeil. During the 18th century, this type of gilding was extensively used and was applied also to bronze, thus <b>bronze d&rsquo;oree </b>or <b>ormulo</b>. Some sections in objects were left ungilded, resisting in a pleasing combination of gold and silver surfaces. The object was referred to as parcel-gilt or gilded in parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early ecclesiastical objects were simple and relied on form and proportion for beauty. Later these could be decorated with wriggle-work engraving called <b>ysot</b>. Known as <b>buriladas</b> in Mexico, ysot designs were probably engraved by a burin called <b>pang-ysot</b>. In Pampanga, the practice of silversmithing in ecclesiastical art continues on with the tradition of <b>pukpuk</b> (hand hammering) exemplified by the work of  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>Eduardo Mutuc</strong></a></strong> </strong>, a Manlilikha ng Bayan (National Living Treasure) awardee in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the second half of the 17th century, designs were chased or ornamented by chisel and hammer. A dull point may also be used to trace a dotted outline. By the 18th century, <b>embossing</b> or creating relief by hammering in the background, <b>repousseing</b> or creating relief by hammering on the reverse side, <b>casting</b>,<b> chasing</b>,<b> </b>and <b>engraving</b> were all used. Ornamentation included strap work and repousse lozenges in 17th-century pieces; foliate forms, cherubs, and rococo scrollwork in the 18th century; and feather-like foliage and sampaguita in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The amount of ecclesiastical silver was phenomenal. To save Manila from the British, Archbishop Rojo, in 1762, raised two million pesos or one million pounds by stripping the churches in Manila of gold and silver ornaments. Not satisfied with the amount, the British sacked the San Agustin Monastery and found 6,000 pesos of silver coins and quantities of wrought silver weighing hundreds of kilos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A typical candlestick weighed about one kilogram and was made from 50 pesos in silver coins. A tabernacle needed 10 kilograms, about 500 pesos in coins. A blandon could use from 750 to 1,250 pesos in melted coins. Sanctuary lamps weighed from 10-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> kilograms. The largest were big enough to bathe in. In general, a church would spend about 5,000 pesos or 100 kilograms of silver to have a frontal, credenzas, gradas, a silver tabernacle, an average-sized sanctuary lamp, a dozen candlesticks of regular size, and a dozen ramilletes (Tinio 1982).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wealth of the Church that financed all these expenses was partly based on the patronage of the crown but to a great extent also on the galleon trade, which enriched the Church and the merchants and inhabitants of Manila. The galleon trade, which began in 1565, brought to the Philippines large amounts of Mexican silver in profits from the cargo sold in Mexico and Peru. By 1573, so great was the annual influx of Mexican silver (from three million to five million) that it created an inflationary situation in the country. An amount of this silver was melted down for domestic use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 17th century, much of domestic silverware came from Europe, but by the 18th century, native craftsmanship in silver had reached a high level of development after apprenticeship with Chinese silversmiths<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Silver had an important place in elite households. Inventories of silverware included, aside from plates, spoons, and forks, a number of <b>bernegal</b><i> </i>(lobed and scalloped bowl with two handles for drinking water), daggers and swords with silver hilts, <b>flamenquillas</b> (small platters), cruets, candlesticks with drip pans called <b>arandelas</b>, snuffing scissors called <b>espabiladeras</b>, coconut-shell cups decorated with silver, <b>aguamanil</b> (set of basin and ewer), tea sets called <b>charera</b><i> </i>or <b>tetera</b>,<b> pebetera</b><i> </i>for holding incense sticks and lighting cigars, and <b>paliteras </b>(toothpick holders). Paliteras took on fantastic shapes from silver pineapples to animals, like dogs and fish. Silver was also used for personal ornaments. Men used cloaks with decorations of silver; shoes with silver buckles; canes with silver tips; hats, like <b>salakot</b>, with silver trimmings. Women had <b>petaquillas para buyo </b>(betel-nut bags); hairpins of different sorts, such as <b>agujilla</b>,<b> pantoche</b>,<b> boradas</b>; hats with silver trimmings; <b>abaniquera</b><i> </i>or <b>porta abanico</b><i> </i>(chains for holding fans); and <b>llaveras</b><i> </i>(key chains with hooks to attach them to a skirt).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Silver also ornamented carriages, such as the <b>birlocho</b><i> </i>(barouche), &ldquo;a large carriage with a folding top and two rows of seats facing each other.&rdquo; Its body was outlined with silver, and its harness gleamed with silver plaques. By 1807 a prominent gentleman could have his horse saddle, bridle, stirrups, pistols, and saddle holsters all made of silver. In the 19th century, furniture was also ornamented with silver, such as tables with decorative metalwork, commodes with silver handles, writing tables with silver plaques, drawer pulls, keyhole shields, and frames for paintings ornamented with silver flowers (Epistola 1977; Jose 1991; Tinio 1982, 1990).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\">Tinsmithing</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">State-of-the-art <b>tinsmithing</b> is employed in crafting Philippine folk vehicles. The Hispanic calesa<i> </i>or the <b>tartanilla</b><i> </i>are horse-drawn, tin-plated carriages&mdash;painted, embellished, and engraved. Tin plates repoussed with images of flowers, vines, geometric figures, and the owner&rsquo;s name are nailed onto the carriage&rsquo;s side and back panels. Tin plates shaped like long headdresses crowned the horse&rsquo;s head and mane. Now rarely used, the calesa and tartanilla have given way to the ubiquitous jeepney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino mechanics and artisans have created unique artwork from remodeled World War II United States Army jeeps. The result is the jeepney, with a shape and design peculiarly Filipino&mdash;that is, a local pop baroque. Thus the jeepney has become a national trademark further promoted by media, advertising, and special government projects, such as ESSO Standard Eastern Inc&rsquo;s &ldquo;ESSO Motor Fiesta&rdquo; nationwide contest of jeepney drivers in 1968 and &ldquo;The Philippine Jeepney Roadshow&rdquo; organized by the Philippine Travel and Tourism Association in 1971. Moreover, VicenteManansala, AntonioAustria, CesarLegaspi, and Rock Drilon, among other contemporary painters, have immortalized it in their works. As a national icon representing Philippine culture, a jeepney made by Sarao Motors is permanently exhibited in the National Museum of Ethnology or Minpaku in Osaka, Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The jeepney&rsquo;s invention has been attributed to Clodualdo Delfin, a musician of the late 1940s and the 1950s. Leonardo Sarao, Magsikap Legaspi, and Anastacio Francisco pioneered the trade in their Las Pi&ntilde;as-Zapote shops. Their names and those of later manufactures, like Tabing, Pabling, Narding, Valenzuela, and other one-person or family enterprises, are marked on the aluminum or stainless steel sides of their vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The jeepney is both sculpture and painting. Its black-iron body is manually assembled. Many, especially those made by Atendido, are plated all over with chrome. On the hood is perched a small metal horse or several horses, perhaps a tribute to the jeepney&rsquo;s precursor, the calesa. Also fastened onto the hood are variously shaped steel bars. The grill, either a replica of an automobile or an original creation composed of red steel bars, is adorned with numerous blinking parking lights and headlights sometimes trimmed with eyelashes and eyelids. The passenger entrance is at the rear section. It is flanked by parallel bars attached to the protruding bumpers. These bars, used as handgrips and equipped with hooks for baggages, often enclose metal plates. Already decked with flashy signal lights and flapping mudguards that shield shiny hubcaps, the rear is even made more theatrical by strips of reflectorized sheets and more frills on the bumpers. Maximizing nearly all available surface space are hand-painted geometric, floral, fruit, and landscape designs as well as occasional ethnic motifs, such as the Maranao sarimanok and graffiti-like sayings, like &ldquo;God is my co-pilot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Binata pa ang driver&rdquo; (The driver is still a bachelor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>cariton</b>, a squarish homemade ice-cream cart, crafted also in the calesa tradition, has a similar pair of fancy wheels and a pair of hind legs on which to rest. Welded into the covers of the ice-cream receptacle are two or three ornaments of beaten tin or chrome shaped like flat minarets. Akin to the metal decorations of the jeepney, motifs may vary&mdash;from wings, feathers, or flower patterns&mdash;but always exuberantly curlicued. Sometimes the pattern is repeated at corners or borders of the painted cart. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\"><strong>Abdulmari Imao</strong></a>, Alice G.

These may be one or a hybrid of the following: <b>conceptual art</b>, wherein a visual artist ideates or sets up a situation, placing philosophical value in the process itself, while de-emphasizing the importance of craftsmanship in arriving at a finished art object; <b>installation art</b>, wherein objects and materials are installed individually or put together in a physical space that determines both the context and meaning-making potential of the work, also called <b>sitework</b> or site-specific work or <b>environmental art</b>, which is usually large in scale given the expanded possibilities of outdoor sites upon which an artist introduces various elements that may be found on-site or be made to relate to the setting to create a distinct environment; or <b>performance art</b>, also called <b>event</b> or <b>happening</b>, wherein artists convert their persons into art objects employing elements of motion and sound. Unlike most visual art genres that rely primarily on the element of space, <b>transmedia</b> forms also rely on the element of time. Previously referred to as &ldquo;multimedia,&rdquo; a term now more narrowly associated with digital media, some transmedia artists presently interchangeably use &ldquo;<b>mixed media</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>intermedia</b>&rdquo; to describe their work to connote the integration of form, process, and the sensory experience of art. The term is also used to challenge the idea of art production as a purely visual phenomenon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a contemporary visual art form, multimedia has its roots in the avant-garde art of European <b>Dadaists</b> and <b>Futurists </b>of the 1920s, who conjured alternative expressions to elicit hostile reaction as a rebellion against the elitism of academicart and its commodification. It was in this spirit that French painter Marcel Duchamp, as early as 1916, quit painting and began to install ready-made objects, such as the unsigned urinal, <b><i>Fountain</i></b>. Hungarian artist Lazlo Moholy-Nagy, in 1922-30, created motion sculptures as a reaction against static pictorial art. Later, sculptors incorporated visual and auditory mechanistic as well as organic elements, such as fire, smoke, steam, and ice. In the 1960s, this genre was labeled <b>Idea Art</b>, or <b>Advanced Art</b> to encompass an extraordinary variety of media aimed at rejecting all &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; or conventional qualities of established art. Such approaches were often used by international artists serving a Left-oriented, cultural-democratic movement. On the other extreme, work of this persuasion could also consist of highly individualistic performance art, such as self-amputation for the sake of proferring a type of &ldquo;anti-art art.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An example of this is Filipino artist David Cortez Medalla&rsquo;s kinetic sculpture <b><i>Cloud Canyons no. 2 a.k.a. Bubble Machines</i></b>, 1964, which was done in motorized wood and foam. It received critical recognition in the international art scene&mdash;which also gained attention for Medalla as he returned from Europe in 1970 to exhibit at the Solidaridad Galleries in Manila. He familiarized Filipino artists and audiences with the aesthetic of physical movement and temporarility. Artists who followed Medalla closely were AlanRivera and LazaroSoriano, and the writer Jun Terra. Soon after, Rivera created untitled works on untreated canvases and issued a manifesto for the <b><i>Artists in Revolt</i></b><i> </i>exhibition in the same gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the same time, the then newly inaugurated CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP) had RobertoChabet as director for visual arts. Steeped in the academics of Western avant-garde art, he launched a program of visual arts practice geared at experimentation and innovation. Chabet&rsquo;s 1970 works exemplified what he was imparting as artistic guru of the new. His situational constructions titled <b><i>Art Idea</i></b> held at the Joy Dayrit Print Shop, his <b><i>Mister Morton Schamberg or Darling Down the Drain</i></b>, and collaborative installation <b><i>Illuminations</i></b>, exhibited at the CCP Main Gallery, set the trend for the next two decades of multimedia experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a year of directorship at CCP, Chabet bequeathed his artistic credo to his successor RaymundoAlbano, and concentrated on teaching at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Albano, inspired by the American art magazine <b><i>Art Forum</i></b>, consistently encouraged multimedia work by visual artists in collaboration with poets, filmmakers, and performing artists. With motivations of sheer creative fun and placing Philippine art in the international (mostly American) art mainstream, cross- or transmedia work flourished in the local art scene. Young experimentalists aspiring for genius and the new in art were able to exhibit in the most elite museums and galleries, such as the CCP, the Museum of Philippine Art, the Luz Gallery, and Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>. Their works were variously criticized as highly original, &ldquo;copycat,&rdquo; nouvelle, gimmicky, daring, or pretentious, depending on who was viewing it. Among those who worked in this direction were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4506\"><strong>Ronnie Lazaro</strong></a>, Yoli Laudico, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3441\"><strong>Joe Bautista</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a>, GenaraBanzon, Eva Toledo, Ami Miciano, IleanaLee, Dick Daroy, FernandoModesto, Red Mansueto, Nap Jamir Jr, and Susan Aragon. They created a variety of situations and installations composed of projected images, shadows, painted acetates, rusty GI sheets, mirrors, growing mongo sprouts, live ants and termites, photocopy prints, mosquito nets, taped sounds, video images, and other cunning sensory elements. Examples of performance art then were zoom-in videotaping of an artist breathing, an artist facilitating an audience in imagining colors, Chabet tearing Duldulao&rsquo;s artbook to pieces, or two artists running nude in an exhibition opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1975, Albano submitted to the 9th International Print Biennale in Tokyo instructions for the creation of <b><i>Step on the Sand and Make Footprints</i></b><i>. </i>For this conceptual work, he was awarded the biennale&rsquo;s second prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the same period Junyee and, later, Banzon&mdash;both residents of UP Los Ba&ntilde;os&mdash;made a relevant mark in the genre of Philippine multimedia simply by working on natural materials that they gathered from their surroundings in Mount Makiling. Junyee&rsquo;s tacit manifesto for his ephemeral works declared the oneness of creating and living art, borrowing from nature, and returning to it what one has taken. He created siteworks, installation, and sculpture with the use of pods, vines, leaves, seeds, soil, and other natural discards. Banzon, aside from installations, crafted natural debris into works on paper. Banzon&rsquo;s and Junyee&rsquo;s works stirred great interest in the use of indigenous materials in the fine arts. SantiagoBose, who worked closely with the Los Ba&ntilde;os sitework artists, also did installations in Baguio and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> rice terraces using ferns, bamboo poles, and running water, incorporating the indigenous with high tech, such as polaroids and earphones, and in integrating art with community services, such as irrigation and weaving. In the 1980s, multimedia work became popular practice among the artists who were regular habitues of Penguin Cafe and, later,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></a></strong> Art Galleries, among them Rivera, CesareSyjuco, JeanMarieSyjuco, Judy Sibayan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3439\"><strong>Huge Bartolome</strong></a>, Teresa Bargielska, AugustoAlbor, and others earlier mentioned, who interacted with members of the PhilippineLiteraryArtsCouncil. They created highly intellectualized and esoteric poem paintings, holographs, and multimedia situations that employed multidimensional and performative elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade of the 1980s concluded with artists searching for indigenous roots and social relevance, as reflected in the works of Bose, RobertoVillanueva, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3405\"><strong>Rene Aquitania</strong></a>, Pepito Bosch, LaniMaestro, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a>, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maestro&rsquo;s <b><i>Suspended Voices</i></b>, 1987, an installation at the CCP small gallery, paid homage to the martyrs of the Marcos regime. On scrolls of tracing paper that covered the walls of the gallery, she wrote in silver pen all the names of the &ldquo;salvaged&rdquo; and the &ldquo;disappeared.&rdquo; Several rows of lighted candles and generous scatterings of kalachuchi flowers completed the eerie atmosphere in silent pain. Now based in France, she continues to make much subtler political statements in her multimedia works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Syjuco created a series of theatrical multimedia work on various timely themes, as in her <b><i>Mano</i></b><i>-<b>Mano </b></i>series of 1988 to 1992. Her subjects included the plight of migrant workers, mail-order brides, and the aftermath of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. These consisted mainly of collaborative installations of props, sets, light and sound, and performance. Her performances were lengthy improvisations of monologue and symbolic gestures of violence by a social victim who turned hysterical madwoman/shaman while in a trance. Pouring on herself a pail full of flour or ash, sacrificially shearing off her own hair, moaning as one who were possessed, and ending with a valedictory act of exorcism became characteristic story lines of her work. She documented her performances in video, and also experimented with sound works for radio in collaboration with other artists, such as Orville Tiamson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Villanueva&rsquo;s <b><i>UmatiBiag</i></b> (Garden of Life), 1989, at the CCP grounds was a construction of reeds, tree branches, grasses, and riverstones in the form of a circular maze. Highlighted with <b>bulul</b><i> </i>(images) and other ritual artifacts that lead to an inner sanctum as evocative of the inner self, Villanueva concluded with a collaborative dismantling performance led by Villanueva himself, the work summoning the spirituality of the northern Philippine traditional groups in a redemptive act of confronting the modern Filipino&rsquo;s labyrinth of contradictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Aquitania&rsquo;s performance at the 1988 Baguio Arts Festival, he tied himself in abaca ropes under a make-believe bridge. In wild hysteria, he thrust himself to the ground on a mound of rice husks, crushed marble, and sawdust, moaning for his lost inheritance. In 1989, he did a performance work on birthing. Suspended inside a jute sack in the likeness of a cocoon, he writhed and struggled like a baby wanting to be born, while a figure rocked him to candlelight and drumbeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Multimedia in the 1990s, in spite of its evolution from the Western avant-garde as performed by artists like Rivera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3619\"><strong>Jose Legaspi</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a>, continued to strive to gain validity as art in a Third World context. Searching for substance from native, familiar inspirations, and struggling to commune with audiences outside the periphery of academic or &ldquo;high&rdquo; art figured prominently as dual concerns of artists at that juncture. Given this desire to anchor art in metaphoric reconsideration of daily shared experience and a reconfiguring of the ordinary or commonplace, it would only be logical that the increasing role of technological mediation in everyday life would also find its place amidst the exploratory impulse of artists. Digital innovations in sound, image-making, and motion technology have thus further broadened art practices, challenging artists as they seek to activate a meaning-making environment and stir up the cognitive encounters out of the made and found materials within their reach. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong>, updated by Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251673600\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Battcock, Gregory. 1986. <em>Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology</em>.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Painting</b> is a process in which various colored pigments and dyes are suspended in a binder (like gum Arabic dissolved in water, slaked lime, linseed oil, or acrylic), resulting in a <b>medium</b>, which is then applied to a surface as a wet layer via a tool (such as a brush, palette knife, spatula, squeegee, airbrush, or fingers). When the medium dries, it leaves a permanent mark as in a figure upon that surface. Oftentimes, the surface, called the <b>ground</b>, is of a compatible substance that retains the applied medium as it adheres to it like skin. The ground is generally understood to be flat or two-dimensional, such as a wall, wood panel, paper, or piece of canvas that is stretched around a frame. However, a curved or three-dimensional ground can also be used in the case of painting done on interior vaults, and rounded objects like pottery and jewelry. This demonstrates the Filipino penchant for painting religious (and now secular) sculptures to show lifelike verisimilitude, a process called <b>encarnacion</b>. Fabric, meant to be worn and thus seen three-dimensionally in relation to its wearer&rsquo;s body and movements, can also be painted. The distribution of a figure upon a ground is premised on either a desired decorative effect multiplied upon the entire viewing surface; or the evocation of specific imagery associated with a visual convention, or <b>iconography</b> practiced by the painter&rsquo;s community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The combination of both indigenous and introduced traditions of painting has made the Philippines a rich and complex source of study in the visual arts. Traditional Western painting materials, like oil on canvas or <b>tempera</b> on panel, were rendered using local dyes and pigments, especially during the Spanish colonial period, when importation of art materials from Europe was prohibitively costly. In the contemporary period, the rediscovery of native painting traditions alongside the latest imports from abroad have also resulted in experimentations of materials, such as the use of coffee or tea staining; <b>batik tie-dye resist</b>; <b>silk-screening inks</b>; <b>mixed media</b>; and organic dyes from local flora, chief among these red from the narra tree (<i>pterocarpus indicus</i>), blue from the indigo plant (<i>indigofera hirsuta</i>), and yellow from turmeric or yellow ginger (<i>curcuma longa</i>). The use of indigenous sources for ground have also been explored, notably <b>katsa</b><i> </i>(cheesecloth), beaten tree bark, and <b>banig</b> (reed-woven) mats.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since painting often requires a visualization of forms embedded within specific stylistic conventions and subject matter, the field of painting is often subdivided into themes&mdash;primarily, <b>religious</b>,<b> historical</b>,<b> mythical-symbolic</b>,<b> portraiture</b>,<b> landscape</b>,<b> still life</b>,<b> figure genres</b>,<b> nudes</b>,<b> seascapes</b>, and various stylized <b>abstractions</b>. Painting is also subdivided into size formats, from <b>miniatures</b> (less than 10 cm across), to <b>easel paintings</b> (less than 1.5 m across), to <b>murals</b> (more than 1.5 m across).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Medium, Form, Process, and Technique </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The oldest painting medium is <b>fresco</b>. Applied directly on a wall primed with damp plaster and painted with a slaked lime formula infused with pigment, frescoes are meant to dry naturally, forming a chemical bond with the wall surface that makes it impervious to water. The traditional method of fresco in Europe is the <b>buon fresco</b> method, in which layers of lime plaster of increasing purity are lain on a brick or stone wall, then painted while the final wall layer is still damp. An adaptation of this method is the <b>a secco fresco</b><i> </i>technique, in which a layer of fresh plaster is overlain on top of the dried wall, onto which changes to the original fresco design are painted.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another traditional painting medium is <b>tempera</b>. A hard wood panel is prepared using <b>gesso</b> (a combination of rabbit skin glue, slaked lime plaster, and gum Arabic) so that it might absorb layers of paint composed of pigments mixed with egg yolk (called a <b>size</b>) suspended in water. The size and pigment combination is then applied to the ground via brushes. The flexibility of the pigment allows the painter to scrape overlain layers of tempera to expose underlying layers, creating a multiple pattern of colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Oil painting</b>, which started in Europe in the 15th century, utilizes a thicker medium of linseed oil mixed with pigment applied on linen or cotton canvas. Due to the &ldquo;fatter&rdquo; nature of oil, more pigment binds to the medium, allowing the paint to thicken to a paste. This thickness is exploited to produce textures on the paint layer, which takes a longer time to harden. This longer drying time also allows the painter to rework the paint surface via a &ldquo;wet on wet&rdquo; (called <b>alla prima</b>) technique, or a thicker buildup of paint to achieve an almost three-dimensional effect (called <b>impasto</b>) on the surface. Oil painting can also be done thinly to achieve ethereal effects. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> method employs the<b> glazing</b> technique, in which a small amount of paint is mixed with a large amount of oil, and then spread thinly on the surface, drying as a colored &ldquo;film&rdquo; on top of the paint layer. A famous technique of glazing is called <b>sfumato</b>, in which multiple layers of glaze produce a hazy effect on the background of figurative subjects. Another technique is <b>scumbling</b>, when small amounts of paint are placed on top of a dried painted surface using a dry sponge or rag. The paint is caught within the grooves of the texturized surface of the underpainting, creating &ldquo;touches&rdquo; of color that accent the overall look of the painting. Finally, there is a technique called <b>chiaroscuro</b>, where a combination of glazing and brushing produces an illusion of depth created by a combination of light and shadow. The canvas layer is prepared or primed via the use of gesso though contemporary oil painters use latex or acrylic paint to prime their canvas. After the paint layer is dried (a process that can take up to two years), the oil painting is varnished using an organic-based resonated compound like damar to protect the paint layer from damage. Accumulation of dirt in the repeated varnishing of oil paintings through the decades or centuries darkens the painting, unless restoration is done by removing the old varnish layer; and then revarnishing the painting once more. Painting tools include hand-held brushes of various sizes and shapes, a palette for mixing colors, palette knives and spatulas, a mahl stick used to support the painting hand during detailing work, and easels to prop up the painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Aquarelle</b> or <b>watercolor</b> emerged by the 18th century, and is used as a more spontaneous or informal means of painting. A mixture of gum Arabic and water is boiled, after which finely ground pigments are added and mixed using a stone grinder until a soft paste consistency is reached. Watercolor is applied using brushes on paper, using more water as a vehicle for chromatically altering the medium. Watercolors dry as translucent layers, unlike oil that dries into an opaque surface. A later industrial version of watercolor that dries opaquely was invented by the 19th century, called <b>gouache</b>. Its appearance allowed more commercial applications of painting, such as poster design, to be produced inexpensively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Acrylic</b> paint emerged in the 1930s, but wasn&rsquo;t commercially available in the Philippines until the 1960s. Acrylic uses a polymer chemical based from petroleum by-products, such as polyvinyl acetate, or other acrylic emulsion polymers. This is mixed as binder to industrial dyes to create a wide variety of acrylic colors, which are soluble in water, but have a rapid drying time. Acrylics generally dry &ldquo;matte&rdquo; (that is, appear flat on the surface with a dull finish), and thus require acrylic emulsion varnish to be applied on top to create luster. To thicken the acrylic color to a consistency similar to oil, acrylic gel or binding medium is mixed, with a higher ratio of paint to gel in order to preserve colorfastness and luminosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Genres</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine painting can be classified according to the subjects or themes it has had over the centuries: <b>religious paintings</b>, <b>historical paintings</b>, <b>portraits</b>, nudes, <b>genres</b>, <b>interiors</b>, <b>landscapes</b>, seascapes, still lifes, <b>abstract painting</b>, and <b>folk painting</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Religious painting is the oldest and longest-lasting genre category in Philippine painting. Perhaps among the earliest surviving oil painting icons is that of the <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Pe&ntilde;afrancia</i></b> in Paco, Manila, that dates back to the 1620s, and is an altarpiece painting. Statues of saints and engravings from Europe were used as models for religious paintings. It was common to portray a favorite saint complete with a wooden stand and a pair of curtains flanking it. Well into the 19th century, religious painting stressed correct iconography rather than realistic rendering of a theme. Smaller devotional icons have been painted throughout the Spanish colonial period, from the surviving icons of Manila-based Fausto Quiotan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\"><strong>Damian Domingo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3417\"><strong>Justiniano Asuncion</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\"><strong>Lorenzo Rocha</strong></a>; the mural-sized works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3501\"><strong>Jose Dans</strong></a> in Paete; and the Stations of the Cross series from anonymous artists in Bohol during the late 18th to early 19th century. By the late 19th to early 20th century, religious painters would include icon painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3771\"><strong>Juan Senson</strong></a> of Angono and Cebuano ceiling muralists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3426\"><strong>Canuto Avila</strong></a> and Raymundo Francia. Carlos Francisco and Galo Ocampo would continue the practice of depicting religious iconography in the modern period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Styles of religious painting have often been <b>iconic</b>, meaning that they follow strict Church conventions regarding form and subject matter. However, historical styles do occur throughout religious painting as a result of shifts in period tastes and fashion. The painters associated with the Gremios Chinos de Santa Cruz, such as Fausto Quiotan, adhered to a more rococo coloration of bright pastel hues mixed with Qing Dynasty Chinese infusions in motifs, like Sinicized eyes and faces. Such 19th-century icons were heavily influenced by the <b>miniaturismo</b> style of Damian Domingo, Ysidro Arceo, and Justiniano Asuncion. Modern icons, such as Carlos Francisco&rsquo;s 1957 <b><i>Stations of the Cross</i></b> murals for Far Eastern University adhered to a cinematic montage format using his trademark sinuous style inspired from <b>Art Deco</b> while Galo Ocampo&rsquo;s stained glass window designs for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>,<i> </i>1956, combined <b>Cubist</b> and <b>Revivalist Gothic</b> styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the European academies, historical paintings consisted of large-scale compositions of human figures depicting a scene from history, the Bible, Graeco-Roman scenes, or an allegory. These paintings were intended to strengthen the moral fiber of a nation; thus they often contained a lesson or praised national values, like courage, steadfastness, generosity, and patriotism. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> paintings also extolled the virtues of great persons, real or legendary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, historical<b> </b>and <b>mythical-symbolic painting </b>started in the early 19th century in the form of folk-style painting. This is best demonstrated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3823\"><strong>Esteban Villanueva</strong></a>&rsquo;s Basi Revolt<i> </i>series, 1807, and expanded more fully in the mid- to late 19th century, and the first decade of the 20th century. Historical and mythical-symbolic paintings eventually became the domain primarily of expatriate Filipino artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, and Academia painters like  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3786\"><strong>Telesforo Sucgang</strong></a></strong>. The official style of Paris&rsquo;s Ecole de Beaux-Arts, which combined <b>Neoclassicism</b>,<b> Romanticism</b>, and <b>Symbolism,</b> were used for this period, as can be seen in Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>El  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(literally &ldquo;Room of Spoils&rdquo; or basement of a Roman Coliseum),<i> </i>1884, and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2253\"><strong>El Pacto de Sangre</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Blood Compact), 1885; and Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>Per Pacem et Libertatem</i></b> (Through  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong> and Liberty), 1904 (destroyed 1945), and the undated <b><i>El Asesinato del Gobernador Bustamante y su Hijo </i></b>(The Assassination of Govenor Bustamante and Son). From the mid- to late 20th century, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\"><strong>Fernando Amorsolo</strong></a>, Carlos aka &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a>&rdquo; Francisco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\"><strong>Vicente Manansala</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3645\"><strong>Amadeo Manalad</strong></a> were prominent painters of historical scenes using various <b>Modernist </b>styles. Amorsolo used his patented <b>academic style</b> imaging brilliant sunlight and sensually depicted native subject matter, as seen in <b><i>Burning of the Idols</i></b>, 1955-60. Francisco&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipino Struggles through</i></b><i> <b>History</b></i>, 1963-67, used a fusion of <b>Mexican Social <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\"><strong>Realism</strong></a></b> with the sinuous curves and primary-secondary colors; and Manansala&rsquo;s <b><i>Planting of the First Cross</i></b>, 1965, used his <b>Synthetic Cubist</b> style of careful delineations of shard-like stained glass lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Portrait painting seeks to capture the basic physical likeness of the subject and to show insight into his/her essential character or psychological makeup. From earliest times portraits have fulfilled different functions: as a record of a person&rsquo;s physical appearance, as a souvenir of a loved one or an ancestor, as a status symbol, as a model image of a leader or prominent social personality for public edification. Before the advent of photography, the portrait fulfilled the camera&rsquo;s function of recording and preserving a person&rsquo;s physical likeness, but portraiture as an art has always transcended mere likeness and showed artistic insight into the subject&rsquo;s personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 19th century, portrait painting emerged in the Philippines. The works of Damian Domingo ushered in the miniaturismo<b> </b>(miniaturism) style. Miniaturismo<i> </i>is a term applied to the technique of &ldquo;<b>limning</b>&rdquo; used by 19th-century artists, in which a very fine brush was used for outlining and bringing out minute details. The artist demonstrated his skill in sharply rendering the details of costume-intricate embroidery on fine transparent cloth, jewelry, and personal accessories, like the fan and handkerchief. Work done by Domingo on ivory locket-sized portrait paintings later expanded into easel-sized works, with detailed rendering of the rich embroidery, jewelry, and furnishings of newly rich principalia families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the secularization of art in 19th-century Philippines, portraits as a separate genre appeared, although for some time the only portraits made were of Spanish officials and church dignitaries, such as those done by JuanArceo. The opening of the Philippines to international trade in the mid-19th century and the development of export-crop agriculture resulted in the rise of a local merchant class, afforded with social and educational advancement, who were called <i>ilustrado</i>. This emergent class commissioned portraits to celebrate its social ascendency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Well-known portraitists found patrons among the elite not only in Manila but in the provinces as well. Their painstaking recording of material detail answered the elite&rsquo;s desire to display its status. Among these artists were Simon<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> y de la Rosa who spent his years in Pampanga painting for churches and the rich, Justiniano Asuncion, AntonioMalantic, Isidro Arceo, and Dionisio de Castro. Masterpieces of 19th-century portraiture include Arceo&rsquo;s <b><i>Retrato de la Familia Azcarraga</i> </b>(Portrait of the Azcarraga Family), 1824; Flores&rsquo;s portrait of the <b><i>FamiliaQuiason</i></b>, 1880; de Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>Soterania Puzon deQuintosyVentanilla</i></b>, 1892; Malantic&rsquo;s portraits of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Francia </i></b>and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2202\"><strong>Inocencia Francia</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1876; and Asuncion&rsquo;s <b><i>Romana<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\"><strong>Carillo</strong></a></i></b>, 1875.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, late 19th-century portraitists like Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, who won distinctions at the Madrid Exposition of 1884, used a combination of Beaux-Arts and Academic styles resulting in somber and formal depictions of personalities, like Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>Una Bulaque&ntilde;a </i></b>(Bulaque&ntilde;a Lady),<i> </i>1895; or Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>Don Felipe Agoncillo</i></b>, 1988. Sometimes, however, <b>Impressionism</b>, with its use of textured paint, bright pastel colors, and the privileging of outdoor sunlight was also used by Luna and Hidalgo for society portraiture, like Luna&rsquo;s<b> <i>Picnic at Normandy</i></b>, 1885; or Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>Portrait of Teresa Tuason</i></b>, 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American period, Amorsolo was the portraitist par excellence of public figures, American colonial officials, and prominent Filipinos who commissioned him to do their portraits. Not to be overlooked is FabiandelaRosa who did a number of outstanding portraits, among them, one of Pura Villanueva-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>w. Other notable portraitists were JorgePineda and IrineoMiranda. Examples include Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>Portrait of Jorge Vargas</i></b>,<i> </i>1943, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3373\"><strong>Martino Abellana</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Portrait of Don Ramon Aboitiz</i></b>,<i> </i>1957. Among Modernists, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\"><strong>Diosdado Lorenzo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\"><strong>Victorio Edades</strong></a> championed <b>Post-Impressionist</b> cum <b>Expressionist</b> styles that resulted in colorful, serenely depicted but brutalist portraits, such as Lorenzo&rsquo;s <b><i>Old Woman with Mortar</i></b>, 1937, or Edades&rsquo;s <b><i>Portrait of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3605\"><strong>Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1976. In the 1960s and 1970s, <b>Expressionism</b> became a major language for portraiture, with its use of exaggerated emotions, contorted poses, thickly or thinly applied paint, and agonized depictions symbolizing the alienation of modernity and the horrors of martial law. An example is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3693\"><strong>Onib Olmedo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Adele H.</i></b>, 1976; or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\"><strong>Danilo Dalena</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a></i></b>, 1983. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3554\"><strong>Romulo Galicano</strong></a> uses a postmodern combination of Amorsolo-style depiction with abstracted vertical lines, as can be seen in <b><i>Portrait of Felix Y. Manalo</i></b>, 2014. Other contemporary portraitists like Isabel Diaz also use postmodern techniques derived from Hyperrealism and American West Coast Art, like <b><i>Portrait of Frank Gehry</i></b>, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Genre painting</b>, which depicts people in everyday activities, became popular in the Philippines beginning in the 19th century. Genre in Europe flourished in Holland in the 17th century, with its lively secular <b>baroque</b>, and also in Spain where they were called <b>bodegones</b>, under such masters as Diego Velazquez. Genre is often full of movement and a sense of community life and collective activity. The changing subjects of genre reflect social and historical developments. Genre painting is perhaps the most popular and wide-ranging of Philippine painting practices. These include early examples like the anonymous (presumed to be Chinese) illustrators of the <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b>, which pioneered the <b>tipos del pais </b>(country scenes)<b> </b>format in the 1590s using a combination of Southern Ming and Spanish late medieval style painting on paper. The watercolor on paper <b>album de trajes</b> (album of costumes)<i> </i>of Damian Domingo in the Newberry Library (ca 1820s) and Justiniano Asuncion&rsquo;s own album of country types at the New York Public Library (1841) both derive similar characteristics from the <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b> in the frequent use of blank backgrounds, but this time the depictions of the tipos del pais<i> </i>are done with minute detailing and clear attempts at a more sympathetic portraiture of accurate racial and physiognomic features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">JoseLozano&rsquo;s <b>letras y figuras</b><i> </i>(letters and figures), in which the letters of the patron&rsquo;s name are spelled out by human figures, contains various tipos del pais of different classes and occupations executed in minute detail as in miniatures; an example is the work <b><i>Andres Sanchez</i></b>, 1852. Later albums of inhabitants in their costumes were done by JoseMa.Asuncion, one of the early directors of the UP School of Fine Arts. An impetus to the tipos del pais was also seen in the drawings and lithographic prints of foreign visiting artists, such as Carl Johann Karuth, C. W. Andrews, and Thomas Barker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the tipos were contextualized within the natural environment and social setting, genre painting began. The 19th-century Academia artists combined the need for accurate portrayal of people and places with a lighter, more lyrical use of lighting that can be said to be the stylistic equivalent to the <b>Romantic movement</b> in Europe. This can be seen in Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>La Banca </i></b>(The Native Boat), 1876; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\"><strong>Lorenzo Guerrero</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>El Fuego </i></b>(The Fire), 1889; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3548\"><strong>Simon Flores</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2276\"><strong>Primeras Letras</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(First Letters), 1890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Closely related to genre is the painting of domestic interiors, such as the inside of a sala or a room of a house or the hall of a building. An interior, first of all, shows the disposition of space inside a house and how it relates with the outside by means of doors and windows. Much of the interest of interiors comes from the furnishings of the house, the types of furniture, and the various ornaments within. It is obvious that an interior reveals social class in the kind of house portrayed, particularly with respect to its materials&mdash;whether strong and permanent, or light and fragile&mdash;and in its furnishings and decorations. An interior also reveals the kind of people who live in it&mdash;their interests, tastes, and temperaments. Tonal values are important in interiors because they create a dialogue between the shadowed interiors and the bright outdoors, as well as convey atmosphere and mood. Luna&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2303\"><strong>Tampuhan</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Sulking) is partly genre, partly interior, as the two personages are in the living room of a <i>bahaynabato </i>or stone house. Lozano&rsquo;s letras y figuras of <b><i>BalvinoMauricio </i></b>shows in several sections the interior of a handsome 19th-century villa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary artists who excel in interiors are Romulo Galicano and Sofronio Y. Mendoza aka SYM who both did a number in a fresh, impressionist style, capturing the grace and casualness of present-day houses with some traditional features, such as <i>capiz</i> windows, screens, and <i>gallinera</i> (long carved benches).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Genre painting grew in importance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, helped by the numerous drawings and engravings of foreign visitors such as C. W. Andrews and Joseph Anton Koch. Artists were encouraged to look around and observe the folk as they went about their daily occupations. Filipino illustrator Gabino Reyes Congson produced humorous genre images of Manila&rsquo;s street characters for the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></i></b>, from 1936 to 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Genre contributed an important self-reflective quality to Philippine art, one that raised the question of national identity in a colonial era. The rural genre paintings of Fabian de la Rosa, Fernando Amorsolo, Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, Toribio Herrera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3721\"><strong>Jorge Pineda</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3739\"><strong>Vicente Rivera</strong></a> continued the Beaux-Arts academic tradition. De la Rosa portrayed the ilustrado setting in <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Love Song),<b> </b>which shows a young woman singing, accompanied on the piano, before admiring guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The high point of genre was reached in the paintings of the Amorsolo school. Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>RicePlanting </i></b>heralded the golden age of Philippine genre. In the 1930s the dominant visual form was rural genre depicting the cycle of planting and harvesting. Based in the University of the Philippines (UP) School of Fine Arts, the Amorsolo school, which, aside from Amorsolo, included Jorge Pineda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\"><strong>Irineo Miranda</strong></a>, DominadorCasta&ntilde;eda, TeodoroBuenaventura, Toribio Herrera, and Amorsolo&rsquo;s brother Pablo, contributed significantly to the development of genre in idyllic scenes of the countryside and its people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the mid-1940s to the 1960s, the genre works of <b>conservatives</b> like Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3630\"><strong>Crispin Lopez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3555\"><strong>Miguel Galvez</strong></a>, Simon Saulog, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3678\"><strong>Oscar Navarro</strong></a> would continue the tradition of academic painting that closely followed the more formulaic renditions of Amorsolo, particularly of rural planting and harvest scenes, groups of peasants at rest or in fiesta, nipa<i> </i>huts, and seashore communities. Cesar Buenaventura and Paco Gorospe, the most dominant members of this group during its &ldquo;<b>Mabini</b>&rdquo;<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a></b>, 1955-early 1980s, however, painted in a combination of <b>Modernist impasto </b>techniques and semi-abstracted <b>Salon Cubism</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Philippine Modern Art, genre expanded in scope and stylization. Victorio Edades&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2156\"><strong>The Builders</strong></a></strong> </i></b>and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2298\"><strong>The Sketch</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1928, followed the <b>American Expressionist</b> style of The Eight. Diosdado Lorenzo&rsquo;s <b><i>Batalan</i></b> (Washing Area), 1939, adapted the Italian Machiaioli style of Post-Impressionist textures applied unto rural genre. Carlos Francisco&rsquo;s <b><i>Pista sa Nayon </i></b>(Rural Fiesta), 1946, used exuberant colors and curving compositional lines to expand the rural genre into mural form. Highly stylized is Hugo Yonzon Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Fishermen</i></b>, 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the development of <b>modernism</b> in the post-World War II years, new painters of genre, such as Manansala, Legaspi, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>taMagsaysay-Ho, RomeoTabuena, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\"><strong>Ricarte Puruganan</strong></a>, discovered many new subjects in the postwar scene, such as jeepneys, <i>barong-barong</i> or shanty, <i>sari-sari </i>or variety stores, vendors of candles, flowers, and all kinds of ware. Fiestas also became a popular genre subject, as in Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos&rsquo;s paintings. Angono-based Francisco dealt with folk traditions in ritual and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vicente Manansala&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong>Madonna of the Slums</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1950, creates cubistic shards through which figure genre became &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; but still recognizable and noble. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\"><strong>Cesar Legaspi</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2188\"><strong>Gadgets</strong></a></strong> </i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1949, combines a stylized Art Deco-inspired cubism with the newer scenery of industrial laborers that paved the way for later developments in <b>Social Realism</b>. From the late 1950s onward, the Expressionistic works of University of Santo Tomas (UST) graduates like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\"><strong>Ang Kiukok</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\"><strong>Antonio Austria</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\"><strong>Angelito Antonio</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>Norma Belleza</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3704\"><strong>Mario Parial</strong></a> depicted folk subjects like vendors and farmers. The genre works of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3451\"><strong>Jose Blanco</strong></a></strong> would initially follow in the vein of the Modern muralism of Carlos Francisco&rsquo;s work in the 1960s, but would eventually return to a more <b>Classical Realist</b> style from the 1970s to the 1990s. The genre works of Benedicto Cabrera from the 1970s onward combined his modernist gestural strokes with a <b>Photorealist</b> style that brought out the nostalgia of the past as in his Larawan (Pictures) series, 1972-98. He also focused on the form of vagrant women in his Sabel<b> </b>series, 1968-2013. Finally, the genre works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3640\"><strong>Anita Magsaysay-Ho</strong></a> from the 1950s to the 1990s followed a semi-Cubist orientation inspired from Art Deco as the artist focused almost exclusively on painting women. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\"><strong>Brenda Fajardo</strong></a> reimagined the medieval tarot cards by drawing images of precolonial Filipinos on handmade paper, including the <i>babaylan</i> (shaman priestess), to reflect on the contradictions in Philippine history and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A major development in the late 20th century is the emergence of <b>protest art</b> by Social Realists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3764\"><strong>Pablo Baens Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3577\"><strong>Renato Habulan</strong></a>, Leonilo Doloricon, Edgar Talusan Fernandez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3519\"><strong>Antipas Delotavo</strong></a>, Papo de Asis, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>. Social Realism in the Philippines encompassed various stylistic approaches, from the <b><i>Tres Grandes</i></b><i> </i>(The Big Three) inspiration of Diego Rivera in the works of Pablo Baens Santos, or David Alfaro Siquieros in the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\"><strong>Nunelucio Alvarado</strong></a>. The graphic depictions of industrial laborers, peasants, and urban workers by Leonilo Doloricon and Papo de Asis transform the German Expressionism to suit a more collective affiliation of underclass oppression; while Edgar Talusan Fernandez&rsquo;s Madonna-like depictions of <i>Inang Bayan</i> (Motherland) figures are enriched by the <b>Surrealism</b> of Salvador Dali. Antipas Delotavo&rsquo;s imagery of the urban poor and migrant laborers parallels the developments of 1970s <b>West Coast Art</b>, in its insistence on Photo-realism mixed with minimal backgrounds, while Renato Habulan&rsquo;s academic approach to depicting the rural poor is framed within the Neo-Expressionistic credo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subject matter of <b>nude painting</b> is the unclothed human figure. It has a long history in Western art starting from the Greek classical period, circa 500 BC, continuing to the Renaissance in the 15th century, unto 19th-century neoclassicism, baroque, and romanticism. With the advent of modernism, the classical canons were challenged by realism, expressionism, and subsequent styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, the nude as a subject of painting was hardly found before the 20th century. The <b>santo</b> (religious sculpture) was often clothed, although a few exceptions were the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, cherubs and angels, and depictions of Adam and Eve. The nude came to its own in the 19th century, when artists like Luna and Hidalgo, schooled in the tenets of the European academies, used the human figure as the subject of historical and mythical anecdotes. Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>La Barca de Aqueronte</i></b> (Charon&rsquo;s Boat) writhes with the nude figures of the damned. Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>Odalisque </i></b>and Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>Artista y Modelo </i></b>(The Artist and His Model) use the undraped female as the focus of the works. Nudes in painting have been associated with mythological figures, such as Malakas at Maganda (Strong and Beautiful). Amorsolo&rsquo;s nudes often represented precolonial babaylan<i> </i>making offerings to the gods, although he is better known for the <i>dalagang bukid </i>or country maiden bathing in the river. Nude drawing and painting from life had been an academic exercise in figure studies at the UP School of Fine Arts since its early years during the American colonial period. Galleries provide venues and models for nude painting sessions. In general, nudes celebrate the female form or express the spirit through material form. However, nude paintings can also be understood as depictions of women as &ldquo;objectified&rdquo; by men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vicente Manansala, CesarLegaspi, JoseJoya, AlfredoRoces, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3391\"><strong>Federico </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a>r Alcuaz</strong>, SolomonSaprid, RomuloOlazo, and PhillipVictor have painted numerous nudes. Manansala more closely followed the Salon Cubist form. The Bali nude series by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\"><strong>J. Elizalde Navarro</strong></a> from the 1980s to the 1990s returned his practice to a more Art Deco sensibility of organic forms arrayed in tapestry-like composition. In contrast, the black-and-white male nudes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3619\"><strong>Jose Legaspi</strong></a> in the 1990s to 2000s were more in tune with the queer gaze directed at men, and had an Expressionistic character informed by psychotherapy. On the other hand, the nude male drawings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\"><strong>Jose Joya</strong></a> from 1975 to 1995 captured native muscular bodies with a degree of academic nobility and a hint of eroticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Landscape painting depicts natural scenery and the countryside, although there are also <b>cityscapes</b> or <b>urban scenes</b>. In general, landscapes may be realist, romantic, classical, or expressionist. The subjects of realist landscapes are actual and specific places with their distinct features. They are often done on the spot and thus often have as title the name of an actual place. Romantic landscapes are picturesque, mysterious, exotic, or awe inspiring with a suggestion of the divine spirit in nature. Romantic landscapes are also subjective, expressive of inner mood, with nature viewed through the reflecting lens of the emotions. Classical landscapes are studio pieces often following formulas of ideal proportion and conveying the qualities of balance, harmony, serenity, and permanence in nature. Expressionist landscapes may use distortion and clashing colors to convey strong emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, landscape painting began in the mid-19th century with the secularization of art and the emergence of the ilustrado as the new patrons of art. Some of the early landscapes were done in the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura (Academy of Drawing and Painting). Hidalgo did his first landscapes in the school. They were shady landscapes of deep perspective showing a countryside with lush vegetation and a nipa hut beside a winding river. In Europe, Hidalgo did more landscapes of a romantic mood combined with an impressionist concern for delicate atmospheric effects and changing hues of the sky at different times of the day. Luna did landscapes of the many places he visited, such as the Normandy countryside; the Brittany coast and the Japanese rural scene, influenced by the vigorous Japanese sense of design. Landscapes during the 19th century focused primarily on the interaction between nature and man through farming or living off riverine environments, as exemplified by the works of Lorenzo Guerrero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3748\"><strong>Felipe Roxas</strong></a>, Felix Resurrecion Hidalgo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3653\"><strong>Felix Martinez</strong></a>, Carmen Zaragoza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3454\"><strong>Teodoro Buenaventura</strong></a>, and Patricio Gaston O&rsquo;Farrell. Works such as Lorenzo Guerrero&rsquo;s <b><i>Nipa Hut</i></b>, 1880,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a>ida Paterno</strong> &rsquo;s <b><i>Pasig River Scene</i></b>, 1896, and Teodoro Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Rio de San Juan</i></b>, 1927, feature riverbanks filled with foliage, nipa<i> </i>huts on the shoreline, and boats on the river. The continued influence of academism is manifested in the use of soft modulations, and dramatic chiaroscuro<b><i> </i></b>contrasts in early 20th-century rural scenes and riverscapes, such as those found in Fabian de la Rosa&rsquo;s <b><i>River View of Santa Ana</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Landscape painting had its heyday in the American colonial period with numerous landscapists headed by de la Rosa and Amorsolo. The dominance of landscapes was primarily due to the preference of the new American patrons for countryside scenes, which appealed to them as &ldquo;exotic.&rdquo; De la Rosa did realist scenes in the cool light of morning, while Amorsolo used backlighting and warm colors to enhance his countryside views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other members of the Amorsolo school based in the UP School of Fine Arts were Pineda, Casta&ntilde;eda, Herrera, Miranda, and PabloAmorsolo. Collectively, the artists of the Amorsolo school created the vocabulary of the Philippine rural landscape: a rice field promising an abundant harvest, a nipa hut under a spreading mango tree, a bamboo grove, a boy on a carabao, a small stream. After the advent of modernism, artists continuing to paint in the Amorsolo style were counted among the <b>conservatives</b> who later set up their studios along Mabini St. These include GabrielCustodio, MiguelGalvez, SerafinSerna, and Cesar Buenaventura.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Edades&mdash;who introduced modernism in 1928&mdash;was not a landscapist, another pioneering modernist, DiosdadoLorenzo, specialized in the landscape art in the impressionist style, done with a paint-loaded brush in direct, spontaneous brushwork. Although a modernist, he chose the same familiar barrio scenes for his subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cityscapes wracked by violence also became a predominant concern by the mid-20th century, as can be seen in wartime works like Fernando Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>Burning of the Intendencia</i></b>, 1944. Post-World War II conservative landscapes would be done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3495\"><strong>Gabriel Custodio</strong></a> and Martino Abellana. Modernist landscapes first emerged in <b>Post-Impressionist</b> or <b>Fauvist </b>works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\"><strong>Juan Arellano</strong></a>, such as <b><i>Forest</i></b>, ca 1913. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>City</i></b>, 1959, renders the cityscape as a completely abstracted grid of tan planes and black lines. Federico Aguilar Alcuaz&rsquo;s panoramic scenes of Manila from the late 1960s to early 1980s visualize the city as a majestic, slightly abstracted vista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, a group of landscapists, among them Romulo Galicano, Sofronio Y. Mendoza (SYM), TinyNuyda, IbarradelaRosa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5194\"><strong>Andres Cristobal Cruz</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3488\"><strong>Emilio Aguilar Cruz</strong></a>, formed the Dimasalang group. They popularized on-the-spot painting to capture the unique spirit of a place, in works generally of impressionist influence. Cebuano artists often excel in landscape due to the influence of Carcar maestro MartinoAbellana. Aside from Galicano and SYM are the brothers Godofredo and Teofilo Mendoza, GamalielSubang, Mardonio Cempron, and others. They have done landscapes of Cebu, old sections of Manila, and urban scenes of barong-barong with their patchwork roof and lines of laundry strung across their windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of the Filipino landscapists abroad, Rome-based LeonPacunayen&rsquo;s landscapes done in watercolor feature contrasting sharp definitions and atmospheric passages with an expressive interaction of figures in space. MacarioVitalis, residing in northern France, did landscapes of Brittany and the Philippines, of cubist and <b>pointillist</b> influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the 1960s landscape painting has continued to flourish. Lino Severino came up with his Vanishing Scene<b><i> </i></b>series, which focused on turn-of-the-century crumbling houses and landmarks in a monochrome style combining rigorous draftsmanship and tonal nuance. Ibarra de la Rosa&rsquo;s city landscapes look surreal because of their fantastically vivid colors. The <b>magic realists</b>, such as AgustinGoy, Stevesantos, and NestorLeynes, did landscapes of meticulous detail and striking clarity of form. The landscapes of Elmer Gernale, Al Perez, and RodolfoRagodon have an underlying documentary and illustrative intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later developments in landscape art are the mixed media works on cloth of ManuelRodriguezJr aka Boy Rodriguez, showing lush tropical landscapes of rich detail. ManuelBaldemor has also done landscapes of Paete, with a strong folk and festive spirit. PrudencioLamarrosa introduced the ecological theme in his magical Amburayan<b><i> </i></b>landscapes&mdash;a theme taken up by JonahmarSalvosa in contrasting works of tropical beauty and decay. Of the printmakers, Fildela Cruz&rsquo;s landscapes are set in the forests and ancestral lands of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> and Subanon threatened by logging and landgrabbing. Seascape refers to painting or sculpture of which the sea, ocean, or large body of water is the subject. Often this includes the shore or coastline in the foreground or along one side of the pictorial field. Many artists also like to draw the sea with picturesque and unusual rock formations. Even more than landscapes, seascapes, which show a large view of the sea and the sky, convey a sense of the vastness and the infinity of the universe. The impressionists liked to capture the sunlight sparkling on the water and a sense of the ever-changing atmosphere of the outdoor scene. In a romantic and melancholic mood, Hidalgo did several seascapes titled <b><i>Marina con Rocas </i></b>(Sea with Rocks), with the pale moonlight shining on the waters and the rugged shapes of the rocks on the shore. Luna painted the <b><i>Bahia de Vizcaya </i></b>(Bay of Biscayne) in predominantly gray tones and a reflective mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still life (French &ldquo;<i>nature morte</i>&rdquo; and Italian &ldquo;<i>natura morta</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that is, dead life) is an artwork, usually a painting, depicting objects&mdash;natural or man-made&mdash;forming a composition in a natural or domestic setting. Still life speaks about a people and their world and the objects with which they surround themselves. They reveal a society&rsquo;s sense of beauty, its occupation and everyday concerns, its taste and fashions at a particular time and place. They display the products of a society&rsquo;s industry during a particular period, such as its level of technology. At the same time, the still life also implies a social class and its manners and mores. While the still life made its appearance in classical antiquity, it was only in the 20th century, with its secular temper, when still life as a contemplation of everyday objects in their sensuous properties became fully accepted as an autonomous art form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still life or <b>bodegon </b>painting emerged in the 19th century, primarily through later Academia painters like  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3710\"><strong>Paz Paterno</strong></a></strong>, Adelaida Paterno, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\"><strong>Miguel Zaragoza</strong></a>, and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\"><strong>Emilio Alvero</strong></a></strong>. Following the Dutch Baroque convention, Paterno&rsquo;s <b><i>Still Life <span class=\"artworktitle\" style=\"font-style:italic\">with Cashewnuts, Macopa</span></i></b>, 1885, presents casual arrangement of cashew fruits, <i>macopa</i>, <i>camachile</i>, and melon, beside a vase of red and yellow flowers on a table. Miguel Zaragoza&rsquo;s illustrations of plant species for Father Manuel Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b>,<i> </i>1877, were scientific renditions of plants following the Linnaean convention of the 18th century. Emilio Alvero&rsquo;s bodegon paintings of the early 1900s followed late Romantic arrangements of fruits and flowers, and served as decor pieces for interior walls, such as those made for the Gen Antonio Bautista House in Malolos. Modernist still-life painters include Vicente Manansala, Hernando Ruiz Ocampo, Arturo Luz, Ang Kiukok, Araceli Dans, and Federico Aguilar Alcuaz. Manansala&rsquo;s <b><i>Sinigang </i></b>(Sour Soup),<i> </i>1950, strongly followed the Synthetic Cubism of Picasso and Braque. On the other hand, Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Fiesta</i></b>,<i> </i>1957, displayed his unique synthesis of a nearly abstracted Cubist rendition of fiesta objects centered on a star <i>parol </i>(Christmas lantern). Luz&rsquo;s <b><i>Still Life with Bottle</i></b>,<i> </i>1953, uses a De Stijl method of rendering objects on a table, albeit still with variations of hues. Kiukok&rsquo;s <b><i>Ink Fish</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1964, is an adaptation of the Synthetic Cubist techniques he learned from Manansala, here used to depict a plateful of fish in dark hues. Alcuaz would utilize Synthetic Cubism from the Barcelona La Pu&ntilde;alada Group to render <b><i>Still Life with Lemons</i></b>,<i> </i>1975. Since the 1980s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3626\"><strong>Araceli Limcaco-Dans</strong></a> has adapted an academic approach taken from Amorsolo and Irineo Miranda to render <i>calado</i> cloth and orchids in various permutations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abstract<b> </b>or <b>Non-Objective Painting</b> became dominant since the 1950s, with practitioners like  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Lyd Arguilla</strong></a></strong>, Hernando Ruiz Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\"><strong>Fernando Zobel</strong></a>, Jose Joya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3696\"><strong>Victor Oteyza</strong></a>, Arturo Luz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\"><strong>Lee Aguinaldo</strong></a>; followed in the 1960s onward by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3553\"><strong>Marciano Galang</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\"><strong>Florencio Concepcion</strong></a>, J.

The Neo-Realist group of Arguilla, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\"><strong>Romeo Tabuena</strong></a>, Estella, and Oteyza either focused on distorted and Non-Objectivist renditions of folk subjects following the <b>Lyrical Abstraction </b>movement in Europe and early 20th century Cubist-style geometry. H.R. Ocampo&rsquo;s works from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s utilized a highly cubistic variation of Futurism to depict Non-Objective works with a strong tendency toward warm and earth colors. Fernando Zobel&rsquo;s abstractions from the 1950s to the 1960s focused on dramatic monochrome sprays on primed canvases using a syringe constituting his Saeta<b><i> </i></b>series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The abstracted works of Arturo Luz from the 1960s to the 2010s may be said to primarily follow the linear style of Paul Klee, enriched with contributions from <b>Hard-Edged Abstraction</b> and <b>Dau al Set</b>. The works of Lee Aguinaldo segued from the <b>Gestural </b>or<b> Action Painting</b> style of Jackson Pollock in the 1950s to the Hard-Edged Abstraction favored by West Coast artists in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose Joya&rsquo;s abstract paintings from the 1950s to 1960s also combined various Abstract Expressionist motifs, such as the boldly flung strokes and drips of Action Painting, and thick impastos formed by spatulas into large planes. In the 1970s to the 1990s, Joya favored a more Lyrical Abstraction style with the careful delineation of planes using handmade paper, often with a red circular element that evoked abstracted landscapes. Florencio Concepcion&rsquo;s abstractions were inspired from <b>Color-Field</b> painting, such as that by Mark Rothko; while that of Raymundo Albano and Roberto Chabet were an ironic combination of <b>Abstract Expressionism </b>and <b>Minimalism</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s to the 2000s, the works of Augusto Albor and Lao Lianben appeared to reference the Lyrical Abstractionism of Europe to evince a more Asian approach to artmaking, with their focus on surface textures, monochrome colors, and controlled gestural strokes. The works of Nestor Vinluan brought Minimalism combined with Abstract Expressionism and Lyrical Abstraction together; while those by Roy Veneracion and Lito Carating demonstrated various permutations of Hard-Edged Abstraction or Color-Field Abstraction. Allan Cosio&rsquo;s renewed interest in Abstract Expressionism in the 1980s to the 1990s was directed at depicting nature; while Eghai Roxas&rsquo;s use of <b>Abstract Illusionism</b> since the mid-1990s blurred the distinction between Abstraction and Figuration in his use of shadowed strokes. Benjie Cabangis&rsquo;s type of abstraction presents layered spaces and surfaces replete with allusions and references.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk painting based on expressionist and/or native stylizations could be traced to the naive religious painters of Bohol in the late 18th century. The anatomical distortions turned out by these &ldquo;untutored&rdquo; painters evokes a more Southeast Asian sensibility with the use of rotund bodies, sinuous faces, and earthen colors. The icon paintings of Jose Dans in Paete and Juan Senson in Angono during the 19th century also follow this convention, albeit tempered with the use of primary colors derived from natural pigments. The 20th century witnessed an explosion of modern folk painting in the works of Romeo Tabuena, Antonio Austria, Norma Belleza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\"><strong>Abdulmari Imao</strong></a>, Angelito Antonio, Vicente Rivera, and Angono-based or Baguio City-based artists who built upon their art education from UP or UST. The combination of exposure to Modernist aesthetics with the employment of indigenous or ethnic motifs continues to inform much of identity-laden works to date. Specifically, the use of the <b>sarimanok</b> (legendary bird) designs on Imao&rsquo;s paintings since the 1960s constituted an attempt to modernize his Tausug heritage, even as he continued in the Muslim Minadanaon visual arts tradition of using bold colors and flat but curvilinear patterns derived from okir<i> </i>carving. The use of brilliant color combinations that typify folk art can also be found in the Vendors series of Austria, Belleza, Antonio, and Parial, most of which is taken from the lowland communities of Rizal, as well as mass culture in downtown Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Forms<i> </i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Painting can also be studied by focusing on the forms, such as<b> easel painting</b>,<b> murals</b>,<b> telon painting</b>,<b> jeepney </b>and<b> calesa painting</b>,<b> </b>and<b> collage</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mural (from Latin &ldquo;<i>muros</i>&rdquo; or wall) may be classified as any large, wall-sized painting. Murals have a long history, going back to the landscapes and mythological subjects painted on walls of villas in Rome and Pompeii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 19th-century Philippines, churches were painted with <b>trompe l&rsquo;oeil</b> effects reminiscent of Renaissance designs and with religious images copied from <b>estampitas<i> </i></b>(printed religious images) and exuding Romantic tendencies. The impetus for the proliferation and popularity of the art form was the revivalist spirit characterizing Philippine tastes at this time. But the immediate impetus for such decorations seems to have been the work done by the Italian scenographic artists CesarAlberoni and GiovanniDibella for the SanAgustinChurch in Intramuros in 1875. After that, churches all over the Philippines were decorated with murals. SimonFlores painted church interiors in Pampanga, his best-known work being that in the BetisChurch. In the Visayas, Cebuano painters Canuto Avila and Raymundo Francia were active in the 1930s, painting church interiors in Cebu, Bohol, and Leyte. The art of painting church interiors is still alive as shown in the folksy restorations of churches, such as those in Tayabas, Quezon; Indang,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong>; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>y, Bohol. In the last mentioned church, painters from Jagna, Bohol, have replaced older paintings of saints with contemporary ones, such as that of San Lorenzo Ruiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although murals are generally painted as frescoes, a true fresco is hardly found in the Philippines. Church murals found in ceilings have a wood and paint support over which a gesso and glue ground is laid, while those on walls are <b>fresco al seco</b>&mdash;meaning, painted on a dry surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, during the Marcos regime, the government sponsored the Kulay-Anyo mural project as part of its beautification campaign to boost tourism. Prominent artists were called upon to participate, among them CesarLegaspi, Jose Joya, Arturo Luz, ManuelRodriguezSr, Hernando R. Ocampo, along with some younger artists. Legaspi did a long horizontal mural in Para&ntilde;aque by the bay; Joya painted an abstract in the midst of a Tondo community; Rodriguez and Luz had theirs in Makati; and H.R. Ocampo had his work in Cubao, but it was covered by a building. Schoolchildren were also given free paints and access to walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the social realists who protested against martial law, murals were favored to convey messages relevant to the social conditions of society and to the urgent issues of the time. Since it was obvious that protest murals risked being effaced, a new mural form gained popularity. This was the <b>portable mural</b>. Large sized and made of several pieces of canvas or cheesecloth, the portable mural became an important visual part of every rally, along with streamers and banners, after which it was rolled up and conveniently stored. The murals, vividly colored and executed in bold strokes, exhorted the public to fight for their rights, honored heroes and sought justice for martyrs, condemned abuses, and asserted workers&rsquo; rights. The strong images were underlined by the slogans of the day. After the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr aka &ldquo;Ninoy,&rdquo; a well-known mural that portrayed the faces of Aquino, Macliing Dulag, Dr Johnny Escandor, and Edgar Jopson bore the slogan &ldquo;Justice for Ninoy, Justice for All.&rdquo; Another mural was <b><i>Fight for the People&rsquo;s Right to Know </i></b>done by the late socially committed artist Emmanuel Gutierrez. Many murals have been done by fine arts graduates in mass organizations from the Marcos regime up to the present. Often commissioned by nongovernment organizations, the murals are done collectively by a group, such as Artista ng Bayan, although a senior artist supervises it and gives it the finishing touches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists in organizations have done murals in different communities through outreach programs, such as those of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> with the cooperation of municipal officials. Public murals have been done in towns, such as Pasig, Pateros, Obando, and Angono. These murals have a strong symbolic aspect as they bring together the cultural symbols of the community to convey nationalist sentiments and awaken the sense of national and community identity. From 1994 to 2000, the artist group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3761\"><strong>Sanggawa</strong></a> (One Work), composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3452\"><strong>Elmer Borlongan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3547\"><strong>Karen Flores</strong></a>, Mark Justiniani, Joy Mallari, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3776\"><strong>Federico Sievert</strong></a>, engaged in revitalizing mural art through collective work. Among their works is <b><i>Epilogo</i></b> (Epilogue), 1998, a mural commissioned for the exhibition <b><i>Alab ng Puso</i></b> (Flaming Heart) at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, to commemorate the centennial anniversary of Philippine independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among less-known artists of the cities and towns, the painting of <b>telon</b> backdrops for <i>sarsuwela</i>,<i> </i>plays, carnivals, and photography studios from the 19th to the 20th century was their chief source of income and visual expression. Telon paintings invariably used scenery based on landscape works of the Academia painters. Its modern equivalent throughout the 20th century were the painters of movie billboards,<b> </b>most of whom were from the Caloocan-Malabon area of Manila, such as the Sagmit family in Tondo. Self-taught painters produce marquees and large signage of currently screening or upcoming films. These were done using katsa and hardware paint, and were thus not expected to last. Since the late 1950s, painters based in Manila&rsquo;s Mabini St area, Angeles City&rsquo;s Roxas Highway, or Cebu City and Boracay have catered to foreign tourists, hotel decorators, American military personnel, and middle-class buyers who fuelled the market once dominated by the conservative followers of Fernando Amorsolo. The Mabini artists often kept to the subject matter of Amorsolo and his followers, but used a more simplified and slapdash technique that was inexpensive and efficient in producing work in vast numbers. Some Mabini artists, however, also used imported styles like those used in velvet<i> </i>paintings popular in American mass culture, as well as painted metal hammer-out or wood-carved reliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modes of public transportation from the late 19th to the 21st century have often been rendered in bright painted chassis to attract attention from riders. This began with the horse-drawn calesa,<b> </b>with<b> </b>its wooden-spoked wheels and<b> </b>single-horse carriage brightly painted in primary and secondary colors on a white base.<b><i> </i></b>After World War II,<b> </b>motorized<i> </i>jeepney and tricycle bodies were also painted following this calesa convention of using a myriad of painted colors, patterns, and installed motifs that reached baroque proportions of excess during the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jeepney painting grew from the calesa tradition. In fact, one jeepney manufacturer, Sarao, once drove a calesa. Like the calesa, the Sarao jeepney is a broad mass of color bounded by designs. A common border is the rope design and the bamboo design. The hood and the sides of the jeepney are areas of decoration. Usually a painting, logo, or number is painted near the driver&rsquo;s seat and the seats beside it. More recent airbrushed paintings depict landscapes and scenes from comic books and manga. Spray-painted vignettes mounted on the chassis and applied on interior spaces also became the norm among some jeepney<i> </i>operators since the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The task of painting the jeepney is divided between the artisans who lay the ground of color, who paint a picture, and who make the designs. More recent jeepneys, especially those made by Atendido, use more chrome than painting in the tradition of calesa decorative art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Besides transportation, vendors using hand-pushed carts also painted in folk motifs became predominant. The most famous of these conveyances are the <i>sorbetero</i> homemade ice cream carts from the mid- to the late 20th century, their bodies painted and outfitted with the same lavish care as iconic jeepneys and calesas. Box-shaped, the cart has two decorated spoked wheels like the calesa and a pair of wooden legs at its rear to allow it to stand firmly when at rest. Like the calesa, chrome and paint is used to decorate the cart. Chrome is used for the top and the cover of the cart usually embellished with finials. Paint is used for the sides of the cart designed as a quadrilateral solid. Like the jeepney, broad areas of color are decorated with borders. The name of the ice cream company is usually written on the sides of the cart. The front usually has a landscape, like the Maria Cristina Falls in Lanao del Norte or sunset in Manila Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A contemporary form of painting is the collage,<b> </b>which is a scissor-and-paste method of combining ready-made images by pasting bits of fabric, paper, tin foil, and other relatively flat odds and ends onto a canvas or board. The technique is usually associated with the early work of the cubists around 1918. Braque and Picasso were the first to incorporate real objects, such as pieces of newspaper, into their pictures, the objects acquiring a dual function as themselves and as elements of a picture. Artists use collage to achieve greater variety in color and texture and to expand artistic resources beyond the traditional. Since the original cubists, collage has been employed by artists to create all manners of effects. In this process, photographs, news cuttings, logos, printed texts, and all kinds of materials and objects are pasted onto the painted ground or are combined with passages of simulated texture. The cuttings and objects are sometimes selected for their associative or representational values. Sometimes, interest is primarily in the formal and textural qualities of the work. The use of collage in printmaking has been fairly recent and may have been inspired by the availability of colored tissue, a material flat enough to allow the intaglio plate to print on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among local artists who work with collage are RobertoChabet, Eva Toledo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3588\"><strong>Nilo Ilarde</strong></a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a>Cajipe-Endaya uses it extensively in her paintings, using denims, crocheted lace, and sawali panels. Social realist NeilDoloricon uses the logos of transnational corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paintings still continue to be relevant in contemporary art in the Philippines as artists explore the human condition of the Filipino in the context of revaluating Philippine history and the shifting meanings of images in a transnational setting. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Alice G.

		"text": "<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong></strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2125\"><strong></strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong></strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong></strong></a><p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Paper art</b> is the skillful cutting, pasting, recycling, or constructing of objects from thin sheets of material made of cellulose pulp derived from wood, rags, and grasses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the examples of folk art in paper art are the <b>taka</b>,<b> parol</b>, and <i>pastillas</i> or milk candy wrappers called <b>pabalat</b>. Taka are <b>papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;</b> animals and other figures from Paete, Laguna. In this folk art, figures of horses traditionally predominate, their bodies painted a bright and glossy red, their saddles emblazoned with white, yellow, and blue flowers framed by leaves, scallops, chains, and feather motifs. Aside from horses, there are also carabaos in gray or bright yellow, and dogs. The taka are the epitome of folk art in their bright and affirmative hues in uninhibited combinations, their simplified forms, their profusion of curvilinear and floral motifs, and their naive quality and charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first step in making taka is carving a wooden mold in the desired shape, often in hard and durable narra. This is brushed with a coat of wax. Then wet scraps of paper, as many as 12 layers, are pasted with rice paste on the mold and left to dry. When the paper bulk is dry, it is cut in half, removed, then reassembled with glue, after which it is painted and decorated. In pre-World War II times, powder paint mixed with glue was used for coloring. Now, well-known brands of quick-drying enamel are mixed with gasoline to achieve bright shiny colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taka-making is a year-round activity. The figures are brought to neighboring towns celebrating their fiestas where they add to the gaiety of carnivals. The old women taka makers of Paete trace the origin of the art to the turn of the century. In the household of Sofia Afuang-Afunggol, for example, generations of women keep the folk art alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; is also used in the making of the <b>higantes </b>(giant figures) that lead the Angono fiesta procession in November. The Angono higante (giants) are large three-dimensional figures representing humans and carabaos, propped up and carried around town by men hidden inside their hollow structures. They are traditionally composed of bamboo frame bodies covered in cloth, with detachable heads made of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;. When assembled, they measure anywhere from between 8 and 11 ft in height. Over time, higante makers in the town of Angono, Rizal, have turned to using new materials, such as resin for the head and aluminum for the frame body of these huge puppets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional higante usually represent folk characters, such as farmers, fisherfolk, and some mythological creatures. Clothes are composed of two or more pieces&mdash;a <b>saya</b> (skirt), <b>baro</b> (upper garment), and <b>panleeg</b> (a bib or scarf that covers the part where the head is connected to the frame body). The same costumes are worn by all higante, regardless of whether they represent male or female, landlord or peasant characters. Social classes are distinguished through facial features, such that landlords have stereotypical European features (nose with prominent bridge, rosy cheeks, fair complexion) and are almost always sneering. These are done in reference to the Spanish or mestizo landlords on which the higante were first based in the late 1800s, according to Angono town lore. Higante representing fisherfolk and farmers, on the other hand, are given traditional Filipino features (flat noses, darker skin tone). However, recent higante makers in Angono and Lucban have opted to represent characters from the working class and popular culture. These modern higante are often garbed in uniforms that indicate their respective industries. The characters always feature a comical expression on their faces as these higante are meant to entertain the audience and enhance the festive mood of the occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The higante, according to oral history, are believed to have been used since the 19th century in Angono&rsquo;s harvest season festivities. The first documented account of the higante is dated to the post-World War II period when Leonardo Tajan Sr created three higante representing a family of farmers around 1945. These were first paraded around town during the annual fiesta of San Clemente on 23 Nov. Other visual artists from the town who became known for producing higante were Carlos Francisco, Nemesio Miranda Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3450\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3451\"><strong>Jose Blanco</strong></a></strong></a>, Charlie Anorico, Perdigon Vocalan, and the Higante Makers and Sculptors Society. Vocalan is credited for initiating the Higantes Festival in 1988, an annual parade of higante held on the eve of the town fiesta as an added attraction to the festivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from Angono, the town of Lucban in Quezon province is also known for its long tradition of making higante that are paraded in the streets during the fiesta of San Isidro Labrador every 15 May. The Lucban higante are distinguished by hands that are hanging by the side of their bodies, while the traditional Angono higante usually have their arms akimbo. However, recent production yielded higante with static hands that appear to be doing certain gestures, like waving or blowing a kiss, or holding an object. Other higante are fitted with strings and pulleys that control their arms to perform mechanical actions, allowing them to better interact with the audience. Their sheer size calls the attention of the crowd who are lined up on the street to watch. Bystanders occasionally encourage the higante to sway as if they were dancing, get closer together to kiss, or approach children who, more often than not, cry at the sight of these caricature giants. All these are done in the spirit of fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Angono is renowned for its higante tradition, other towns also feature the giant puppets in their local festivities. Higante are paraded in the streets of Gasan, Marinduque, as part of its religious playlets during the Christmas and Lenten seasons. Beginning in the late 1990s, Miag-ao, Iloilo, and Kalibo, Aklan, also began parading giant effigies they call &ldquo;higante&rdquo; in their local festivals. Unlike the ones in Angono and Lucban, these figures adopt themes from pop culture as subject matter and are propped up in floats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk drama uses paper extensively as an ornament. Paper flags and cutouts decorate the raft containing offerings to the spirits used in the Ibanag healing ritual, <i>atang-atang. </i>It is used for the wings of angels and hangings on the <i>galilea</i> in the <i>salubong</i> rite, to decorate the <b>arco</b> (arches) for the <i>pastores</i> of Camalig, Albay, and as decoration for the open-air stages of folk drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Parol<b> </b>are Christmas lanterns symbolizing the star of Bethlehem. Their basic design is that of a five-point star. Its bamboo frame is covered with thin and transparent <b>papel de japon </b>(japanese paper); a pair of tails of the same material attached to the star move gently in the wind. Traditionally, the parol was lighted from within, using a <i>kalburo</i> or carbide lamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The giant lanterns of San Fernando, Pampanga, particularly of the barangays of Santa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a>, Del Pilar, San Jose, Dolores, Lourdes, and San Juan, represent the high point of the art of parol making. These lanterns measure from three to six meters in diameter and can weigh a total of 1,000 kilos, with up to 2,000 light bulbs of varying wattage. Each lantern has its own generator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On Christmas Eve they are brought to the San Fernando plaza for judging. When the bands start to play, the huge lanterns light up like kaleidoscopes. The central star pulsates with the musical beat, while shells, scrolls, golden bells, holly leaves, and trumpetlike flowers flash in alternating movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The design, drawn on plywood panels, serves as guide for the cutting and shaping of wires for the structural framework, which consists of two identical faces for both sides. After the elaborate lighting system is installed, the paper is then attached in sculptured layers of varying thicknesses to create subtle tonal effects, each motif of distinct and raised shape set at an angle to the adjacent elements and with transparent areas as part of the general design. Among the master parol makers of San Fernando are Ernesto Quiwa and Mario Datu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Pabalat</b><i> </i>or<i> </i>pastillas wrappers, made in San Miguel, Bulacan, are paper cutouts fashioned from thin and transparent papel de japon to serve as wrapping for pastillas, soft confectionery made from carabao milk and fine sugar. In different colors, the paper is wrapped around the candy and twisted at both ends; one end sports a tail about 15.24 cm long, which is cut out in a variety of fine floral designs, often symmetrical. More complex examples may have hut-and-tree or landscape motifs with greetings, such as &ldquo;<i>Maligayang Pasko</i>&rdquo; (Merry Christmas) or &ldquo;<i>Maligayang Kaarawan</i>&rdquo; (Happy Birthday). Designs like the nipa hut, Maria Clara, man pounding rice grains, and the <i>tinikling</i> dance, are created by Luz Mendoza Ocampo for the pabalat. Traced into the papel de japon, the pattern is cut out using a cuticle scissor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Kites</b> are also examples of paper art. In the Philippines, they are made of papel de japon in different colors, pasted on a bamboo framework. Colorful paper hats trimmed with gold and silver foil also make an appearance on New Year&rsquo;s Day, along with toy trumpets and buntings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of contemporary artists also work in the medium of paper. In recent years, handmade paper became popular among printmakers because of its interesting textures and personal appeal. A number of workshops appeared, specializing in the making of handmade paper from different kinds of local grasses and plants, such as cogon and bamboo. Printmakers known for their use of handmade paper are GlennBautista, SantiagoBose, and Petite Calaguas. Paper has also been used by some contemporary artists to do sculpture. ImpyPilapil has made abstract sculpture by serigraphing, then cutting paper to create three dimensional shapes. In <b><i>Permutation</i></b>, 1979, pages were cut out, creating spaces in which to see the other pages in the book, thus exploring the translucency of paper as both material and meaning. ManuelRodriguezSr has done monoprints with paper sculpture techniques, including folding and collage. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3440\"><strong>Glenn Bautista</strong></a> has done complex abstract compositions using paper&mdash;torn, folded, and pasted with geometric designs. Many collages have been done with plain or printed paper, such as the works of RobertoChabet and Rodriguez Sr, the latter incorporating paper bags, maps, postcards, and school texts in his work. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3502\"><strong>Roderico Daroy</strong></a> has also done collages with reproductions of paintings on aged paper. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\"><strong>Romulo Olazo</strong></a> and Ryan Villamael have explored the potential of paper as sculptural work. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">As a category of art production, <b>performance art</b> encompasses bodily actions or gestural work that do not fall within, and in many instances seek to challenge, the boundaries intrinsic to more traditionally movement-associated art categories. These categories include <b>dance</b>, <b>music</b>, and<b> theater</b>. A concrete example of the transgressing of these form boundaries is the emergence of <b>poetry</b> <b>performance</b> wherein poets not only count upon the written but <b>spoken word</b>, sometimes alongside the use of props, costume, and gestural and voice nuances that play into the live form as encountered by those present for these readings. Apart from pursuing the desire to explore forms of work that do not conform to what has already become canonical, some performance artists play up the time-based, ephemeral aspect of performance, which to certain degrees keeps their work beyond the reach of market forces that invariably seek objects that might be reduced to monetary and trade value. Particularly in more recent times, performance artists have also done work that crosses over into even less convention-circumscribed domains of art such as relational or community-based work, and art characterized by multimedia aspects, such as <b>video </b>and <b>sound art</b>,<b> </b>as well as <b>installation</b> wherein the movement of bodies of artists/participants navigates or intervenes within a space. In the latter, the core of a work is constituted to provoke action, or to play into the conceptual framing of an open-ended piece as this becomes subject to the contingencies of other minds and bodies shaping or disrupting what an artist may initially have planned to do within the performance site. In this case, the aspect of improvisation or the absence of a prescriptive script is upheld as important to the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest accounts of performance art are associated with the work done in the 1960s by the Arts Laboratory loosely made up of such artists as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Medalla</strong></a>, Jun Terra, Lazaro Soriano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3553\"><strong>Marciano Galang</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3737\"><strong>Alan Rivera</strong></a>, and Red Mansueto, who sought to explore art unbound to the studio, gallery, and other overly familiar and codified art contexts. Their early largely improvisational, action-based practice consisted of a range of work that could be located across a spectrum bookended by the loosely narrative to spontaneous, with form variably described as playful mass dancing to provocative, often participatory actions wherein public intervention is required for the task to progress. In most of these early instances, performances were done unannounced and in public places such as Luneta Park, at the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) complex open areas, in caf&eacute;s and other gathering places where artists stationed themselves, or at exhibit openings where performances sometimes constituted uninvited, disruptive gestural-visual-aural interventions amidst otherwise formal and staid events overlaid by rigid social codes of behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Precisely because of its highly fluid and experimental character, performance art can also be taken as displaying an ambivalence toward such notions as time, narrative, the translation of mental to bodily proposition, and thus lately, even the live presence of the artists&rsquo; body in performance. Thus, these explorations have consisted of performances that range from lightning or instantaneous, often fleeting actions to those that have required physical endurance on the part of performers doing exaggeratedly durational work that demands sustained or more committed viewing/participation from those witnessing these pieces. Lately too, with the increasingly broad access to digital technology on the net and various telecommunication platforms, artists have sought to &ldquo;stage&rdquo; performance in virtual space, no longer counting on the immediacy posed by the interaction of artists and audiences occupying the same physical space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Just as the nature of performances have run the gamut from the fleeting, like Red Mansueto streaking through the CCP Main Gallery, as well as protracted actions like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3405\"><strong>Rene Aquitania</strong></a>&rsquo;s five-day hike from the Cordillera to Manila wherein he would also inevitably interact with people walking along his route, other liberties taken with form enable these artists to explore how variable physical and psychological configurations between artist-participants positioned within a space can play into the performance of transient relationships. These permutations, for instance within immersive or confrontational situations, influence the action-response cycle between those who have initiated a performance and those coming to encounter it. In a sense, this dispersing of the position of author or meaning-maker across those who enter a potential zone of participation basically determines how a work or proposed intervention could eventually take shape, and ultimately, how art is thus circumscribed. This is one of the reasons that performance artists have argued that their practice makes for a more democratic encounter of art, although the overall abstract and sometimes overly conceptual nature of their work have also elicited countercharges of audience alienation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In some cases, performance art as practiced here is also characterized by a liberal poaching from text (which may be literary, historical-mythical, filmic, musical, pop-graphic), which functions as loose structural element of the work. This borrowing and layering over of text unto a work that is still primarily propelled by action has also opened up collaborations between writers interested in performance poetry, drawing upon both Filipino folk/oral literature and concrete poetry as spoken word takes tangible form through the artist&rsquo;s use of visual and kinesthetic elements, like gesture coupled with aural flourish, dress, and objects that amplify or extend the meaning of a piece. The intersection between performance and sound art also illustrates this tendency to merge forms as the artists see fit. Thus it is no longer extraordinary to find dance artists, both choreographers and dancers, and techno-inclined sound collectives participating in performance art festivals that have been held in the Philippines since the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The emergence of performance art as a category has also simultaneously been informed by scholarly and artistic research into performative practice across ethnolinguistic cultures and this in turn has yielded contemporary work that is rooted in ritual and alternately over-the-top and secular-sacred hybrid contexts that demonstrate the cross-genre nature of art coming out of communal events that are usually either propitiatory or celebratory in nature. This blurring of distinctions between what is primal and contemporary, what is art vis-&agrave;-vis what constitutes daily life, what is textual against what is visual/performative has given artists the leverage to expand both the vocabulary and syntax of their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Emphasis on the conceptual aspect as well as physicality of performance gained momentum in the 1970s in the collaborative work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3439\"><strong>Huge Bartolome</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3775\"><strong>Judy Freya Sibayan</strong></a>, and Ray Albano whose actions often issued from a bare skeletal script made up of series of instructions, alternately abstract and colloquially poetic. Sibayan elaborates on how privileging process over product propelled them to do work that hoped to defy genres during this period. Parallel to this, on the other hand, was performance borrowing from experimental theater, such as that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2739\"><strong>Dindo Angeles</strong></a>&rsquo;s participation in the CCP&rsquo;s Black and White annual, which eventually led to his being selected by Albano to represent the Philippines at the 1982 Paris Biennale via an image/poetry trilogy in homage to  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>, and Zoleta. Angeles would eventually go on to develop the pilot theater curriculum of the Philippine High School for the Arts in Makiling, and it was within this program that young artists groups like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2913\"><strong>Dulaang Sipat Lawin</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>no Shadowplay would take root. Meanwhile, the minimalist aesthetic that informed early forays into performance by artists associated with the CCP continued to run through what has been described as the performance-based conceptual photography of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a> whose images of himself playing up to a camera lens amidst incongruous contexts (lying prostrate while laid over with black plastic or blowing smoke circles through the hole of a paper bag upon his head) eventually saw him shifting to video and, eventually, television. Simultaneously during this period, art institutions, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\"><strong>Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</strong></a>, pursued a short-lived interest in <b>experimental art</b>, which enabled artists to undertake installations and performance under AAP auspices. This may have additionally been fuelled not only by third-hand encounters with international avant-garde practice but also by lightning actions carried out by artist-activists mobilizing across the streets of the metropolis. For instance, a bound and shirtless <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\"><strong>Nunelucio Alvarado</strong></a> walked into Ayala Museum, entreating those present to participate in his unfettering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mid-1980s also gave rise to unannounced collaborative actions in public sites by artists, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2864\"><strong>Soliman Cruz</strong></a>, Joey Macalino, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4506\"><strong>Ronnie Lazaro</strong></a> who enacted scenes of surveillance and militarization that could loosely be construed as precursor for the more complex collaborations later done by artists, such as those done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a> in the early 1990s. It was in this decade that she began staging more theatrically elaborate and thematic work in places like Luneta, Quiapo, Kulay Diwa, and Penguin, the latter site specifically for a surrealist take on the phenomenon of Filipina workers being globally trafficked. Syjuco would team up with a long queue of artist-collaborators, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3619\"><strong>Jose Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3581\"><strong>Hermisanto</strong></a>, Rene Aquitania, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a>, for the seminal <b><i>Puting Uwak </i></b>(White Crow) done in 1992 at the CCP Little Theater, the work particularly remembered for its grandiose projection within the still underwritten art historical narrative as well as for the inverted emplacement of audience members made to sit atop the stage as performers were positioned in the viewing section of the theater. Video documentation of Syjuco&rsquo;s work shown in schools would eventually yield experimentation by a still younger set of artists who began working together in the 1990s underperformance art festival platforms, like the Philippine International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><strong>Performance Art</strong></a> Festival and the TUPADA Action and Media Art. This streak of independent activity would run parallel to work turned out from artist-run spaces, such as Surrounded by Water (e.g., Alice and Lucinda) and Third Space under the instigation of the filmmaker-curator  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3435\"><strong>Yason Banal</strong></a></strong> who, among other young artists, took advantage of workshops done at the Syjucos&rsquo; ART LAB, the same site that saw a brief mentorship bloom between Jose Legaspi and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5526\"><strong>Vim Nadera</strong></a></strong>. This overall more eclectic strain of practice encompassed performances ranging from the primarily gestural, amalgamations of neo-expressionist, surreal and Dadaist tropes, and a deliberate shift to a mode of spectacle-making the scale of which thrust practice unto heightened degrees of campy theatricalization and collaboration. Examples of the latter were ambitious all-evening improvisational performances in mainstream sites, such as at the Ayala Museum (<b><i>Post </i></b>curated by Jet Melencio) and the CCP (<b><i>Kaka</i></b> curated by Banal). This period to the present has also seen parallel development in diasporic communities, such as those done by individuals as well as groups like the now Canada-based Roy Lumagbas, United States-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3822\"><strong>Carlos Villa</strong></a>, Diwa Arts, Barriotics, and, more currently, Mail Order Bride made up of Jenifer Wofford, Reanne Estrada, and Eliza Barrios. It was also in the 1990s extending to the next decade when Jose Legaspi explored collaborative work with the multiethnic Godzilla West in California, while the then France-based Sandra Palomar and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3498\"><strong>Gaston Damag</strong></a> would eventually team up to manage the artist-support site Sanlikha: Maison des Artistes Philippins.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This multiplicity of sites of practice as well as in originating impulses (from extensions of theater and/or visual art practice to the pursuit of transmedia work) similarly informs the emergence of performative work outside Manila as core sites could be drawn across the regions: Angono via the Neo-Angono Public Art Festivals; Baguio via the Baguio International Arts Festivals; Cebu initially via the school-based event Mind Works initiated by Javy Villacin, Roy Lumagbas, and Raymund Fernandez at University of the Philippines Cebu, morphing into the latter XO? street actions with younger artists, such as Russ Ligtas; and Davao-based anarchist-inspired actions organized by Fritz Balgos who gravitated around the same circles as Jong Pairez who in turn crafted the Tasaday cyber persona Jean Makisig released into the sphere of viral multi-authorship. This Pairez work thus now stands as an early indicator of interest in the performative mode of identity-formation made possible through virtual platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some strains of performance play up the artists&rsquo; embodied capacity to enact a persona. Some recurring characters, for instance, were Alan Rivera&rsquo;s Non, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\"><strong>Jose Tence Ruiz</strong></a>&rsquo;s bandaged up man and puppet, Pepito Bosch&rsquo;s Abaca Man, Jess Abejo&rsquo;s Tree Man, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3751\"><strong>John Frank Sabado</strong></a>&rsquo;s Eco-warrior, Jose Legaspi&rsquo;s White Man, Jef Carnay&rsquo;s Queen, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3447\"><strong>Jeho Bitancor</strong></a>&rsquo;s Man-in-suit, the guitar-wielding Marlon Magbanua, comic superhero Thom Daquiaog, Sam Pe&ntilde;aso&rsquo;s Mourner, Sandra Palomar&rsquo;s Red Crow, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3492\"><strong>Noel Cuizon</strong></a>&rsquo;s Sojourner, and the Butoh-inflected figures of Martin de Mesa and Ligtas. The flexibility in form and relationship to such theatrical notions as character, narrative, staging, dramaturgy, movement, and site/space for action remain largely unbound by stringent parameters. This free-for-all climate has predictably engendered criticism particularly in regard to the lack of concern for form and resistance to evaluative criteria. Nevertheless, a desire to draw upon an essentially inclusive or total art context where loose codes of performances are drawn from inferred communal negotiation rather than inflexible aesthetic constraints could be gleaned from the work of Roberto, Ben-hur, and Bumbo Villanueva, Yuan Mor&rsquo;o Ocampo, Hermisanto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\"><strong>Diokno Pasilan</strong></a>, as well as in the parodied shamanistic reference in the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a> and those who have further explored parallel performative modes through Bose, as was the case with Baguio-based Karlo Altomonte and Cagayan de Oro-based Nick Aca. Latent <i>babaylan </i>(shaman) references in the work of Raquel de Loyola, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3725\"><strong>Alma Quinto</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Turalba register in this shamanistic vein as well. Analogous enactments of folk tropes have come in the form of the <i>taho</i>/<i>balut </i>(soft tofu/unhatched duck egg) vendor of Alwin Reamillo, rogger basco&rsquo;s hermetic wiseman, and the penitent Rommel Espinosa. Still another recurring theme that cuts across the bodies of work of several artists includes critical commentary on globalization as seen in pieces by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\"><strong>Mideo Cruz</strong></a>, Ronald Ruiz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3830\"><strong>Jevijoe Vitug</strong></a>, Arnel Ramiscal, Bitancor, UGATLahi, Boyet de Mesa, this alongside pieces directed at issues of gender and body politics in the work of Roselle Pineda, Bunch Garcia, Maki Calilung, Kaye O&rsquo;yek, Ceej Gomera, and Christine Sioco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The apparent catchall disposition of performative work has even further opened up the field to more diverse syntheses of seemingly disjunctive forms. This liberal criss-crossing has enabled intersections across performance and domains, such as dance, theater, sound and media art production, thus Fete dela WSK annual improvisatory sound and image festivals have morphed into a miscellany of collaborations between artists, such as E.X.I.S.T., the Gangan Ensemble (made up of Tad Ermita&ntilde;o, Caliph, Malek Lopez, and Tengal Drilon), Jing Garcia/Autoceremony, Eric Calilan, Gentle Universe, Mannet Villariba, and the Sipat Lawin Ensemble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another pertinent discursive point that has influenced practice done over the history of performance art is how the performative mode propels a dialogic process between artists and publics. Reamillo, who previously taught at the Makiling High School for the Arts, explicitly identifies this track in his work as something he traces both to a received Situationist lineage, a Beuysian notion about social sculpture, and the natural affinities between installation art and process-based art. His work with various groups to craft a whale car and the transformation of a disused chopper into peace icon demonstrate this. There are parallels here too in the work of the artist couple Isabel and Alfredo Aquilizan who have positioned their early pieces as performance installations particularly in regard to how the accumulation of objects that eventually constitute the key elements of their installations, establishing a fleeting relationship with source communities. As in the case of installation, site and social context of a performance work may prominently play into how a performance might be devised as well as determine its capacity to initiate interaction. Such was the case in the ritual dismantling of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\"><strong>Roberto Villanueva</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\"><strong>Uma ti Biag</strong></a></strong> </i></b> (Garden of Life) at the CCP lawn, a site also later used for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Angud </i></b>upon which members of the CCP dance corps interacted spatially, maneuvering across the stumps of trees the artist had strewn across the front lawn, in front of the prominent facade. Another example of this is how <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3558\"><strong>Lyra Garcellano</strong></a> embodied the owning and sharing of territory in the performance-installation <b><i>Free Land </i></b>done through the digging up, packing, and sharing of soil among those present at a juncture in her residency in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As previously mentioned, constituting digital media as yet another performance platform not only comes with the potentials of multiplicity in authorship but also an opening up of the reception and circulation contexts of art, particularly in relation to the viral potential of hypertextuality or the webbed associations enabled by networked information in cyberspace. Most recently, Sibayan&rsquo;s <b><i>Hypertext of Her(Mes)</i></b> explored this track in her autobiographical accounting of a practice spanning her engagement and disengagement with art world institutions, posing her post-CCP phase as institutional critique. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byEileen Legaspi-Ramirez</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Legaspi-Ramirez, Eileen. 2011. &ldquo;For the Record: For the Record: Agency and the Crafting of Discourse around Performance Art from the Philippines.&rdquo; MA thesis, College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sibayan, Judy Freya. 2011. &ldquo;Braided Voices and Parallel Scripts: Discursive Construction of the Autobiographical Subject.&rdquo; http://www.ctrlp-artjournal.org/dissertation/The-Discursively-Constructed-Constructing-Subject.pdf. 29 Mar.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The use of <b>personal ornaments</b> is a common but diverse practice in the Philippines. It has had a long existence, the earliest evidence of which dates back to prehistoric times, long before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers. It takes various forms, which generally relate to degrees of engagement with the body as either permanent or temporary appendage. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> permanent form of adornment is <b>tattooing</b>. The practice was documented by early observers among so-called <b>pintados</b> (painted ones) in the Visayas. Temporary forms, on the other hand, are illustrated by the practices of Samal and Yakan peoples living in southern Philippines. They paint their faces with rice paste during important occasions, such as weddings. The more known types of adornment, however, are realized through the putting on of objects, which may be worn or taken off at will. They are often seen as adjuncts to <b>dress</b>, but are generally distinct from them. The ornaments are worn on different parts of the human body, and while generally seen as decorative, may also bear other cultural meanings. Philippine languages have particular names for many of these ornaments, but whether made of ephemeral or more permanent materials, these constitute a category that may be thought of as <b>jewelry</b>. Filipino terms, such as <b>hiyas</b> (jewel or jewelry), <b>alahas</b> (from the Spanish <i>alhajar</i>, &ldquo;to adorn with jewels&rdquo;), and <b>aretes</b> (from the Spanish <i>aretes</i>, &ldquo;earrings&rdquo;), are used in reference to jewelry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Background</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jewelry constitutes some of the most important Philippine artifacts found in ancient grave sitescontaining human fossils and grave furniture. The oldest jewelrywere found in Duyong Cave, Palawan (C-14 dated to 2680 BCE). It is in this site where a tall muscular male was found with two shell discs near his ears and another perforated disc made from cone shell (Conus litteratus) near his chest. It is uncertain whether these types were specifically used for funeral purposes, but evidence indicates that shells were a common raw material in the fabrication of ornaments used in everyday contexts. Apart from shells, organic and inorganic materials sourced locally or from outside the Philippines were also incorporated in early jewelry. Extant examples of ornaments have been found to use materials from West Asia, India, China, and Southeast Asia. To a certain degree, existing personal ornaments used by various ethnolinguistic groups may give valuable insights into the study of early jewelry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early Filipinos clearly had particular preferences for types of personal ornaments and the technology for procuring and fashioning them. Certain parts of the Philippines, for example, had abundant amounts of gold,found either in raw or wrought state. These were used in both local exchange and international trade. The Surigao hoard, dating from the 10th century onward, shows a wide variety of techniques and designs used for gold ornaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These ways of working gold, done by the skilled <b>panday-ginto</b> (goldsmith), continued until the Spanish period, but also became enriched by inputs from Asian and European jewel makers who introduced innovations in the repertoire of existing designs and technologies. Soon the delicate and laborious art of <b>filigree</b>,<b> chasing</b>,<b> engraving</b>,<b> </b>and<b> casting</b> were set aside in favor of modern styles. However, in Batanes and Paracale, Camarines Norte, goldsmiths continue to create jewelry using the traditional techniques of filigree and granulation. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3409\"><strong>Ely Arcilla</strong></a> continued the tradition in Paracale, creating the styles of <b>agrimon</b> (flat necklace chain) and <b>tamburin<i> </i></b>(filigree bead necklace) coming from the 18th and 19th centuries. There are other centers of jewelry smithing in the Philippines that have thrived. Baguio City, being rich in silver, is famous for its silver filigree. Meycauayan town in Bulacan province is another jewelry center where a <b>platero</b> (jeweler) can still be found in many households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the mid-18th century, certain districts, like Santa Cruz in Manila, came to be associated with excellent jewelry crafting. Platerias Street in the Quiapo area, near the bridge, was a place where jewelers converged. In the mid-19th century, the plateros were renowned in the craft. The town of Lipa, Batangas, in the 19th century had excellent goldsmiths whose skills were comparable to European artisans of the same period. Gorgeous diamond-studded crosses and ornaments were commonly produced in these sites. The famous coffee boom of Batangas resulted in the ostentatious display of Batangue&ntilde;o jewelry. Emerald-encrusted <b>peinetas</b> (ornamental combs), elaborate 18-carat gold chains, huge diamond rings, diamond-studded slippers, gold-covered front teeth, and three-carat diamond studs for the barong tagalogwere just some of the objects associated with the economic elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">American colonization at the turn of the century brought a change of style in jewelry that was more streamlined. Diamonds came into vogue and goldwork was merely used as setting for precious gems. Emphasis shifted to stone. This led to the deterioration of the goldsmith&rsquo;s art. This shift in stylistic preferences was also accompanied by changes in the marketing of jewelry. Previously, jewelry would be commissioned or sold by jewelers via an expanded network of relations and friends. But by the turn of the 20th century, jewelry became regular items of trade in shops. Jewelry was sold in shops in the Escolta area, which became the main commercial center during the American period. La Estrella del Norte, owned by the French-Jewish brothers Adolphe, Charles, and Raphael Levy, grew from the sale of five crates of religious medals, statues, and gold chains, which the brothers brought from San Francisco, to become the most famous jewelry store in the Philippines. Their original store was established in Iloilo. Another firm engaged in the jewelry trade was H. E. Heacock, who specialized in men&rsquo;s watches and chains, and collar and cuff buttons directed at American ex-soldiers, businessmen, and Manila&rsquo;s elite. It evolved into a full-blown department store in the 1930s. These stores made available not only locally crafted jewelry but also imported goods, such as branded wrist and pocket watches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila and, more recently, Makati are now the trendsetters in jewelry. While modern Western designs are popular, there is also increasing interest in reinterpreting traditional ethnic and colonial designs. The work of Celia Molano, for example, illustrates this trend. Moreover, there are also noted specialty shops for jewelry. The Ocampos, Panlilios, and Velayos have been in the business for a long time. Their ateliers, together with newer shops, such as Miladay&rsquo;s, La Czarina, or Orocher, continue to set directions for jewelry creations in the country. Young Filipino designers, such as Bea Valdes, Jul B. Dizon, Ericson Manansala, and Cherrie Marie de Guzman, are also making names for themselves in the world of fine jewelry, both here and abroad. The industry has also tried to enlarge its market by offering a range of products for various types of consumers&mdash;silver jewelry and costume jewelry are relatively within reach by people of all genders, ages, and persuasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Materials, Processes, Techniques</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Personal ornaments are made using various types of organic and inorganic materials. Organic materials are mostly from plants (flowers, seeds, cotton fibers, bamboo, palms, vines, coconut shell, wood) and animals (shell, coral, pearl, tortoiseshell, bone, animal teeth, hornbill, ivory, human and horsehair, feathers) while inorganic materials include stone, glass, ceramic, metal and plastic. Processes of working with these different materials varied, and could range from simple stringing of pre-manufactured beads, to more complex filigree work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Organic</b>. Shell ornaments are said to be as long-lasting as diamonds. Prehistoric Filipinos used shell ornaments at least 5,000-7,000 years ago during the New Stone Age or Neolithic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a>, as evidenced by the Duyong Cave artifacts mentioned earlier. Shell discs fashioned into beads were common ornaments during the late Neolithic age. For instance, prehistoric Filipinos were able to produce beads by grinding off the dorsal surfaces of two species of shell, the ringed cowrie (Cypraea annulus) and the money cowrie (Cypraea moneta). Another shell species, the nassarius or sand snail (Nassarius spp), was also used to make beads. Shell bracelets have also been found in late Neolithic excavations. One example is a type of bracelet cut from the base of the cone shell. Broader, spiral bracelets are made from the natural spiral along the shell&rsquo;s shoulders, creating a natural design. Spiral bracelets may either be concave or convex. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> <b>ginut-tu</b>, a belt created from perforated-shell discs, is worn only by the nobility or the <b>kadangyan</b> class during festivities. The Ifugao <b>kilaong </b>or ear pendants suspended from metal rings are fashioned from the chambered nautilus shell (Nautilus pompilius). In Palawan and Samar, indigenous groups produce their own shell bracelet, called <b>galang</b>, ground from giant clams (Tridacna gigas) and cone shells. Even among contemporary ethnolinguistic communities,shell ornaments are still widely used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Inorganic</b>. Stones were used as jewelry as far back as 2000 BCE. These ancient stone ornaments were developed in Philippine prehistory during the Neolithic stage, the same period when polished stone tools were also used in agriculture. From at least 500 BCE, &ldquo;true jade&rdquo; or nephrite was also used as material for working tools. Apparently, jade was highly valued then for its technological and artistic qualities. Nephrite was used by ancient Filipinos for jewelry: beads, ear pendants, and bracelets. Since the Philippines is geologically young, geological deposits have yet to yield precious gems, such as diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds or aquamarines. But at least 22 types of native semiprecious stones have been unearthed, among them amethyst, opal, garnet, and obsidian. The integration of precious or semiprecious stones into personal ornaments continues to form part of the practice of many contemporary Philippine jewelers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of glass, usually in the form of beads, may also be traced to ancient times. Most of the beads recovered from archaeological sites are glass beads. The earliest glass beads found in the country were undoubtedly imported. Recovered from Uyaw Cave, Palawan, dating to 500-200 BCE, is a large green glass bead shaped like a cicada, closely resembling similar Chinese jade carvings of approximately the same period. In the mid-15th century, the Pandanan shipwreck in Palawan yielded thousands of imported Indo-Pacific glass beads, many of which are believed to have been sourced from Sungai Mas, Malaysia. Despite the access to imported glass beads, evidence however also indicates familiarity with bead-making processes&mdash;shaping through abrasive processes, drilling, boring, etching, application with gold foil&mdash;which could have been used for both local and imported beads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among traditional Philippine ethnolinguistic groups, beads also form a large part of the materials used for personal adornment. In the north, among the Bontok and the Ifugao, the rarest and most highly priced heirloom bead is the <b>pang-aw</b>, a cylindrical bead with gold leaf embedded between layers of clear glass. Small, round, or cylindrical monochrome glass beads, generally termed <b>batek</b>, are common in Bontoc province. These may be <b>lang-at</b> (red), <b>impokon</b> (white), <b>fa-king-i</b> (yellow), and <b>gu-sao</b> (black). Orange glass beads are also common. Several strands of these beads are worn around the head, or strung into bracelets or armlets. In the south, a significant number of glass eye beads among the Tboli and other Mindanao tribes probably came from &ldquo;British Borneo&rdquo; since most eye beads found among highlanders of Borneo and Indonesia were from England, manufactured for trade during the 19th century. During the latter part of the Spanish period, <b>abaloryo</b> (from the Spanish <i>abalorio</i>, &ldquo;bead,&rdquo; &ldquo;glass bead,&rdquo; &ldquo;trinket&rdquo;) or fine glass beads intended for embellishing garments and objects like slippers and purses, became widely used as inexpensive body ornaments and rosaries for the masses. In contemporary bead making, old as well as new beads may be used. Beads made from modern materials, such as plastics and synthetic crystals, are also common accessories both in everyday fashion and in haute couture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the metals, gold has played a consistently significant role in personal ornamentation. Ancient Philippine gold was <b>gintong pula</b> or in shades of red-yellow. Several varieties were <b>dilaw</b> (yellow) from a mix of equal amounts of silver and copper; <b>mapula</b> (pink), mixed only with copper; and <b>berde</b> (green), mixed only with silver. Gold from local deposits was fashioned into combs, hairpins, earrings, weapon handles, eye masks for the dead, as well as images of <b>anitos</b>. Archaeological artifacts prove that ancient Filipinos were great goldsmiths. Excellent gold jewelry by ancient Filipino artisans exhibit expertise in the art of filigree and granulation in earrings, necklaces, wristbands, and bracelets. The height of ancient Filipino gold artistry unparalleled elsewhere in the world is perhaps exhibited by the gold sashes found in Surigao. The sophisticated method used in the magnificent sashes was the gold-weaving method that utilized the &ldquo;<b>loop-in-loop technique</b>.&rdquo;<b> </b>Vigan and Bantay, Ilocos Sur, became the centers of gold jewelry in Luzon for most of the Spanish colonial period. The town of Bantay was engaged in the manufacture of filigree jewelry or lacelike <b>calado </b>(openwork) in gold and silver, which are techniques that continue to be in use. Apart from gold, personal ornaments have also been produced using silver, brass, copper, or bronze, sourced from mines or pre-used metals, such as coins or bullets. More recently, metals like aluminum and stainless steel have also been utilized. Additional processes of working with metals also include casting,<b> repouss&eacute; </b>and<b> </b>chasing,<b> </b>engraving,<b> die-stamping</b>,<b> inlaying</b>,<b> soldering</b> and <b>gilding</b>. The Tboli, for example, cast brass bells that were then attached to necklaces, belts, and anklets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Form, Content, and Function</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jewelry making belongs to the expressive and applied arts contextualized within tradition and a discipline of styles. The Philippine jewelry tradition is characterized by the dominance of symmetry and formal proportion, a strong sense of rhythm, and a distinctive rather than specific emphasis. The importance of surface textures has also received critical attention. Sizes are either oversized or minute. There is also a predominance of primary hues, achieved through use of a variety of tones associated with stone and glass beads, and the natural color of metals, especially gold. The curve is a prevailing motif combined with basic forms&mdash;the square, triangle, ellipse, and circle. On occasion, there are stylized animal or human forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ancient jewelry, for example, covers a wide spectrum of forms. For example, the circle may be seen during the Spanish period in a variety of permutations&mdash;as plain or textured gold globules for necklaces, as flattened mother-of-pearl discs for pectorals, or as nephrite lobed annular ear pendants. Representational shapes, on the other hand, may be evidenced by &ldquo;death masks&rdquo; consisting of gold sheets, rendered either for the entire face or as separate pieces for eyes, nose, and mouth. In the traditions of many ethnolinguistic groups, there may also be observed a preference for colorful jewelry. Beads of variegated colors are used in almost all types of body ornamentation among the Cordillera and southern Mindanao groups. Red, yellow, black, and opaque white predominate this palette. While motifs are generally geometric and nonfigurative, images may be suggested by the materials used&mdash;a bird, from its bill; a snake, from its skeleton; a crocodile, from its teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Christianization also brought in Catholic motifs, such as the cross; while religious images also appear in pendants, reliquaries, and scapulars. The cross was a symbol essential to the Christian faith. The earliest design of the cross ornament was the <b>krus na baligtad</b>, a cross functionally inverted so that when worn as a pendant, it would be right side up when one prayed. Its eclectic blend of style and technique was typical of Philippine jewelry tradition. The oldest were those in which the Christ figure was more hieratic, with the elements radiating from the figure. The figureless cross was sometimes used to symbolize the risen Christ. The veneration of saints was reflected in the religious figurines of jeweled or enameled gold&mdash;the reliquaries, rosaries, scapulars, and medals with the images of Christ, the Virgin, and the saints. The tamburin became an ornamental form of rosary. Also hanging from the gold bead necklaces were the so-called <b>agnus dei</b> or <b>relicario</b> pendants with a detached openwork panel using a lamb, cross, chalice, or monstrance design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The various insurrections and the Philippine Revolution also engendered a distinct iconography as seen inunique military and masonic insignias and amulets. Shapes such as triangles, sunbursts, stars, ovals, crossed swords, and guns, for example, were incorporated with symbols of the Katipunan and worn on the uniforms of the revolutionaries. As the Philippines remained essentially Catholic, Christian motifs continued to be used. Increased secularization during the American period, however, expanded the range of motifs to choose from, and designs of a nonreligious nature, consisting mostly of plant and floral forms, which could be rendered naturalistically or in more stylized fashion, gained added attention. Precious and semiprecious stones were mounted on gold settings, which established the overall shape of the pieces. This entire repertoire of designs from different periods in Philippine history in fact resonates even in contemporary pieces. Yet, in modern and contemporary jewelry, a challenge to this aesthetic language is attempted through more asymmetrical arrangements, a much more expanded palette, and experiments with rectilinear and angular compositions. The jewelry of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\"><strong>Eduardo Castrillo</strong></a>, for example, typifies this trajectory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While personal ornaments are generally understood to adorn the bodies of its wearers, they have other &ldquo;associative&rdquo; meanings, which could actually be essential to these objects&rsquo; &ldquo;beautifying&rdquo; properties. In the ancient past, such ornaments were believed to have magical functions, being used as protective amulets against evil spirits or as charms to ensure fertility. The form of the <b>lingling-o</b>, for example, which dates to the pre-Hispanic period, survives today among cultures in northern Luzon. It is believed to have protective and healing powers, and is also acknowledged as a symbol of fertility. In the tourist market of the Cordilleras, it is advertised as a good luck charm. The ancient funerary gold masks from Oton (in Iloilo) are also theorized as having protective properties for the dead. These gold sheets covering human orifices are believed to prevent evil spirits from entering the body. Even ancient Filipinos could not deny its significance; in death, certain ornaments were expressly meant to be worn. The Christianization of the islands did not remove jewelry&rsquo;s association with protection. Jewelry continued to function as a potent object to keep its wearer safe. Parents would pin medallions on babies and young children to protect them from danger, from an &ldquo;evil eye,&rdquo; and from <i>usog</i> (distress caused by strangers). The Saint Benedict medal, known since European medieval times for its &ldquo;devil-chasing&rdquo; properties, was especially popular for this purpose. Adults, on the other hand, would wear rosaries or scapulars. While the scapular is less worn today, the rosary continues to be used widely&mdash;ring, bracelet, and wristband rosaries have become quite accessible, serving both as amulet and talisman. This magic-like quality attached to religious objects is also attributed to <b>anting-anting</b>, a term for various types of amulets, which could give its wearers a range of possible powers, such as superhuman strength, invisibilty, or self-healing capabilities. Near the Quiapo Church in Manila, several types of anting-anting are being sold. Many of them incorporate esoteric elements drawn from Christian and masonic texts and iconography. Muslims have also their own versions of these amulets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many personal ornaments also function in the social sphere as prestige objects, signifying rank, status, and wealth. The lingling-o mentioned earlier also functions as a marker of status. The anthropomorphic jars from Ayub Cave (in Maitum, Sarangani Province) used in secondary burials are also possible clues to the importance of jewelry as prestige markers. These jars were found in an assemblage, which included glass beads, bracelets and pendants. The jars themselves had lids composed of the head and upper part of the chest (much like sculptural busts). The representation of the earlobes is interesting: some are like simple curled loops or rings attached to the side of the face, while in others, the lobes appear to jut out from the side of the face. When perforated, they might have represented large earrings, or perhaps the distension from ear plugs. Large or plugged earrings were types of jewelry associated with elite classes in some traditional Philippine societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish period, the possession of religious jewelry in the form of reliquaries or scapulars, would point to the wealth and status of its owners. These ornaments were not only used as religious paraphernalia but also served political interests. The cross was a badge of pragmatic import, a password to economic, political, and social mobility in colonial society. Even in decidedly secular contexts, accessories to clothing marked differences among classes of people. Elite women wore ornaments such as combs, hairpins, chains, necklaces, tamburin necklaces with pendant medallions, earrings, rings, bracelets, brooches, and pins. The men wore gold ornaments in the form of finials for their salakot, cuff links, handles for walking canes and riding crops, and saddle decorations used during official and social functions. The fashion of the period permitted the simultaneous use of all these types of jewelry. The ladies used peinetas, gold sheets embossed, chased, or engraved, and riveted onto silver combs. Even more elaborate were combs of gold filigree, which were sometimes set with pearls or corals, diamonds and other stones. Hairpins, called <b>pantoche</b> or <b>tusok</b>, were of various shapes; they had floral designs in filigree or in chased and engraved gold, with dangling gold beads and movable parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ornaments also marked ritualistic and emotional states, like happiness, mourning, triumph, celebration, and solemnity. The Ilongot, for example, could wear red hornbill earrings only if he had captured a head. The Bontok and the Ifugao, on the other hand, wore boar-tusk necklaces and armlets on the biceps after every successful war expedition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To wear ornaments is to draw attention to the parts of the body where they are worn. But apart from an awareness of the physical attributes to which ornaments are attached, meanings may also be heightened. A necklace could reference one&rsquo;s social rank; an earring, a young man&rsquo;s acceptance into the world of adult men. Ornaments may also be metaphor for the powers residing in the body&mdash;the head for thought, the chest for feeling, the limbs for strength and action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Ornamentation and the Body</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three major areas may constitute the surfaces, so to speak, on which jewelry may be applied: (1) the head and neck, (2) the upper body, and (3) the lower body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Types of ornaments for the head and neck include headdresses, earrings, ear pendants, ear plugs, necklaces and pendants. For example, among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> and Tboli, huge earrings, 9.8 cm in diameter, signified high status among males. There are four basic types of earrings among the ethnic tribes: the plug, the chandelier, the graduated ring series, and the ear-with-bib combination. Blaan plug earrings have a piece of mirror glass framed by tiny beads while the Kalinga wear them with front ends covered with embroidered cloth, coins, or glass bits. Chandelier earrings usually consist of long tassels of beads threaded on horsehair, but among the poor Batak, they are made of tufts of wild cotton or bundles of grass. The <b>kawat</b> of graduated rings may be worn only if the wearer&rsquo;s ears were pierced seven to eight times from top to lobe in which brass hoops are attached, the smallest at the top and the largest at the bottom. The<b> kowol</b> or bib earring is common among southern Philippine communities, like the Bagobo, Ubo, Tboli, and Blaan. An elaborate four-inch-deep bib made of lace, beads, glass, or metal teardrop pendants connects the two earrings and frames the face under the chin. The alluring bib catches light or quivers as the wearer smiles or speaks. During the Spanish period, earrings known as <b>criollas</b>, referencing the hoop earrings from the Caribbean, became quite popular. Ear pendants may be seen in the lingling-o, which may be described as a basic ring with bud-like projections on the edge of the ornament in each quarter. The jade double-headed pendant is a distinct type of lingling-o, similar to stone amulets found in the Middle East. In fact, the lingling-o finds similar forms in many parts of the world, such as India and Southeast Asia, and is believed by some to be of foreign origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are also numerous types of necklaces. The Isneg <i>menghal</i> or warrior used to wear elaborate necklaces of capiz-shell discs to signify head-hunting feats. The Ifugao <i>pangalapang</i>, made of trapezoidal mother-of-pearl pieces, was worn by both males and females as a status symbol. The Tboli wore a large variety of body jewelry, among them brilliant inch-thick chokers with geometric designs, convinced as they were that an attractive appearance pleased the gods. The Mansaka had prized necklaces, called <b>balliug</b>, a string of beads dangling to the waist containing carnelians and crocodile teeth. The most outstanding pieces of jewelry produced by Ilocano artisans were the necklaces in varied forms, the tamburin being the most popular. Chains started out as ordinary gold links and progressed into chains of braided gold wire, ropelike chains of varied forms, intricate vertebrae necklaces, square link-chains with tiny flower decorations, and the <b>alakdan</b> or scorpion necklace. These were used together with pendants. Most symbolic of the pride and power of the elite was the <b>alpahor</b> (from the Spanish <i>alfajor</i>, a type of round flat cookie), a double-linked flat necklace. Goldsmiths strove to outdo each other in embellishing not only the fronts but also the reverse sides of the medallions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jewelry for the upper body consists of shoulder bands, pectorals, arm bands, armlets, bracelets, wrist bands, wrist clasps, and rings. Perhaps one of the most remarkable pieces of precolonial jewelry is the almost four-kilo gold sash from the Surigao hoard. It is said to be an <b>upavita</b>, or &ldquo;sacred thread,&rdquo; used traditionally among the Hindus to mark their &ldquo;twice-born&rdquo; state, but certainly used in the Philippines to mark elite status. Among ethnolinguistic groups, the Bagobo have their &ldquo;musical&rdquo; jewelry exemplified by hollow brass bracelets containing little bells. Some bracelets were used as charms; the <b>sagay sagay</b> of the Manobo and Mansaka were made of black coral from shark-infested waters, worn to provide warning of imminent danger to the wearer. The Mandaya are unique in having pectorals, large silver disks pinned to the chest area, as part of female finery. During pre-Spanish times, gold rings were used for barter. But they were also used as symbols of power and royalty, and served as amulets. Some rings were engraved with ancient Malay script or bore stylized representations associated with fertility and good fortune. With western culture came the popularity of rings, which were used in betrothals and marriages. Much later, more fashionable types were introduced, such as the <b>lansadera</b>, so-called because it resembled the shape of the shuttle (lanzadera) used in weaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lower body ornaments consisted of different types of waistbands and belts, buckles, knee and leg bands, leglets and anklets. Archaeological excavations have yielded many precolonial belts and waistbands in chainwork or hammered gold. No belts of this type have been found anywhere else in the world. Among traditional communities, belts are also significant. They may be used to hold weapons or betel nut containers, and may also be indicators of rank. Among the Aeta, finely woven strands of <b>behuco</b> (from the Spanish <i>bejuco</i>, &ldquo;liana,&rdquo; a type of woody vine) were worn as leglets so that the wearer could have a wild boar&rsquo;s strength, stamina, and speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The numerous types of personal ornaments indicate the importance of adornment in Philippine culture. It is an art form that serves as extensions of the body and, as such, serves to reference aspects of its wearer. Personal ornaments define physical attributes, index affiliation in a community, emphasize sexual distinctions, and imply power relations. It is an art form well ingrained in the fabric of everyday life. The objects are used in exuberant moments of celebration, as well as in the throes of grief. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\"><strong>Rosalie Matilac</strong></a>, Jeannie Javelosa, and Marilyn R.

An image of a barn and a bakery seen through the window of his study, it was set on a pewter plate covered with a solution of white petroleum and pulverized bitumen of Judea (a type of asphalt). The image was formed eight hours after exposure to sunlight trapped inside a <b>camera</b> (from the Greek <i>kamera </i>or<i> </i>&ldquo;vault&rdquo;)<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1829 until his death in 1833, Niepce partly collaborated with his rival, painter Jacques Louis Daguerre. In 1837, Daguerre made his first successful photographs of views of his studio showing a relief sculpture. The French government bought his invention in 1839, after which Daguerre made public his experiments for making <b>daguerreotypes</b>. He used iodine vapor to make a silver-plated copper sheet light-sensitive. After exposure in a camera, the plate was treated with mercury vapor to bring out the picture, which was fixed in place by a salt solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary cameras began with the <b>camera obscura</b>, an instrument described by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century as rooted in optical principles known to Arabian astronomers in the year <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>0. By the 1700s, the camera obscura&rsquo;s darkened room or chamber had been changed to a box that had a lens on one side through which light could enter. When illuminated, this would project an image upside-down on a surface. The camera obscura helped artists make accurate drawings by allowing them to trace the projected picture on paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over the centuries, photo-sensitive glass plates, gelatin-coated paper sheets sensitized by bromide, and flexible roll film made from celluloid were invented to make positive and negative permanent images. Gold paint and powders were applied by hand to color sepia prints. The first effective color film, Kodachrome, was introduced in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Eastman box camera of 1888 and the first small handheld camera, made by the Leitz <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> of Germany in 1925, improved the clarity of photographs and made photography more practical. Cameras currently use photocells to measure exposure time, infrared beams to focus automatically, and silicon chips to provide computerized functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photography was first mentioned in literature from the Philippines in an 1841 report of Sinibaldo de Mas, the Spanish ambassador to China. Short of funds and unassisted by the local bureaucracy, de Mas reported that he had to sell his photographs&mdash;probably daguerreotypes. These pictures are still unlocated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1860, a still unidentified French engineer who visited the South Seas took the earliest known photographs from the Philippines. These were stereoscopic pictures of the Tinguian of Abra. These images were later found in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first foreign resident photographer and the first Filipino photography studio are also still unidentified though A. Honiss maintained a commercial studio in Manila as early as 1865. Access to photography equipment and supplies from abroad determined the level of activity of photographers in the country. European technology spread with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. According to an 1875 record, there were seven photographers practicing in the country. By 1902, there were 48 photographers&mdash;all men&mdash;in 14 studios; three in Bicol, the rest in Manila. The Dutch businessman Meerkamp van Embden, who served as the Netherlands&rsquo; honorary consul from 1889 to 1927, took many photographs of the Philippines showing his family&rsquo;s career in the country in a time of growing trade. His collection presents travels in the Philippines and several infrastructure projects. His images constitute an observant look at various indigenous peoples. Felix Laureano is considered the first Filipino who made pictures of his country, and his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>s de Filipinas</i></b><i> </i>(Memories of the Philippines), 1895, details customs and daily activities, profiles of the land and its people, and different structures at that time. These are mainly addressed to a foreign observer. Filipinos, as &ldquo;new peoples&rdquo; to the American public, were showcased and avidly photographed at the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. These photographs often showed the Filipinos&rsquo; unique, exotic characteristics (such as those of midgets and other physical distinctions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest exhibition of photography as art featured photographs taken by Miguel Reyes, in a section of the Asociacion International de Artistas art exhibition in 1908 in Escolta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rolled celluloid film, an invention of Kodak&rsquo;s George Eastman, was available in Manila as early as 1900. The establishment of the Kodak-Philippines office in 1928 further increased the possibilities for local photography. In 1946, the monopoly of photo supplies was broken, easing import restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1980, Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s Presidential Decree 1938 declared the first week of January as National Photography Week. This was to encourage the use of photography in developmental communications and nation building by the Professional Photographers&rsquo; Association of the Philippines (PPAP), then headed by Jose Sarmiento. The PPAP was organized by Bob Razon, Arsenio Veluz, Regalado Montemayor, and Escobar Ovejas. The National Photography Week Awards are now perhaps the most prestigious photography awards in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the National Photography Week in 1987, seven photography groups formed the Federation of Philippine Photographers Foundation (FPPF), the first umbrella association of photography clubs in the country. Its concerns include photography education, professionalization, and the availability of photography materials. There are many photography groups across the country&mdash;small and large, amateur and professional. Before the onset of more affordable digital photography equipment, commercial photographers were increasingly concerned with artistic or creative aspects of photography, while creative photographers in turn were being drawn to commercial work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more democratized landscape today has enabled even amateur photographers to do their own image-making. In the 1990s, the introduction of digital photography allowed the storage of image files in computers rather than printing from studios and photo shops. The production cost of practicing photography significantly lessened and enabled enthusiasts to be experimental with images using computer programs. The degree of manipulation of images affected the resulting images, prompting debates on the changing aesthetics of photography between digital and manual photography. Its inclusion in mobile phones in mid-2000 and the onset of social media dedicated to image sharing on the Internet have made photography a part of everyday life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photography in the country has the following primary functions: portraiture; travel, research, and news documentation; propaganda; advertising and fashion coverage; and as artist&rsquo;s tool and art medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Research on the history of Philippine photography continues. There is also the need to develop the exhibition and commercial value of Philippine photographs. Probably the most important contemporary exhibition of vintage photographs about the Philippines was <b><i>Colonial Philippines: Photographs 1860-1910</i></b>, curated by John Silva and Jonathan Best for the Philippine-American Research Center, University of California, Berkeley. It was held in the autumn of 1987 at the Lowie Museum of Anthropology, USA. Exhibited were 125 original prints, selected from 25,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Portraiture</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photography became popular because it provided access to images that consisted of the accurate likeness of a sitter at a cost cheaper than a painting. <b>Cartes-de-visite</b><i> </i>were affordable photos, measuring 4 x 2&frac12; in, the size of calling cards; they were patented in 1854 by Adolphe Eugene Disderi. The <b>tarjeta</b>, measuring 3&frac12; x 5&frac12; in so that it could be mailed as a postcard, became the next affordable photo print. In the last half of the 1800s, photo studios sprouted in Manila&rsquo;s business centers like Santa Cruz, Binondo, and Quiapo. Among them were Fotografia Pertierra, Fotografia Universal, Camara Fotografica, and Fotografia Enrique Schuren. By the 1930s, when photography had become a viable business, prosperous provinces, like Iloilo and Cebu, began to draw studios and itinerant photographers to set up shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 19th century standardized settings for photographs to be taken, with fancy chairs, pedestals, curtains, and painted backdrops. Studios like Voigt&rsquo;s advertised in print and offered the services of a <b>peinadora</b><i> </i>or makeup expert free of charge. Photo-portraits, vertical full-frame or bust, were hung prominently on living-room and office walls. Life-size photos became status symbols. Small photos enclosed in standing frames were displayed on top of tables and pianos. Portraits were usually taken to mark graduations, weddings, coronations of festival queens, and award ceremonies. At the turn of the century, it was customary to photograph a corpse before its burial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photos were exchanged as a sign of friendship. Filipinos traveling abroad collected portraits of friends from foreign lands. The Lopez Memorial Library and Museum keeps a historic album of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong>. In the 1920s, a bachelorette showed special affection to a suitor by giving him her portrait. American soldiers stationed in the Philippines before the Philippine-American War in 1899 were a ready market for souvenir portraits. A popular souvenir photograph depicted an &ldquo;American hero&rdquo; pointing at a Filipino posed as a captured insurgent pleading for mercy, while another paid Filipinos to pose as dead at the American&rsquo;s feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The increase in the circulation of newspapers and magazines and the improved quality of print media also raised the value of portraiture in the making of celebrity. The staff photographers of magazines gained prestige as their publications conducted beauty contests, which consisted of published portraits of both candidates and winners. Joaquin Reyes and Carlos Alcazar of the <b><i>El</i></b> <b><i>Renacimiento</i></b>, Augusto Fuster of <b><i>Excelsior</i></b>, and Voigt of <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino </i></b>were popular portraitists in the early 1900s. Star Studio was also popular during the American period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1934 to 1956, EduardoMasferre photographed the indigenous groups of the Cordilleras. Prominent post-World War II portraitists include Chat Peypoch (who specialized in photography of children), Bob Razon, Arsenio and Sofronio Veluz, and Regalado Montemayor. Sonny Camarillo is known for his portraits of beautiful women, and Rupert Jacinto gained attention as a portraitist of international celebrities. Mandy Navasero takes sensitive portraits of people from all walks of life and, like many Filipinos now armed with imaging devices, documents both people and places encountered in her travels. A shift toward less straightforward portraiture playing on the physical and chemical aspects of the medium would be found, by the 1970s onward, in the work of Nap Jamir II, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, Neal Oshima,  <strong><strong> <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3812\"><strong>Wig Tysmans</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> </strong>, among others. A minimalist aesthetic informs artists such as Isa Lorenzo and Jake Versoza. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\"><strong>Experimental</strong></a> photography in a much more broadly conceived portrait genre continues in the conceptual practices of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3497\"><strong>Kiri Dalena</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3498\"><strong>Gaston Damag</strong></a>, Jed Escueta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3558\"><strong>Lyra Garcellano</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3617\"><strong>Romeo Lee</strong></a>, Wawi Navarozza, Gina Osterloh, Steve Tirona, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3841\"><strong>Eric Zamuco</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Research and Documentation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early photographs recorded both the typical and the unusual for travelers, anthropologists, medical experts, and the colonial bureaucracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1880s, the British Fox Talbot developed a cross screen to reproduce photographs with a rotogravure printing press<i>. <b>La Ilustracion Filipina </b></i>introduced <b>foto-litografia</b><i> </i>(photo lithography) in 1892. <b><i>Los Domingos del Diario de Manila </i></b>featured photographs, along with paintings and sketches, in 1896. The Cheofre Lithographic Company achieved clear photographic reproduction in their documentation of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato celebration in 1897.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Englishman Roger Fenton took the first war photos during the Crimean War of 1856. Likewise, field correspondents from the United States (US) Signal Corps, <b><i>Harper&rsquo;s</i></b>, and <b><i>Leslie&rsquo;s Weekly</i></b> accompanied the US Army of 1898. President Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government issued press passes to local and foreign correspondents and photographers. With their equipment on horseback and carabao-drawn carts, they not only recorded battlefronts but also local lifestyles; these were printed in newspapers and books. This is exemplified in the work of Harry Whitfield Harnish, an American soldier, who opened a photo studio in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. His photograph of <b><i>Captain Alex Davis&rsquo; Child and Nurse</i></b>, done between 1898 and 1907, presents a mother and child theme charged with racial and colonial tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On-the-spot <b>photojournalism</b> was highlighted during the Tercentenary of Newsprinting celebration in 1911. Magazines published more photos than the daily tabloids. The monthly <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino </i></b>ran an account of the first airplane accident on the islands&mdash;that is, a full photo coverage of Mr Sevimming and his plane as they crashed outside Bautista, Pangasinan. Fires, floods, funerals, parades, political meets, banquets, countryside development, and celebrities were the staple subjects in news pictorials. For the first time Filipino readers saw how other parts of the country looked while experiencing visualized history in the making. Professional and hobbyist photographers were encouraged to submit photos. Among the contributors were Sol Naciente, S. A. Figueras, Cebu Photo Material Company, and Camera Supply Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American colonial government set up the first tourism office of the Philippines in the early 1900s. It was the first initiative to promote the islands not just for curious local customs but for scenic beauty. Promotional materials as well as postcards and picture albums opened up tourist markets, providing employment for photographers. The Department of Tourism continues to promote travel photography. <b><i>Sunday <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>ne Magazine </i></b>ran a series with photographs by Manuel Arellano, called <b><i>Manila Beautiful</i></b>. Current specialists in travel photography are Jose Sarmiento, George Tapan, and Francis Rivera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1870s to the early 1900s, anthropological research by Europeans and Americans supplemented by photography brought Philippine culture to world notice. Valuable photographs were taken in the ethnological expeditions led by Alexander Schadenberg, Hans Meyer, Jose Montano, Paul Rey, Alfred Marche, Dean Worcester, and Roy Barton. These were in aid of anthropometric measurements being taken by anthropologists, particularly of the human cranium in order to determine mental inferiority or superiority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The exhibit of photographs of the Philippines displayed in 1904 at the<b><i> Louisiana Purchase Exposition</i></b> in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, consisting of 2,000 prints, remains unsurpassed in scope and number, and the way they continue to surface in the work of scholars writing on the fraught relations of America and the Philippines demonstrates the potency of photographic images in spurring research and new thinking. Many of these images have been digitally archived for the project <b><i>The United States and Its Territories (1870-1925: The Age of Imperialism)</i></b>, where 2,100 photographs from the Special Collections Library of the University of Michigan can be accessed and studied. Filipino anthropologists and archaeologists continue to use photography as an investigative tool. Scholar Benito Vergara Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Displaying Filipinos: Photography and Colonialism in Early 20th Century Philippines</i></b>, 1995, articulated how the domain of images taken by Americans to represent the country to fellow Americans is very much integrated in the colonial narrative of progress and civilization of the colonial regime. In the same manner, Jonathan Best&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Picture Postcards 1900-1920</i></b>, 1994 and <b><i>A Philippine Album: American Era Photographs, 1900-1930</i></b>, 1998, showed how Americans saw the Filipinos. Analyn Salvador-Amore&rsquo;s <b><i>Tapping Ink, Tattooing Identities: Tradition and Modernity in Contemporary Kalinga Society</i></b> utilized the Dean C. Worcester Pictures Collection at the University of Michigan as an ethnographic tool to provoke dialogue about contemporary tattooing practices among the indigenous peoples of Northern Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1911, Eusebio Nievera Sr won a competition sponsored by the American Society of Photographers, making him the first Filipino recipient of an international award for photography. In 1931, Vicente Mills Sr was awarded a diploma of honor for his photograph titled <b><i>Native Architecture </i></b>by the Kodak International Salon World Contest held in Geneva. In 1981, Angsin Taguibao, a still-documentary expert, received the Photographic Society of America (PSA) Diamond Star Award for consistently entering monochrome prints of high quality in PSA-recognized international salons worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In June 1922, the forthnightly <b><i>Photo News: A Graphic Review in Rotogravure</i></b> first appeared in Manila&rsquo;s newsstands. It was the first authentic Filipino pictorial magazine. In 1925, a contest was sponsored by Denniston&rsquo;s, a photo-equipment supplier. Among the winning photographs were landscapes, portrait shots of local belles, beautiful Filipinas in native dress, as well as human interest themes, like the Quiapo Church beggars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over the years, Philippine newspapers and magazines have prided themselves in their staff photographers whose works have competed in industry-sponsored contests. Among the prestigious competitions in photojournalism was the National Press Club&ndash;Elizalde photojournalism contest, which ran from 1954 to 1988. Early winners include Honesto Vitug, Dominador Suba, and Benjamin Roxas. Vitug documented the presidents of the Philippines from Emilio Aguinaldo to Corazon Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Well-known photojournalists are Vitug (first Filipino on the Associated Press roster), Nap Jamir Sr, Teodulo Protomartir (called &ldquo;Dean of Philippine Photography&rdquo; because of his interest in teaching photography since the 1950s), Nap Jamir Jr, Sonny Yabao, Fabian Roxas, Filemon Tutay, Ed Santiago, and Benjamin Roxas, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1950, Tutay of the <b><i>Philippine Free Press Magazine </i></b>organized the Press Photographers Association of the Philippines (PPAP). In 1988, the Photojournalists Guild of the Philippines was formed by members of the PPAP who were protesting against suppression of the press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nath Guttierez pioneered cultural photography or the documentation of cultural aspects, when he became the first and sole photographer of the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP) from 1970 till his death in 1974. He was the first Filipino to receive academic training in photography from Germany. In 1983, the CCP sponsored a documentation photo contest to record artistic activities, such as theater performances, art exhibits, and related outdoor performances held in and outside the CCP. The competition highlighted cultural coverage as a specialized topic of photography. Among the specialists for cultural events coverage are Boaner Medina, Ernesto Caballero, and Renato S. Rastrollo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photographers and academic researchers also collaborated on book projects that highlight the aesthetic qualities of indigenous and traditional arts. Wig Tysmans worked with Marian Roces for <b><i>Sinaunang Habi</i></b> (Traditional Weaving) and Elena Mirano for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>Subli</strong></a>: Isang Sayaw sa Apat na Tinig</i></b> (Subli: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Dance in Four Voices). Masato Yokohama did the photos for Roberto Maramba&rsquo;s <b><i>Form and Splendor: Personal Adornment of Northern Luzon Ethnic Groups, Philippines</i></b>, 1998, while Wig Tysmans, BG Hernandez, and Ramon Cantonjos did the photography for Ramon Villegas&rsquo;s book <b><i>Ginto: History Wrought in Gold</i></b>, 2004. In the performing arts,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong> was the subject of Jaime Zobel de Ayala&rsquo;s book <b><i>Zobel Dancer</i></b>, 1988, as well as <b><i>In Performance</i></b> by Doreen Fernandez with photography by Rudy Vidad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scientific research, like astronomy, requires special photographic skills. Underwater photography is done by specialists and amateurs for research and as a hobby. Filipino physicians, especially those engaged in laboratory or academic activities, were among the first to learn photography. Among the photographers trained abroad in medical photography is British-trained Ben Laxina, and Ibarra Deri who specializes in photomicrography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cultural anthropology and sociology have also been behind the stream of pictures depicting ethnographies of the everyday life of Filipinos living across and beyond the Philippines, in the uplands, to city streets, and at sites peopled by expatriate Filipinos. Artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3578\"><strong>Tommy Hafalla</strong></a>, Nana Buxani, Veejay Villafranca, Kat Palasi, and Xyza Bacani are just some of the photographers working in this vein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:4.0pt\">Propaganda</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipinos realized the vital role of photography as an effective communication tool when they first saw the pictorial coverage of the opening of the Malolos Congress in Sep 1898. <b><i>La <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1190\"><strong>Independencia</strong></a> </i></b>praised Jose Pi&ntilde;on&rsquo;s clear photos and Pedro Chivi&rsquo;s documentation of the establishment of Asia&rsquo;s first constitutional democracy. Chivi&rsquo;s photograph of Filipino floats on parade in Malolos, Bulacan has become iconic. Chivi&rsquo;s Plaza del Conde studio in Binondo sold photos of Republican troops alongside their respective generals, as well as pictures related to the War for Philippine Independence, and of the Congressional Hall in the Barasoain Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Government information agencies continue to use photography for posters, brochures, and other materials which promote official programs and policies. The Government Photographers of the Philippines, composed of photographers working in government offices, was organized by Malaca&ntilde;an Press office photo-section chief Manuel Bulaong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most powerful civic campaigns using photographs, &ldquo;Disiplina ang Kailangan&rdquo; (Discipline Is Necessary), was launched at the start of the martial law government of President Marcos in 1972. The privately sponsored &ldquo;Catch a Cheater&rdquo; photography contest was used by anti-Marcos government groups to prevent election fraud in 1985. Agencies, like the Population Commission used visual aids in public educational campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Human rights and ecological advocates as well as charities and fund raisers for crisis situations are among civic groups that use photography calculatedly and powerfully. Such were photographs by Alex Baluyut, Luis Liwanag, Bullit Marquez, and Sigfred Balatan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Advertising</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photographers traditionally began as commercial portraitists, photojournalists, and hobbyists. Advancements in science, technology, and marketing methods increased specialization. The role of photography in selling products, services, and personalities has steadily increased since the early 1900s, particularly during the 1970s, with the growth of the Philippine advertising industry, the public relations sector, and mass media. With the inclusion of graphic arts as a course in university fine arts programs, photography became a subject of legitimate academic study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising photographers serve on the staff of agencies and also set up their own companies. They are considered specialists due to the demands of creative conceptualizing and product lighting for print advertisements, calendars, brochures, flyers, point-of-purchase displays, posters, and even guides for billboards. Filipino advertising photographers service local and international clients. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only as good as your last shot&rdquo; is the unofficial policy in the advertising field. Competition in the industry has further energized photography as far as creative talent and professionalism go. As creative directors and clients make demands for creative effects, photographers have had to introduce and appropriate new photo technology. Being able to offer an advertiser that competitive edge has allowed photographers to increase professional rates. Access to equipment and expanded platforms for advertising have reinforced popular interest in photography&rsquo;s potential just as this has led to overproduction and deluge of sensory stimuli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1988, the Advertising Photographers of the Philippines was organized to professionalize advertising photography upon the initiative of Emil Davocol, Eduviges Huwang aka &ldquo;Edi,&rdquo; Nelson Rivera, Edgar <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>, John Chua, and Bien Bautista, among others. Some of the well-known contemporary advertising photographers are Davocol, Huwang, Rivera, Chua, Mark Floro, Pio Capiral, Eddie Go, and NikRiccio. There are also some who specialize in food photography, product stills, and action formats. Foreign training in university and atelier programs offering degrees and short course certificates have enabled new photographers and upgraded local capabilities. To date, there is no collegiate degree program for photography in Philippine schools as photography is still subsumed under broader design and arts programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The test of an advertising photographer&rsquo;s mettle are international competitions for advertising campaigns and products. In 1976, the International Multicolor Exhibitors Competition awarded a gold medal to <b><i>Angelus</i></b>, a posterized color photo of birds in flight by Davocol. He also received the Best Four-Picture Series Award and the Best Entrant from Asia Award. The Mongkok Photographic Society honored Davocol further by awarding his creativity at the same exhibit. In 1980, Davocol returned with a posterized evening shot titled <b><i>Quiet Beacons</i></b>, adjudged as the &ldquo;Best Local Entrant&rdquo; and awarded another gold medal. Davocol&rsquo;s winning streak is credited with breaking the hiatus of Filipinos in these international competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Until 1992, the highest advertising award was the CLIO Award given in the United States. Each category in the annual event would have as many as 27,000 entries from around the world. Philippine advertising agencies have been making it to the finalist rounds. Among photographic stills that have brought credit to both agency and client as finalists in the CLIO are Pampers&rsquo; <b><i>Leak a Like</i></b> by Dante Mara for the Ace-Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Incorporated, 1989; Magnolia&rsquo;s <b><i>Why Fry Economy When You Can Fry First Class?</i></b> by Chua for Ace-Saatchi, 1988 (also awarded the Best Copy for Print in the 1988 Creative Guilds Award); Philippine Airlines&rsquo; <b><i>The Beauty of the Philippines: Beaches</i></b> shot by Davocol for Avia Communications Incorporated, Best Print Campaign category, 1991; and Blue Diamond Nuts&rsquo; <b><i>Everyday</i></b> by Joey Ibay, 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other important foreign photography awards that test the advertising photographer include those given by the Asian Advertising Congress, which in 1989 awarded Philippine Airlines&rsquo; <b><i>The Beauty of the Philippines </i></b>photos by Bautista and Bolix Suzara the Best Print Campaign Award for 1989. In 1989 and 1990, McCann-Erickson Incorporated received a finalist citation from the New York Festival of Advertising for its Del Monte Pineapple Juice&rsquo;s <b><i>Label</i></b> and Levi&rsquo;s Black Jeans&rsquo; <b><i>Ink</i></b> advertisements photographed by Chua and Charlie Almonte, respectively. In 1991, McCann-Erickson received a bronze medal for the <b><i>Amen</i></b> advertisement photographed by Bayani for Levi&rsquo;s 501 jeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising campaigns, as well as color magazines, posters, and billboards, have increased public response to and interest in the attractiveness or impact, and aesthetic or graphic quality of photography. These have also resurrected experimentation in darkroom and computerization techniques as applied to the shooting and printing of a photograph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fashion has also opened up creative dimensions for photographers. Fashion coverage is an adjunct of advertising, press photography, and portraiture, and is now a separate line of specialization. Recognized fashion photographers include Sonny Yabao, Jun de Leon, Wig Tysmans, Manny Goloyugo, Edgar Santiago, and Pancho Escaler. Wedding, sports, travel, and underwater photography are other fields of commercial photography that have made the practice of photographers successful and sustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Photojournalism</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photographers affiliated with Philippine and international news agencies have pushed the documentary artistic capacity of the medium to an ever-widening extent. Under American colonization, Dean Worcester&rsquo;s photographs of indigenous Filipinos, described as tribal and exotic, were printed in the <b><i>National Geographic </i></b>magazine<b><i>.</i></b> Articles on the Philippines, prompted by studies in anthropology and tourism, were illustrated with images of bare-chested Filipinas, prompting curiosity and controversy. The Nov 1913 issue featured hand-colored photographic illustrations of Filipinos accompanying Worcester&rsquo;s article &ldquo;The Non-Christian Peoples of the Philippine Islands: With an Account of What Has Been Done for Them under American Rule,&rdquo; juxtaposed the backwardness of the colonized Filipinos who were &ldquo;in need&rdquo; of American guidance and benevolence. By 1915, photographer Charles Matin, who collaborated with Worcester, would head the National Geographic Society Photographic Laboratory. Continuing in the long history of featuring tribal images in the Philippines, the magazine would later feature in 1972 a spurious stone-age inhabitants in Mindanao called &ldquo;Tasaday,&rdquo; which sparked a debate in the politics of image-making and authenticity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Willie Vicoy&rsquo;s gripping snapshot of a Vietnamese woman carrying her stricken child appeared on the front page of <b><i>Time </i></b>and <b><i>Newsweek</i> </b>magazines in March 1975 and became influential in shaping international opinion on the personal cost of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2317\"><strong>Vietnam War</strong></a></strong>. Albert Garcia&rsquo;s death-defying photograph of a van escaping the wave of ashes coming from the just-erupted Mount Pinatubo astounded millions of viewers worldwide and was included in <b><i>Time: Great Images of the 20th Century </i></b>and <b><i>National Geographic: 100 Best Pictures</i></b>. Working for Agence France Presse, Romeo Gacad covered the 1991 Gulf War and 2001 Afghan War and was an embedded photographer with the US Army Third Infantry Division in the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1986 EDSA Revolt and its sequel in 2001 involved numerous Filipino photojournalists who seized the opportunity to cover their own country and offer the world their views. The works of Andy Hernandez, Vicoy, and Noli Yamsuan were part of the book <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong> !: Images of the Philippine Revolt </i></b>while those by John K. Chua and Manuel B. Ferrer comprised <b><i>People Power: An Eyewitness History</i></b>&mdash;these two being important photographic collections on the revolution. In 2011, the business daily <b><i>Business  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></strong> </i></b> published <b><i>The Human Tide of History: The Protest Movement from the Aquino Assassination to EDSA</i></b>.<i> </i>Anvil Publishing released <b><i>EDSA 2: A Nation in Revolt; A Photographic Journal</i></b> immediately after EDSA 2 in 2001 to commemorate the uprising. Other photojournalists who covered the political events before, during, and after the EDSA Revolt are Alex Baluyut, Joe Galvez, Vin Toledo, Jun <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceta, Melvyn Calderon, Mon Acasio, Bullit Marquez, and Luis Liwanag. American photojournalist Kim Komenich, who covered EDSA for the US newspaper <b><i>Examiner</i></b>, provides an interesting take on how a foreign eye sees sociopolitical change in a familiar-yet-strange polity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fast-paced nature of violence has become a challenge for photography&rsquo;s capacity to still the moving image. In the 1980s and 1990s, reports on the raging counterinsurgency campaign in rural areas became staple fare in Philippine and international newspapers and magazines. Photographic documentary projects on slum eviction, illegal drugs, street crimes, gangster culture, and prostitution have been a regular subject for both amateur and professional photographers and catapulted Filipino images to international attention. Photojournalists such as Jun Sepe and Sigfred Balatan are just two examples of lensmen who consciously transgress the categories of coverage and art in their image-making focused on disaster and displacement in relation to development issues. Other notable Filipino photojournalists are Johnny Acasio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3433\"><strong>Dick Baldovino</strong></a>, Joan Bondoc, Sonny Camarillo, Romeo Gacad, Albert Garcia, Edwin Tuyay, and Vicoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The documenting of violent and tragic events has also surfaced ethical issues regarding the practice of both artists and photojournalists. Apart from the angle of the subject&rsquo;s volition, safety issues also come into play. In this regard Ben Roxas of the <b><i>Manila Times</i></b> was photographed dying in the Plaza Miranda bombing. Vicoy went to cover the counterinsurgency war in Cagayan province in late Apr 1986 and died when the army jeep he was riding with soldiers was ambushed by New People&rsquo;s Army rebels. On 27 Jul 1986, civilian Steve Salcedo was mercilessly lynched by Marcos loyalists in front of photographers, raising the question of whether the lensmen should have continued with coverage or intervened by helping the victim in such life-threatening circumstances. Martin Castor of the tabloid <b><i>Pilipino Ngayon</i></b><i> </i>died on reportorial duty while covering the coup attempt against the Aquino administration on 28 Aug 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Artist&rsquo;s Tool and Art Medium</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino artists were early to appreciate the archival role of photography. JuanLuna and FelixResurreccionHidalgo had all their landmark works photographed. Augusto Fuster was the first painter in the country to use his camera to compose pictures as paintings. Painters, like FernandoAmorsolo, Mauro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a> Santos, and AngKiukok, used photographs of their subjects as references for paintings. Painter JuvenalSanso makes hand-painted transparencies for projection and printing. Among outstanding innovations in the social realist stream is painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>&rsquo;s Larawan (Photograph)<b><i> </i></b>series painted in the 1970s onward, inspired by photo images taken of Filipinos during colonial times. Photographs, in whole or in part, have been incorporated into collages and constructivist works. The role of photography among photorealists also cannot be overlooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of photography as primary form of individual expression has acquired a growing appeal among both professional and amateur photographers. In 1928, the first photography club, Camera Club of the Philippines, was formed under the initiative of Manuel de Cartagena. It provides camaraderie and lessons in creative photography for amateurs and hobbyists. It is also the first local camera club to participate in bilingual photography-teaching exhibits conceptualized for the general Filipino public in coordination with a Philippine art museum. Undertaken by the Metropolitan Museum of Manila (The Met), its <b><i>Pilipinas <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/621\"><strong>Nating</strong></a></i></b> <b><i>Napakaganda: The Ecology of Aesthetics </i></b>(Our Beautiful Philippines: The Ecology of Aesthetics), opened in 1988, and was a landmark in the employment of artistic photography to promote both environmentalism and aesthetic appreciation in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PhilippineArtGallery hosted the first one-person photography exhibit featuring Nap Jamir Sr in 1954. Photography as an art form received a boost when the CCP was established in 1969. At the time, CCP&rsquo;s visual arts director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3385\"><strong>Raymundo Albano</strong></a> and The Met director ArturoLuz were proponents of modernism and contemporary experimentation. On 15 Aug 1974, Albano curated <b><i>Otherwise Photography</i></b>, a statement on how conceptual photography could engage artists beyond technical concerns. The curatorial charge did not even require participants to handle cameras or make their own prints. It installed print serializations, segment presentations, and &ldquo;instant&rdquo; photos in a manner unique for Manila at that juncture. The seven participating artists were professional photographers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4595\"><strong>Butch Perez</strong></a>, Franco Patriarca, and Nap Jamir Jr, along with Albano, Johnny Manahan, MarianPastor-Roces, and AlanRivera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1980s, The Met, which specialized in the bringing over of foreign-loan exhibitions, exposed local artists to original photographic work by prominent foreign artists, such as David Hamilton, 1982; Henri Cartier-Bresson, 1990; John Thomson, 1991; and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, 1992. Other museums, like CCP&rsquo;s Contemporary Art Museum of the Philippines, Ayala Museum, National Museum, and commercial art galleries, like Diviana and Luz, increased their exhibitions of Filipino and Asian photographers in group and solo shows. In general, however, comprehensive photography-specific exhibitions come few and far between with only two figuring in the last decade: <em><b>Swarm in the Aperture: Recent Photography in the Philippines</b></em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">, held at the National Museum of the </span></em>Philippines, 2008; and <b><i>Beyond Frame: Philippine Photomedia</i></b> at the Ateneo Art Gallery, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photographers associated with creative photography are Davocol, Tysmans, Goloyugo, Patriarca, Bautista, Baldovino, Rodolfo de Leon, Quincy Castillo, JaimeZobelde Ayala, and Francis Escaler. Patrick de Koenigswarter and Neal Oshima are foreign photographers based in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this era of digital technology, today&rsquo;s photographers variably manifest a concern for creative composition, lighting, and the thematics of their works. The rising expectations for instantaneous imaging and circulation of these pictures, along with the value of pictorial media, weigh against the photographer&rsquo;s need not just to document but to express personal feelings about their subjects. Hybrid approaches to visualizing techniques and visual handling thus continue to challenge both artists&rsquo; and photojournalistic orientations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like other imaging media, photography attracts artists who take to it primarily for its formal possibilities. Ricardo Soler&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Photography: The Best of &rsquo;81</i></b>, 1982, argued for the solid consideration of photography as an art form. The role of self-expression through camerawork, as well as processing, printing, and installation techniques are reflective of late 20th-century culture in which technology, cerebral conceptualization, and affective disposition interface as influences in the production of art. More recently, the <b><i>Beyond Frame</i></b> exhibition mounted by 12 Filipino artists highlighted the troubled history of the country by utilizing the combination of photography with installation art and new media. Earlier, <b><i>Filipino, Portraits by Jaime Zobel de Ayala</i></b>, 1987, depicted the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; of the 1986 EDSA Revolt, from Cory Aquino and Jaime Cardinal Sin to the photographers and nuns who figured in the revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This unproblematic shifting between formalist and contextual concerns may variably be seen in photography by artists such as Toto Labrador, Rachel Rillo, Corrine San Jose, and Jenifer Wofford. Questions of subjectivity and agency have been raised in regard to the work of Mark Gary and Poklong Anading. Notions of presence and absence within the photographic frame either through tactical positioning of the lens or through digital manipulation figure in the work of artists like Paul Pfeiffer. The use of the image as raw collage fodder is seen in <b>transmedia</b> work by Kidlat de Guia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3623\"><strong>Tita Lim</strong></a>, and Romina Diaz. That photographs can serve as both context-rich and installative element can be found in the bodies of work of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3435\"><strong>Yason Banal</strong></a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3475\"><strong>Lena Cobangbang</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3562\"><strong>Nona Garcia</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3573\"><strong>Katya Guerrero</strong></a>, At Maculangan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3639\"><strong>Lani Maestro</strong></a>, Riza Manalo, Manny Migri&ntilde;o, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3747\"><strong>Norberto Roldan</strong></a>, Kreskin Sugay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3834\"><strong>MM Yu</strong></a>; or as post-process-installative document in the work of Gary Ross Pastrana; and as surrealist medium in the work of Emmanuel Santos and Frank Callaghan. This interface of form and meaning making underlines how the medium remains potent despite its potential to overpower and its associations with self-indulgence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of late, an explosion of photographic work on and/or by Filipinos in the diaspora have gained traction on social media as well as in more traditional exhibition platforms. The work of Ric Rocamora on Filipino military veterans in the United States is an example. Xyza Cruz Bacani, a Filipina domestic helper in Hong Kong, and her crafting of remarkable pictures of the places and peoples she traverses as overseas worker, provide an interesting view from below of the imponderable lives of Filipinos living in flux and under less than optimal conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:8.0pt\">Photography Studies</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There has been a significant growth in the study of photography in the Philippines&mdash;in the fields of artistry and technique, on the one hand, and history, theory, and criticism, on the other. Countless photography groups, institutions, and organizations initiate print and publications, social media discussions, workshops, exhibits, equipment sales, fairs, and festivals. Notable among these are the following: <b><i>Philippine Photography Blog</i></b>, <b><i>Digital Photographer Philippines</i></b> magazine, Pinoy Photography community (PiPho), Philippine Center for Creative Imaging Institute of Photography, Philippine Bird Photography Forum, the Federation of Philippine Photographers Foundation, Philippine Photographers (Ph Photo), ASEAN-Korea <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a> Competition, Philippine Photo Festival, and Manila Photo (a weeklong photography festival).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the FPPF, and the chairmanship of Huwang, much effort has been made to increase local opportunities to improve photographic skills and creative approaches. With photographer Eliseo Casia and Celia Angeles, an art teacher interested in photography education, FPPF has pursued annual photo exhibits accompanied by workshops and seminars wherein professionals teach and interact with students. Composition and chiaroscuro are among aesthetic concerns in the basic FPPF learning modules. Picking up from earlier artist-led ventures, such as Blacksoup in Cubao-X and the defunct Photography Art Center in Makati, the artist couple Katya Guerrero and At Maculangan set up Pioneer Studios not only for professional shoots but as a converging point for photographers and other artists interested in slideviews, workshop-critiques, and talks done alongside artbooks, a distribution hub for critical literature on all of the Philippine arts. In addition, many photography contests, sponsored by local and foreign companies, nonprofit institutions, and photo suppliers, continue to uphold creativity as criterion when selecting winners. In light of the digital revolution in photomedia, other formal and informal aggrupations, such as the Digital Photographers of the Philippines and various Instagram groups, have also played into the broadened practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Academic institutions both here and abroad have increasingly studied photography within the disciplines of fine arts, mass and visual communication, art history, anthropology, and history. The Asian Center for Journalism of the Ateneo de Manila University offers certificate and diploma courses in photojournalism conducted by leading international photojournalists. Notable literature on photography include the following: Jonathan Best&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Picture Postcards: 1900-1920</i></b>, 1994, and <b><i>A Philippine Album: American Era Photographs 1900-1930</i></b>, 1998; Benito Vergara Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Displaying Filipinos: Photography and Colonialism in Early 20th Century Philippines</i></b>, 1995; Enrique de la Cruz and Pearlie Rose Baluyut&rsquo;s <b><i>Confrontations, Crossings, and Convergence: Photographs of the Philippines and the United States, 1898-1998</i></b>, 1998; Maria Serena Diokno&rsquo;s <b><i>Voices and Scenes of the Past: Philippine American War Retold</i></b>, 1999; Felix Laureano&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2282\"><strong>Recuerdos de Filipinas</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1895 (original in Spanish), and translated into English in 2001; Art Studies Foundation&rsquo;s <b><i>The Philippines through the Lens of an American Soldier (1898-1907): The Harry Whitfield Harnish Photographic Collection</i></b>, 2004; John L.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\"><strong>Pottery</strong></a> </b>consists of functional and decorative objects made from clay and fired at high temperatures. <b>Ceramics</b> (from the Greek<i> keramikos </i>or &ldquo;potter&rdquo;) is also a term used, although ceramics has a wider application and includes objects for industrial use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pottery is divided into three types: <b>earthenware</b> or <b>terra-cotta</b> (literally, dried earth), which is made from porous clay and fired at a relatively low temperature, ranging from 1700&deg;F to 2<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>&deg;F; <b>stoneware</b>, which is made from a mixture of clay and feldspar and fired at a temperature ranging from 2220&deg;F to 2230&deg;F; and <b>porcelain</b>, which is made from kaolin (a pure and white clay from China), and feldspar, then fired at a temperature ranging from 2500&deg;F to 2700&deg;F. Pottery can be covered by a nonporous layer made from metal oxides, called glaze, or it can be unglazed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Process</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The preparation of material for making pottery involves quarrying clay from riverbanks or clay deposits, and cleaning this of impurities by removing branches and twigs and by sedimentation, which involves the mixing of clay with water until it forms a creamy substance. The mixture is allowed to stand for a considerable amount of time to allow sand, pebbles, and stone to settle at the bottom of the mixture, thus leaving the clay body clean. Clean clay is separated from the sediments and is allowed to dry until it reaches a doughlike consistency. This is then mixed in proper proportions with other substances, including feldspar, sand, ash, and metal filings. The proportion of clay and other additives produces a specific type of pottery. For instance, <b>burnay</b><i> </i>from Ilocos Sur belongs to <b>stoneware</b> and is made by adding sand to clay. This mixture is thoroughly kneaded either by machine; by hand; by foot, as in the case among the potters of Iloilo; or by an animal, such as the carabao among Ilocos burnay potters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once the clay is properly prepared, objects can be made from it. There are six common ways of working with clay: slab making, coiling, turn modeling or throwing, hand modeling or anvil-and-paddle method, cradling, and molding. The <b>slab method</b> involves rolling out the clay into flat sheets of slab and joining them together. <b>Coiling</b> means rolling out clay to form cylindrical strings and coiling these to form a bowl, pot, or jar. <b>Throwing</b> uses the potter&rsquo;s wheel. The <b>anvil-and-paddle</b> method uses a stone or pot shard and a wooden paddle to shape an object, thin it out, and open it. <b>Cradling</b> involves shaping an open and shallow object by moulding it on another object, like a basket, a piece of cloth, or a leaf. <b>Molding</b>, customarily used for decorative works, uses a plaster of paris mold in which slip is poured and allowed to dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once bone hard, the shaped clay is ready for firing. Firing removes all the moisture from the clay and renders the clay durable. Firing is done either in a kiln; a brick oven, which can be heated to high temperature by electricity, gas, or wood; or an open pit, a depression in the ground into which the clay objects are covered with flammable material, like wood, coconut husks, and fronds, then fired. The time of firing and cooling depends on the material. Stoneware takes 12 hours to fire and 12 hours to cool. Fired pieces are called <b>bisque</b>.<b> </b>Bisque can be the final stage in the creation of pottery, or it can be glazed&mdash;that is, covered with a vitreous solution that renders the piece impervious. At times, bisque are decoratively painted with enamel paints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Terra-cotta pieces made by the different ethnolinguistic groups in the Philippines consist largely of cooking utensils, stoves, decorative items, and toys. Cooking pots are made by following three methods: hand modeling (anvil-and-paddle method), turn modeling (thrown method), and a combination of methods (hand modeling, molding, coiling, or slab building).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hand-modeled pots follow similar methods. Starting the piece involves taking a lump of clay and putting it on a flat surface, such as a board, dish, or winnower. The lump is shaped into a ball among the Ibanag and Pampango, or an elongated shape among the Cebuano. This lump is opened by means of the thumb or fingers by the Bontok, Bukidnon, Cebuano, and the Mandukayan Kalinga. Then the body of the pot is built. The Bontok hollow the rounded clay with their hands as do the Mandukayan Kalinga. The Ibanag, Bukidnon, Tausug, Pampango, and Cebuano use a paddle and anvil to enlarge the pot and thin its wall. The anvil used by the Pampango, Cebuano, and Tausug is of stone. The Mandukayan Kalinga use their hands to shape the pot and press its walls thin, then the inside is smoothened by a curved piece of bamboo. A coil of clay is attached to the pot&rsquo;s opening to form a rim; but among the Ibanag and Cebuano, a paddle is used to put out the rim. As the pot is turned once around, the paddle set at a 120-degree angle creates the rim. Finishing involves decorating or smoothing the surface of a vessel. For smoothing, a damp cloth, stone, or paddle is used.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For turned pottery, the wheel is used by the Ilocano, especially in the making of large vessels. For the making of the burnay, a wheel embedded on the ground and moved by kicking is used. The Bikol use the <b>bayanyang</b>, a pivoted turntable. In Masbate, the clay is put on top of a tournette made from a flat piece of wood through which a slender stick or iron spike is driven. The spike is driven through a section of a banana stalk placed firmly on the ground. The method of shaping turned pottery is similar to the hand-modeled method with the thumb making the initial opening. The body is shaped by anvil and paddle, whereas the rim is made by running a wet cloth at the opening while the vessel is on the wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Slab modeling has been documented among the Ivatan. They begin with a slab of clay shaped by the hand to form a circle. The circle is then cradled inside a small round, shallow, wooden form, overlapping the edge from 15 cm to 30 cm depending on the size of the pot. The clay is taken out of the form, and the upper part is formed while holding the pot in the lap, using the anvil-and-paddle method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hand modeling, coiling, and molding are methods used by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, the Manobo of Agusan province, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>. The Bagobo begin by hand modeling the bottom of a jar or pot. It is then smoothened as it is turned on a dish. As the bottom is being turned, the potter adds coils of clay until the vessel reaches the desired size. Paddling gives the vessel its final shape. The Manobo shape the bottom of a pot by paddling a slab of clay on a round stone. Coils are then used to complete the pot. Patient paddling causes the coils to adhere well. The Ifugao mold the base on a<b> hagappon</b> or a round wooden base, probably a wooden bowl. To this base are added strips of clay, which are rolled then flattened. Pinching makes the clay adhere to the rest of the pot. The pot is finished by smoothing the inside and outside of the pot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary pots tend to be simpler when compared with Iron Age artifacts. The decorative techniques of <b>pressing</b>, <b>incising</b>, and <b>slip decoration</b> are almost absent in contemporary works. None can match the beauty of the Manungguljar, dated to circa 800 BC, which is incised and slip decorated and covered by a lid with a sculptural rendering of the journey to the afterlife. The decline in earthenware technology is attributed in part to the introduction and easy availability of tradeware during the pre-Hispanic period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, toys made of painted terra-cotta are often sold during fiestas, at the weekly makeshift markets called <i>tabu </i>or <i>mercado</i>.<i> </i>A common toy is a replica of clay utensils, which include the <b>kalan </b>(stove), <b>palayok </b>(pot) with a cover, and the <b>kawali</b> (frying pan). The frying pan is always made of metal but in its toy version is made of clay. Flowers in baskets, farm animals, women and men in native costumes, even guns are manufactured in great numbers in Tiwi, Albay. Also made are decorative items, like incised tiles, candleholders, flower-vase stands, and garden sculptures of toadstools and dwarves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Pottery in the Philippines</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pottery presents an excellent material for archaeological study. Unlike other artifacts like cloth or textile, pottery&mdash;in the form of burial jars, jar covers, bowls, pots, and trays&mdash;does not disintegrate with time. Philippine pottery is represented by various traditions, most notable of which are the Sa-hyunh <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>nay pottery tradition, the Novaliches tradition, and the Bau-Malay pottery tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Sa-hyunh Kalanay tradition encompasses related variations of pottery found in many sites over a wide area. The name derives from the Kalanay cave site in northwest Masbate, but now refers to other potteries found in the Philippines sharing the same broad characteristics. The tradition probably developed in southern Philippines or eastern Indonesia after 2000 BC. Identifying the tradition are the decorative incisions, impressions, carvings, paintings, applications, and modelings. Incisions were marked by bordering the decorated area with punctuations or small circles, done with a single-point, a two-point, or even a three-point tool. Impressions were accomplished with an area shell. Carvings were done to remove the clay from a rim or applied flange. Paintings were meant to highlight incisions. Applications of flanges&mdash;which were later carved&mdash;were either vertical, horizontal, or cylindrical. Although rare, modeling of human or animal figures was applied to the surface of a vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The triangle is the key geometric figure impressed with an area shell in variously directed diagonal lines. In a horizontal series, patterns are created around the neck or on the shoulder of a vessel. Common patterns consist of a chain of triangles, scrolls or spirals, zigzags, variations of vertical or diagonal lines bounded by horizontal borders, rectangles, chevrons, and others. Common forms include variations of the rounded bottom, flat bottom, ring foot, four applied feet, and bottomless hollow vessel. These often result in the cylindrical, the spherical, the subspherical, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Sa-hyunh Kalanay tradition subdivides into four: the Kalanay pottery complex, the Tabon pottery complex, the Bagupanto pottery complex, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3876\"><strong>Asin</strong></a> pottery complex. The distinctions are fluid as there are great overlaps in form and decoration among the categories. Vessels from the Kalanay complex generally have plain surfaces and round bodies with plain, flared rims. The incisions are in a horizontal series of diagonal-line combinations bounded by straight or wavy lines. The main difference of the first from the others is the absence of cord-marked pottery. Kalanay pottery is found in Cotabato and Batangas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tabon complex, named after various cave sites in western Palawan, is distinct for its cord-marked pottery in the earlier cave sites and for its simplicity in later sites. It is also distinguished for its very early dating&mdash;2000 BC. Vessels from this complex commonly have round bottoms with bodies of various shapes, such as round, ellipsoidal, and spheroidal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bagupanto complex is often classified with the Kalanay complex as 17 of its vessels were unearthed at the Kalanay Cave site. Generally, they were of superior quality, material, and artistry. Vessels include large, circular or square burial jars with huge flanges. Incisions are rare. The complex presents some unusual forms: a test-tube-like vessel; an ordinary looking pot but uniquely perforated through its bottom and sides; and a bottomless cylinder with a bottom opening larger than the diameter of the top rim. Freehand-painted patterns distinguish the Asin complex, which is found in the Asin cave sites in Davao del Sur. These patterns include horizontal series or curvilinear scrolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Novaliches tradition had been presented as a complex but was later reclassified by Wilhelm Solheim as a tradition. It was named after a Novaliches cave site north of Manila, but its remnants are also found in northwest Palawan and the Calamianes Islands. The tradition probably dates from 250 BC to the fourth century. Its most distinctive vessel is a well-polished bowl with a stand decorated profusely with geometric figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bau-Malay tradition or geometric pottery of south China is named after a cave site in Sarawak, Malaysia. In the Philippines it is found in coastal sites in Mindanao, Bohol, northern Palawan, and the Calamianes Islands. It is estimated that these sites have been in use since the 10th century. Vessels from this tradition have simple, round shapes with impressions that include small rosettes, triangles, and floral patterns. Some Tinguian pottery are classified under this tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Earlier than the Kalanay tradition are ritual vessels unearthed at Cagayan, which are to date believed to be the earliest specimen of Philippine pottery: polished ritual vessels of Leta-leta; and eight earthenware from Ngipe&rsquo;t Duldug, one of which has impressions of triangles and circles. The last two are found in Palawan cave sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1991, anthropomorphic jars from a cave in municipality of Maitum, Saranggani Province, Mindanao, were discovered. Dated to have been made in the Late Neolithic period, 29 secondary burial jars were recovered from the site featuring individuated faces of different ages, male and female, with emotions of sadness and happiness. Hair incisions are suggested by surface clay designs, with some jars featuring ears, torsos, arms, and legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Tradeware</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tradeware refers to stoneware and porcelain from precolonial trade with China and other Southeast Asian countries. These are mostly <b>celadons</b> of the Sung (960-1278) and Yuan Dynasty (1260-1368), blue-and-white porcelain of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and Thai or Siamese pottery from the kilns of Sawankhalok and Sukhotai and Anamese ware from the area now called Vietnam. Local excavations have yielded very few pieces from the Tang Dynasty (618-906). Early tradeware was composed mostly of unglazed earthenware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the imported tradeware found in the Philippines have been excavated from graves. It was customary to furnish the dead with objects for the afterlife, so that they could maintain the prestige they had enjoyed on earth. This practice ceased with Spanish colonization in the 16th century, just when the Chinese trade was at its height. Some pieces, especially the large eight-eared stoneware dragon jar, used from the Sung to the Ching dynasty to store provisions of the junks, are among the prized possessions of ethnolinguistic groups in the Cordillera, Palawan, and Mindanao. These jars, often used for storing rice wine, are used in rituals and have been carefully guarded and therefore preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before the mid-8th century, lead-glazed ceramics appeared in a variety of colors. Chinese porcelain and stoneware were traded in the Philippines during the Sung and Yuan periods, and this trade reached its apex in the 13th century. Yuan ware were more ornate than those of the Sung, both in style and decoration. Yet these were mass-produced, and 200,000 pieces were often fired at one time. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>-third to one-half of all the excavated ceramics found in the Philippines are from the Yuan period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Up to the 14th century, Filipinos prized Chinese celadon pieces above all. The best pieces had a rich, glowing green glaze intended to rival jade, but many beautiful pieces ranged from gold to olive-green to blue-green. Changes in hue resulted from different firing methods: those from South China, which produced the soft jade-green color, used wood; while northern celadons were fired with coal and produced an olive-green color. Filipinos believed that these celadon and other tradeware were greater talismans than the local ware and deserved reverential treatment. They thought that celadon pieces changed hue when poisoned food was put on them, and that plates and bowls could cure diseases or act as vehicles for summoning powerful forces from nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 15th century, much value was placed on Thai celadon, which were slightly heavier and often less glossy. Gradually, however, celadon lost out to the blue-and-white under royal supervision in China during the Ming dynasty and in Vietnam. While most of the imports in the Philippines were celadon and blue and white, there were also great quantities of white <i>blanc de chine </i>ware (some with black or white decoration), plain brown ware, and monochrome ware in other colors, like oxblood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-14th century, the Ming emperors brought foreign trade under direct control while private trade continued; it was severely restricted for several centuries. The Chinese ceramic trade generally declined, and filling the vacuum came white and unglazed black and brown ware in large quantities from Vietnam and Thailand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Those with attribution to Vietnam are called Anamese ware after Anam and are believed to have been fired in kilns located near present-day Hanoi, Vietnam. The quality of Thai ware was generally inferior to the Chinese despite the strong Chinese influence in their shapes and potting techniques. In 1249, King Bam Kanhaeng of Thailand is said to have visited China and brought back to Thailand 300-500 master potters who began the kilns at Sukhothai and Sawankhalok. Thai ceramics from Sawankhalok were introduced into the Philippines in the mid-14th century. About 20-40 percent of ceramics found in local graves, especially in Mindoro and southern Luzon, are from Sawankhalok and Sukothai. Common are Sawankhalok pots with three vertical handles and domed lids with knobs on top. Sukhotai ware are mostly plates with underglazing and black decorations more exuberant than the Sawankhalok pieces. Production in Sukhothai kilns ceased before that in Sawankhalok possibly because their products could not compete with their rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Excavated pieces reflect the complex history of trade in the Philippines. Aside from plates and dishes, covered cases, bowls, jars with or without lids, <b>kendi </b>or a pouring vessel with a spout, jarlets, and pots have been found. Water droppers, brush holders, and accessories for the desk of the Chinese literati entered the trades only when defective images of Chinese deities and those of daily life have been found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although Spanish colonization effectively ended the practice of burying ceramics with the dead, tradeware continued to be brought to the Philippines, and in turn exported to Europe. The blue-and-white porcelain of the Ming was emulated in Europe once the technique of porcelain making was made known. Blue-and-white ware in Europe included the Dutch Delfware. Ceramic pieces, glazed in blue designs or polychrome, called <b>azulejos</b>,<b> </b>were very popular in Portugal. The trade in tradeware and other goods in China inspired European taste for the &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, the Oriental&mdash;thus creating a style associated with the rococo, called <b>chinoiserie</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since colonial times to the present, the easy availability and the cheap price of porcelain and ceramics from China made it easier to import rather than manufacture them locally, hence locally made ware were almost always earthenware, in the form of a <b>banga<i> </i></b>(jar), palayok<b><i> </i></b>(cooking pot), and <b>paso </b>(pots for plants). But a pottery tradition in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, called burnay has survived since it was started by Chinese migrants who settled in the area, led by the Go and Ongkai family. The burnay jar is an unglazed earthen jar, using a type of clay found in the area mixed with fine sand, and fired in a ground kiln. The burnay is reputedly harder than terra-cotta jars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\">Studio Pottery</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Interest in contemporary <b>studio pottery</b> among artists started in the late 1960s. Through workshops, artists began to discover the importance of this medium. Studio pottery, the name given to handmade, usually one-of-a-kind pieces by ceramic artists became popular through the work of Manuel Ramirez, who taught ceramics at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts, and Leonardo Villaroman who also taught the craft. BaidyMendoza and AroSoriano were also most active practitioners of ceramic art during this period. However, these two painted on rather than glazed their pottery. Ceramic artists usually work with stoneware and with glazes to create utilitarian and decorative items. NelfaQuerubin, an artist from Iloilo, produced not only outstanding functional pieces from clay dug in Iloilo but also sculptural works done by the slab method. TessySanJuan and JonPettyjohn are known for their hand-formed jars, cups, plates, and dinner sets. LanelleAbueva-Fernando, who studied under the Japanese masters, produces works that are a combination of Eastern and Western traditions. She favors celadon, although recently she has experimented in using Mount Pinatubo ash. The Jaime and Anne deGuzman family&mdash;who established residence and pottery studio in Candelaria, Quezon, and Sagada in the Cordilleras&mdash;produced incised tiles and utilitarian pieces. An artist influenced by the de Guzmans is UguBigyan who combined stoneware with local fiber, roots, and branches to produce tapestries, candleholders, and salt and pepper sets. Studio pottery has but recently been discovered to be both aesthetic and functional and is avidly collected by patrons who find them in art exhibits or in stores specializing in these wares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary potters in the Philippines come from all over the archipelago: Castora Cudal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a> Bernardo from Ilocos Norte; Mary Decoy from Benguet; Rodrigo Lomibao and Judith Mina from Pangasinan; Agripina Mondares from San Carlos City; Pedro Amistad from Ilocos Sur; Magdalena Hicarte from Sorsogon; Emma Ferraris from Negros Occidental; Erolly Geronimo from Bacolod City; Florentino Paul from Pari-an Sigma; Josefina Andico, Nena Ega&ntilde;a, Alejandro Mariano, Jerry Amar, Rolando Macajiling, Avelina Garceniego, and Shirley Garcenita from Antique; Gerardo Abadia Jr and Epifania Cacafranca from Davao City; Reidel Campo from Davao Oriental; and Rito C.

This process, which is closely linked with the history of printing and publication, results in the mass production of art, making it accessible to a broader public or instrumental in promotion and propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early Philippine printmaking was a facet of bookmaking and publishing, which developed as an instrument of Spanish colonization. The very first prints were thus designs or illustrations published in instructional books on catechism and prayers, which at times included lessons in alphabet, language, and practical science.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Xylography<i> </i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Xylography</b> is the Chinese method of printing from relief images cut on <b>woodblocks</b>. Wooden blocks are cut and planed to the size of two book pages. The surface is then coated with rice paste, on which a previously drawn design on paper is pasted. The reverse image registered on the wood is then cut. When carving is completed, the pasted paper is rubbed off. Ink is then applied on the uncarved surface, and paper is carefully impressed with a ball of cloth until the design is transferred onto the paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The very first print workshop using the woodblock method was improvised in San Miguel, Binondo, by the Spanish Dominican Francisco Blancas de San Jose and the Chinese convert Juan de Vera, a carver. In 1592 , they completed the <b><i>Beng Sim Po Cam</i></b>, a catechism book in Chinese. By 1593 they had printed three more books by the xylographic method: <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</i></b> (Christian Doctrine in the Spanish and Tagalog Languages); <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Letra y Lengua China </i></b>(Christian Doctrine in the Chinese Script and Language); and <b><i>Tratado de la Doctrina de la Santa Iglesia y de la Ciencias Naturales </i></b>(Treatise on the Doctrine of the Holy Church and Natural Sciences), also known as <b><i>Shih</i></b><i>-<b>lu</b></i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</i></b> is the best known and most artistic of these first books. It has for its frontispiece a portrait of Santo Domingo in symbolic array and setting. The print is unique for the Asian facial quality of Santo Domingo, the naive simplicity of the design, and its ornate frame. The same design was used for the <b><i>Beng Sim Po Cam</i></b><i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Letra y Lengua China</i></b> had on its cover an <i>escudo de armas </i>or coat of arms of the Dominican Order in medallion and scroll motif, said to have been taken from an emblem printed in Mexico, and printed by Keng Yong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Shih</i></b><i>-<b>lu </b></i>had on its cover an illustration on the theme of Christianization of the sangley. The design shows a Dominican monk, a Chinese man in traditional costume, suggestions of the Great Wall of China, and elements of classical Western architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Between 1600 and 1604, the first printing press of movable type was used in the same workshop by de Vera and San Jose. Thereafter, engravers and printers learned to cut individual letters on smaller blocks of wood so masterfully that carving of texts, ornaments, and emblems became more important than pictures. TomasPinpin, Jacinto Magarulao, Raimundo Mag-isa, and Andres de Belen are some of the names imprinted on the handcrafted books that survive today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the more notable woodblock designs printed by moveable type of the period were the Blessed Sacrament with angels on the title page of the Ilocano<i> <b>Doctrina Christiana</b></i>, 1621, the seal of San Agustin in <b><i>Arte de la Lengua Iloca </i></b>(Grammar of the Ilocano Language) printed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5598\"><strong>Tomas Pinpin</strong></a> in 1627, the catafalque of Prince Baltazar Carlos printed by Simon Pinpin in 1649, and the coat of arms in Baltazar de Medina&rsquo;s <b><i>Sermon de la Inmaculada Concepcion </i></b>(Homily on the Immaculate Conception) printed by Gaspar de los Reyes in 1672.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several printing presses were subsequently established by the Franciscans, Jesuits, Augustinians, and the Ecclesiastical Seminary. But since engraving and printing during the colonial period were licensed occupations for official use, little artistry was encouraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Copper Engraving<i> </i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest known record of <b>copper engraving</b> in the Philippines is that of Juan Correa on the presentation of the Virgin at the Temple, printed in 1701 for the second edition of <b><i>Las Ordenanzas y Constituciones de la Hermanidad de la Misericordia </i></b>(Rules and Construction of the Fraternity of Mercy). Jeronimo de la Correa&rsquo;s 1748 engraving of San Pedro Martyr Sanz, published in the book <b><i>La Christianidad de Fogan </i></b>(The Christianity of Fogan), is well preserved at the Lopez Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In engraving a copper plate, a design is cut with a burin or graver. The deeper the tool penetrates into the plate, the wider the line; thus variations in tone and depth are achievable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 18th century is said to have been the golden era of Philippine engraving, primarily because of the work of the artists NicolasdelaCruz<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5078\"><strong>Bagay</strong></a>, FranciscoSuarez, and LorenzoAtlas (previously identified as Laureano but with recent evidence seems to be Laurentius in Latin or Lorenzo in Spanish).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3421\"><strong>Lorenzo Atlas</strong></a>&rsquo;s works that illustrate his masterful technique are his 1743 portrait of Fr Juan Angel Rodriguez printed in Esteban Roxas y Mello&rsquo;s <b><i>El</i></b> <b><i>Moyses Verdadero </i></b>(The True Moses) and his 1749 engraving of the icons of the Virgen de la Rosa and Virgen de Paz y Buen Viaje.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was customary to have <b>estampas</b> or prints of miraculous images made for distribution to devotees at their shrines. Atlas&rsquo;s print of the Virgin may have originated as estampas. Smaller estampas used as markers in devotional books were called <b>estampitas</b>.<i> </i>During this era, a <i>pasyon</i> (a didactic verse narrative on the passion and resurrection of Christ) made its first appearance in print. This was GasparAquinodeBelen&rsquo;s <b><i>MahalnaPassionniJesuChristongPanginoon NatinnaTola </i></b>(The Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Verse), which was appended to <b><i>Manga Panalanging Pagtatagobilin sa Calolouang Naghihingalo</i></b> (Prayers of Guidance for the Soul of the Dying), first published in 1703. The 1760 edition of this <b><i>Passion </i></b>was illustrated with engravings by Nicolas de la Cruz Bagay and FranciscoSuarez, with the assistance of Cipriano Bagay and Luis Suarez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Felipe Sevilla, who could be the same engraver cited in Mexican prints of the same period, was active in Manila between 1789 and 1791. He also did a copperplate of the Last Supper dated 1789 and an engraving of the Carlos II funeral pyre dated 1791.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The craft of engraving was taught through an atelier system, wherein an apprentice was trained on the job by a master engraver. Often, the engraver was a different person from the printer, as inscriptions on extant prints indicate&mdash;for example, Felipe Sevilla <b>sculpsit </b>(engraved it) or Casimiro <b>impressit</b><i> </i>(printed it). The atelier or guild was usually confined within the family as reflected in the common surnames of different generations. Otherwise, the friars, brothers of the religious order, and members of their community collaborated in the printmaking tasks. Other engravers and printers of the 1700s were Domingo Pauner, active circa 1702; Cipriano Bagay, active 1788-92; Luis Suarez, active 1737-60; Bachiller Casimiro de los Santos, active 1789-1798; Fr Hipolito Ximenez, active 1715-30; Fr Jose Azcarate, active 1752-72; Esteban de Sevilla, active 1790s; and Geronimo Atlas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 19th century saw a general decline in the quality of engravings. Most designs on religious and chancery themes were overused, perhaps an ill-effect of official standardization. A few exceptional works were those done on religious subjects by Ysidro Paulino, Bentura Javier, Vicente Atlas, Juan Atlas, and Carlos Borromeo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Wood Engraving </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Wood engraving</b> is a variation of xylography. It developed in Europe with the use of movable type printing. This entails the use of an end block or the cross section of a tree. The hard and fine surface is not subject to the splintering that usually occurs when ordinary woodblocks are carved. Finer details could be engraved using the same tools for copper engraving. Among the finest examples of wood engraving still extant at the University of Santo Tomas Museum are <b><i>La Bendicion de San Francisco </i></b>(The Blessing of Saint Francis), the <b><i>San Vicente Ferrer</i></b>, and<b><i> La Coronacion de Maria Reina de los Angeles </i></b>(The Coronation of Mary Queen of Angels) by unknown artists of the late 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 19th century, subject matter also became more and more secular. Presses owned by businessmen and lay persons proliferated in Manila and challenged the dominance of friar-owned presses. Among the most productive of these were Amigos del Pais, Babil Sayo, and Chofre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:-1.0pt\">Lithography</span></span><i></i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Lithography</b>, introduced in the early 19th century, proved to be a more efficient and economical method. The proliferation of catechism and novenas gave way to the more cosmopolitan journals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In lithography, a design is done with a greasy crayon or paint on limestone. By chemical treatment based on the antipathy of oil and water, areas to be printed are isolated from areas not to be printed. Although a tedious process, results can be the most faithful duplications of pen-and-ink, crayon, watercolor, or sprayed paint texture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most outstanding lithography done in the Philippines were those published in 1859-60 in the <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>, a magazine of general interest. A few line drawings were signed E. Evans and B. Giraudier. In the 1859 series, C. W. Andrews&rsquo;s lithography of <b>tipos del pais</b><i> </i>(country scenes) and landscapes were published, among them <b><i>La Buyera </i></b>(The Betel-Nut Vendor), <b><i>El Tulisan </i></b>(The Bandit), <b><i>El Mediquillo </i></b>(The Herb Doctor), <b><i>Volcan de Albay </i></b>(Albay Volcano), and <b><i>PuenteColgante </i></b>(Hanging Bridge).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another publication with high-quality lithography was <b><i>Ilustracion del Oriente</i></b>,<i> </i>which serialized <b><i>Cuadro de Costumbres de Filipinas</i></b>, portraits and sceneries by C. Borner and C.W. Andrews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the introduction of photography in lithography printing for mass reproduction, handmade printmaking as a fine-art form vanished in the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Graphic Arts, 1946-2014</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Printmaking reemerged after World War II due to several factors. The most important factor was the return from art studies of ManuelRodriguezSr and RodolfoParas-Perez from the United States in the late 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both conducted workshops. Rodriguez Sr specialized in <b>etching</b> while Paras-Perez concentrated on the woodcut. Most contemporary printmakers at one time or other fell under the influence of the two. As teacher, Rodriguez Sr was exceptionally generous in imparting his skills. He was also instrumental in organizing the Philippine Association of Printmakers (PAP) and introducing this as part of the fine arts curriculum of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. Also notable is the initiative of other artists in introducing printing to artists and the public. In 1956, JuvenalSanso exhibited etchings he had done abroad. FernandoZobeldeAyala, RomeoTabuena, and ArturoLuz exhibited lithographs at the PhilippineArtGallery. During this period, HilarioFrancia, CenonRivera, and FlorencioConcepcion were also doing woodcuts. Mauro<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\"><strong>Malang</strong></a>Santos popularized art by printing silkscreened images based on paintings by himself and his artist friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is also in the 20th century that printmaking is clearly differentiated from reproduction. In the former, an artist creates the plate by hand or with the help of mechanical means. In the latter, creation of the plate and printing are totally done by mechanical process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fine-art print, which should not be confused with commercial reproduction, may be printed by the artist himself or may be printed by a technician under his supervision. An artist&rsquo;s signature and numbering indicates the uniform quality of all prints pulled in a limited edition. When an edition is completed, the artist destroys the image on the plate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because prints are original artworks in multiples, it is viewed as a populist art form; hence the print became popular for expressing socially relevant themes, and could conveniently be exhibited simultaneously at various venues in traveling shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1960s, a number of important printmakers emerged, among them VirgilioAviado, OfeliaGelvezon-Tequi, MarcelinoRodriguez, ManuelRodriguez Jr aka Boy Rodriguez, and LucioMartinez. Others who developed their printmaking skills while organizing the PAP were Florencia Mota, Josefina Escudero, EfrenZaragoza, Restituto Embuscado, NelfaQuerubin, BrendaFajardo, Adiel Arevalo, IviAvellana-Cosio, and Petite Calaguas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other artists whose print works are extensions of painting since they were painters first and printmakers second are JoseJoya, MarcianoGalang aka Mars Galang, BenedictoCabrera aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>, JustinianoNuyda aka Tiny Nuyda, RaulIsidro, CesarLegaspi, RobertoChabet, and ManuelBaldemor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other printmakers most active in the 1970s were RaymundoAlbano, SantiagoBose, Benjamin Torrado Cabrera, OrlandoCastillo, Evelyn Collantes, FildelaCruz<i>, </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a>Cajipe-Endaya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3576\"><strong>Romeo Gutierrez</strong></a>, IleanaLee, Al Manrique, Flora Mauleon, LitoMayo, FernandoModesto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\"><strong>Romulo Olazo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\"><strong>Nonon Padilla</strong></a>, MarioParial, ImpyPilapil, Rhoda Recto, Rey Rodriguez, RodolfoSamonte, Joel Soliven, and ManuelSoriano. Among the many printmakers who developed in the 1980s were NeilDoloricon, Jeannie Javelosa, OjengJocano, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3690\"><strong>Jonathan Olazo</strong></a>. Contemporary printmaking may be classified into three general categories: <b>relief</b>, <b>intaglio</b>, and <b>planographic method</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In relief, the imprint comes from the surface of the block. Parts of the wood or metal block that are to be printed are left in relief and the remainder cut away. Impressions from the inked block can then be made with a press or even by hand. The principal relief methods are <b>woodcut</b>, <b>wood engraving</b>, <b>lino-cut</b> (linoleum), <b>rubber-cut</b>, <b>metal-cut</b>, <b>relief printing</b>, and <b>collagraph</b>. The collagraph<b> </b>is a technique for making plates involving the pasting of different materials on a base of masonite, wood, or cardboard. Lines or texture may also be drawn with the use of white glue from a fine-tipped vial. When the gluing is completely dried, the entire surface is coated with shellac or varnish to ensure smooth inking and printing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">If printed in relief method without an etching press, the degree of pictorial realism expressed is very limited. Consequently, most of such prints are highly stylized or abstract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A variation of printing a relief is the inkless embossed print. This involves building or lowering a surface onto which damp paper can be molded and subjected to great pressure to transfer the design. Artists who have done outstanding relief prints are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3702\"><strong>Rodolfo Paras-Perez</strong></a>, EfrenZaragoza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3779\"><strong>Manuel Soriano</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3704\"><strong>Mario Parial</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The principal methods of preparing a plate for intaglio printing are copper engraving, which includes <b>drypoint</b> and <b>mezzotint</b>; etching, which includes <b>aquatint</b>; and collagraph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Intaglio<b> </b>refers to the printing method that is the opposite of relief; the printed image comes from the inks deposited in the grooves and lines beneath the surface of the plate. After inking a plate, its surface is wiped clean with rags. Damp paper is laid on the plate, covered with thick felt blankets and run through a press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In engraving, an image is drawn on copperplate with a graver. In drypoint, lines are scratched with a steel needle. In etching, the plate is first covered with asphalt ground, then drawn over to create an image. This is then dipped in an acid bath to deepen the lines. Etching became more popular than engraving because the acid corrosion is considered a quicker but effective way of achieving the effects of engraving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The majority of Filipino printmakers in the 1970s employed etching with aquatint as its versatility offered many creative possibilities. Aquatint is a method of using powdered resin for etching, which gives tonal effects similar to that of a wash drawing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Engraving, the oldest intaglio process to be introduced in the Philippines, is hardly used today, quite a contrast from the times of Nicolas de la Cruz Bagay and Lorenzo Atlas. Engraving using machines is very much limited to the production of paper money. In mezzotint, an artist first makes use of a roulette and rocker to make a totally dark surface and to scrape white images on it. Since mezzotint is a physically demanding and time-consuming process, few artists have used it. Manuel Rodriguez Sr did a few mezzotints. Its main proponent today, Fil de la Cruz, has produced works of remarkable vision and mastery. His themes touching on ecology and survival are inspired by the tribal Filipinos who have preserved traditional Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A collagraph plate, if done in shallow recesses, can be printed the intaglio way. There are two advantages of collagraphy: first, the production of large and powerful images in a relatively short period of time; and second, the financial investment in plates is very small. This technique is still wide open to experimentation, since lines, textures, and tonal values can be built up in as many ways imaginable, and can have very painterly effects. Printmakers who have employed collagraphy are Romeo Gutierrez, Romulo Olazo, and Rey Rodriguez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The planographic method includes lithography and <b>serigraphy</b>. A lithograph may be printed from a perfectly flat limestone slab or prepared from metal plates, usually zinc&mdash;hence the name zincography. Lithography is not widely used today because of the limited availability of limestone, which tends to crack with humidity, and the limited availability of the special press required for it. Most Filipino printmakers who have done lithographs have produced work during their sojourns abroad where presses are available. Among them are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3762\"><strong>Juvenal Sanso</strong></a>, Manuel Rodriguez Sr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a>, VirgilioAviado, GlennBautista, Jeannie Javelosa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3666\"><strong>Fernando Modesto</strong></a>, and Ben Cabrera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The term &ldquo;<b>serigraph</b>,&rdquo; attributed to American Carl Zigrosser, was coined to distinguish art print from mass-produced silkscreened images. Serigraphy involves forcing ink through unstopped areas of silk or nylon mesh with a squeegee, a flexible rubber or synthetic blade on a handle. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3758\"><strong>Rodolfo Samonte</strong></a> has made maximum use of serigraphy. From simple stencils of torn masking tape, he masterfully ran several repetitive layers of paint to create low-relief prints of various colors, tints, and shades. Imelda Pilapil has used serigraphy on cloth, paper, plastic, and glass. To produce the widest range of colors while reducing the number of plates and the runs used, the inking of plates was the subject of experimentation by American Stanley <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Hayter in his Atelier 17. Because inks with differing viscosity or stickiness take more or less time in adhering to a surface, a single plate may be prepared using inks of differing viscosity when printed in a single run. The result is different colors placed over each other producing a third tone. Called the <b>viscosity method</b>, it is used by Gelvezon-Tequi for her prints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, new printmaking techniques are being invented and old ones retrieved from commercial use. While photographic letterpress, photocopy offset, and computer images have become acceptable media of edition prints in the international market, the printmaker&rsquo;s rule is that the artist creatively controls the making of the plate. In the 1990s onward, the revitalization of printmaking came through the reactivated PAP under the leadership of FildelaCruz and the Mariposa Workshop under the leadership of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\"><strong>Virgilio Aviado</strong></a>. Scholarships in lithography have also been made available. There is increasing popularity in the use of woodcuts, rubber cuts, and serigraphy in many community craft-oriented workshops. Moreover, new printing technology has allowed work to be done on a variety of supports so much so that three-dimensional but still print-based work has become more and more possible. Examples of these are the virtually sculptural work done by Ambie Aba&ntilde;o and the glass works done by Benjie Cabrera. These confluences of factors and expanding practices offer richer and broader promise for the further development of Philippine printmaking. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by</strong> </em><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong>Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, Rene B.

Freestanding or in-the-round sculptures are viewed from all sides and surfaces with form freed from raw material. <b>Relief sculptures</b>, on the other hand, are hewn from surface material, portions of which remain evident. <b>Low-relief</b> or <b>bas-relief</b> sculpture has slight projections from surrounding surface while <b>high-relief </b>sculpture has greater and deeper incisions with forms that prominently project from the background. Some works adopt movement and light as sculptural elements. <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\"><strong>Assemblage</strong></a></b>, a putting together of three-dimensional elements and found objects, is generally a process of addition of usually unlike objects. <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a></b> aka transmedia, mixed media, or intermedia works use materials that are two- and three-dimensional or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sculpture employs methods of addition, reduction, or substitution. Pliable materials may be &ldquo;added to&rdquo; to produce form, while hard or rigid materials are &ldquo;subtracted from&rdquo; to reveal form. Mediums can be replaced or substituted with more permanent materials. However, contemporary sculptures deliberately use materials that are ephemeral, such as candle wax and lard, to connote temporariness and shifting meanings of the material. Malleable materials, such as clay, wax, or plaster, are shaped or &ldquo;pushed into form&rdquo; by hand. Often, inner support structures, called armatures, are used to keep desired shapes stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carving takes away from the material to reveal form and is a technique used on wood and stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Casting is a replacement process. Casting involves using flexible materials for moulds to fashion forms into a more permanent medium. Metal, clay, plastics, and polyvinyl resin are some materials used for casting processes. Materials that liquefy can be poured into moulds, which function as patterns, and later used to produce works in their final form. Casting liquids are poured into the moulds, which can be broken up (lost-wax casting) or preserved to replicate works.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Living Indigenous Tradition</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditional sculpture of the ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines are done using materials such as wood and stone manipulated through carving; in clay, by molding; and in metal, by casting. Carving involves removing material from wood or stone by using a metal implement, usually a chisel. Carving is found throughout the country and is used for ornamenting daily objects, like boats, ladles, furniture, and beams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wood carving in the Philippines is part of the ancient tradition of Malay wood carving in Southeast Asia. The art has retained its vitality through the centuries, from precolonial times to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The native wood carving traditions are first of all found in the productions of cultural communities. The <b>bulol</b><i> </i>are freestanding in-the-round images of granary gods or anito, ancestor, and nature deities. They may either be in a standing or a sitting position. If sitting, their rear ends do not touch the ground but are raised above it, their hands touching their knees or their arms resting across their knees, as in the traditional way of sitting in the outdoors when performing a ritual or simply banding together to talk by an open fire in the cold mountain air. Figures are frontal in presentation and planimetric, following the planes of the original wooden block. Facial features are simplified and lightly incised, with a geometricized tendency. There is no intention to represent a particular individual, as in a portrait, but the generalized features are deemed more appropriate in representing anthropomorphic deities of an archetypal cast. The articulation of the joints is less defined when the figure is in a standing position. Sometimes, stalks of rice, representing hair, rise from a small hollow in the head. As to its proportion, the bulol has short limbs with a big head.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important characteristic is that the bulol are generally found in pairs, male and female. This pairing, which symbolizes the sexual principle, also signifies the value that society places on fertility, and the whole of nature&mdash;including all living things of the earth, water, and sky&mdash;multiplies and flourishes from the union of the archetypal man and woman. As granary gods, the bulol are found inside granaries. They do not only guard the harvest from insects and animals but also guarantee increasing yield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An exception, however, is found among the Kiangan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>. For them, the bulol do not come in pairs but are single figures. This is because their function here is centered on healing rituals. According to Peralta (1977), a ritual figure representing the sick person is carved, then called <b>tat-tagu</b><i>&mdash;</i>no different in appearance and style from the usual bulol. This is consecrated and used in the healing ritual. If the person recovers, then its potency is recognized and is properly called bulol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The same may also occur with the carved figures of animals, such as the pig, which is a common sacrificial animal. The carving of a pig is originally called <b>binabbuy</b>; it is later also called bulol after it participates in a successful healing ritual. Thus, according to Peralta (1977), the term bulol &ldquo;suggests a generic term for types of consecrated images whether of similar configuration but differing in function or totally of different configuration and function.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Cordillera houses, those of the Ifugao are the most sculptural. Wooden posts are carved with circular rat guards that prevent rodents from entering the house. Its walls and doors are of wood, usually carved with chevron patterns. Beneath the Ifugao house is the <b>hagabi</b>, a prestige bench owned by the affluent and carved from a single piece of hardwood. Its center is usually higher than the sides, thus forming a low arch or a squat chevron shape. The ends of the bench are carved with stylized animal heads, like the pig or boar. For the carving of the bench, the affluent throw a feast, called <i>ca&ntilde;ao</i> (pagan religious feast in the mountainous regions), during which the bench is brought from the forest, where it has been carved, to the house of its owner. Other motifs carved in relief in the Cordilleras are human figures, lizards, snakes, and crocodiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tagbanwa of Palawan carve ritual animals from soft wood. Dyed black, these are incised with geometric designs, which show the natural light color of the wood. Among the Mindanao groups, the Maranao and the Tausug have a lively carving tradition. Called <b>okir</b><i> </i>by the Maranao and <b>ukkil</b><i> </i>by the Tausug, traditional carving shares a number of designs, although with distinct regional variations. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> common motif is called <b>sarimanok</b><i> </i>by the Maranao and <b>manuk-manuk</b><i> </i>by the Tausug. The motif portrays a bird with a fish caught in its beak, among the Maranao, and without a fish, among the Tausug. Other Maranao motifs are the <b>naga</b><i> </i>(snake), <b>pako rabong</b> (fern), the floral, as well as the star-and-bud motif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These motifs apply to objects in everyday life. Among the Maranao, okir designs appear in the <b>panolong</b><i> </i>or the flaring beams of the Maranao longhouse; in the <b>giyaina-panagan</b><i> </i>(prow) of the Maranao boat; in <b>kulintang</b><i> </i>(gong) stands; and also in tools and utensils, like the reed flattener for making mats, ladles, and coconut graters. Even the <b>kubing</b><i> </i>(mouth harp), made from bamboo, is decorated with okir. Okir designs embellish the <b>sunduk</b>, the boat-shaped grave marker of the Tausug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A traditional casting process is<i> </i><b>cire perdue</b><i> </i>or &ldquo;lost wax,&rdquo; a Malay technology of brass casting, which began before the 15th century in Sulu and is used to the present by a number of Philippine groups, such as the Maranao of Lanao and the Tboli of Cotabato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Hispanic Tradition and Local Transformations</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spaniards introduced the tradition of carving in the Hispanic manner. Sculpture found its widest and most popular expression in the carving of <b>santos</b>. These were figures of Christ, the Virgin, and the saints usually three-dimensional, made of wood or ivory for religious devotions, and often placed in niches. As such, they could also be planimetric&mdash;that is, made up of flat two-dimensional planes of different shapes and arranged at angles to each other. Santos were also made in <b>relieve</b><i> </i>(relief), which could be <b>basso relieve</b> (low relief), <b>medio relieve</b><i> </i>(demi-relief), or <b>alto relieve</b><i> </i>(high relief). Aside from santos found in church, there were santos for domestic devotions. Santos in churches were part of the <b>retablo</b>, the elaborate Hispanic altarpiece. In the houses of the rich, small santos were kept in <b>urnas</b><i> </i>or miniature freestanding altarpieces; others were protected under <b>virinas</b><i> </i>or cylindrical glass globes. During fiestas, especially in Lent, the santos were brought out of churches and homes and paraded on elaborate <b>carrozas</b><i> </i>(floats) or <b>andas</b><i> </i>(platforms).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first santo came to the Philippines with the introduction of Christianity, the first recorded being that of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o of Cebu, which was a gift of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\"><strong>Magellan</strong></a> to King Humabon&rsquo;s wife in 1521 and was found by Legaspi&rsquo;s soldiers after their attack on the village in 1565. With the intensive activity of church building that occurred in the first centuries of Spanish colonization, more santos were needed for the retablos of the churches. During the centuries of the galleon trade, each galleon brought with it its patron image to guide and protect it during the long voyage. The most famous of these santos was <b><i>NuestraSe&ntilde;oradelaPazyBuenViaje</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2248\"><strong>Our Lady of </strong></a><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a></strong> and Good Voyage</strong> or Our Lady of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2128\"><strong>Antipolo</strong></a></strong> ), an image of the Inmaculada Concepcion that accompanied the galleon on several successful voyages on the Manila-Acapulco trade, and was brought from Mexico by Governor-General Ni&ntilde;o de Tabora in 1626. In Naga, <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Pe&ntilde;afrancia </i></b>(Our Lady of Pe&ntilde;afrancia) also draws large crowds to her shrine. Of the figures of Christ, among the most popular is the Quiapo <b><i>Nazareno</i></b> (Nazarene), an image brought from Mexico in the 1620s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While some santos came from Spain through Spanish friars and officials, an undetermined number from Mexico, and some ivory images from Portuguese Malaca, in time most of the santos were made in the country by Filipino and Chinese <b>santeros</b><i> </i>(carvers). FernandoZobel de Ayala suggests that the introduction of foreign prototypes occurred within a short period of time so that by the 17th century, there were enough carvers in Manila and elsewhere to meet the demand for santos. All the Christianized regions, including the Ilocos, the central Luzon provinces, and Visayan Provinces such as Cebu, Bohol, Samar, and Leyte, also had their santeros. Active centers were Paete, Laguna, and Betis, Pampanga, which have kept up the tradition to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos carved for churches before the 19th century tended to be squat, with an accent on the face and hands, but almost always iconographically accurate. By the 19th century, the making of santos had reached a high point of artistic achievement. In Manila, particularly in the districts of Quiapo and Santa Cruz, there were excellent artisans who established shops or ateliers. Before the 19th century, santos were made by anonymous wood carvers; but in the mid-19th century, with the rise of the native merchant class from the opening of the country to international trade, higher artistic standards were demanded and a number of sculptors achieved considerable fame, such as LeoncioAsuncion, RomualdodeJesus, CrispuloJocson, and IsabeloTampinco. The second half of the 19th century saw the rise of secular themes in sculpture and the expansion of <i>ilustrado </i>(educated native) art patronage. Known sculptors of the time were BonifacioArevalo, GracianoNepomuceno, and Anselmo Espiritu who began a trend in genre sculpture and introduced nationalist themes, sometimes anticlerical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 19th century, santos could both be found in churches and homes of the <i>principalia </i>or elite class. The religious sculpture were called <b>poon</b> by those who hold a <i>panata</i> (vow), which consisted of performative acts of devotion such as changing the clothes of the icon, kissing and wiping the exposed wood in the sculpture, carrying the image during processions, and singing the <i>pasyon</i> (verse narrative about the life and suffering of Jesus Christ) during Holy Week rituals at the home of the owner of the<i> </i>poon. These rituals are similar to rituals also done to the ancient bulol and other traditions for the dead in Southeast Asia, suggesting a hybridity of belief systems and cultural transformations that have continued to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art of making santos has continued to the 20th century, particularly in Paete where wood carving practiced at present owes much to the traditions established by the elders and the previous generations of Paete wood-carvers. Prominent among them are MarianoMadri&ntilde;an and JoseCaancan. The former received high distinction at the Amsterdam exposition in 1883 (a year before JuanLuna won honors for <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong> </i></b>) when his <b><i>Mater Dolorosa </i></b>(Sorrowful Mother) won a gold medal over European entries, thereby drawing the attention of King Alfonso XII of Spain. It was during Madri&ntilde;an&rsquo;s time that the santero&rsquo;s art reached its peak&mdash;with the highly realistic and expressive santos, life-size or larger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paete wood carvers introduced such refinements as movable, ball-and-socket joints at the shoulders, knees, elbows, and even fingers so as to make possible the portrayal of different gestures in a series of episodes, as in the passion of Christ. Delicate features and expressive, sad eyes are the hallmarks of Paete wood-carving art. Old secrets of the trade include light brown wavy hair made of pi&ntilde;a fiber; eyelashes from monkey&rsquo;s hair; and eyes of glass that are blown, shaped, and tinted in the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Paete, families specialize in particular aspects of the art of wood carving, from the making of tools to the final painting and varnishing. Several generations of wood-carving families in Paete are the Madri&ntilde;an, Caancan, Caguin, Cajipe, Edjawan, Madridejos, Fadul, Ac-Ac, Adao, Afunggol, Cagayat, Cagandahan, Baet, Bagabaldo, Baldemor, and Palatino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The holy figures have their own prescribed iconography by which they are identified. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/471\"><strong>San Roque</strong></a> points to a wound on his leg while a dog stands by his side, alluding to the ravaging plague and the dog that miraculously saved him. San Isidro Labrador stands with a shovel, at the same time that an angel works the field with a plow while the landlord gapes in amazement. Santa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1463\"><strong>Lucia</strong></a>, who was blinded by her persecutors, holds her eyes on a tray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The making of the polychromed santo, whether in the round or in relief, entails a painstaking process from the initial carving of the wood to its ornamentation. This involves laying on a whitish coat of <b>gesso</b> on the wooden surface to make it nonporous to paint or gilt. Medieval artists in Europe produced it from a mixture of <b>plaster</b> (dehydrated calcium sulphate) and size or glue. Santeros in the Philippines, like those from Paete, used materials, such as local <i>kesong puti </i>or white cheese mixed with glue. After priming with gesso, flesh-colored paint was applied directly onto the surface. In the 16th century a non-glossy matte finish was preferred in the interest of realism. Local santeros have also used the &ldquo;ivory finish,&rdquo; which simulated the milky pallor of ivory, considered an appropriate and precious material for the santo. For contrast, ivory was painted with flesh tones similar to those of the wooden images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is the process of <b>encarnacion</b> that maintained the tradition of giving a fair complexion to holy figures, since it defined flesh color and tone in Caucasian terms. For colonized societies, this gave both the saints and the colonial rulers a common cast and became influential in local standards of beauty. The process was applied to formal santos, particularly of the classical and baroque style; but it was not strictly observed in informal or folk santos, the characteristics of which were closer to the common people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Occupying an important place in the history of Philippine art is the carving of ivory using elephant&rsquo;s tusks from Africa and India obtained in the Philippines through trade with China and mainland Southeast Asia. Ivory carving according to the Western tradition was introduced in the last quarter of the 16th century by the Spaniards, who first commissioned carvers from Southeastern China for images of the crucified Christ and of the Virgin Mary. By the first third of the 18th century, accounts extolled the artistic skills that Filipinos learned from the Chinese. Finely carved santos imbued with Oriental features (oval face, heavy-lidded almond eyes, stiff postures) became popular gifts and souvenirs, which were shipped to Spain and Mexico. It may be surmised that the trade in Philippine ivory images was far greater than those dealing with similar ivories from Goa (Portuguese India), Sri Lanka, China, and Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whole statues were carved in the round from segments of tusks. In many instances only the heads, hands, and feet were made of ivory and attached to a carved wooden body or pyramidal conical <b>bastidor </b>(frame), which was meant to be covered with vestments of cloth or metal. In some impressive examples, a wooden structure was completely enclosed in several pieces of ivory to produce an even larger santo. Perhaps the oldest dated ivory work dating from 1587 is a crucified Christ in the church of the Magdalena in Sevilla; it is the prototype of many later crucifixes, with arched back and head pointed upward. A possible early piece is the set of ivory head and hands of <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Santisimo Rosario </i></b>(Our Lady of the Holy Rosary) or <b><i>LaNaval</i></b>, commissioned in 1593, and presently venerated in the SantoDomingoChurch in Quezon City. Dated 17th-century pieces are the <b><i>San Sebastian </i></b>(Saint Sebastian), <b><i>Ignacio de Antioquia </i></b>(Ignatius of Antioch), and the image of the crucified Christ and others in the church of Santa Maria in Medina de Rioseco, Villadolid, Spain, which are masterpieces of their genre yet are unusual even for some of the atypical &ldquo;open&rdquo; poses of the saints; and the San Francisco and Santo Domingo in the monastery of San Esteban, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>anca, Spain, which still manifest characteristics of the earlier, archaic style, such as elongation and the graceful curve of the body following that of the tusk from which it was carved. A still extant set of 12 ivory figures for a choir lectern, including a <b><i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Asuncion </i></b>(Our Lady of the Assumption) and various saints, reached Mexico circa 1770 and was a gift to the cathedral there from the archbishop of Manila. Among the most talented of the ivory carvers were JuandelosSantos who carved the flawless crucifix in the SanAgustinChurch, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3418\"><strong>Leoncio Asuncion</strong></a>, who worked in the artistic enclave of Santa Cruz, Manila. Like his colleagues, he also carved in wood. Two of his religious works may be seen at the Ayala Museum in Makati. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3681\"><strong>Graciano Nepomuceno</strong></a> was the last of the &ldquo;old school&rdquo; of ivory carvers whose works express sophistication of technique. Today, occasional ivory statues are done by a few artists, like FredBaldemor and EsmeraldoDans&mdash;both from Paete, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his study of religious art, GaloB.Ocampo classified santos into formal and informal types. Formal types were the santos found in churches, which thus showed a high level of artistry. Large in size and richly ornamented, these were done under the strict supervision of friars with respect to correct iconography or prescribed content and manner of representation in order that no &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; or heretical element was introduced. On the other hand, the informal santos, usually smaller in size, were used for private devotions and were freer in execution, thus showing folk qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\"><strong>Fernando Zobel</strong></a> de Ayala (1963) classified the santos into classical, popular, and ornate. Classical santos either came from Europe or were done locally with a strong academic influence. Often carved in wood, these observed the classical proportions of 7&frac12; to 8 heads to the standing figure. The representation of drapery was in regular, symmetrical folds; the general appearance of the figure was one of formality, balance, and restraint. In a style different from the classical, the ornate santos also showed strong European influence from the school of the Spanish artists Pedro de Mena and Alonso Ca&ntilde;o who emphasized emotionalism and realistic detail. Of wood or ivory, they were more richly embellished and more expressive than the classical. The third group, the popular santos, did not observe classical proportions; thus they often had big heads and squat or elongated bodies. Their features were more native than the classical and baroque types, which were of a Caucasian cast with their deep-set eyes and aquiline noses. It is possible that the early folk santos continued the precolonial sculptural tradition in the carving of anitos marked by animistic vigor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose (1991) proposed that the santo be classified according to the scheme found in church inventories&mdash;that is, <b>de bulto</b> (from which is derived the Filipino term for the statue <b>rebulto)</b>, for fully carved figures including drapery; <b>de gozne</b>, for figures that were dressed but had articulated hands; and <b>de bastidor</b>, for figures that were a mere head and hands on a frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another instance of a local response to the presence of religious sculptures is the urna tradition in Bohol. This is a small carved shrine for religious images, joined by wooden pegs and features a wooden screen door (Jose 1991, 212). The urna&rsquo;s basic parts are the following: the niche where the religious image is placed; the forward tilting crown, the topmost decorative element; the <b>arbotantes</b>, a pair of decorative volutes flanking the niche; and the <b>gradillas</b>, a pyramidal structure of small steps where the main body of the urna is mounted. An<i> </i>urna may be considered the miniature counterpart of the church <b>retablo</b>, the decorated backdrop of the altar where images of the saints are usually placed. The urna is designed for small places of prayer, such as chapels, convents, and home altars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the santo, more mundane types of carving were the result of Hispanic heritage. Carvers in Pakil, Laguna, make the <b>pahiyas-tambag</b> (ornamental toothpick trees and fans) through the process of<i> </i><b>kayas </b>(wood whittling or wood shaving). The Tree of Life centerpieces have detachable branches to embellish colorful rice dishes, tufted birds, and airy butterflies with curling antennae, which are arranged in tapering, graduated tiers above a circular base like a symmetrical spreading bouquet. The fans, in natural ecru like the trees, are carved from <b>palo sapis</b>, a single block of softwood, with thin and even blades spreading out in feathery grace. The fan sports a chain of two complete rings with a pendant bird at the end of the handle, all made from the same single bar of wood. The local names of the variety of softwoods used in kayas are <i>lanite</i>, batikuling, <i>amlang</i>, and <i>quetana</i>. Prior to World War II, townsfolk created a hair ornament called <b>payneta</b>, perhaps the local version of the Spanish <b>peineta</b><i> </i>worn by the elite. A few families, such as that of Emeterio San Gaspar, still practice the tradition, albeit with a redefined purpose as souvenirs for tourists, weddings, and other celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Betis carving tradition comes from an old precolonial practice of <b>matenakandadaras</b> or boat carving in Pampanga. Over time, thestyles, medium, designs, and techniques of Betis carvers(known as <b>mandukit</b>) have evolved because of cultural amalgamation and exchanges with the Chinese andSpaniards. In the Spanish colonial period, productions were done in response to Spanish religious commissions to createreligious icons and interiordesigns for the Santiago Apostol Church aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/270\"><strong>Betis Church</strong></a>. The retablo or thefront altarpiece bears resplendent floral ornamentation with some parts covered with gold leaf. The religious statues follow Western classical form and iconography. The main doorway has its own carving depicting the stairway to heaven&mdash;that is, anallegory drawn from the story of Jacob&rsquo;s dream as found in the book of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong>, where angels ascend to heaven through a flight of stairs. Betis carving practices also have along history of transpacific maritime trading and exchanges with the Europeans during the colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Betis has produced important sculptors through the years, operating local studios and workshops that sustained families and community members during difficult times. Juan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> (1900-92) is considered to have revived the wood-carving practices of Betis. He isknown to be one of the key carvers of the ornaments at <em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Malaca&ntilde;an</span> </em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Palace</span></em> during the Marcos period. He has also served as the mentor of several generations of carvers in Betis. Carlos Roque Sr is known for his detailed wood carving and craftsmanship in furniture making. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3613\"><strong>Wilfredo Layug</strong></a> is known both for his ecclesiastical work andcontemporary sculptures. His works often consist of hyperrealistic designs and figures. After the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, a few sculptors experimented with lahar or mudflow to produce sculptural pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wood carving also plays an important role in furniture making, as seen in furniture made in Betis, Pampanga. Its high moments were in the mid-19th century with the advent of cash-crop agriculture, and in the 1960s when it benefited from the National Cottage Industry and Development Authority program promoted by the Philippine government to uphold the development of cottage industries. Wood-carving tools, so important to the art, are produced in Apalit, Pampanga. The woods used are narra, of the red and yellow varieties, and acacia. Carvers who begin in their teens, execute design patterns on cardboard cutouts. The shops produce <b>gallineras</b><i> </i>(benches), <b>aparadores</b><i> </i>(cabinets), console tables, coffee tables, and headboards. The gallineras of Betis show the furniture at its most refined development: the narra in two tones, polished and varnished to a high sheen; and the square panels featuring carved rosettes flanked by small, neatly turned balusters for the backrest and the enclosure below. More colonial aspects are the tables and the armoires with motifs derived from European period-furniture styles. Recognizably baroque are the motifs of the unfurling scrolls meeting at the center, the concave shells everting delicately around the edges, the medallions and cartouches, and the occasional broken pediments and Solomonic columns. These motifs are found in conjunction with elements of local origin, such as rosettes and other organic curvilinear motifs, as well as the row of small balusters. Betis wood carving is distinguished by the motifs and figures carved in bold relief or intricate openwork as the hardwoods permit. It likewise exhibits a heavy, opulent character from baroque influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, sculpture in stone were often used to ornament facades. These were made into <b>escudos</b><i> </i>or stone reliefs of coats of arms usually ornamenting the main portal of a building. A striking example of stone relief is the <b><i>Rendicion de Tetuan </i></b>(The Surrender of Tetuan) found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/371\"><strong>San Joaquin Church</strong></a> in Iloilo and the relief of San Cristobal, amidst a tropical landscape, found in the facade of the Miag-aoChurch in Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Metal casting</b>, although to a limited degree, was also practiced in colonial times. An effigy of King Carlos IV, cast in the foundry of Manila, was installed in front of the ManilaCathedral where it still stands today. Silver was a material used for casting or chasing small figures like reliefs that decorated the <b>portapaz</b><i> </i>(a small tablet, generally of silver, with a religious image in relief in front and a handle at the back). A rare example of silver sculpture is the image of San Pedro de Alcantara found in the Nagcarlan Church in Laguna. Folk works that use brass casting are the <b>anting-anting</b><i> </i>(talisman). Rooted in the Spanish period&rsquo;s religious traditions, brass anting-anting take various forms, such as medals, triangles, crosses, the crucified Christ, and the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. Often a script in corrupt Latin is found on the faces of the medal-type anting-anting.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong> and Batangas are the two provinces where brass anting-anting are made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The American Tradition and Local Transformation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With American colonization at the turn of the century, new influences in sculpture appeared: <b>classicism</b>, <b>art nouveau</b>, and <b>art deco</b>. IsabeloTampinco pioneered in the local art nouveau idiom by introducing indigenous motifs like the pineapple and the anahaw leaf for his carvings. Art nouveau&rsquo;s curvilinear style and art deco&rsquo;s geometric lines, applied to furniture and to all kinds of functional objects, proved to be a lively creative stimulus to local carvers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the beginning of the 20th century, sculpture projects commissioned by the state would be exemplified by <b><i>Rizal Monument</i></b>, 1913, by Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling. The bronze work is done in the classical style with the national hero  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> at center, flanked by allegorical figures and obelisk. However, the period is dominated by the classical sculptures of GuillermoTolentino exemplified by the <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1935, and its bronze cast versions installed at the University of the Philippines campuses. His <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 1933, is done in the Beaux Arts tradition of classicism and romanticism, wherein Bonifacio stands resolute in the middle of the group of Katipuneros depicted with strong emotions and movement. Other artists who carried on this tradition are AnastacioCaedo, Ambrosio <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es, Froilan Madri&ntilde;an, and JoseMendoza. TingPingLay is among the modern figurative sculptors most active in the 1950s, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3431\"><strong>Fred Baldemor</strong></a> emerged with his classico-romantic portraits in wood and ivory in the 1970s. JulieLluch, AgnesArellano, DanRaralio, and Peter de Guzman are among the later generation figurative-expressionist sculptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The introduction of modern sculpture is associated with the work of NapoleonV.Abueva who dominated modern sculpture for several decades. Abueva used the so-called noble material&mdash;hardwood, metal, and stone&mdash;for sculpture, whether these be in relief or in the round. He lent sculpture the quality of living fluidity and the impression of movement and action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bronze casting, practiced extensively during the pre-World War II period by sculptors who made public sculptures for monuments, is hardly practiced by contemporary artists because of its prohibitive cost. AbdulmariImao was known for his cast works depicting modern interpretations of traditional okir motifs, like the sarimanok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The traditional methods of creating sculpture by carving or casting have been augmented by contemporary techniques or forms&mdash;such as <b>welding</b>, assemblage, and the construction of <b>mobiles</b> using nontraditional material, like glass, plastic, bamboo, and even vegetable matter and earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Welded sculptures involve making objects by bonding together sheets of metal by electric or acetylene torch. EduardoCastrillo dominated the field of sculpture in the 1960s and the 1970s by creating monumental and environmental sculptures, in the abstract and figurative idiom, and some with social and historic meanings, in the medium that became his trademark&mdash;welded metal. Monumental public sculptures are exemplified by Castrillo&rsquo;s <b><i>Katipunan</i></b>, 1974, at the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2270\"><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></a></strong> Shrine, San Juan, and <b><i>People Power Monument</i></b>, 1993, at Libis, Quezon City, which celebrate heroic themes. Kublai <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a> has also done monumental sculptures in Mindanao, such as <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2173\"><strong>The Durian</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 2003, done in concrete, for the Davao International Airport, appropriating the image of the halved native fruit incorporated with motifs evoking the multiplicity of ethnic identities in the region. IldefonsoMarcelo did abstract works in concrete and stone in the 1960s. SolomonSaprid, J.ElizaldeNavarro, and VirginiaTy-Navarro also use welded bronze. ArturoLuz created abstract pieces using painted metal pipes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mobile is a three-dimensional work of sculpture that, instead of being made to stand on the ground or on a horizontal base, is suspended from the ceiling or from a projecting element. It usually consists of one or several balancing rods, principal and secondary, from which hang a number of elements, figurative or nonfigurative, in varying lengths. American sculptor Alexander Calder was the first to create mobiles, inspired by simple organic shapes. He was followed by the constructivists who worked in chrome and plexiglass, with their transparent and reflecting qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A mobile can be considered a simple form of <b>kinetic sculpture</b> or <b>sculpture in motion</b> because it moves with the wind or vibrates with the surrounding air. Furthermore, its suspended form casts moving shadows and light reflections on the environment. As such, an essential character of the mobile is that it creates a continuous interplay of the sculptural form with its surrounding space. This interaction of solid and space is part of the concept of mobile sculpture in which the work is viewed not only in terms of its solid mass but also in terms of what is called its &ldquo;virtual volume,&rdquo; as space becomes a positive value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Castrillo has done mobiles in chrome and plexiglass with modular elements. RamonOrlina has also done mobiles in painted metal. Simpler and more familiar types are wind chimes that have the additional element of sound. Popular mobiles of Philippine folk art are the colorful <b>kiping</b><i> </i>chandeliers called <b>arangya,</b><i> </i>which are made of rice wafers decorating the Pahiyas festival in Lucban and Sariaya, Quezon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contemporary sculptors continue to experiment and develop new materials.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3581\"><strong>Lamberto Hechanova</strong></a></strong> introduced in his works colored metal and plexiglass. Anatascio Caedo, a classicist, experimented with &ldquo;cold casting,&rdquo; a process involving the use of marble dust and polymers. Orlina pioneered in <b>glass sculpture</b>, where glass blocks are shaped by abrasives and adhesives to form prismatic or anthropomorphic shapes. FranciscoVerano used bamboo for sculpture, while ImpyPilapil uses glass with serigraphed patterns, stone, iron rods, galvanized-iron sheets, and screens for her sculptures, some of which are decorative as well as functional, like her furniture pieces. Kinetic sculpture, which adds movement to the art form traditionally presented as static, had its earliest expression in the performance artist DavidMedalla&rsquo;s <b><i>BubbleMachine</i></b><i>. </i><b><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a></strong> art</b> is produced through the modifying and positioning of material like poles, windbreaks, or walls, that may be dug up or rearranged. In the 1970s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3385\"><strong>Raymundo Albano</strong></a> advocated this among artists of Mount Makiling. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\"><strong>Junyee</strong></a> is also among the foremost practitioners of this art. RobertoVillanueva&rsquo;s maze, made of runo and other local reeds, is also an example of this type of sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1990s onward, many artists have used installation as a means to explore postcolonial perspectives in understanding Filipino faith and identity. For example, the traditional sculptures such as the santo are reimagined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3584\"><strong>Riel Hilario</strong></a> to evoke issues of memory of place and sense of displacement, as he works with wooden furniture from his hometown. On the other hand, the bulol is recontextualized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3498\"><strong>Gaston Damag</strong></a>&rsquo;s reflection of claimed identities in diaspora, in one instance using candle wax to effect the transformation of the bulol figure, which eventually melted inside the museum. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3683\"><strong>Leeroy New</strong></a>, Gerry Leonardo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3796\"><strong>Rodel Tapaya</strong></a>, Kawayan de Guia, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3590\"><strong>Toym Imao</strong></a> have also explored installations invoking motifs from pop and folk culture, and history as they have employed materials from everyday life. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\"><strong>Alwin Reamillo</strong></a> recuperates objects, such as an already grounded military helicopter, to invoke the notion of &ldquo;social sculpture&rdquo; participated in by children from internally displaced communities. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3411\"><strong>Agnes Arellano</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3629\"><strong>Julie Lluch</strong></a> continue to work on themes touching on questions of gender and subjectivity in their sculptures. Gender issues were also explored by Francesca Enriquez when she used soft lard in her past work. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3725\"><strong>Alma Quinto</strong></a> uses recycled clothes for her soft sculptures, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3490\"><strong>Marina Cruz</strong></a> created sculpture from casts of baptismal dresses to reflect on handed down memory via objects that embody societal structures. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Sound art</b> or <b>sonic art </b>is an art form that covers a wide range of activities wherein sound is utilized as a medium. It is inherently interdisciplinary and may draw elements from the traditional visual arts, music, performance, media arts, and installation, among others. Many sound-related activities and works are related or influenced by music, but it is also possible for them to have nothing to do with music at all. It is also not necessary for these to take a physical form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the term &ldquo;sound art&rdquo; in the Philippines is also often used interchangeably with <b>experimental music</b>. It is possible to distinguish practitioners who are musicians, but venues, events, and audiences are often shared. Most exhibitions that highlight sound art have performance activities of sound artists and experimental musicians woven together. Performances do not necessarily involve the exhibiting artists creating sound themselves. Their work may feature a lineup that have features parallel to musical events. The boundary between sound art and music is further blurred by frequent collaboration between sound artists and those more commonly described as experimental musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The composer and National Artist for music <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a>, also known for his work in ethnomusicology, is considered a major influence on sound art in the country. <b><i>Cassettes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a></i></b>, 1971, his first attempt in using electronic devices in a composition, involved 100 participants carrying cassette tape recorders that played an assortment of sounds. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a></i></b>, 1974, on the other hand, consisted of prepared music getting played across 20 radio stations. In 1975, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\"><strong>Roberto Chabet</strong></a> assisted Maceda in <b><i>Udlot-Udlot</i></b> by designing the ground layout for performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collaborative group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> Recapping Co., composed of Roberto Chabet, Ray Albano, and Boy Perez, held the exhibition <b><i>Illumination</i></b> in 1970. It was one of the first attempts to incorporate sound within an exhibition context. The group mainly designed sets for the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> (CCP) and in this exhibition referenced that function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\"><strong>David Medalla</strong></a> also created <b>sonar sculptures</b> and <b>sonic installations</b> that utilized different electronic devices, which included tape recorders, microphones, megaphones, loudspeakers, and oscilloscopes. An example of this was the participatory artwork <b><i>Listen to the Sonar Trees</i></b>, 1972. Medalla&rsquo;s performative work, however, has been mostly performed and shown outside the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3411\"><strong>Agnes Arellano</strong></a> has called some of her works &ldquo;sound sculpture&rdquo; and &ldquo;music composed through sculpture.&rdquo; With a musical background as a singer in her younger days, her soundworks have representations consisting of Western musical notation and staff, and are sometimes accompanied by their interpretations recorded on a cassette tape or compact disc. Examples include <b><i>Music for Watching the Moon Rise</i></b>, 1983; <b><i>Music for Making the Sun Rise</i></b>, 1987; and <b><i>Lingga Mantra</i></b>, 1990 (Guillermo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other artists who have experimented with sound since the 1980s are Orville Tiamson, who conjured &ldquo;paintings&rdquo; meant to be seen in the mind of the audience by playing music on his synthesizer; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3787\"><strong>Cesare Syjuco</strong></a>, whose work included radio and telephone soundworks; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a>, whose series <b><i>Toys for Grownups</i></b> also incorporated sound (Gatbonton et al. 1992).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1990s, Baguio-based Shant Verdun, inspired through meditation, released under his Lampas Isip Productions (literally, Beyond Imagination Productions), recordings on tape that blended indigenous instruments, experimental music, and recorded environmental sounds. &ldquo;Lampas Isip&rdquo; also refers to consciousness or soul, thus he used sound elements and musical modes that have meditative and healing effects on the mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A venue for music gigs, Red Rocks, later Club Dredd, was a venue for two groups that became significant in the development of sound art in the Philippines. Intermidya, founded by Lirio Salvador in 1986, was the first group to highlight homemade musical instruments. They used sound-producing assemblage works called <b><i>Sandata</i></b> (Weapon) but have since become more associated today with the band Elemento, founded by Salvador in 1996. The individual<i> sandata</i> since the mid-2000s have become popular as exhibition pieces. In 2012, a show in Vargas Museum featuring the sandata was dedicated to the by then immobilized Lirio Salvador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Children of Cathode Ray had its first performance in Red Rocks in Nov 1988. Its members were also habitu&eacute;s of the place: Regiben Romana, Magyar Tuason, Jing Garcia, Tad Ermita&ntilde;o, and Blums Borres. Three of the members, Romana, Tuason, and Ermita&ntilde;o, also went to the Mowelfund Film Institute, which explains how <b>experimental film</b> was a major influence for the output of the group. Initially only creating sounds, a visual component was later added using Ermita&ntilde;o&rsquo;s projector and digital manipulation and algorithmic intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some sound artists employ monikers, thus Jing Garcia aka autoceremony, Tad Ermita&ntilde;o, and Blums Borres aka Loom would eventually perform as individual sound and media artists taking on the names they adopted to this later practice. Ermita&ntilde;o, now a known media artist, has created sound works that do not require him to perform, such as <b><i>Robot Gamelan</i></b> <b><i>Quartet</i></b>, which was included in the main juried exhibition of the 2008 International Symposium on Electronic Art (ISEA2008) and exhibited in the National Museum of Singapore. <b><i>Quartet</i></b> was a generative installation that any member of the audience could interact with as a &ldquo;conductor&rdquo; of its virtual musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Salvador&rsquo;s Intermedia and Elemento, and Children of the Cathode Ray eventually also performed in art spaces like Mag:net and the CCP. These groups continue to have performances, although which specific members would be playing at a specific event can vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1990s, Poklong Anading, Kaloy Olavides, and Jose Beduya formed the group Gitaw while they were still students at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\"><strong>University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</strong></a>. All three played around with sound art at that time, but Olavides later emerged to be the most active in it. Olavides, soon after their disbandment in the late-1990s, would also join Elemento as a member. In recent years, he formed PastilanDong!, recruiting fellow visual artists Pow Martinez, Costantino Zicarelli, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3838\"><strong>Alvin Zafra</strong></a> as his bandmates. The band also incorporates noise in their sound work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The label Documento was formed by Ernest Concepcion and Mads Adrias in 1999. It was grant-funded by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and its first project was framed as a spoken word undertaking. The first release of the label was <b><i>Uno Documento Compilo</i></b>, a compilation compact disc that included an eclectic mix of artists that had &ldquo;one similar ability, they could produce &lsquo;sounds.&rsquo;&rdquo; This compilation included Gitaw and Elemento.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Surrounded by Water, the alternative art space founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3805\"><strong>Wire Tuazon</strong></a>, operated from 1998 to 2004. It annually celebrated its anniversary on 29 Mar with a &ldquo; <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\"><strong>Sound Art</strong></a></strong> &rdquo; event, unaffected by the art space&rsquo;s location changes. Tuazon had already been working with sound in his individual art practice and organized these annuals to encourage other visual artists to extend their practice by using sound as a medium as he asked for submissions of audio recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\"><strong>Experimental</strong></a> music events also became venues for sound art. Around 1999-2001, Malek Lopez and Noel de Brackinghe, who together also make up Rubber Inc, organized a series of events called <b><i>Recitals</i></b> that were held in a place called Kemistry in Malate. Arvin Nogueras, Caliph8, a popular hip-hop DJ with a tendency toward the abstract side of the genre, held his first <b><i>Subflex</i></b> event in Verve Room, Malate, in Jan 2001. He would hold succeeding ventures in various places before it became a monthly event at B-Side at The Collective in Makati from 2009 to 2013, though it has been on hiatus since. Nogueras also organized <b><i>Expansions</i></b> with Mark Young aka Mark Zero from 2006 to 2010. It was held in different venues but most frequently at Penguin Caf&eacute; in Malate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The setting up of Experimentation in Sound Art Tradition (E.X.I.S.T.) was instigated by Salvador in 2002. It is a loose organization of sound artists and musicians, but the core group is made up by Salvador&rsquo;s Elemento bandmates and others based in  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a></strong> and Marikina, such as Erick Calilan aka Ugong, Roger Lopez aka Inconnu Ictu, Jon Romero aka Aurora Borealis, and Chris Garcimo aka Blend:er of the band Gentle Universe. E.X.I.S.T. aims to inform and educate people about sound art as an interdisciplinary form. They have sought to do this by exploring and manipulating found objects, environmental sound, and analog and digital audio technologies. In 2002, their first sound art exhibition was held with performances by Elemento and Transitory Form in Club Sound Experience, Makati. They also released a split album CD of Elemento and Transitory Form at the same event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">SABAW Media Art Kitchen was founded by Earl &ldquo;Tengal&rdquo; Drilon and Pow Martinez in 2005. In contrast to E.X.I.S.T., SABAW&rsquo;s scope of interest covers the wider picture of media art. It is not as concentrated on sound as medium. Drilon&rsquo;s space, Terminal Garden in Mandaluyong, was often used as an event venue, work lab, hacker space, and temporary homestay for visiting artists until 2015. SABAW produced monthly experimental music events at Mag:net Caf&eacute;, Katipunan, in the last quarter of 2005. This led to the release of an anthology of noise, electronic, and experimental music in CD format, 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Drilon&rsquo;s practice as an interdisciplinary artist parallels this scope as the range of his work has included new media, sound, music, video, cinema, and performance. He is also the progenitor of the Gangan Ensemble, a loose improvisational performance group composed of sound and video artists. Ermita&ntilde;o also plays a key role in the group by creating digital visualizations that function as notation for the performance. The other collaborators include Malek Lopez, Arvin Nogueras, and Blums Borres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to establishing himself as a painter, Pow Martinez undertook sound art projects as Nun Radar. He was also part of Nasal Police, working with Donna Miranda and Ria Mu&ntilde;oz as they combined sound performances with contemporary dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of the sound art scene has thus far progressed through the formation of E.X.I.S.T. and SABAW. Both groups were instrumental in building networks between sound artists and disseminating their work. Meanwhile, in 2007, sculptor Reginald Yuson was commissioned to create artworks in Bonifacio High Street and this enabled the making of sound art in an accessible form for a broader public. Yuson&rsquo;s work <b><i>Presence</i></b>, consists of large freestanding chimes, while another work called <b><i>Hearsay</i></b>, is made up of pipes partially buried in the ground. The structure is set up to allow sound to travel from one point of the ground to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From Oct 2007 to Feb 2009, Children of the Cathode Ray members Borres, Jing Garcia, and Ermita&ntilde;o organized events under their group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1556\"><strong>New Media</strong></a> Arts Manila. It came after Borres&rsquo;s return from Australia, where he did volunteer work in Melbourne for Liquid Architecture, an Australian organization for artists working with sound. The events they organized included three editions of their Electrostatic Sound Conferences, Minus Ten Decibels, and Field Trip. By the time of Field Trip, however, their name was changed to Media Arts Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2008, SABAW held a small two-day festival called Fete dela Wasaque, later Fete dela WSK. The name is both foil and pun on the popular French music festival Fete dela Musique, which at one juncture failed to materialize in Manila temporarily. By WSK organizers&rsquo; own accounting, however, the festival was not taken seriously even by its own proponents until 2010, when its name was changed to Fete dela WSK, and further shortened to WSK in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 2010 edition of Fete dela WSK had activities spread out over 10 days and had an exhibit component that focused on sound art. Dubbed <b><i>From Here to Ear</i></b>, it was held in Outerspace Gallery at The Collective, Makati. It featured works by Ermita&ntilde;o and Kawayan de Guia. The edition the following year also exhibited works in Ronac ART Center, NOVA Gallery, and Light &amp; Space Contemporary. This edition was more diverse in its elements with installation works that were not sound-based, video art, digital art, and Internet art. The sound art that was exhibited included a work by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3728\"><strong>Claro Ramirez</strong></a> and a collaboration between Salvador and Neil Arvin Javier, A.lien.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first institution to hold an exhibit dedicated to sound art was the Lopez Museum in 2011, through an exhibition curated by Claro Ramirez and Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez. <b><i>Reverb</i></b> featured works by Eric Ambata, de Guia, Ermita&ntilde;o, IC Jaucian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\"><strong>Diokno Pasilan</strong></a>, Ronald Tomas, E.X.I.S.T., and ethnomusicologist Dr Christine Muyco. It had an off-site component in SM Mall of Asia, Pasay City, that was also part of Zero In&rsquo;s museum consortium art festival in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Listen to My Music</i></b>, an exhibition dedicated to Jose Maceda, was curated by Dayang Yraola in the Vargas Museum, 2013. It had a section of works by sound artists influenced by Jose Maceda. The artists included Calilan, Drilon, Ermita&ntilde;o, autoceremony, Paolo Garcia aka Pasta Groove, Garcimo, Malek Lopez, Armi Millare, Nogueras, and Romero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later that year, Yraola and Lian Ladia co-curated the Manila leg of Media/Art Kitchen, a series of media art events supported by Japan Foundation. It had an installment at the Ayala Museum that featured sound works by de Guia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3695\"><strong>Renan Ortiz</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3668\"><strong>Manny Montelibano</strong></a>. It also opened with performances: Mel Araneta collaborated with Bani Haykal from Singapore for a performance using handmade improvised or do-it-yourself (DIY) instruments; Calilan and Paolo Garcia&rsquo;s collaboration featured noise and samples in audio and video formats; and Nogueras and Mannet Villariba together created a performance combining sound, performance art, and video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Media/Art Kitchen in Manila also collaborated with Fete dela WSK in 2013 to create WSK.FM, a pirate radio station set up in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\"><strong>Green Papaya Art Projects</strong></a>, Quezon City. This aimed to explore analog and digital radio as both a means of distribution and medium for sound art. WSK.FM would support Radyo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a>, a component of Jong Pairez&rsquo;s CIV:Lab, which saw a more activist use of radio within the context of contemporary art. Along with Pairez, Radyo Itim was co-founded by Randy Nobleza and DJ Seitan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many sound artists are inclined toward experimentation and invention. Garcimo, who creates musical instruments using coconut shells, began to organize Musiko Imbento events at Sev&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;, Malate, 2013. He designed this to function as part mini-workshop for the use of DIY musical instruments and also partly as performance platform for sound artists and experimental musicians. Participants have included Garcimo, Elemento, Jean Paul Zialcita, Harvey Vasquez aka Wiquwi, Inconnu Ictuo, Pasta Groove, Gentle Universe, Calilan, Joe Estimo, JP Hernandez, Joon Guillen, Modulogeek, Ros Veluz, Ermita&ntilde;o, autoceremony, Romero, and Richard John Tuason. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byIris de Ocampo, with notes from Merv Espina</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251682816\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"><em><strong> </strong> </em><v:textbox><em><strong> </strong> </em></v:textbox></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Defeo, Ruben. 2004b. &ldquo;Jose Maceda&rsquo;s Lifelong Quest for Traditional Filipino Music.&rdquo; <em>Philstar.com</em>, 10 May.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Tattooing</b> is a process of marking one&rsquo;s skin permanently with ink or pigment made of plant dyes applied by sharp instruments like needles or thorns. These inking implements pierce the fleshy membrane to create designs and patterns that may signify various meanings and symbols to the wearer or to the society to which he or she belongs. The term tattoo is derived from a Polynesian noun: <i>ta-tau</i> of the Samoan, and <i>ta-tu</i> from the Marquesan, which means to mark the skin with pigment. Western voyagers identified this term during imperial transcontinental journeys made in the mid-18th century. However, the traditional practice of tattooing has much earlier roots in ancient civilizations as evidenced in archeological finds, which include tattooing tools, implements, and preserved mummies with markings on their skin. Tattoos had several functions and meanings orally relayed to generations of people during ancient times and even up to the current period. Some of these were to serve as a form of adornment, to enhance physical appearance, to function as a form of representation of religious beliefs, to protect against evil spirits, to show a mark of bravery of an individual or group, to identify a group or ethnicity, to document significant events in one&rsquo;s life, to categorize one&rsquo;s vocation, and to symbolize one&rsquo;s social status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The practice of tattooing in the Philippines predates the writings of the Spanish chroniclers who encountered and witnessed firsthand the culture and society of the <i>Pintados</i><b> </b>(Painted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>s) of the Visayan Islands during their initial contact in the mid-16th century. The <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b>, 1590, includes the image of the Pintados of the &ldquo;Bissayas&rdquo; (Visayas). The bodies of the two figures are covered by tattoos from their heels to their faces. The male&rsquo;s tattoos are displayed frontally while the female&rsquo;s tattoos are shown from the back. The elaborate tattoo designs feature geometric shapes contouring to the shape of the wearer and showing similarities with indigenous textile motifs. If the images in the <b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b> can be considered a <b>tipos del pais</b> (country scenes), the tattoo of the Pintados may be seen as a kind of clothing during that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process of tattooing among the Pintados required a highly skillful tattoo artist to execute the markings and designs on the skin using black soot as outline before embedding the sharp comblike thorns that served as the needle to puncture the skin. This allowed the soot to be absorbed by the epidermis while the wound is still fresh. The process was done gradually for it sometimes caused the tattooed individual to get infected. Their tattoos signified the skill and bravery of the victorious warriors who engaged in wars and battles. Elaborate designs of lines and geometric patterns were marked on the skin. Tattoos were added only after successful battles, thus increasing the markings from the ankles, to the legs and thighs, until the hips. Chest and back tattoos were rendered when the warriors defeated the enemies in another battle. Tattoos on the face were reserved only for the fiercest and bravest warriors (Scott 1994). Women were tattooed as well. Their arms were adorned by intricate crisscrossing of lines, geometric shapes and motifs that signified their status in the society. This tattooing tradition among the Visayans is hardly practiced anymore, having been replaced during and after the Spanish period by <i>anting-anting</i> or amulet tattoo with Christian icons as popular motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Spanish colonization and the propagation of Christianity sought to obliterate the custom, tattooing also persisted on a limited scale for the purpose of indicating brotherhood among the revolutionary peasant movements from the mid-19th century to the 1930s and 1940s. Such was the case with the Pulahanes of Samar and Leyte, so named after the <i>pula</i> or red headband they wore. Like anting-anting, tattoos are believed to endow the wearer with invincibility, even invisibility, against bullets and bladed weapons, as well as immunity from illnesses caused by witchcraft, harmful spirits, and epidemics.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the revolutionaries, tattoos featured <b>orasyon</b> (prayer) with esoteric symbols on arms and other parts of the body. While orasyon, in its widest sense, refers to any prayer of the Roman Catholic Church, in folk oral tradition it also refers to incomprehensible words in pig Latin believed to possess magic powers that can accomplish positive or negative effects when uttered or written down on paper or cloth, or tattooed on the body. Such prayers are written down in a small book, called <i>librito</i>, and jealously guarded by the shaman, in Waray known as <i>paramatbat. </i>These might be placed in a container and worn as a pendant but, for fear of losing the powerful prayers, some have them tattooed on their bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The orasyon tattoo is received as part of the initiation rites among the different cults in the Visayas and Mindanao, such as the Amahan-Inahan cult, the anti-communist Alsa Masa, or the Philippine Benevolent Missionary Association<i>. </i>In Leyte, the tattoo is the culmination of a series of ritual and sacrificial acts done by the pamaratbat<i>. </i>The initiate is tattooed using a wand, which may consist of 24 needles joined together with wax, the pointed ends slightly projecting and forming a slight arch. The wand, constantly dipped in indelible ink, is held vertically in puncturing the skin, with the first series pricking the skin and the second deepening the wound. Certain taboos&mdash;such as abstaining from pork, chicken, yellow sweet camote, sweets, cigarettes, sex, heavy manual work, and entertainment&mdash;are imposed by the shaman on the initiate to ensure the tattoo&rsquo;s efficacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tattoos are of different kinds. There are <b>panlalaki </b>tattoos worn exclusively by men because they transmit manly powers, and the <b>pangontra</b>, which provide protection against evil spirits. The purpose of the tattoo may be related to the wearer&rsquo;s occupation; thus tattoos for farmers safeguard them against the evil spirits of fields or forests, as well as snakes, scorpions, and bats. The <i>tuba</i> (fermented coconut water) gatherer wears tattoos for invulnerability against bladed weapons, such as the sharp knife used by tuba gatherers for collecting coconut nectar. The icon tattoo may depict the <b>solo mata</b>, an open eye enclosed in an equilateral triangle and the symbol of the Christian Trinity; images of Mary, like the Perpetual Help; images of Christ, like the Nazareno, the Cursillo Christ called &ldquo;The Eye,&rdquo; and the Sacred Heart. Geometric figures&mdash;such as the circle, square, triangle, and pentagon&mdash;as well as variations of the cross may also be used. Some of the many cross designs used are the Latin cross, singly or on top of a three-stepped base; the cross of Santiago, also called Cursillo cross; the haloed cross; and the cross on an arched base. Pig Latin ciphers, words, or phrases usually accompany these motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traces of the traditional tattooing, however, can still be seen among the indigenous groups in the Philippines. Various local words that denote a traditional tattooing practice are found among several indigenous groups in the country. These include <b>batuk</b> (Visaya), <b>patik</b> or <b>fatek</b> (Bontok), <b>batek</b>,<b> batok</b>,<b> whatok</b> (Kalinga), and <b>hakang</b> (Tboli). The tattooing process of the Pintados is almost similar to the practice among the people in the Cordillera region. Sharp thorns from the lubfan tree are used as needles to prick the skin. Three to five pieces of thorns are prepared; and as they puncture the skin, lines and geometric shapes are formed using black soot pressed onto the fresh wound. In Kalinga, particularly in a remote village of Butbut (Salvador-Amores 2013), the traditional practice of tattooing is still being performed by a <b>manwhatok </b>(tattoo practitioner) using <b>gisi </b>(stick with a thorn) as the main tattoo instrument used via a continuous hand tapping on the skin. Apo Whang-Od of Buscalan is a manwhatok or <b>mambabatok</b>, reputedly the last holder of traditional knowledge in batok tattooing previously associated with the outlawed practice of head-hunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the designs and patterns vary in different groups and regions, there are common and shared motifs. <b>Labid </b>refers to the thick lines and wavy lines that can denote a snake. <b>Ablay</b> is a tattoo on the shoulder. <b>Dubdub</b> refers to one on the chest going upward to the neck. <b>Bangut</b> or <b>langi </b>is the term used for a tattoo on the face. <b>Hinawak </b>refers to a tattoo from waist down (Scott 1994). In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, the tattoo motifs are <b>kinabu </b>or dog usually placed on the chest, the <b>tinagu </b>or man, and the <b>ginawang</b> and <b>ginayaman </b>or centipedes. Men and women in the region, particularly in Kalinga, Kankaney, Ibaloy, and Ifugao, have their bodies inked with figurative designs of snakes, centipedes, frogs, rice grains, fern plants, interspersed with geometric motifs of zigzag lines and shapes, which reflect their landscape covered with mountains, rivers, and rice paddies. There is also a diamond-shaped motif that signifies rice, a staple food in the region. In Bontoc, women have their arms tattooed for social acceptance. These are applied on the arms since these are the most visible and exposed body parts when women perform their traditional dance during ritual celebrations, such as courting. It is believed that men would not court them if their arms were not tattooed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contemporary urban areas, tattooing is performed using either traditional or manual methods or with the aid of a machine. For the manual method, around 14-24 small and thin needles are tied on a stick or joined together with wax. These are used to slightly puncture the skin and embed the ink in the wound. Initially, the preferred design is drawn and outlined on the skin using a single needle with ink. Shadows and shading are then achieved when several needles are pricked on the skin to apply colors or to fill in the preferred design. This method of tattooing was previously linked to the subculture of street gangs and prisoners. Tattooing is known as a prisoner art form with its own repertoire of motifs and designs. Tattooing in prison can be a sign of membership in a prison gang, a way of remembering loved ones, a sign of machismo, or simply an exercise to relieve boredom. Prison tattoos may be done on the biceps, forearm, and chest of a person. Some prisoners are tattooed all over the body. The most common or popular images in prisoners&rsquo; tattoos are portraits or names of wife or girlfriend, children, and best friends; dragons; flowers and hearts; snakes; eagles; and religious icons. The repertoire of prison tattoos can take the shape of religious symbols as in the orasyon tattoo. The &ldquo;Don Juan&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love&rdquo; tattoos consist of portraits of a loved woman or a scantily clothed girl. Similar motifs are found in the tattoos worn by the <i>maton</i> (tough guy). In fact, some maton have their start in prison and display tattoos received in jail as signs of machismo. The snake usually tattooed on the body is common, as it denotes sexual and physical prowess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Machine-rendered tattoos are the most commonly used method in contemporary tattooing. Several needles are attached to the tattoo gun depending on the tattoo artist&rsquo;s intended interpretation of a design. Tattoo designs are catalogued according to themes and motifs. Clients sometimes ask tattoo artists to create an original design for them based on their preferred style, content, or meaning. Linear or outline rendering is used to define the shape and form of the tattoo. Detailed rendering of colors, form, and shadow can be achieved when using a round three-needle tip. Magnum needles, on the other hand, are used with five-needle points to apply various colors on the design. This machine-operated tattooing apparatus can create various images with numerous styles and design treatments as preferred by either the clients and/or the artists. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAlice G.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Textile weaving</b> is the process of making cloth by means of interlacing a series of parallel longitudinal threads, called the <b>warp</b>, at right angles with another series of lateral threads, called the <b>weft </b>or <b>woof</b>. Weaving textiles is an ancient art in Southeast Asia. In a funerary site in northeastern Thailand, fragments of colored hemp fiber in a plain weave were found, dating to about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>0 BC. The earliest example of textile found in the Philippines in Banton, Romblon, is a 13th-century piece of ikat-dyed abaca cloth. Textiles may be plain or decorated by dyes, embroidery, and appliqu&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Process</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Traditionally, the entire process of weaving cloth, for daily use or for ritual, has been the work of women. The production of a piece of cloth entails a number of stages. It begins with the cultivation of the plant&mdash;such as cotton, abaca, and pineapple&mdash;the fibers of which will be used for weaving. The fibers are extracted from the leaves of these plants and prepared by carding, twisting, spinning, and winding by means of a spindle into thread. Warp threads are carefully counted and measured before they are attached to the beam of the loom and weft threads are evenly wound onto bobbins. Also part of the preliminaries is the gathering and preparing of naturaldyes. After the threads are soaked in dye and dried in the sun, weaving on a loom can begin. Weaving may follow decorative dyeing techniques, decorative weaving techniques, or supplementary thread techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, there are a number of plants producing fiber for handwoven textiles. Cotton was once a major crop in the Cordilleras and Ilocos regions, and was also cultivated in the Visayas. Ramie is a shrub that yields a tough, white, and lustrous fiber from its stems. It is woven commercially into clothing and table linen primarily in central Philippines. Abaca, a variety of banana grown in central and southern Philippines, produces long and pliant threads, which the Tboli weave into their tie-dyed <b>tnalak</b>.<b><i> </i></b>The sword-shaped leaves of the pineapple plant produce a fine, lustrous fiber from which <b>pi&ntilde;a</b>, a diaphanous, off-white fabric is woven and made into exquisitely embroidered handkerchiefs and altar cloths. <b>Jusi</b>, another fine sheer fabric, is made from pineapple or hemp warp in combination with a silk, cotton, or fine abaca weft. It makes elegant material for the richly embroidered <b>barong tagalog</b>.<b><i> </i></b>At one time, buri, which produces a raffia-type fiber, was woven into clothing, sails, and mosquito nets in central Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most dyes come from vegetable substances. They have to be gathered from the forest and prepared by chopping, pounding, squeezing, soaking, boiling, and evaporating in earthenware vessels. To these are added mordants to fix the dyes and add tone and luster; often these include lime, salt, urine, mud, and leaves, which contain alum and iron compounds. Since no two dye shades are exactly the same and an element of unpredictability is always involved, many folk beliefs and taboos have surrounded the dyeing process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From indigo is derived shades of blue-black, royal blue, gray, lavender, and even pink. Orange-red is derived from annatto or achuete seeds and from sappan, a low, thorny bush with yellow flowers. <i>Dilaw </i>or yellow ginger gives a mustard yellow color, which can be modified into bright yellow with the addition of tamarind or citrus juice; <i>langka</i> (jackfruit) bark also produces yellow. Brown dyes are derived from the talisay tree and the <i>katuray</i>. In recent times, chemical dyes have largely replaced vegetable dyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A loom is used for weaving. In general, the warp threads run vertically in parallel lines from the warp beam to the breast or cloth beam, which is close to the weaver. The weaver uses a heddle rod to raise and lower the odd and even warp threads, creating a space or shed through which is passed the shuttle with the weft threads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still widely used throughout Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, is the <b>backstrap</b> or body-tension loom, the oldest and simplest type of loom. A backstrap consisting of a pad of leather, woven matting, or wood is attached to the breast beam by a string or rope. The weaver sits on a mat with her feet outstretched supporting the warp beam, with the breast beam on her lap and the backstrap passing around the small of her back. She shifts her weight forward and backward while weaving in order to control the tension of the warp yarns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For manageability, the width of the backstrap loom usually falls within the arm span of the weaver, while the length of the cloth is determined by the length of the prepared warp threads. Although the width of the cloth produced in this loom is not very large, blankets and <b>malong</b><i> </i>(tubular skirts) are made by skillfully stitching together two or three separately woven pieces with care in matching designs. In other kinds of body-tension looms, the warp beam is secured to a house post or tree and the weaver supporting the breast beam sits on a stool, or the warp beam may be slotted into an upright wooden frame. No longer dependent on body tension, frame looms have a bigger and more complex structure and may even include the weaver&rsquo;s seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To create designs in handwoven textiles using the backstrap or frame loom, there are three kinds of processes: the decorative dyeing techniques, the decorating weaving techniques, and the combination techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decorative dyeing techniques include the different kinds of <b>ikat</b>.<b> </b>Ikat is a process done before weaving in which a specified number of threads or fibers are bound or knotted together at different intervals with dye-resistant material following a preconceived design before soaking the entire mass of knotted threads in a vat of prepared dye. This may be repeated several times, the knots unravelled and other areas knotted in turn, depending on the complexity and number of hues of the design. Ikat is characterized by a softness or blurriness of the design because of a slight bleeding of the dyes around the resist bindings. There are three kinds of ikat: the warp ikat, the weft ikat, and the combination ikat. In warp ikat, the warp threads are knotted together, thus the design has a vertical orientation. It is primarily applied to cotton fibers, as in the exquisite blankets of the Cordilleras. In weft ikat, the weft threads are knotted together, so the design has a horizontal orientation, as in table runners. Unlike warp ikat that is used for cotton fibers, weft ikat is applied to silk threads, as well as cotton with rayon, producing weaves of fine quality. Double ikat is an even more complex technique that requires the dyeing of both warp and weft threads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tboli tnalak and the Mandaya <b>dagmay<i> </i></b>use the ikat technique on abaca fiber to create numerous bird, snake, and other animal and human motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To make tnalak, fiber is extracted from the mature, fruit-bearing, wild abaca plant while utmost care is taken to preserve its length and silky appearance. Then the fiber is evenly stretched on a bamboo frame and the dye-resist patterning technique is executed by binding numerous small sections of the warp with thread treated with wax following a preconceived design. When the entire mass is immersed in dye, only the exposed threads absorb the color. The resist bindings are removed after dyeing and another combination of threads are bound in turn until the entire design is completed after several bindings and saturations. Traditional tnalak has three colors: deep reddish-brown, black, and white. Black dye is derived from the leaves of the <i>k&rsquo;nalum</i> tree (a type of ebony) and red dye from roots of the <i>loko</i> tree. After the dyeing process, the dyed and dried warp fiber is carefully set and woven following the design on a back-strap or body-tension loom kept taut by the weaver&rsquo;s own weight as she reclines back against the strap slung around the small of her back. The finished cloth is rubbed with a bone of the cuttlefish to give it a silken luster. The basic design of tnalak is the <b>sigul </b>or zigzag forming triangles from the ancient <b>tumpal<i> </i></b>motif of the early Asian Dongson culture. Within this are particular motifs, such as the crab, the mythical bird, the frog, the shield, the python, and the man in his house, along with geometric motifs. These designs are also found in the colorful embroidery on women&rsquo;s blouses and in body tattoos (Casal 1978).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the decorative weaving techniques, the designs do not result from the dyeing process but from the weaving process itself. Thus, these entail different kinds of weaving patterns. The simplest of these is the plain or tabby weave in which individual warp and weft threads are interlaced together. If the warp and weft threads are of equal size and are equally spaced, this results in a &ldquo;balanced weave.&rdquo; If the warp threads are visually dominant over the weft threads, which are largely concealed, it is a &ldquo;warp-faced weave.&rdquo; On the other hand, if the weft threads dominate over the warp threads, it is called a &ldquo;weft-faced weave.&rdquo; Plain weave is decorated with stripes and plaids using bands of different colored threads for the warp and weft. Examples of these are the sarong or wraparound skirt, the <b>tapis<i> </i></b>(wraparound overskirt), and the <b>patadyong<i> </i></b>(tubular dress).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2304\"><strong>Tapestry</strong></a></strong> weaving produces complex, mosaic designs by weaving with discontinuous weft threads in many colors. In this case, the weft threads do not pass through the entire area of the warp, but they are assigned to small areas of a particular design. The result is a symmetrical, usually square tapestry consisting of areas of different designs, usually with a large central design bordered by smaller areas. The Maranao malong features tapestry weave in the <b>langkit</b> bands that join together the large sections of solid color. The <b>pis</b>, the large colorful headpiece of the Tausug, is an excellent example of tapestry weave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the decorative dyeing and weaving techniques, there are the supplementary thread techniques used in Southeast Asian textiles. These make use of special threads, such as brightly colored yarns or metallic threads of gold or silver, to supplement or complement the design of the plain weaves, which is the basic ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the supplementary weft technique, the special threads are inserted into the weft but are made to float over a section of warp threads to form patterns of color and texture contrasting with the ground. When the supplementary threads extend over the entire width of the product, they are said to be &ldquo;continuous,&rdquo; but when they are worked back and forth in small areas, they are &ldquo;discontinuous,&rdquo; which is often favored because the snagging of long floating threads is avoided. Yakan cloth owes its particular beauty to the supplementary weft technique. Itneg blankets also use the supplementary weft technique in their designs of horses alternating with human figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the supplementary warp technique, the appropriate supplementary warp threads appear on the surface as part of the design; otherwise, they make a continuous float on the reverse side. Weavers of northern Luzon sometimes make supplementary warp stripes as in the tapis and the <b>bahag</b> (G-string).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other decorative techniques include the &ldquo;float weave&rdquo; in which the warp or weft skips two or more threads in its path before it is interwoven. Decorative twining in which pairs of adjacent elements are twisted around each other is often used for the borders of textiles to prevent fraying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from these, there are combination techniques involving <b>embroidery</b>,<b> couching</b>,<b> appliqu&eacute;</b>, and <b>beading</b> to embellish the cloth. The Bukidnon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, and Mandaya of southern Philippines decorate their ikat weaves with appliqu&eacute;, colored wool, gold and silver thread, shells, mica chips, and panel beading. The Cordillera groups of the north also embellish their weaves with mother-of-pearl slivers of shell. Decorative knots have also been used to enrich the texture of weaves. Bagobo abaca bags patterned with narrow warp stripes are embellished with small brass bells and colored glass beads. Tboli and Bagobo blouses are richly ornamented with embroidery, sequins, seeds, glass beads, and tiny mother-of-pearl buttons. These costumes have a distinct religious and ritualistic significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Textiles, as clothing, may be untailored or tailored. Due to the warm climate, much of Southeast Asian clothing is untailored. A rectangular piece of cloth may be folded, draped or wrapped around the body to a snug fit, such as the sarong, the malong, the tapis, and the patadyong. There are the loincloths or bahag, the shoulder cloths or <b>alampay</b>,<b> </b>sashes, belts, and headcloths&mdash;such as the pis and the <b>tubao</b> or large handkerchief. The most common form of tailored clothing may be jackets, vests, caftans, and pants. Aside from their practical function, handwoven textiles have also been associated with traditions and religious rituals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Philippine Textiles</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Textile continues to be woven among the cultural communities of the Philippines and the Christianized lowland groups. Among the Cordillera groups, blankets, loincloth (called <b>binulan</b> or <b>wanno<i> </i></b>among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>), blouses, skirts, and bags are woven. The Itneg <b>dinapat<i> </i></b>blanket features stylized human forms, while their <b>binakol<i> </i></b>has repetitive op art patterns. Ikat decoration is also used in more expensive textiles. The Ilocos is known for its sturdy <b>abel<i> </i></b>(blanket) weave. Woven on a frame loom, abel can be multicolored with checkered or striped patterns or can be plain white with embossed patterns in tapestry weave. Also woven are pillowcases, towels, napkins, and place mats often decorated with supplementary weft at the fingers. The Mangyan of Mindoro generally use bark cloth for daily wear but also weave a dark blue denim-like skirt used by women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In western Visayas, Aklan is known for its pi&ntilde;a cloth. Since the process of preparing the thread and weaving pi&ntilde;a is so tedious, weaving of the cloth suffered a decline until rediscovered by haute couture. Pi&ntilde;a is woven into cloth for tailoring, handkerchiefs, napkins, and fine altar linen. Similar to pi&ntilde;a is <b>pinukpok</b><i>&mdash;</i>woven from banana fiber, then pounded to make it more pliant. The cotton patadyong is woven in Miag-ao, Iloilo. Compared to the Maranao malong, the patadyong is shorter and less ornate, its typical decoration being stripes of contrasting color. The patadyong is complemented by a <i>kimona</i>, a blouse of fine pi&ntilde;a, sinamay, or synthetic material. A textile shared by many western Visayas provinces is <b>hablon</b>, meaning weave, which combines silk and cotton to produce a gloss smooth textile for clothing. Other woven items from the western Visayas are blankets, pillowcases, and mosquito nets. In eastern Visayas, Cebu is noted for its blankets, which come from the town of Carcar. Generically called <b>habol</b>, the blankets are woven in frame looms like the abel of the Ilocos. Similar geometric, checkered, and stripped designs found in the abel are also seen in Carcar weaves. A special type of weave, called <b>kinarnero<i> </i></b>(sheeplike), has a high nap and resembles the wool of sheep. Bohol has a long tradition of weaving. During the Spanish period a strong cotton canvas cloth was one of island&rsquo;s exports. Called <b>lampotes</b>, the cloth was used for making sails. Because of the easy accessibility of textile from other places, the weaving of textile in Bohol has declined, although still woven is the <b>saguran</b>,<b> </b>a raffia cloth used for bags, wallpaper, and covers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mindanao has strong weaving traditions especially among the cultural communities. The malong woven by the Maranao who live along the shores of Lake Lanao and the Maguindanao is a large wraparound cloth, about 165 sq cm. Two pieces of cloth are sewn together lengthwise along the edges to form a square, after which it is sewn up on one side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Maranao malong woven from cotton or silk is of different kinds. For everyday wear, stripes or plaids are commonly used. The <b>landap<i> </i></b>is for ceremonial occasions. This may be of one solid color, although often in two alternating colors in broad bands. Red, purple, yellow, and green are preferred colors; dark red is favored by the men, and yellow by the women. The special feature of the landap is the <b>langkit,</b> which is a band separately woven in tapestry weave and sewn onto the malong. The broader band, a 15 cm strip called <b>lakban</b>,<b> </b>is sewn vertically along the front of the malong, while a number of smaller bands, called <b>tobiran</b>, are sewn at right angles to the lakban along the boundaries of the areas of solid color. Intricately designed in several colors, the langkit contain <b>okir </b>motifs of flowers, leaves, and vines, or a stylized tree of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another kind is the <b>andon<i> </i></b>malong, which features ikat motifs in the warp and weft techniques. These geometric motifs&mdash;such as small stars, triangles, squares, diagonal crosses, and circles&mdash;may be found between checks or stripes. Malong decorated with tiny motifs between bands of many colors are called <b>babalodan</b>. A rare kind of malong contains overall floral geometric designs, while the central area or <b>kepala<i> </i></b>features two vertical rows of facing <b>tumpal<i> </i></b>patterns, a row of adjacent narrow triangles that frame a series of simple geometric motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The landap is not found among the Maguindanao. Instead, the Maguindanao malong is covered by recurring designs, sometimes put on by supplementary weft. A simple malong consists of bands of alternating colors, or stylized stars and recurring geometric patterns may be liberally sprinkled on the cloth. The malong for a special occasion may be woven from silk and decorated with gold thread to form stylized Tree of Life designs that originate from either edge of the cloth in a jagged pattern. Also woven is the <b>tubao </b>or headpiece, which is a square cloth about 60 cm long and wide. The tubao is decorated in a manner similar to the malong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The malong is a versatile garment for both men and women, which can be simple for everyday wear and regal for special occasions, such as weddings and funerals. Aside from its regular use as a tubular garment covering the large area from the upper torso to the feet, it serves a number of different purposes&mdash;as a modest screen for shielding the body while doing ritual ablutions in the lake, a cloth for carrying a baby on one person&rsquo;s back while doing chores, a hammock for the injured, a protective covering against the rain, a blanket or bedcloth, a cigarette case or purse, a sack for carrying tubers and foodstuffs, or an instant curtain for privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a garment, the women roll and tie it around their upper chest or knot it around one shoulder from which it falls in graceful folds. The men often tuck it around their loins and knot it at the waist. A traditional Maranao dance, called <i>kapamalongmalong</i>, gracefully illustrates the many different ways of wearing the malong according to its functions (Fraser-Lu 1988).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other Mindanao groups that have vibrant weaving traditions are the Tboli, Mandaya, Bagobo, Yakan, and Tausug. The Yakan weave multicolored scarves and belts with recurring geometric patterns. The Tausug male gird themselves with a colorful waistcloth, called <b>kandit</b>,<b> </b>and wear the pis or a headcloth of recurring geometric patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The coming of the Spaniards brought new traditions of clothing and tailoring textile. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\"><strong>Embroidery</strong></a> became a requisite element of lowland native costumes, such as the barong tagalog and the <b>maria clara<i> </i></b>with its butterfly sleeves, made of fine transparent material like jusi or pi&ntilde;a. It flourished in the 19th century with the patronage of the fashion-conscious <i>ilustrado </i>(educated) class, as can be seen from their portraits detailing their material refinements. Because of the increasing demand, there emerged communities of <b>bordadora</b> (embroiderers) in Malate and in the provinces, such as Batangas, particularly the towns of Taal and San Nicolas. Characteristic of Philippine embroidery is the <b>calado</b>, fine openwork combined with solid areas of design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Embroidery is done not only on costumes and church vestments but also on table linen, bedspreads, veils, and handkerchiefs. However, it is the wedding trousseau with its demanding and elaborate needlework covering large areas of the bridal gown in its entire length and the matching embroidery of the groom&rsquo;s barong that have challenged the bordadora to produce masterpieces of design and artistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rich textile weaving tradition of the Philippines is an important cultural link to Southeast Asia, Taiwan, South Asia, and the Pacific cultures. The weaving processes that have been passed on from generation to the next have been recognized as an intangible heritage that embodies the social, economic, and spiritual beliefs of Philippine communities. Textile weaving is also considered a signifier of the high status of women in indigenous communities as they were also considered as leaders, healers, and keepers of traditional knowledge.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The use of video as a medium in Philippine visual arts began in the 1970s. However, such use was sparse until the mid-2000s, primarily due to the limited access to video equipment. Owing to artistic preference or the lack of apparatus, artists at times simulated the movement of images by montaging a series of photographs hung sequentially. Notably, many artists who now use video as a medium have a film or television background, which makes them more sensitive to how moving images may be used to make meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists who use video rarely do so exclusively. Usually they work with and in other media as well, particularly <b>installation</b>. While there is frequent use of single-channel video, video art is more often exhibited as installation presented in multiple-channel formats, using specific display equipment, lighting conditions, and objects related to the themes of the work. While cathode ray tube television sets were the default option in the 20th century, flat-screen TVs and projections have become a popular display option since the mid-2000s.The format of video art has changed with the development of technology, at the time of the work&rsquo;s creation and the artist&rsquo;s own aesthetic tastes. The technological range includes U-matic, Hi-8, VCR, VCD, DVD, and HD video. Digital formats, which are easy to use, more accessible, and much cheaper, have led to an increased number of video works done by artists. At times though there is no recorded image involved, with artists using direct feed from the video camera to the display screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of the medium of video, the making of video art requires a collaborative effort, which may be simple or otherwise depending on the complexity of production, editing, and installation involved. Artists may not necessarily shoot the video themselves, deploying others to shoot the video for them or using already existing footage as elements of the final work. An example is  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3435\"><strong>Yason Banal</strong></a></strong> &rsquo;s two-channel video work <b><i>Chop-Chopped First Lady and Chop-Chopped First Daughter</i></b>, 2005, which consisted of excerpts of Kris Aquino from a slasher film screened side by side with documentary footage of a real-life attempted assassination of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos. Both sets of images were screened on a loop. The video component of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\"><strong>Bomba</strong></a> </i></b>(Soft Porn Movie/Bomb), 2010, by Kawayan de Guia, used brief clips from over 60 films, selected by de Guia mostly from the <b>bomba </b>film period, and edited together by another artist, JJ Villamarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Video art has been used for many different functions because of its documentary attributes. It is repeatedly used in a performative context, with video being an essential part of the work and distinguished from simple documentation of a performance. This is exemplified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>I Will Breathe, Scale in Time:1:27, Components: Plastic Bag Covering Head, CO<sub>2</sub>,<sub></sub>O<sub>2</sub></i></b>, 1972, where he recorded himself with a plastic bag over his head for a certain amount of time. The performance <b><i>Three Pieces</i></b>, 1976, by Judy Sibayan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3439\"><strong>Huge Bartolome</strong></a>, and Ray Albano, involved the audience seeing themselves on live-feed television sets as cameras surrounded them. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3788\"><strong>Jean Marie Syjuco</strong></a>&rsquo;s work <b><i>See Me, See You</i></b>, 1986, the reactions of gallery visitors to her interactive work were also seen through live feed, but this time, watched on a television set by audiences in another part of the exhibit venue. Kaloy Olavides&rsquo;s <b><i>The Elements</i></b>, 2001, also played up this contrast between live action and recorded image through the screening of a video of an overflowing stream on a monitor set next to the artist&rsquo;s body as he lay covered by soil while breathing through a straw.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like photography, video is a fitting medium for works that focus on social, historical, political commentary or observation. This can be seen particularly in the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3497\"><strong>Kiri Dalena</strong></a>, like <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2321\"><strong>Washed Out</strong></a></strong> </i></b>, 2012, which examined the devastation wrought by typhoon Sendong in Iligan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3668\"><strong>Manny Montelibano</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Red Wake</i></b>, 2006, painted a disillusioned portrait of Philippine politics, with video of then-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo screened from within a coffin. The three-channel video, <b><i>Gilubong ang Akong Pusod sa Dagat</i></b> (My Navel Was Buried in the Sea), 2011, by Martha Atienza, intimated a sense of the relationships of those who live from the sea like traditional fishermen, children deep-sea divers, ship workers, and other seafarers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists also make use of video&rsquo;s time-based aspect in their works, employing it as both mode and as subject. Gerry Tan&rsquo;s <b><i>Apparition</i></b>, 1999, used time to reverse playback the slow melting of a candle shaped like an image of the Virgin Mary. The interchange and cycle of time is made apparent in several layers of video within a video in Poklong Anading&rsquo;s <b><i>Dusk and Dawn</i></b>, 2003, a work shot on the specific site over several days. Tad Ermita&ntilde;o&rsquo;s <b><i>/mutation</i></b>, 2005, involved a computer program editing in situ various available video clips, resulting in a narrative structure algorithmically determined and thus generating variable versions of a story in each sequence. It is an example of how video is also used in media art, which typically involves a more complex use of technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As audiovisual material, video also employs the element of <b>sound</b>. The sound may be inherent to the actions captured or it can be added on as another layer to evoke or intensify a certain atmosphere. Sound can also be used for irony as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3795\"><strong>Maria Taniguchi</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Untitled</i></b> (<b><i>Crystal Palace + Gauguin</i></b>), 2009, which pairs images of dinosaurs with the audible commentary of different voices describing works by Paul Gauguin. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byClarissa Chikiamco</strong> </em><v:shape id=\"_x0000_s1026\" o:allowincell=\"f\" style=\"position:absolute; margin-left:0; margin-top:0; width:8.3pt; height:8.25pt; z-index:251685888\" type=\"#_x0000_t202\"> <v:textbox> </v:textbox></v:shape></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img align=\"left\" src=\"file:///C:UsersJANCENAppDataLocalTempmsohtmlclip1clip_image001.png\" style=\"width:17px; height:17px\" /></p>\r\n"
